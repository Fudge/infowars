[00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:09.517]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:11.118]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:12.640]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.843]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:20.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:33.693]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday!
[00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:36.640]  That's just the start of my work week.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.802]  I work eight days a week.
[00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.450]  Yeah, I know there's seven.
[00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.431]  It's a joke.
[00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.231]  Figure of speech.
[00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.493]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:50.556]  It is Friday, the 17th day of August 2012.
[00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:53.698]  We're way more than halfway into the end of the world year.
[00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:56.039]  Of course, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.
[00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.222]  I think you're going to see big things in 2012 because the globalists have planned that.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.068]  But you watch next year when it's not the end of the world, there will be mainstream dinosaur corporate Decepticon media, sewer stream media saying I said the world would end this year.
[00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:15.785]  Now it may be the end of the world as we know it though.
[00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:16.265]  Wow!
[00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.627]  There is so much to go over today.
[00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:21.229]  He was on Sunday and there was so much to discuss.
[00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.211]  I'm getting back on because a big development since then.
[00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.572]  Always informative and interesting.
[00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:31.435]  Max Kaiser will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:33.477]  And then in studio, Joe Bannister.
[00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:41.964]  And his lawyer, Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent who exposed the fact that the IRS is a collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:44.045]  They then arrested him for his free speech.
[00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:50.488]  He beat him in court, thanks to that evil thing called juries.
[00:01:50.488 --> 00:01:52.348]  So we're going to be going over that as well.
[00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:58.470]  But I'm going to smatter throughout the transmission the unbelievable news.
[00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.012]  Pentagon developing autonomous humanoid robots.
[00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:02.552]  Wait for it.
[00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.410]  They've been doing this for decades.
[00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.351]  And they're killer robots, but they're classified.
[00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:09.431]  I told you about that.
[00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:13.313]  To perform evacuation operations, don't run!
[00:02:13.313 --> 00:02:14.814]  We are your friends.
[00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:21.857]  Kind of like the Bradley fighting vehicle ramming in and machine gunning and starting a fire on the Branch Davidians with bullhorns.
[00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:22.817]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:02:22.817 --> 00:02:24.358]  We're here to help.
[00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:25.658]  We come in peace.
[00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.587]  You know how that ends, don't you?
[00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.847]  Everything's fine, though they love you.
[00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:37.628]  But, oh, the drones were going to be for humanitarian reasons.
[00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:39.568]  They said that last year in the U.S.
[00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:43.429]  We're only rolling them out for humanitarian and public safety and law enforcement and weaponizing.
[00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:48.370]  I mean, 1.4 billion bullets, but Alex Jones is wrong to be criticizing it.
[00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.751]  Yeah, we've had George Soros' group come out and say, I'm evil.
[00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.491]  Don't worry about the bullets.
[00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.912]  They don't discuss the 1.4 billion bullets, though.
[00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:58.385]  They don't discuss that.
[00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:05.708]  They just say, oh, Alex made it up that the National Weather Service was buying a whole bunch of bullets.
[00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:08.609]  Really, the federal purchase order said they were.
[00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.510]  And now they say, well, actually, a subgroup of organization.
[00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.913]  So they play the semantical game and then spin it again and say, Alex Jones just made it up.
[00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:20.073]  The government's buying bullets.
[00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:21.274]  Everybody knows.
[00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.599]  That we, the government, is not building up and arming against you.
[00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.660]  And everybody knows the government's loving and good.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.862]  Everybody knows George Soros is a good man.
[00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:36.005]  And everybody knows Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:37.726]  And everybody knows.
[00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:43.169]  Obama's out saying Romney needs to release his tax returns.
[00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.331]  Not defending, you know, I'm not a big fan of Romney as everyone knows.
[00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.253]  I'm not in love with a guy that's anti-gun, pro-abortion and all that stuff.
[00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:51.534]  But here's the deal.
[00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:59.601]  Obama won't release any of his college records when all his friends said he had the name Barry Sotero.
[00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:03.784]  Because the word is he was getting free tuition as a foreign student on a grant.
[00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:05.425]  And a bunch of other stuff.
[00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:07.587]  So, I want to see all that.
[00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:15.555]  I mean, we're seeing stuff like Romney killed a woman with breast cancer because he fired her husband and he lost his insurance.
[00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:20.437]  Folks, when they get their government-run health care, they say, of course Romney wrote that, so you ought to be happy.
[00:04:20.437 --> 00:04:23.839]  I love him criticizing Romney saying he doesn't like government-run health care.
[00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.781]  He helped write it because he works for the big banks that want it.
[00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:32.424]  But you want to die and not get surgery or get health care, try having a socialist system.
[00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:35.006]  Oh no, it's great in Europe, it's all free!
[00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:35.506]  Oh really?
[00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:38.428]  You've been to Europe, you've talked to Europeans, you know the numbers?
[00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:41.249]  Listen, that's not even the issue.
[00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.250]  I was wrong to tell you blimps were coming over every city.
[00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.491]  It's now been announced today.
[00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.673]  And we've got huge news on QE3.
[00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:50.473]  I'm glad Kaiser's coming up.
[00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:53.075]  And we have got so much more.
[00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:57.677]  It is a jam-packed extravaganza of resistance straight ahead.
[00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:03.457]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:05:03.457 --> 00:05:09.400]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.004]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:21.687]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:25.329]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.312]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:33.917]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.419]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.282]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:44.707]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:47.349]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:54.476]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:59.962]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:03.265]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water?
[00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:05.447]  Bathing as you get sick and die?
[00:06:05.447 --> 00:06:07.869]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:13.573]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:16.976]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:20.418]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:06:20.418 --> 00:06:22.100]  There's no priming required.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.381]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.883]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:29.465]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.886]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:34.048]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:37.430]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.573]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:06:41.573 --> 00:06:44.315]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:45.896]  It's what my family uses.
[00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:49.078]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:55.032]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at InfoWars.com.

[00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:06.928]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:12.173]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:07:12.173 --> 00:07:14.415]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:21.901]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.205]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:30.570]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:36.958]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:07:37.418 --> 00:07:40.461]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:43.564]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:47.308]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:50.331]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:55.436]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.117]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:06.795]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:20.583]  It is a big Friday!
[00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:27.987]  The forces of liberty are fighting back worldwide in a big way, but the faces of global corporate, anti-free market,
[00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:32.471]  Are striking back through their collectivist tyrannies.
[00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:35.153]  All the different flavors of it.
[00:08:35.153 --> 00:08:46.720]  Socialism, communism, fascism, corporatism, sitting up on top of it, perching up there, trying to create a monopoly system of cookie cutter controlled minions.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.240]  Wow!
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.941]  It is Friday.
[00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:51.322]  Kaiser's coming up.
[00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.143]  We're going to get into QE3.
[00:08:53.143 --> 00:08:55.305]  I've got to say, this is our top story.
[00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:58.447]  Fox Business, Financial Times of London, they're all reporting
[00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:03.971]  That for the first time that there are going to pretty much do QE3 by the end of the year.
[00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:11.738]  The globalists like to hang it out there and wait so that they know the time when they're going to do it to be able to position themselves.
[00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:14.580]  But chance of Fed printing more money jumps to 60%.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.282]  That's foxbusiness.com.
[00:09:17.843 --> 00:09:20.225]  And I've got a bunch of other articles saying basically a similar thing.
[00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:33.393]  And when you've got George Soros just jumping into gold with both feet, and not just ending his big brokerage firm last year and not investing people's money, he's dumping his own money out of stocks and bonds and everything right now.
[00:09:33.393 --> 00:09:34.614]  And so are a bunch of other globalists.
[00:09:34.614 --> 00:09:37.195]  We've got a big stack of financial news.
[00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:40.978]  We're going to be covering with Max Keiser, so I'll wait till he's on with us in the next hour.
[00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:42.879]  And then in studio, former Treasury agent,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.064]  We'll be joining us in studio.
[00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:50.189]  He was on for about 15 minutes earlier in the week on the phone.
[00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:51.671]  Joe Bannister with his lawyer.
[00:09:52.674 --> 00:09:58.259]  Because when he went public and said, I found out the IRS works for the private Federal Reserve, they arrested him for his free speech.
[00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:00.621]  But the jury said, we're still America.
[00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:02.123]  He's going to go free.
[00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:08.509]  But other IRS agents and Treasury agents and people that write books are now going to prison if you expose the big secret.
[00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:11.291]  Because they got to jail you or kill you.
[00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:16.296]  When the public finds out that we got the IRS in 1913, didn't really start paying taxes till the 40s and 50s.
[00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:28.023]  You know, mid-40s into the early 50s, they phased it in, and that not one cent, as Ronald Reagan's commission found in 81, but the Grace Commission, not one cent goes around the country.
[00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:39.791]  But it's one thing if I say that, when Treasury agents and IRS senior fraud investigators go public, when they're rising up through the organization, have everything to lose, they arrest them.
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.211]  They've sent quite a few to jail.
[00:10:43.211 --> 00:11:01.207]  I mean, this is, they're talking about trying to jail whoever went to, you know, to the Inspector General of the Treasury with the fact that in Austin, Texas alone, 10 homes, because this all started here in Austin, the big national clearing center for fraud is here, and then a five-state total clearing center.
[00:11:01.207 --> 00:11:05.030]  That's kind of an oxymoron, the IRS clearing center for fraud is here when the whole thing's a fraud.
[00:11:06.704 --> 00:11:10.045]  And again, this news was so big months ago when I learned about it from my whistleblowers.
[00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:13.987]  I never codified it, never properly vetted it, never did the report.
[00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:18.228]  In fact, I even have more infos in the news, and I'm so busy I've not even done it.
[00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:20.529]  People say, you know, do a bunch of original journalism.
[00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:21.409]  We do all the time.
[00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:23.350]  We break stuff all the time, but it's hard.
[00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:24.850]  It's hard.
[00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.571]  That's why we're hiring six more reporters.
[00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:29.432]  Those reporter backgrounds.
[00:11:29.432 --> 00:11:32.713]  And so they can go out and do that and I can oversee it.
[00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:33.913]  We're trying here.
[00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:35.713]  All that cost Federal Reserve notes.
[00:11:35.713 --> 00:11:42.055]  You know it as dollars, money.
[00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:43.296]  Hillary said no.
[00:11:43.296 --> 00:11:44.596]  That's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:45.936]  They're now jumping at what?
[00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:47.137]  What, no to VP?
[00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:50.097]  Oh, yeah.
[00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:52.919]  Well, the word is, yeah, I told you yesterday, you could see it.
[00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:54.461]  Obama meeting with Biden.
[00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:56.482]  Everyone's saying Biden needs to step down.
[00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.944]  It's not too late for Biden to step down.
[00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:03.889]  The word is that old Biden is very close to going down the drain.
[00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.430]  He is circling the drain.
[00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.973]  They want to jazz things up with a new mummy.
[00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:10.274]  Print me that report, please.
[00:12:10.274 --> 00:12:14.598]  If Hillary, indeed, is saying no to VP, that means that Obama is out.
[00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:31.523]  And again, this is not all just about the globalist selling their cult of Obama.
[00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:35.225]  It's about the globalist moving their ball down the field.
[00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:37.586]  So it isn't just about Obama being a star in all this.
[00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:41.489]  It's about bring in their puppet, wear them out, destroy them, bring in the next one.
[00:12:43.277 --> 00:12:48.438]  But we know the military and police are gearing up for what they believe to be civil unrest after the election.
[00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:53.660]  Again, before George Soros' groups twist that, I'm not saying there'll be civil unrest.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.101]  It's all over the news they're preparing for civil unrest.
[00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:58.701]  By the way, look at the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:12:58.701 --> 00:13:00.982]  For sale, asking $2.5 billion.
[00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:05.883]  How to buy the White House, the GOP architects, grand design, the decline of the small donor.
[00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:10.257]  And sure, they advertise what's already known in here.
[00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:14.219]  That big megacorporations and foreign corporations lobby and own the government.
[00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:16.080]  But it's not just 2.5 billion.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.262]  You've got to be who they want.
[00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:23.445]  And you've got to be basically already in line with the main global interest.
[00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:26.226]  And then there's a race.
[00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:32.270]  But it's kind of like Iran, where the Ayatollahs, the Supreme Council, they have to pick who can run for president.
[00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.112]  So they go, okay, you three people can run for president.
[00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:36.513]  Now you can have an election.
[00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:45.542]  That'd be like going on a car lot and they said, uh, you can have a red Ford Focus, a blue Ford Focus, or a white Ford Focus.
[00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:48.003]  And you're like, I don't want a Ford Focus.
[00:13:48.003 --> 00:13:50.624]  Not picking on Ford, I just use that as an analogy.
[00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:56.066]  Or it'd be like going on a Toyota dealership and saying, you can have a red Avalon, a black Avalon, or a white Avalon.
[00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:56.867]  I don't want an Avalon.
[00:13:56.867 --> 00:13:59.007]  I want a Dodge Charger.
[00:13:59.007 --> 00:14:00.128]  I want a black one.
[00:14:00.128 --> 00:14:02.189]  The point is, is that
[00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:13.311]  Okay, yeah, it does cost $2.5 billion, but that's like cherry on top, the plastic cherry on top of this whole fake confection.
[00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:17.676]  So we're going to be talking about that, but let me, I just digressed off into politics.
[00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:19.538]  Let me get into all the other news here because it's big today.
[00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:21.236]  U.S.
[00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:27.219]  troops to get new headgear for homeland security operations to stop small arms that would be used by the American people.
[00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:29.280]  And they admit it's for the U.S.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.081]  Gun confiscation drills, declassified documents.
[00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.182]  Re-education camps.
[00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:34.582]  Army admits those documents are real.
[00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:42.546]  1.4 billion rounds for non-military police in every agency arming themselves.
[00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:44.407]  All of this going on.
[00:14:44.407 --> 00:14:48.208]  In fact, guys, I've got an article about the Soros crowd in the printer in there.
[00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:49.209]  Will you bring me that, please?
[00:14:49.209 --> 00:14:49.509]  Thank you.
[00:14:50.703 --> 00:15:03.051]  So we're going to be getting into that report today and how it connects into Police Department wants Blimp to spy on suspicious activity under a Homeland Security grant.
[00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:09.356]  Darigible would hover at a height of 400 feet over the city.
[00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:15.240]  Now again, they tether these, they have them also, their solar power that float around
[00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:18.667]  This has already been going on for a long time.
[00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:23.992]  How many national news reports have you heard made fun of us for talking about this?
[00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:32.761]  I mean, this was released by DARPA in 2000, that they were already launching low Earth orbit, I mean, edge of space, 120, 150,000 feet.
[00:15:35.486 --> 00:15:37.327]  Not really edge of space, but up there.
[00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:48.636]  Big, giant, unmanned blimps with solar panels on top of them, with ground penetrating radar, face scanning, intel grabbing, you know, NSA stuff.
[00:15:50.145 --> 00:15:59.487]  It's a lot cheaper than satellites, and you can also land them and stuff at night at Air Force bases, or you can crash them in the ocean and just have the gear picked up.
[00:15:59.487 --> 00:16:01.408]  I'm gonna give you some classified info.
[00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:05.009]  They've got where they crash it in the ocean when they're down when the life's over.
[00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:14.311]  They have a ship just waiting because the intelligence package has inflatable balloons on it so that once the blimp crashes,
[00:16:15.672 --> 00:16:20.758]  They then just extract that onto the deck of the ship and then let the dirigible go under.
[00:16:20.758 --> 00:16:23.961]  Oh yeah, talk to folks in the Navy that have been part of those missions.
[00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:26.745]  And last time I saw a public document...
[00:16:27.426 --> 00:16:32.527]  Alexander Haig actually launched the program for this and covertly made billions in the mid-90s.
[00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:35.748]  Actually, about 1990 is when the program launched.
[00:16:35.748 --> 00:16:36.808]  But it got big by 2000.
[00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:38.709]  It got admitted more by 2000.
[00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:43.170]  And there are quite a few giant blimps.
[00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.591]  When a person gets a telescope out on a clear day...
[00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:48.831]  And shows one, the news says it's aliens.
[00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:50.752]  I've shown you ABC News, you name it.
[00:16:50.752 --> 00:16:58.233]  Where they go, aliens are over Salt Lake, or aliens, they saw a big cigar-shaped craft over Dallas.
[00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:03.534]  And they show it on the news, and it's a giant blimp with lights on it, and they'll even have a red light on it.
[00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:06.275]  During the day, they got propellers on them.
[00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.315]  Look, sir!
[00:17:07.315 --> 00:17:09.075]  Look, it's E.T.!
[00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:11.696]  He came to Earth for Reese's Pieces!
[00:17:14.777 --> 00:17:16.290]  And it's a giant blimp.
[00:17:18.831 --> 00:17:20.132]  Doesn't matter though.
[00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:23.974]  The Soros propaganda front slanders Rand Paul and Alex Jones.
[00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:26.235]  There's 1.4 plus billion bullets bought.
[00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:28.676]  Social Security Administration, everybody's getting them.
[00:17:28.676 --> 00:17:33.538]  The National Weather Service wanted hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo.
[00:17:33.538 --> 00:17:35.419]  15,000 of this office, 23,000 of that office.
[00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:36.860]  That's what the document said.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.321]  They came out in the Washington Post and said, well, it's a sub-agency of ours.
[00:17:40.321 --> 00:17:46.925]  But technically, we bought them, but it's for the NOAA dolphin protectors or whatever.
[00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:47.325]  Yeah, sure.
[00:17:48.683 --> 00:17:50.785]  It's for the Greeney police.
[00:17:50.785 --> 00:17:57.810]  And then the Soros outfit spotted that Rand Paul, Senator Paul and myself, and Drudge Report and whoever else covered it.
[00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:05.337]  That we just made it up that Fish and Wildlife or National Weather Service was getting this.
[00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:07.757]  When they're done with it, it's like, look at these people.
[00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:10.679]  They just made up blimps.
[00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:12.379]  They made up drones.
[00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:13.500]  Remember that a few months ago?
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.120]  There's hundreds of articles.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.262]  There's no drones over the U.S.
[00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:24.004]  That nasty Alex Jones and that nasty Matt Drudge just lying to you.
[00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.445]  I said hundreds of papers, over 500 that I know of.
[00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:43.554]  Four or five different articles, different people, the same script, the same government plagiarized dribble, was put in newspapers everywhere telling, shh, shh, shh, farmers, now farmers, there's no drones watching you.
[00:18:43.554 --> 00:18:54.501]  In one of the cases Kurt Nemo wrote about at Infowars.com, they cherry picked it, where Congress people were complaining, and it was manned Cessna spying on the farmers.
[00:18:55.256 --> 00:19:02.921]  Sure, there were other drones in the Air Force, and South Dakota, North Dakota, people can't even... But this... No, it's... They took that.
[00:19:02.921 --> 00:19:06.003]  One thing we linked to was manned aircraft spying.
[00:19:06.003 --> 00:19:07.684]  The whole point is they're spying on us.
[00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:08.765]  And arming their teeth against us.
[00:19:08.765 --> 00:19:11.187]  And they spun it and went, They made it up.
[00:19:11.187 --> 00:19:13.508]  There's no drones, sweetie cake.
[00:19:13.508 --> 00:19:15.189]  That's why you have no readers.
[00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.510]  That's why you're a joke.
[00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.792]  That's why everyone hates you.
[00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:22.814]  People know the games you're playing now.
[00:19:22.814 --> 00:19:23.315]  People know.
[00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.064]  The big news is up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:19:27.064 --> 00:19:35.890]  It's InfoWars.com reports Steve Watson, Pentagon developing autonomous humanoid robots, wait for it, to perform evacuation operations.
[00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:40.394]  Just like the drones that were for evacuations and now they admit they're going to be weaponized in America.
[00:19:40.394 --> 00:19:42.715]  Oh, the combat robots?
[00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:45.437]  Yeah, they're humanoid, bipedal.
[00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:48.439]  It looks just like the Terminator, just like I told you!
[00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:49.360]  But never mind!
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.641]  They're coming to save you!
[00:19:52.915 --> 00:19:55.556]  During emergencies, you know when the guns get taken?
[00:19:55.556 --> 00:20:00.538]  If you fight back, well, you know what the weapons package will go live.
[00:20:00.538 --> 00:20:02.099]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:08.182]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi.

[00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:30.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:35.017]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:40.821]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:23:40.821 --> 00:23:44.463]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:44.463 --> 00:23:49.327]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:52.248]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:52.248 --> 00:23:52.569]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:53.890]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:09.495 --> 00:24:26.759]  Well, I think I see another side Maybe he's stuck by the light that shines And I look over now through the door And I still belong to no one else
[00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:35.810]  We've got all this incredibly serious news to go over.
[00:24:57.179 --> 00:25:04.964]  But remember, truth is stranger than fiction, and there's a lot of interesting things that go on in the world.
[00:25:04.964 --> 00:25:20.493]  In fact, speaking of that, before I get back into serious news from around the world, and here domestically ahead of Max Keiser and others joining us today on this Friday edition, I wanted to briefly talk about, well, a couple different issues.
[00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:23.383]  Well, one of them is serious.
[00:25:23.383 --> 00:25:35.735]  We have Dave Mustaine's exclusive response to the media's demonization campaign of him coming out and saying Obama could have been behind the shootings in Colorado and Wisconsin.
[00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:46.685]  Look, if government's done it before and Obama's run false flags like Fast and Furious and it has all the signs with the witnesses at the Sikh temple and even Larry Pratt of Gunners of America is coming out,
[00:25:48.007 --> 00:25:53.869]  And saying that they have to be looked at as suspects, as prime suspects.
[00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:58.030]  When there's a bank robbery, you go round up the bank robbers who've been let out of prison and you interrogate them.
[00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:02.311]  I mean, it's very, very simple.
[00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:03.151]  They stand again.
[00:26:03.151 --> 00:26:03.891]  It was the timing.
[00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:04.892]  You go through all the evidence.
[00:26:04.892 --> 00:26:06.652]  I'm not going to do that again here today.
[00:26:06.652 --> 00:26:09.353]  We need to defend his courage.
[00:26:09.353 --> 00:26:13.534]  So the article's red-linked at InfoWars.com, defending him.
[00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:20.883]  He defends himself, pointing out, hey, I'm just saying what Larry Pratt and Alex Jones basically said.
[00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:23.745]  And it's red-linked, I'd ask you to get that and get it out to everybody you know.
[00:26:23.745 --> 00:26:28.189]  Exclusive Dave Mustaine clarifies Obama staged shooting statement.
[00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:31.772]  Speaking of shootings, finally people are striking back.
[00:26:31.772 --> 00:26:38.457]  Politico, Family Research Council head blames Southern Poverty Law Center for listing them as terrorists.
[00:26:39.349 --> 00:26:50.582]  I mean, you list somebody as extremist, mix them in with terrorist, and then somebody goes and attacks them, because the Family Research Council, who by the way, is pretty milquetoast.
[00:26:50.582 --> 00:26:56.930]  But they say, don't teach 8-year-olds about sex, period, whether it be heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:26:58.263 --> 00:27:01.984]  And so the guy goes and attacks him over it, saying he's mad at Chick-fil-A.
[00:27:01.984 --> 00:27:03.025]  That's now official.
[00:27:03.025 --> 00:27:04.885]  This is a hate crime.
[00:27:04.885 --> 00:27:08.347]  But again, I don't want to play into their game of going, okay, well then charge him with a hate crime.
[00:27:08.347 --> 00:27:13.449]  Hey, attempted murder, shooting somebody, you know, that's, that's, uh, people stopped him there, though.
[00:27:13.449 --> 00:27:17.370]  It wasn't a bunch of victims.
[00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.170]  So, no, no, no.
[00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.392]  Just charge him with the attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, he'll get 30, 40 years in prison.
[00:27:23.237 --> 00:27:27.599]  We don't want to play your game of, oh, because it was hate motivated, he gets more time.
[00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:33.542]  Hey, somebody shoots you in your house to rob you, you need to get the death penalty.
[00:27:33.542 --> 00:27:35.963]  Somebody kills you because you're white, you need to get the death penalty.
[00:27:35.963 --> 00:27:39.765]  Somebody kills you because you're black, you need to get the death penalty.
[00:27:39.765 --> 00:27:42.787]  That's where I stand on this stuff.
[00:27:42.787 --> 00:27:44.808]  I mean, the guys that drugged that poor black man to death,
[00:27:46.084 --> 00:27:49.167]  Six, seven years ago that's made so much news down in East Texas.
[00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.948]  They all got the death penalty.
[00:27:50.948 --> 00:27:53.250]  Last time I checked, they've executed a couple of them.
[00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.732]  And there was this big thing on the news.
[00:27:56.732 --> 00:27:58.254]  I mean, I remember Jesse Jackson.
[00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:00.015]  Nothing was done.
[00:28:00.015 --> 00:28:00.475]  What?
[00:28:00.475 --> 00:28:01.156]  Nothing was done?
[00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:02.337]  There wasn't a hate law?
[00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:04.318]  You mean a thought crime law?
[00:28:04.318 --> 00:28:08.502]  Where now in Europe they arrest you for not smiling at the Olympics in England?
[00:28:10.794 --> 00:28:14.682]  Where they arrest you if you criticize somebody's religion or sexual.
[00:28:14.682 --> 00:28:16.847]  They arrest people if you criticize Muslims.
[00:28:16.847 --> 00:28:19.773]  They arrest you if you criticize homosexuals.
[00:28:19.773 --> 00:28:21.296]  And by the way, the homosexual lobby...
[00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:26.766]  I don't even go, I'm not even attacking these people, this is not even my big axe to grind.
[00:28:26.766 --> 00:28:33.033]  Except they're authoritarian, at least the ones that speak for them are like, yeah, arrest somebody if you use the word homosexual.
[00:28:33.033 --> 00:28:42.323]  Robin Page, I had him on the show like seven years ago, BBC host of One Man and His Dog, a rural affairs show, wasn't even political, said in a speech when they were trying to take
[00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:48.571]  ...rural property and ban hunting, he said, hey, our rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:52.033]  They arrested him saying the word homosexual is hateful.
[00:28:52.033 --> 00:29:00.140]  Folks, this is political correctness where you can't even use scientific words.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.644]  People are so ignorant now, they think Caucasian is a slang term.
[00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:08.087]  They think Negro is a slang word, an insult.
[00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:12.436]  A slight, an attack.
[00:29:12.436 --> 00:29:17.122]  They think homosexual is, or heterosexual, no, these are names.
[00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:23.119]  If you say Asiatic, it's not attacking Asians.
[00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:28.561]  People don't say Oriental anymore about folks in the Orient.
[00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:33.343]  Political correctness is a war on words, a war on communications.
[00:29:33.343 --> 00:29:36.064]  It's pure authoritarianism.
[00:29:36.064 --> 00:29:38.265]  You people aren't liberals.
[00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:43.767]  You're a bunch of control freak nutcases who can't compete and want to muzzle the rest of us.
[00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:44.627]  Well, you know what?
[00:29:44.627 --> 00:29:45.908]  I'm off your plantation!
[00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.351]  I'm a colonist of the New World Order!
[00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:50.752]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.752 --> 00:29:53.274]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.956]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.245 --> 00:30:10.350]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.432]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:21.736]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:24.558]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:24.738 --> 00:30:29.580]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:35.523]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:35.523 --> 00:30:40.926]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.907]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:48.150]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.631]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:59.794]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:30:59.794 --> 00:31:05.956]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:31:05.956 --> 00:31:08.897]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:31:08.897 --> 00:31:14.299]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:18.981]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:31:19.261 --> 00:31:26.905]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:30.767]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.548]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:31:32.548 --> 00:31:36.570]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.191]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:31:39.471 --> 00:31:42.254]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:31:42.254 --> 00:31:46.818]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:31:46.818 --> 00:31:47.478]  Don't wait!
[00:31:47.478 --> 00:31:49.941]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:52.903]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:52.903 --> 00:31:54.445]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:05.114]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:32:05.114 --> 00:32:07.516]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:16.623]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:16.623 --> 00:32:20.066]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.747]  There's no priming required.
[00:32:21.747 --> 00:32:22.568]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:27.291]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:29.111]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:30.532]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:32:30.532 --> 00:32:33.693]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:32:33.693 --> 00:32:37.075]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:32:37.075 --> 00:32:41.217]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:32:41.217 --> 00:32:43.958]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:45.539]  It's what my family uses.
[00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:48.720]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:54.664]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at InfoWars.com.

[00:32:55.905 --> 00:32:56.685]  888-253-3139.
[00:32:56.685 --> 00:33:14.577]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:29.114]  And if George Soros isn't a foreigner who's become an American, so he's a domestic enemy, I don't know what is.
[00:33:29.114 --> 00:33:32.475]  Pushing his anti-gun, anti-family garbage.
[00:33:32.475 --> 00:33:36.338]  Attacking me through his fake surrogates, White House run.
[00:33:36.338 --> 00:33:39.019]  Tax exemption, just absolutely disgusting.
[00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:41.941]  We're gonna be breaking some of that down, coming up.
[00:33:43.635 --> 00:33:47.759]  Against Soros, propaganda front, slanderous Senator Rand Paul and Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:51.262]  Ecuador President Rafael, we are not a colony.
[00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:55.547]  He stands up to the jackbooted British Gestapo, Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:33:55.547 --> 00:33:56.808]  Absolutely.
[00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:04.816]  I mean, the British government that sucked off the great British people and the great Irish and Scottish people around them isn't even British.
[00:34:04.816 --> 00:34:05.877]  It's Transylvanian.
[00:34:06.872 --> 00:34:08.033]  They call it German royalty.
[00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:09.013]  They're not even German.
[00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:15.357]  But my point is, they have sucked off those people and built a global empire that the Brits paid for.
[00:34:15.357 --> 00:34:18.639]  And remember the whole Falcons war?
[00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.121]  Remember the battleship getting sunk and all that?
[00:34:22.121 --> 00:34:27.324]  Where the submarine blew up the former US battleship that was Brazilian, wasn't it?
[00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:29.727]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:34:29.727 --> 00:34:38.411]  You've got Britain, that is the globalists that run it, picking on people and trying to take their islands, their waterways.
[00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:39.892]  Yeah, they're not a colony.
[00:34:39.892 --> 00:34:42.093]  And by the way, we're not a colony of the globalists.
[00:34:42.093 --> 00:34:44.914]  It's the British model that we're under today.
[00:34:44.914 --> 00:34:53.719]  That's what the New World Order is, in Carol Quigley's own words at Georgetown, in Cecil Rhodes' own words, in the Council on Foreign Relations' own words.
[00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:58.223]  So we're going to be getting into that with Max Keiser as well.
[00:34:58.223 --> 00:35:02.946]  The whole world's lining up for war here.
[00:35:02.946 --> 00:35:05.488]  And you know, our forebearers said that 236 years ago.
[00:35:05.488 --> 00:35:07.529]  They said, look, we're not a colony.
[00:35:07.529 --> 00:35:08.089]  Okay?
[00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:09.831]  We're not your slaves.
[00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:19.117]  We're not going to sit here and pay you all these taxes because they were Englishmen, but they weren't being given the rights that had already been gained in England.
[00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:22.199]  They said, okay, we'll just, we'll just stand up to you.
[00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:24.781]  Because at a certain point you get past the fear and you just,
[00:35:25.612 --> 00:35:31.975]  You're so disgusted at being a slave and being pushed around and having lesser men dominate you that you just say, you know what?
[00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:33.436]  You're looking for a fight.
[00:35:33.436 --> 00:35:36.557]  You better believe you got one.
[00:35:36.557 --> 00:35:37.777]  That's how it works.
[00:35:37.777 --> 00:35:42.620]  And no amount of drones and weapons and 1.4 billion rounds of ammo.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:49.363]  You're buying all that because you're scared because you see us buying millions of guns a month.
[00:35:49.363 --> 00:35:53.425]  But again, I don't even want to fight with the Americans that serve the globalists.
[00:35:53.425 --> 00:35:54.165]  I want to wake them up.
[00:35:55.219 --> 00:36:03.222]  I don't have some macho imperative that I need to go out and, you know, see a civil war, you know, because, ooh, it's sexy and fun.
[00:36:03.222 --> 00:36:04.843]  There's nothing sexy and fun about it.
[00:36:04.843 --> 00:36:08.805]  But I will not be a slave.
[00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:10.145]  Period.
[00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:16.188]  The only reason we have so much prosperity in this country, the media loves to tell you how bad America is and all our horrible past.
[00:36:16.188 --> 00:36:18.209]  Compared to other countries, we've been great.
[00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:22.751]  Because the basic ideas of liberty that were later adopted that everyone demanded.
[00:36:23.683 --> 00:36:26.191]  What's in the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence?
[00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:30.706]  That idea is 180 degrees against what the globalists want.
[00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:34.709]  That's why they're so angry.
[00:36:34.709 --> 00:36:38.331]  We've always had monopolies with the monopoly elites in every culture running things.
[00:36:38.331 --> 00:36:56.523]  This system was the first time, starting with the Renaissance and the General Enlightenment 500 years ago, roughly, 550 years ago or so, right through to 1776, the greatest flowering of it, through to the prosperity it created, and then the decadence.
[00:36:57.958 --> 00:37:18.728]  And there's the modern sophistication of the world which allows corruption to hide better until it takes over and then declares war on the segments, the remnants of goodness that are left because the remnants of good could sprout at any time and grow and overthrow the evil.
[00:37:18.728 --> 00:37:23.870]  Evil seeks to eradicate good because it's threatened by it.
[00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.171]  It's at war with each other.
[00:37:29.704 --> 00:37:32.525]  What an amazing show yesterday.
[00:37:32.525 --> 00:37:37.267]  Richard Belzer on the show, big movie star, TV host, author, comedian.
[00:37:37.267 --> 00:37:41.670]  And then he's like, hey, I'm at Chris Walken's house.
[00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.871]  And the crew's like, did he just say Christopher Walken?
[00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:54.195]  So we go to break, and the really good stuff was during that four-minute break, the long break at 20 after, that we take the other breaks for three minutes long, top of the hour is one minute, or end of the hour is one minute.
[00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.813]  I walk in the control room, he goes, yeah, here he is.
[00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:04.815]  And then there's Christopher Walken, we talk for a few minutes.
[00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:14.922]  And then he gets on air and plays, you know, plays it safe and wants to talk about cooking chickens and French wine.
[00:38:14.922 --> 00:38:18.385]  That was probably one of the weirdest moments in my radio show.
[00:38:18.385 --> 00:38:20.407]  And folks, we've had a lot of them.
[00:38:20.407 --> 00:38:24.470]  Of course, it was also streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv or no one would have believed it.
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.092]  But I walked in there, 30 seconds in, he goes, yeah, you want to talk to him?
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:34.445]  And there's Christopher Walken, what an interesting person, looking at us on Skype.
[00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:41.391]  It's ridiculous.
[00:38:41.391 --> 00:38:42.612]  There's the added funniness.
[00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:49.138]  At first he was sitting in Belger's lap because there was only one chair and they got another chair in there.
[00:38:49.138 --> 00:38:52.681]  And the crew flipped their phones on and started taping all this.
[00:38:52.681 --> 00:38:53.522]  We have it on tape.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:59.523]  And I'm saying stop that, but then there's that effect around celebrity, people just can't help it.
[00:38:59.523 --> 00:39:04.707]  Even if you're over celebrity, when it's a really interesting celebrity, it's not just that they're a celebrity, it's that they're so interesting.
[00:39:04.707 --> 00:39:10.450]  I'm going to ask them next week, we're going to get Belzer back on, I'm going to say, hey, by the way, we have the behind the scenes talk, you want to put that out.
[00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:16.975]  I told anybody who puts that out before we get authorization, you just delivered yourself a pink slip.
[00:39:16.975 --> 00:39:18.916]  You erased yours?
[00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:22.198]  Well, that wasn't good, Johnna, they let us use it, even though I know I told you not to shoot it.
[00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:26.796]  No, doesn't matter.
[00:39:26.796 --> 00:39:31.018]  It's funny, people now are so quick on the draw that it's like gunslingers, like BAM!
[00:39:31.018 --> 00:39:36.220]  Their droids and iPhones are all recording so quickly.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.661]  But it'd be one thing if we had Christopher Walken coming on the show.
[00:39:39.661 --> 00:39:45.844]  It's like you're interviewing a really interesting writer and researcher, movie star in their own right, about politics.
[00:39:45.844 --> 00:39:49.446]  That's why Richard Belzer was on the show, and then BOOM!
[00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:54.753]  Christopher Walken, and if I could tell you, that's the strangest moment on radio.
[00:39:54.753 --> 00:40:01.676]  I've been taken to some elite parties in Hollywood, and I have seen stuff you people wouldn't believe.
[00:40:01.676 --> 00:40:07.639]  To quote Blade Runner, Roy Batty, and I'm not name-dropping here.
[00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:14.883]  The only reason I bring this up, though, is it's signpost that, oh, here's a book about, you know, government staging assassinations and blaming patsies.
[00:40:16.226 --> 00:40:19.847]  Dead wrong, we sell at Infowarshop.com by Richard Belzer.
[00:40:19.847 --> 00:40:26.268]  We get him on, and then find out he's been a listener for many years and is a great guy.
[00:40:26.268 --> 00:40:28.728]  And then, boom!
[00:40:28.728 --> 00:40:32.529]  By the way, they did invite me up there to New York or Connecticut to hang out with those guys.
[00:40:32.529 --> 00:40:34.829]  That's something I might go through TSA groping for.
[00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:40.130]  I should go cook over at Christopher Walken's house.
[00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.011]  I'll tell you whose house I have cooked at and other people wouldn't believe it.
[00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:46.143]  My life is so weird, man.
[00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:48.425]  It is beyond bizarre.
[00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:50.547]  Alright, I'm gonna stop right now.
[00:40:50.547 --> 00:40:52.689]  We got all this crazy news and stuff.
[00:40:52.689 --> 00:40:59.335]  The point is, and then at the same time, we're defending Dave Mustaine from comments made, and he's giving us that exclusive.
[00:40:59.335 --> 00:41:03.058]  I'm just telling you, this show has already begun to orbit into the zeitgeist.
[00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:05.000]  We're not even there yet.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.822]  But it is blast off now.
[00:41:06.822 --> 00:41:07.963]  It is blast off.
[00:41:10.586 --> 00:41:11.587]  Oh boy.
[00:41:11.587 --> 00:41:19.053]  Speaking of that, before we get to this really hardcore serious news, we're just having a little fun here right now.
[00:41:19.053 --> 00:41:27.180]  To show you how focused on politics we are, we didn't even get into the Christopher Walken thing on the Nightly News last night.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.443]  And then we put it up on YouTube, the radio slash TV show yesterday.
[00:41:30.443 --> 00:41:32.225]  We just mentioned that it was Richard Belzer.
[00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:41.075]  Came on the show talking about government murders and cover-ups, and didn't even point out that Christopher Walken was in it.
[00:41:41.075 --> 00:41:47.778]  So the YouTube audience is all freaking out going, hey, 10 minutes into this, it's Christopher Walken.
[00:41:47.778 --> 00:41:54.621]  But now we did cut it out and we have the Christopher Walken up there on the site.
[00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:56.222]  Really, really crazy.
[00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:57.863]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:07.652]  And go to a short clip of the Christopher Walken via video on the Alex Jones syndicated transmission.
[00:42:07.652 --> 00:42:08.493]  Here it is.
[00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:12.437]  Suddenly, Christopher Walken is on our Skype video feed.
[00:42:12.437 --> 00:42:13.458]  Let's bring him up right now.
[00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:16.560]  Oh my!
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.102]  I had to drag him out of bed.
[00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.463]  That's how much he likes me.
[00:42:19.463 --> 00:42:21.125]  Richard and I are cooking.
[00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:22.005]  Yes.
[00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:23.427]  And we're writing a book.
[00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:23.847]  Right.
[00:42:23.847 --> 00:42:25.789]  And we're doing a movie called... The Nose.
[00:42:25.789 --> 00:42:26.710]  The Nose and the River.
[00:42:27.932 --> 00:42:40.136]  We're teasing, but we're filming this cooking thing for Funny or Die, so Chris took a picture of my nose and I took a picture of his nose, and we're gonna release that as a short film and hopefully get an Oscar.
[00:42:40.136 --> 00:42:43.437]  You took a snapshot of my nose, but I took a movie of yours.
[00:42:43.437 --> 00:42:46.238]  Yeah, a four second movie of my nose.
[00:42:46.238 --> 00:42:46.958]  It's gonna be great.
[00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:48.559]  People want to know what celebrities do, Alex.
[00:42:49.741 --> 00:42:50.702]  We're not that mysterious.
[00:42:50.702 --> 00:42:52.623]  But we also made a chicken.
[00:42:52.623 --> 00:42:56.405]  Yeah, we made chicken, we made sweet potatoes.
[00:42:56.405 --> 00:42:58.467]  He made chicken with sweet potatoes and onions.
[00:42:58.467 --> 00:42:59.007]  Cooked pears.
[00:42:59.007 --> 00:43:00.188]  Cooked pears.
[00:43:00.188 --> 00:43:03.270]  And the orange seafood melon.
[00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.230]  He's a great cook.
[00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.031]  And I just made the salad.
[00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:07.853]  The orange melon.
[00:43:07.853 --> 00:43:08.533]  The orange melon.
[00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:09.834]  What's the name of that dish you made?
[00:43:09.974 --> 00:43:10.394]  I don't know.
[00:43:33.536 --> 00:43:41.488]  Almost 24 hours into this, nothing on InfoWars.com or PrisonPanda.com about Christopher Walken popping in on the show.
[00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:44.052]  Thanks to Richard Belzer.
[00:43:44.052 --> 00:43:45.454]  So pretty amazing.
[00:43:45.454 --> 00:43:45.875]  By the way...
[00:43:46.758 --> 00:43:49.901]  I've now read two chapters of it, and I'm going to read the whole thing.
[00:43:49.901 --> 00:43:54.905]  Very powerful book, Dead Wrong, How Government Stages Murders and Blames It on Patsies.
[00:43:54.905 --> 00:44:03.032]  Just amazing cover-ups covered here in the book, whether it's RFK, JFK, Marilyn Monroe, or of course Martin Luther King and others.
[00:44:03.032 --> 00:44:07.796]  Dead Wrong, Richard Belzer and David Wayne, available at Infowarshop.com.
[00:44:07.796 --> 00:44:09.998]  Your purchase supports him and our work as well.
[00:44:09.998 --> 00:44:11.639]  Our bookstore is everywhere.
[00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:12.640]  It really is a powerful book.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.421]  I'm going to read it tomorrow.
[00:44:15.442 --> 00:44:16.103]  We're good to go.
[00:44:38.416 --> 00:44:41.137]  So, in fact, give me a document cam shot of this since folks are watching.
[00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:43.258]  I want them to actually see what I'm talking about here.
[00:44:43.258 --> 00:44:58.985]  This is exactly, if I had time to write books, this is what my show is kind of like, the documentaries, and then we show you the documents and all the photos and articles and graphs and everything else that's in here.
[00:44:58.985 --> 00:45:05.368]  And then, of course, you got Richard Belzer, David Wayne, Jesse Ventura, a great, great book at InfoWarshop.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:12.223]  And I don't wanna, oh, I'm not gonna show this till Monday.
[00:45:12.223 --> 00:45:16.986]  New magazine, it's being printed right now.
[00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:17.987]  Newspaper.
[00:45:17.987 --> 00:45:21.049]  This is the size of it.
[00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:22.129]  This is the size of it.
[00:45:22.129 --> 00:45:23.690]  Look at that banker graphic right there.
[00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.252]  Oh, in-house illustrators.
[00:45:26.252 --> 00:45:32.276]  I mean, to say this is pimp is to use the common vernacular nomenclature.
[00:45:32.276 --> 00:45:34.117]  Not your standard imperial, but still.
[00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:38.370]  Oh yeah, it's powerful.
[00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.490]  It's powerful.
[00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.430]  And it's going to be out Monday.
[00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.911]  We're going to have it out Monday.
[00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:46.631]  You can buy them at cost in bulk.
[00:45:46.631 --> 00:45:48.631]  Oh, we don't just sell one thing of something.
[00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:51.292]  We sell them in bulk at cost.
[00:45:51.292 --> 00:45:54.613]  But it's not up yet, and so that is coming.
[00:45:54.613 --> 00:46:01.034]  It's 48 pages long, and I'm not going to show you the cover until Monday.
[00:46:03.442 --> 00:46:04.923]  I'm out of control, I apologize.
[00:46:04.923 --> 00:46:06.405]  You can tell I'm in a good mood.
[00:46:06.405 --> 00:46:09.527]  I had a great evening last night as well.
[00:46:09.527 --> 00:46:12.530]  The Lord is blessing those that love freedom.
[00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.411]  That's all I can say.
[00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:17.354]  I was over at the pool, the pond.
[00:46:17.354 --> 00:46:18.795]  The pond would be good.
[00:46:18.795 --> 00:46:21.177]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:46:21.177 --> 00:46:23.019]  Max Keiser is coming up.
[00:46:25.219 --> 00:46:30.383]  Let me shift gears to the really hardcore news now.
[00:46:30.383 --> 00:46:31.123]  U.S.
[00:46:31.123 --> 00:46:42.151]  troops to get new headgear for homeland security operations, arming to develop new helmets to protect against small arms ammunition in the homeland.
[00:46:43.035 --> 00:46:49.519]  And these are basically new ballistic riot gear helmets and they admit for, well, the new combat with us.
[00:46:49.519 --> 00:46:52.961]  And of course Homeland Security's got the 1.4 billion bullets on top of all this.
[00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:58.604]  The Army admits gun confiscation drills and re-education camp training.
[00:46:58.604 --> 00:47:00.925]  And we'll be going over that more with Max Keiser.
[00:47:00.925 --> 00:47:04.207]  Police Department wants to blimp to spot American suspicious activity.
[00:47:04.207 --> 00:47:08.710]  All over the country they're getting tethered blimps that sit at 400 to 1,000 feet right under the FAA limit.
[00:47:14.327 --> 00:47:20.432]  And with the cameras on them, and loudspeakers and face scanners barking orders at you.
[00:47:20.432 --> 00:47:23.073]  And how do they have your face scan, even though it's not in the database yet?
[00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:26.276]  Well, the driver's license was a face scan, and Facebook.
[00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:29.218]  And of course, they've got the high altitude ones.
[00:47:29.218 --> 00:47:36.123]  You know, it's funny, I said this in my film in 2005, because they had surveillance blimps over New York, and I show it.
[00:47:36.123 --> 00:47:40.266]  And I've been on countless talk shows where they raise this thing, you're the crazy guy who thinks there's blimps watching us.
[00:47:41.927 --> 00:47:42.308]  I don't know.
[00:47:42.308 --> 00:47:45.692]  I got video of them saying NYPD on them.
[00:47:45.692 --> 00:47:46.853]  You see the video, right?
[00:47:46.853 --> 00:47:49.797]  And they're like, well, here's a document.
[00:47:49.797 --> 00:47:51.719]  Oh, no, there's no blimps or drones.
[00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:53.181]  And by the way, they're not weaponized.
[00:47:53.181 --> 00:47:54.122]  They're not watching us.
[00:47:54.122 --> 00:47:55.864]  Okay, well, here's the FAA's admission.
[00:47:55.864 --> 00:47:56.986]  I don't want to see that, crazy man.
[00:47:58.351 --> 00:48:00.993]  And you know the ADL, 7th Impoverished Law Center?
[00:48:00.993 --> 00:48:05.337]  We've got the ThinkProgress run by the White House and Soros on record.
[00:48:05.337 --> 00:48:08.580]  Tax-free, supposedly non-partisan, because they tell you they are.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.461]  Non-partisan, really!
[00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:16.947]  We actually have meetings weekly with the White House, have the former transition director runs it, and Soros funds it, what, $3 million a year.
[00:48:16.947 --> 00:48:21.391]  And then they tell their readers that they're non-partisan, and they're a watchdog, because they said so.
[00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:24.373]  It'd be like if I announced I was the Queen of England, because I said so.
[00:48:26.465 --> 00:48:27.626]  Side issue.
[00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:30.288]  They're God, I forgot that.
[00:48:30.288 --> 00:48:32.229]  They say it, so it is.
[00:48:32.229 --> 00:48:39.075]  But here I am on CBS TV, and they're playing a clip of my film, Martial Law, where I'm warning of the move towards tyranny in America.
[00:48:39.075 --> 00:48:42.737]  And the colonel I'm debating keeps saying, well, Bush will be out of office in a few years.
[00:48:42.737 --> 00:48:44.399]  I'm like, no, it's about Bush.
[00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:46.460]  It's about the system taking over.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.382]  Here's a clip of me.
[00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:52.385]  Well, first is from Martial Law, seven years ago.
[00:48:52.385 --> 00:48:53.826]  And then this is from five years ago.
[00:48:55.177 --> 00:48:56.978]  On CBS when they're playing the clip, here it is.
[00:49:15.968 --> 00:49:23.676]  On the phone we have with us the man you just saw in the video, that is Alex Jones, a man who has set forth to expose these supposed indiscretions by the government.
[00:49:23.676 --> 00:49:26.458]  We also have with us terrorism law expert Jeff Atticott with us.
[00:49:26.458 --> 00:49:28.300]  Thank you both for joining me this morning.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.381]  Thanks for having me.
[00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:29.902]  I appreciate it.
[00:49:29.902 --> 00:49:31.964]  Let's first talk with you, Alex, by phone.
[00:49:31.964 --> 00:49:36.929]  Alex, you feel America is going to be under some martial law pressure as soon as we get attacked again, is that correct?
[00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:40.933]  Back in 99, I met with your police chief and we threw Delta Force out.
[00:49:40.933 --> 00:49:43.675]  They brought in large bags of cash and tried to buy them off.
[00:49:43.675 --> 00:49:52.064]  Then I talked to emergency managers around the country when I was fighting this then and found out there was a covert plan to take over all of our major cities.
[00:49:52.064 --> 00:49:53.926]  Now that's been in the Associated Press.
[00:49:54.226 --> 00:49:55.287]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:50:18.621 --> 00:50:22.144]  Then that university head who was a colonel, JAG officer, we've interviewed him before.
[00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.945]  He actually turned out was a listener and agrees with us.
[00:50:23.945 --> 00:50:26.707]  I guess he was playing the part of the guy that disagreed with me that day.
[00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:28.588]  Of course, that was a few years later.
[00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:30.490]  I guess he did see it all come true.
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:36.374]  Now the president tells the Congress that NATO gives him orders.
[00:50:36.374 --> 00:50:38.656]  That's called a dictator.
[00:50:38.656 --> 00:50:41.898]  The office is becoming a dictatorship.
[00:50:41.898 --> 00:50:43.079]  Not the president himself.
[00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:44.060]  Let's be clear on that.
[00:50:45.273 --> 00:50:47.195]  And it looks like Hillary doesn't want to run as VP.
[00:50:47.195 --> 00:50:53.062]  That means the rat is leaving the sinking Obama ship and scurrying over to Mittens.
[00:50:53.062 --> 00:50:53.883]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:54.324]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.897 --> 00:51:07.743]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:51:07.743 --> 00:51:13.188]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:51:13.188 --> 00:51:15.370]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:22.678]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:51:23.158 --> 00:51:26.859]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:51:26.859 --> 00:51:31.120]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:37.761]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.721]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:51:40.721 --> 00:51:43.742]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:51:43.742 --> 00:51:47.383]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:51:47.383 --> 00:51:49.803]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:51:50.324 --> 00:51:55.315]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.491]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:06.592]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:16.483]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:53:16.483 --> 00:53:21.410]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[00:53:22.029 --> 00:53:33.399]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:45.388]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:49.070]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.932]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[00:53:51.932 --> 00:53:56.255]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[00:53:56.255 --> 00:53:57.516]  Protect your immune system.
[00:53:57.516 --> 00:53:58.557]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:54:34.046 --> 00:54:35.027]  You know what?
[00:54:35.027 --> 00:54:40.029]  For me, living it up is standing up against evil and building things.
[00:54:40.029 --> 00:54:45.292]  You see how the globalists make you think living it up is gambling, partying mindlessly?
[00:54:45.292 --> 00:54:50.455]  You know, running around, having 20 sexual partners?
[00:54:50.455 --> 00:54:52.236]  No, that's not what's valuable.
[00:54:53.662 --> 00:54:55.323]  Ideas.
[00:54:55.323 --> 00:54:57.125]  Information.
[00:54:57.125 --> 00:54:58.826]  Art.
[00:54:58.826 --> 00:55:00.467]  Literature.
[00:55:00.467 --> 00:55:02.168]  Civilization.
[00:55:02.168 --> 00:55:06.051]  But most importantly, truth.
[00:55:06.051 --> 00:55:08.853]  Truth is the key.
[00:55:08.853 --> 00:55:13.637]  I want the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[00:55:13.637 --> 00:55:15.739]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:19.021]  Max Keiser is coming up, and this is an order to the crew.
[00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:21.002]  30 minutes into the interview,
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:34.387]  I want you guys to keelhaul me, as Yosemite Sam would say, if I am not starting to go to calls at 33 after, okay?
[00:55:34.387 --> 00:55:39.550]  I think we should add an element to the show where they have, like, electroshock things when I don't do what I'm supposed to, and they just... I'm joking.
[00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.531]  It's a joke.
[00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:45.593]  Because they already have that with the TSA.
[00:55:45.593 --> 00:55:47.615]  I haven't had allergies that bad in about a year.
[00:55:47.615 --> 00:55:49.756]  I think it's because I'm taking Yongevity.
[00:55:51.138 --> 00:55:59.303]  But they are, it's killing everybody right now, because it's so wet, and there was this giant spring after a drought here, and then it rained like the monsoon, now it's dry again.
[00:55:59.303 --> 00:56:07.948]  And it's like wild kingdom flowers everywhere, and well, Austin's already the capital of allergies.
[00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:10.770]  You know, I forgot I have a cough button over here.
[00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:11.490]  Gotta use that.
[00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:14.052]  I know why I forgot, somebody moved it.
[00:56:14.052 --> 00:56:17.814]  Okay, getting back to all of this information.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.484]  What are we going to be discussing with Max Keiser?
[00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:25.745]  Let's just get him on now, by the way.
[00:56:25.745 --> 00:56:26.486]  I want to go right to him.
[00:56:26.486 --> 00:56:28.487]  We start the next hour, please.
[00:56:28.487 --> 00:56:32.010]  Chance of Fed printing more money jumps to 60%.
[00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.552]  That's Fox Business.
[00:56:34.552 --> 00:56:34.833]  U.S.
[00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:38.315]  government foreign debt hits record $5.29 trillion.
[00:56:38.315 --> 00:56:44.741]  But the banker's debt is $1.5 quadrillion that they say I owe them because they engage in fraud and I never signed on to it.
[00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:47.924]  But the Army's standing by to take it out of me, and I guess even though there's not enough money to do it.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.420]  No matter.
[00:57:04.665 --> 00:57:13.151]  That is the former managing directors and deputy directors and vice presidents and presidents of the big banks who now are the head of the agencies in every case.
[00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:24.658]  They will now do a fake investigation of their bosses and their own blind trust, which aren't blind with the investment money they stole.
[00:57:24.658 --> 00:57:28.040]  Satan will now investigate Beelzebub.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.562]  Or the devil will now investigate Baphomet.
[00:57:31.855 --> 00:57:36.718]  Or Leviathan will now investigate the old serpent.
[00:57:36.718 --> 00:57:37.218]  I guess.
[00:57:37.218 --> 00:57:39.700]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:45.283]  Report Soros unloads all investments in major financial stocks.
[00:57:45.283 --> 00:57:48.805]  Invest over 130 mil in gold.
[00:57:48.805 --> 00:57:50.746]  They go to QE3.
[00:57:50.746 --> 00:57:56.049]  Well, all the common sense is gold's going to go up like a rocket ship.
[00:57:56.049 --> 00:57:58.871]  Or like when I was a kid, I'd say a rocket chip.
[00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:00.572]  And I called elephants Elfinance.
[00:58:01.809 --> 00:58:03.411]  Jobless rates rise.
[00:58:03.411 --> 00:58:04.292]  I still say drowning.
[00:58:04.292 --> 00:58:06.495]  I know everybody likes that so I still say it.
[00:58:06.495 --> 00:58:07.757]  I know it's drowned.
[00:58:07.757 --> 00:58:12.743]  Jobless rates rise in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in July.
[00:58:13.891 --> 00:58:17.954]  No one will be charged with crime over MF Global Collabs.
[00:58:17.954 --> 00:58:21.296]  Well, I mean, they just tapped in people's bank accounts and took it.
[00:58:21.296 --> 00:58:23.738]  I mean, that's not stealing when you take it.
[00:58:23.738 --> 00:58:26.180]  They said so.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.022]  Finland prepares for breakup of the Eurozone.
[00:58:29.022 --> 00:58:31.023]  It's all coming up.
[00:58:31.023 --> 00:58:36.647]  Along with combat robots to take your guns in America.
[00:58:36.647 --> 00:58:37.828]  And you're going to pay for it.
[00:58:43.038 --> 00:58:50.245]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.245 --> 00:58:53.268]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:58:53.268 --> 00:58:58.273]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:58:58.273 --> 00:59:05.440]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:11.225]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:59:11.225 --> 00:59:15.248]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:59:15.248 --> 00:59:19.972]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:59:19.972 --> 00:59:25.196]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:28.659]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:31.241]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:59:31.241 --> 00:59:35.945]  AeroSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:59:35.945 --> 00:59:38.828]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:59:38.828 --> 00:59:46.034]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[00:59:46.034 --> 00:59:47.315]  We're getting prepared.
[00:59:47.315 --> 00:59:47.975]  Are you?
[00:59:47.975 --> 00:59:49.056]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:59:53.214 --> 00:59:55.596]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.596 --> 01:00:05.044]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.044 --> 01:00:06.365]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:08.146]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:09.907]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.489]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.489 --> 01:00:13.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:17.233]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.233 --> 01:00:21.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.884 --> 01:00:38.236]  Well, fresh off of Dave Mustaine on the show yesterday with his official international response to saying the mass shootings could have been staged by the criminals that staged Fast and Furious.
[01:00:38.236 --> 01:00:42.541]  You know them as the Obama administration.
[01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:48.379]  And then we had Richard Belzer along with Christopher Walken yesterday.
[01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:54.963]  On the heels of that, you can only go up one level, to quote Spinal Tap, from 10 to 11.
[01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:57.404]  And I said, well why not just make it louder and make it 10?
[01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.185]  And it's 11.
[01:00:59.185 --> 01:01:01.207]  And our 11 is Max Keiser.
[01:01:01.207 --> 01:01:02.768]  Alright, Max is a funny guy.
[01:01:02.768 --> 01:01:04.249]  I like him.
[01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:06.350]  You know, he'd be a nice, fun guy to hang around and drink beer with.
[01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:14.218]  But I shouldn't open the interview up joking around with him or that'll set the tone and then it'll disintegrate very rapidly with the two of us.
[01:01:14.218 --> 01:01:16.501]  And I am in a kind of a joking mood today.
[01:01:16.501 --> 01:01:18.744]  Don't ask me why.
[01:01:18.744 --> 01:01:19.725]  Well, actually, I know why.
[01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:21.587]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[01:01:21.587 --> 01:01:26.392]  I actually got to go wakeboarding yesterday evening with some friends that took me out.
[01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:27.814]  I want to thank them for that.
[01:01:29.657 --> 01:01:30.558]  And I feel energized.
[01:01:30.558 --> 01:01:32.619]  I feel like I was on a week-long vacation.
[01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:35.461]  Now I have many vacations, three-hour periods every once in a while.
[01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:41.084]  So we're going to be talking about the big news with Max Keiser.
[01:01:41.084 --> 01:01:54.793]  When we come back from break, we're going to get into the talk of QE3, the rapidly deteriorating situation since we had him on a week ago, less than a week ago, doing nothing to MF Global, what precedent this sets.
[01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:57.495]  We're going to talk about it all with Max Keiser today.
[01:01:59.025 --> 01:02:02.529]  And we're also going to look at a bunch of the different military developments and more.
[01:02:02.529 --> 01:02:05.692]  And the new combat robots to occupy our cities.
[01:02:05.692 --> 01:02:10.717]  Pentagon developing autonomous humanoid robots to perform evacuation operations like Katrina.
[01:02:10.717 --> 01:02:12.799]  That means gun confiscations.
[01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:14.360]  So talk about Skynet.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.181]  It's here.
[01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:17.283]  And police departments are getting Homeland Security blimps.
[01:02:18.304 --> 01:02:27.008]  It's all very nice, so it's all part of, well, it's all part of our tax money and the playing army on the disheveled, overtaxed American people.
[01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:29.169]  But it's the same thing worldwide happening.
[01:02:29.169 --> 01:02:31.970]  Max Keiser, tell us, tell us what's front and center on your plate.
[01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:34.931]  We're going to come back and launch the official interview here.
[01:02:34.931 --> 01:02:44.676]  Max Keiser, syndicated radio host, TV host, maxkeiser.com, a one-stop shop for all things financial crystal ball gazing.
[01:02:44.676 --> 01:02:45.416]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:02:46.092 --> 01:02:48.053]  Hey Alex, great to be with you.
[01:02:48.053 --> 01:02:58.559]  And just continuing on the theme that we established a few months ago, just trying to pick the exact date of when you have this global fiat money collapse.
[01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:03.622]  I've said April of next year is the outside chance of that happening anytime between now and then.
[01:03:03.622 --> 01:03:05.923]  And just try to figure out where the
[01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:08.164]  Seismic shocks are in the system.
[01:03:08.164 --> 01:03:10.626]  What will trigger the event?
[01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:12.927]  So I'm looking at a couple of different things.
[01:03:12.927 --> 01:03:18.411]  And as I mentioned on the last show, I've done some more work looking into Japan.
[01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:26.697]  You know, Japan is a very interesting country because they funded 20 years of stagnant economic development with their savings accounts.
[01:03:26.697 --> 01:03:32.641]  So people in Japan are almost forced to buy Japanese government bonds.
[01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:35.763]  But now demographically, these people are retiring, so they have to sell.
[01:03:36.543 --> 01:03:38.504]  To fund their retirement.
[01:03:38.504 --> 01:03:41.565]  So that means a guarantee upward move in interest rates.
[01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:47.587]  That could be the trigger that starts a global cascading effect in the entire.
[01:03:47.587 --> 01:03:54.109]  What got me started on this is because it just emerged this past week, Alex, that the second biggest buyer of U.S.
[01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:57.211]  Treasury debt now is no longer China.
[01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:58.651]  Number one, of course, is America.
[01:03:58.651 --> 01:04:00.952]  America is the biggest buyer of its own debt.
[01:04:01.252 --> 01:04:04.474]  But taking the second spot now is Japan.
[01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.795]  China is walking away from the table.
[01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:11.657]  Japan has always been under the Treasury of America's thumb.
[01:04:11.657 --> 01:04:13.678]  They'll do whatever America says.
[01:04:13.678 --> 01:04:16.479]  And now they are the number two biggest buyer of U.S.
[01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:17.160]  Treasury bonds.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.662]  But that is extremely dangerous because their economy itself is a tinderbox.
[01:04:21.662 --> 01:04:28.885]  Probably the weakest, most fragile economy in the world after the Fukushima disaster, after 20 years of the zombie economy and the zombie banks.
[01:04:28.885 --> 01:04:29.726]  But now they are
[01:04:30.146 --> 01:04:31.127]  Supporting America.
[01:04:31.127 --> 01:04:34.409]  Japan, the zombie economy, is supporting the American economy.
[01:04:34.409 --> 01:04:37.251]  It gives you an idea of how fragile the system is.
[01:04:37.251 --> 01:04:39.292]  China is walking away.
[01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.994]  What is China buying with the money that they have?
[01:04:41.994 --> 01:04:44.796]  Well, it's turned out that they are buying gold.
[01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:55.203]  My sources tell me that China, before the end of this year, will come out with an official statement announcing that they've upped their gold by over a thousand tons.
[01:04:55.203 --> 01:04:56.084]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:04:56.084 --> 01:04:58.906]  We're going to come right back with all things economic.
[01:05:02.603 --> 01:05:10.708]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:14.791]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:01.571]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:07.152]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.152 --> 01:06:12.193]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.193 --> 01:06:12.653]  It's true.
[01:06:12.653 --> 01:06:15.474]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:17.214]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:17.754 --> 01:06:22.978]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:25.299]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:30.102]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.102 --> 01:06:31.223]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.223 --> 01:06:34.285]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:06:34.285 --> 01:06:37.908]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:37.908 --> 01:06:41.090]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:43.311]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:06:43.311 --> 01:06:44.232]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:06:47.874 --> 01:06:49.315]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:49.315 --> 01:06:56.937]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:56.937 --> 01:07:00.879]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:00.879 --> 01:07:15.324]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.348 --> 01:07:21.050]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:33.815]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.815 --> 01:07:41.078]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:52.149]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:52.149 --> 01:07:56.073]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:59.197]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:08:05.253 --> 01:08:10.096]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.096 --> 01:08:11.677]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.677 --> 01:08:13.218]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:17.421]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:26.527]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.527 --> 01:08:33.351]  Well, if true, it signals one of the biggest, stinking, ugliest, mange-covered,
[01:08:34.946 --> 01:08:35.552]  Rats!
[01:08:36.736 --> 01:08:45.520]  Fat on the blood of dead children and criminal wars and tyranny worldwide and fat off the blood of all they killed with Arkansas.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:09:01.487]  Hillary Clinton, one of the king rats, the Washington Examiner, DrudgeReport.com are reporting, or Drudge is linked to it, technically he's not reporting, that she is set to not be his VP because they want to get rid of Biden.
[01:09:01.487 --> 01:09:04.929]  I mean, that's admitted after Biden came out.
[01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.872]  And so they want to put, basically, chains on black people.
[01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:13.094]  Hillary rejected VP slot to ready her own 2016 run.
[01:09:13.094 --> 01:09:19.878]  And go ahead and go to the Examiner, you know, let's show people that they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:19.878 --> 01:09:33.766]  And it goes on, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pressed by her husband and a top Obama aide to consider replacing Vice President Joe Biden just a couple of weeks ago, claims the author of the New York Times bestseller, The Amateur.
[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:38.293]  And going over, it looks like a pretty good source, but who knows?
[01:09:38.293 --> 01:09:46.601]  Continuing here, following Biden's footsteps, MSNBC host says Romney engaging in inwardization.
[01:09:46.601 --> 01:09:47.342]  He actually said it.
[01:09:49.724 --> 01:09:54.368]  I'm not going to go the route of their talk show host saying it, saying it's not that big of a deal.
[01:09:54.368 --> 01:09:55.288]  They use it as a weapon.
[01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:56.469]  Let's use the word.
[01:09:56.469 --> 01:09:58.931]  It doesn't matter with the political correctness.
[01:09:58.931 --> 01:10:08.278]  They can say that stuff to get everybody fighting with each other and to inject racial division, divide and conquer, and then it's cute and sweet.
[01:10:08.278 --> 01:10:14.343]  Yeah, you can show the Cruz like, can we even show the headline?
[01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.283]  He's allowed to say it.
[01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:23.737]  To try to create race war, but then we, the evil whitey, exactly, we're bad.
[01:10:23.737 --> 01:10:25.538]  And again, it isn't a black-white thing.
[01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:26.659]  These people know this.
[01:10:26.659 --> 01:10:28.860]  They're engaging in class warfare.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.042]  They're just literally pimping out racial conflict.
[01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:34.624]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:34.624 --> 01:10:37.846]  Those black leaders make sure those black babies get aborted, 51% of them.
[01:10:39.957 --> 01:10:42.538]  So we're going to be going over all of that, but that's enough.
[01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.979]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, we're going to open the phones up.
[01:10:44.979 --> 01:10:58.245]  They're open now for your questions for former top stockbroker, retired author, researcher, done BBC shows, syndicated radio, RT, press TV, does that every week.
[01:10:58.245 --> 01:10:59.785]  Max Keiser was on with us Friday.
[01:10:59.785 --> 01:11:01.366]  No, no, last Sunday.
[01:11:01.366 --> 01:11:02.806]  Now he's on with us this Friday.
[01:11:02.806 --> 01:11:02.907]  It is
[01:11:04.187 --> 01:11:09.030]  The 17th day of August 2012 on this Friday edition.
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:12.813]  This is teleprompter free radio slash TV.
[01:11:12.813 --> 01:11:14.334]  Talking point free as well.
[01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:15.274]  We just cover it.
[01:11:15.274 --> 01:11:16.916]  Well, like I see it, my guests see it.
[01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:18.657]  That's why sometimes we have differing views with guests.
[01:11:18.657 --> 01:11:22.199]  We're not monolithic liberal show, monolithic conservative show.
[01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:22.900]  I'm into freedom.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.120]  I'm into an open debate.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.142]  I'm into getting people to think for themselves.
[01:11:26.142 --> 01:11:28.363]  I think you deserve more than talking points.
[01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:29.584]  I think you're smart.
[01:11:29.584 --> 01:11:32.826]  I think when I tell you all this scary stuff, you'll make preparation for it.
[01:11:32.826 --> 01:11:33.967]  I don't tell you this stuff to scare you.
[01:11:34.848 --> 01:11:35.988]  I think you're like me.
[01:11:35.988 --> 01:11:37.410]  I think you want to know the truth.
[01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:39.711]  The truth's always there anyways.
[01:11:39.711 --> 01:11:45.896]  If you didn't know the elevator didn't actually come when the doors opened, and you step out and go, well, I don't see an elevator.
[01:11:45.896 --> 01:11:50.239]  I see a 100-floor shaft, but I just feel like I'll step on in there.
[01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.920]  I'm going to be positive.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.121]  I don't want to be scared.
[01:11:53.121 --> 01:11:55.383]  And then you'd fall 100 floors and die.
[01:11:55.383 --> 01:11:58.726]  And you'll bounce at the bottom and splat everywhere like Sloppy Joe's on the highway.
[01:12:00.196 --> 01:12:01.820]  That's what we're talking about here.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.343]  Okay, the elevator doors have opened.
[01:12:03.343 --> 01:12:04.366]  There is no elevator.
[01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:05.869]  Do not walk into it.
[01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:08.655]  But people are like lemmings falling off the edge of the cliff.
[01:12:10.103 --> 01:12:11.984]  After all, Gloria Steinem says it's cool.
[01:12:11.984 --> 01:12:15.766]  I mean, she is CIA after all, which means banker, banker-occupier.
[01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:18.428]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com joins us.
[01:12:18.428 --> 01:12:21.129]  He's also the inventor of the virtual trading system.
[01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.950]  He's with the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:26.392]  He was on with us Sunday, and now things have really deteriorated.
[01:12:26.392 --> 01:12:30.075]  Fox News, AP, Reuters, they're all talking about global collapse.
[01:12:30.075 --> 01:12:31.976]  Banks prepared for collapse.
[01:12:31.976 --> 01:12:34.977]  Banks told prepare for collapse.
[01:12:34.977 --> 01:12:35.398]  We've been
[01:12:36.338 --> 01:12:39.900]  Now told, and China has announced, the government's pulling out of the U.S.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.401]  stock market, saying it's fraudulent.
[01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:44.582]  That's what Max has been saying.
[01:12:44.582 --> 01:12:51.164]  George Soros and others rushing in to buy gold, getting completely out of the market, even privately.
[01:12:51.164 --> 01:12:53.525]  They stopped managing people's money years ago.
[01:12:53.525 --> 01:12:56.407]  What does all of this signify?
[01:12:56.407 --> 01:12:59.088]  For those of us watching, the writing's on the wall.
[01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:02.552]  Massive war, total collapse.
[01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:04.654]  Can it be averted?
[01:13:04.654 --> 01:13:12.223]  Max, when you say collapse on the outside by next April at the latest, are you saying that it will happen?
[01:13:12.223 --> 01:13:13.605]  Is there any way to avert it?
[01:13:13.605 --> 01:13:15.147]  What does the collapse look like?
[01:13:15.147 --> 01:13:16.368]  Max Keiser, you have the floor.
[01:13:17.372 --> 01:13:27.021]  Yeah, I'm saying that it's a 90% chance of collapse by next April, but it could happen at any time between now and April.
[01:13:27.021 --> 01:13:32.966]  The global economy, you have to look at it in terms of the way a systems analyst would look at any complicated system.
[01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:39.470]  Every time you add more to the system, the complexity doesn't rise in a linear fashion.
[01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:41.672]  It rises exponentially.
[01:13:41.672 --> 01:13:58.083]  So every time the Fed puts on more quantitative easing, every time investment banks bail out some other investment bank, every time more derivatives are released into the system, you don't go from, let's say, 700 trillion in notional value derivatives to 800 trillion in a linear way.
[01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:03.086]  You have to think of it in terms of this global quadrillion to two quadrillion derivative
[01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:09.809]  Suffle, being encumbered with exponentially more risk.
[01:14:09.809 --> 01:14:17.152]  This is classic systems analysis, because we no longer have an economy of supply and demand, of output, of factories, of wages.
[01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:21.033]  We've left that world 40 years ago when we went off the gold standard in 1971.
[01:14:21.033 --> 01:14:25.895]  By the way, this is the 41st anniversary of the closing of the gold window on August 15th, 1971, by Richard Nixon.
[01:14:27.816 --> 01:14:31.939]  But all this time since then, we've been building in the complexity, building in the debt.
[01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:35.422]  And so now, between now and April of next year is my call.
[01:14:35.422 --> 01:14:39.566]  You're going to have complete systemic collapse, much worse than in 2008.
[01:14:39.566 --> 01:14:45.331]  2008 was just a precursor to what will be a complete and utter breakdown.
[01:14:45.951 --> 01:15:01.216]  And so the game here is to try to pick where it starts, what the trigger, and to kind of study it in terms of how the economies rattle and roll as a result of this complete and utter systemic breakdown.
[01:15:01.216 --> 01:15:05.977]  As I mentioned, Japan, to me, seems like the weakest link in the chain.
[01:15:05.977 --> 01:15:12.379]  Once that goes, it's one of the top three economies in the world, the second biggest creditor behind the US itself, the US debt.
[01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:18.682]  And they just have a lot of awful demographic and economic trends going against them.
[01:15:18.682 --> 01:15:27.607]  So looking more locally, Alex, to follow up on a story you've been talking about for a few weeks, the fraud that is Facebook, Groupon, and Zynga.
[01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:28.648]  I want to add something to that.
[01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:30.889]  And you said on this show, let me just interrupt to get the number out, 800-259-9231.
[01:15:30.889 --> 01:15:30.969]  800-259-9231.
[01:15:30.969 --> 01:15:32.350]  Call's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:35.251]  Max, I hate to toot your horn, I just want to point out,
[01:15:40.794 --> 01:15:44.958]  Mainstream media gets it wrong most of the time beforehand because they're lying.
[01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:45.878]  They have an agenda.
[01:15:45.878 --> 01:15:49.922]  You keep getting it right, and our guests do, because you know what's happening.
[01:15:49.922 --> 01:15:57.388]  But expanding on this, you said six months ago, well before this, you said Facebook was going to be a giant pump and dump.
[01:15:57.388 --> 01:15:59.590]  Everybody who knew what was going on knew that.
[01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.391]  And now they get away with this.
[01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:02.812]  But Martha Stewart goes to jail.
[01:16:02.812 --> 01:16:03.113]  Go ahead.
[01:16:04.045 --> 01:16:13.710]  Right, it's a pop-and-dump scandal and which is what you'd see on Wall Street 20 years ago on the penny stock firms.
[01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:27.758]  You know, they're very famous companies back then who were big in the penny stock and they would call people up on the phone and get them to buy stock while they themselves were selling the stock and then suddenly there were no more sellers and the stock would collapse and the insiders made out like bandits.
[01:16:27.758 --> 01:16:29.299]  Now, this is the first time we've seen it
[01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.301]  Operated on a huge scale.
[01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:34.003]  Facebook was $104 billion public offering.
[01:16:34.003 --> 01:16:36.606]  Barack Obama had his arm around Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:16:36.606 --> 01:16:38.367]  He was involved in this pump and dump.
[01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:44.473]  They go public at $104 billion and they are now down 50% from the IPO price.
[01:16:44.473 --> 01:16:47.837]  60 or 70% from the high just touched after the IPO price.
[01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:49.778]  And you've got two other stocks I want to talk about.
[01:16:50.499 --> 01:16:51.680]  Zynga and Groupon.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:57.463]  Groupon is a stock that won public at 20, traded near 30, is now at 5.
[01:16:57.463 --> 01:17:00.384]  And Zynga is down 60 or 70, 80% as well.
[01:17:00.384 --> 01:17:08.148]  What all these three companies have in common, this is a dimension that hasn't been touched on a lot, is that they all share a common auditor, Ernst & Young.
[01:17:08.148 --> 01:17:10.810]  Ernst & Young is one of the biggest auditors in America.
[01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:11.710]  They are crooked.
[01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.151]  They are as crooked as Wall Street.
[01:17:13.151 --> 01:17:15.152]  They are as crooked as the fund managers.
[01:17:15.152 --> 01:17:17.013]  They are as crooked as the rating agencies.
[01:17:17.353 --> 01:17:19.615]  And explain how this works.
[01:17:19.615 --> 01:17:22.078]  It's not just that they're crooked and cook the books.
[01:17:22.078 --> 01:17:33.529]  Only certain groups like Arthur Anderson and others who are politically connected with Justice Department people in a revolving door, only you go to them, not for them to cook the books even really.
[01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:34.650]  That's on the surface.
[01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:40.737]  It's really a payoff to regulators who are in a revolving door to let you be above the law.
[01:17:41.527 --> 01:17:44.330]  Well, Arthur Anderson is one of the biggest accounting firms.
[01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:46.512]  They got caught up in Enron.
[01:17:46.512 --> 01:17:49.235]  Enron blew up, and Arthur Anderson disappeared.
[01:17:49.235 --> 01:17:52.339]  There were ten or so big firms at one point.
[01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:53.460]  I think we're down to four now.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.801]  But am I correct in what I said?
[01:17:56.202 --> 01:18:15.871]  Ernst & Young is not necessarily hired to cook the books because the system is so corrupt that there is no genuine, generally accepted accounting principles worth anything anymore.
[01:18:15.871 --> 01:18:18.732]  Ernst & Young, they cover these three companies that I just mentioned.
[01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:22.554]  They have just lost, in total, these three companies alone.
[01:18:22.554 --> 01:18:29.177]  The market caps have dropped by $62 billion in the past just a few months since going public.
[01:18:29.177 --> 01:18:36.120]  And just to give you an idea of what Ernst & Young does, or these big accounting firms do, I had an experience myself when I was CEO of a company in Los Angeles.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.342]  We had one of these big accounting firms come in, PricewaterhouseCoopers.
[01:18:39.342 --> 01:18:43.544]  And they, the trick is basically, it depends on what they call revenue.
[01:18:44.404 --> 01:18:55.353]  In the case of Zynga, that they sell virtual tractors, and they sell virtual raspberries as part of FarmVille, which is a game on Facebook.
[01:18:55.353 --> 01:18:58.095]  The Ernst & Young would count the virtual money as real money.
[01:18:58.095 --> 01:18:59.777]  So that was the fraud that they were committing.
[01:19:00.237 --> 01:19:07.480]  In the case of the company I was involved with, PricewaterhouseCoopers, they were identifying losses as revenue.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.321]  We had $2 million in losses.
[01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:13.443]  They put in the filing for the IPO of Bear Stearns, $2 million in revenues.
[01:19:13.443 --> 01:19:19.126]  According to their formula, that was the revenues of the company, even though they were the losses of the company.
[01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:32.749]  But they didn't get in trouble after that, because the accounting rules in America, just like all the banking rules and all the political rules and all the special interest rules and all the abrogation of all the civil rights and all the constitutional rules, are now in the hands of the lunatics running this asylum.
[01:19:32.749 --> 01:19:39.410]  They're the ones, Ernst & Young can say, that loss is equal to revenues, and therefore the company is worth $100 billion.
[01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:43.811]  Then it goes to the public market, and within three months we know, wait a minute, the company's not worth $5!
[01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:45.272]  Sure, Max, stay there.
[01:19:45.272 --> 01:19:48.394]  When we come back, I want to get your take on this then.
[01:19:48.394 --> 01:19:56.579]  If the whole thing is rotten, and as you said, the whole structure is the rust, take the rust out of the car, there's no car, what happens when there is an implosion?
[01:19:56.579 --> 01:19:57.479]  Is it total?
[01:19:57.479 --> 01:19:58.420]  Does it make it worse?
[01:20:00.543 --> 01:20:03.724]  What's the difference in all these online emergency food stores?
[01:20:03.724 --> 01:20:05.144]  The difference is Deseret!
[01:20:05.144 --> 01:20:14.086]  DeseretFoodStore.com has the best price on a one-year supply of restaurant-style gourmet food starting at just $695 for 875 servings.

[01:21:00.882 --> 01:21:01.883]  Hi there.
[01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:03.404]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:21:03.404 --> 01:21:07.226]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:21:07.226 --> 01:21:16.392]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:23.097]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:21:23.097 --> 01:21:25.278]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:21:25.278 --> 01:21:30.362]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:21:31.102 --> 01:21:39.027]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:44.611]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.

[01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:23.496]  Oh, the foreign bankers did a bad, bad thing.
[01:24:23.496 --> 01:24:25.736]  Oh, they did.
[01:24:25.736 --> 01:24:29.798]  And now, they're buying 1.4 billion bullets.
[01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:33.179]  They've got drones and checkpoints going up everywhere.
[01:24:33.179 --> 01:24:36.860]  And more and more they admit it's for a civil unrest collapse.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:43.282]  Max Keiser, who's been stunningly accurate in his prediction so far, unfortunately, is saying in the next...
[01:24:45.239 --> 01:24:45.619]  I don't know.
[01:24:45.619 --> 01:24:46.659]  How far away is April?
[01:24:46.659 --> 01:24:48.640]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 months.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.980]  6, 7 months.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.121]  He sees it all imploding.
[01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:56.782]  And now they're in Fox News saying it looks like the Fed is going to go to QE3.
[01:24:56.782 --> 01:25:00.463]  But they've already done other forms of stimulus that cause inflation.
[01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:04.063]  Max, what happens when the corruption is so systemic?
[01:25:04.063 --> 01:25:10.745]  I mean, if we had crashes in 1929, not much of the economy was tied up in the market.
[01:25:10.745 --> 01:25:14.726]  What happens when everything's tied up in fraud if things go belly up?
[01:25:16.169 --> 01:25:21.992]  Well, it's a good point because back in the 20s and 30s, you still had a very big farming component in the U.S.
[01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:22.452]  economy.
[01:25:22.452 --> 01:25:25.513]  And even during the Depression, there was enough family farms in America.
[01:25:25.513 --> 01:25:27.874]  People could eat to some degree.
[01:25:27.874 --> 01:25:28.915]  That's not so anymore.
[01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:33.717]  You have the big industrial farming, the Monsanto farming, the huge conglomerate farming.
[01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:35.638]  You don't really have the small farms anymore.
[01:25:35.638 --> 01:25:38.159]  So when the thing blows up, there's no recourse.
[01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:38.939]  There's nowhere to go back.
[01:25:39.019 --> 01:25:41.180]  I'll make another prediction for 2013.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.462]  You keep asking me, is there any way to stop it?
[01:25:43.462 --> 01:26:01.314]  I say, no, there's no way to stop this, because systems analysis tells me that when you complicate a system to the degree that this has been compromised and complicated, there's a 99.9% probability of a total, utter systemic collapse before April, and that's my thought.
[01:26:01.314 --> 01:26:07.098]  Now, following up on that, there is only one possible outcome as a result of that, and that's civil war.
[01:26:07.338 --> 01:26:08.778]  There's got to be a civil war.
[01:26:08.778 --> 01:26:12.499]  It's going to be a civil war in America, intergenerational.
[01:26:12.499 --> 01:26:27.262]  All the people under 30 are going to go to war with everybody who's 45 plus, who basically stole all their money, stole their country, stole their wealth, destroyed the arability and the viability of the soil.
[01:26:27.262 --> 01:26:29.003]  And that will be the civil war.
[01:26:29.003 --> 01:26:32.724]  There's only, if you have one, you're going to have the other.
[01:26:32.724 --> 01:26:33.604]  And that would come in 2013.
[01:26:35.184 --> 01:26:40.250]  Max, I'm so speechless I've got to interject something here.
[01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:45.736]  This is shaking me right now because I know you wouldn't just say this and put your credibility on the line.
[01:26:45.736 --> 01:26:49.661]  You're really sure of this and I hope you're wrong.
[01:26:49.661 --> 01:26:50.502]  That's all I can say.
[01:26:51.223 --> 01:26:58.405]  Well, I'm putting my flag, you know, planting my flag on this one, as I have done before with predictions previously.
[01:26:58.405 --> 01:27:06.888]  And there's, because there's no avoiding the collapse, there's no remedy to the collapse.
[01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.369]  The underlying chaos
[01:27:08.749 --> 01:27:12.192]  Is too great.
[01:27:12.192 --> 01:27:15.454]  86% of all the trades in the New York Stock Exchange are computer to computer.
[01:27:15.454 --> 01:27:17.556]  That's true of exchanges all over the world.
[01:27:17.556 --> 01:27:22.539]  The algorithms that support all this trading are funded with 0% interest rates from the Fed.
[01:27:22.539 --> 01:27:24.180]  They can borrow money at zero.
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:29.184]  They can do anything they want with any amount of money that they want and they never make a mistake.
[01:27:29.184 --> 01:27:31.826]  They get bailed out with more free money from the Feds and they
[01:27:31.886 --> 01:27:33.427]  Well, I mean, here's why you may be right.
[01:27:33.427 --> 01:27:38.170]  I mean, undoubtedly, it's all a giant fraud waiting to blow up, Max, but why are the Chinese pulling out of the U.S.
[01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:38.630]  stock market?
[01:27:56.459 --> 01:27:57.399]  They're buying gold.
[01:27:57.399 --> 01:28:00.581]  They're buying every... This is going to be another surprise announcement, Gal.
[01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:08.485]  They're going to come out before the end of the year and say that their gold holdings are not at roughly 1,000 tons, but they're closer to 2,000 tons.
[01:28:08.485 --> 01:28:12.627]  They may even be up toward 3,000 tons, which would put them right up with Germany.
[01:28:12.627 --> 01:28:18.469]  Number two biggest concentration of gold in the world is Germany with 3,000 tons, and then the U.S.
[01:28:18.469 --> 01:28:18.710]  with 8,000 tons.
[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:22.213]  China, big surprise announcement coming this year.
[01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:26.417]  They're either going to double, probably double their gold to 2,000 tons.
[01:28:26.417 --> 01:28:28.399]  It'll shock the world.
[01:28:28.399 --> 01:28:34.786]  It'll put a whole nother wave of buying pressure on gold, which we still see is going to continue.
[01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:41.311]  It's climbed to $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 an ounce, and China is a big part of that.
[01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:45.814]  As you mentioned, Soros is now back in gold in a big way.
[01:28:45.814 --> 01:28:51.877]  John Paulson, one of the biggest hedge fund managers in the world, is now 44% of his fund is entirely in gold bullion.
[01:28:51.877 --> 01:28:53.238]  That's billions of dollars.
[01:28:53.238 --> 01:28:58.421]  The hedge funds, the smart money, is always the first mover, and they get in there first.
[01:28:58.421 --> 01:28:59.282]  They know what's coming.
[01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:00.683]  They see the collapse.
[01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:04.285]  A lot of other hedge funds are closing business because the system is too chaotic.
[01:29:04.285 --> 01:29:05.986]  It's too treacherous out there.
[01:29:05.986 --> 01:29:07.367]  Funds are just pulling the plug.
[01:29:07.367 --> 01:29:08.568]  Well, yeah.
[01:29:08.568 --> 01:29:10.650]  Well, I mean, that's what the Chinese said.
[01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:16.714]  They said Monday, I mean, of course, you just mentioned earlier, they said this system doesn't work.
[01:29:16.714 --> 01:29:17.975]  It's not real.
[01:29:17.975 --> 01:29:18.995]  In fact, I had the article.
[01:29:18.995 --> 01:29:21.237]  I forget their exact statement, but they did.
[01:29:21.237 --> 01:29:22.478]  We'll try to find it during the break.
[01:29:22.478 --> 01:29:25.940]  But they were like, you know, this system is no longer.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.121]  We can't gauge this.
[01:29:27.121 --> 01:29:28.562]  They basically said it wasn't real.
[01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:32.751]  Exactly what you're saying, Max.
[01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:33.871]  Yeah, I know.
[01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:34.631]  They listen to my show.
[01:29:34.631 --> 01:29:37.872]  Well, they listen to reality, I'm sure.
[01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:39.152]  And they probably do listen to you.
[01:29:39.152 --> 01:29:42.293]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser and your phone calls.
[01:29:42.293 --> 01:29:43.433]  And he's got a lot more to cover.
[01:29:43.433 --> 01:29:49.875]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.875 --> 01:29:51.276]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.276 --> 01:29:53.796]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.796 --> 01:29:56.477]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:06.574]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:30:06.574 --> 01:30:09.536]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:30:09.536 --> 01:30:14.920]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.182]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[01:30:18.342 --> 01:30:19.043]  We're good to go.
[01:30:33.319 --> 01:30:37.203]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:30:37.203 --> 01:30:40.105]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[01:30:40.105 --> 01:30:42.888]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:30:42.888 --> 01:30:47.452]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:30:47.452 --> 01:30:48.112]  Don't wait!
[01:30:48.112 --> 01:30:49.994]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:30:49.994 --> 01:30:51.575]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:30:51.575 --> 01:30:53.077]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:31:00.203 --> 01:31:05.687]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:31:05.687 --> 01:31:08.108]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:31:08.108 --> 01:31:17.214]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:17.214 --> 01:31:20.656]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:31:20.656 --> 01:31:22.337]  There's no priming required.
[01:31:22.337 --> 01:31:24.619]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:31:24.619 --> 01:31:27.120]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:29.702]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:31:29.702 --> 01:31:31.123]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:31:31.123 --> 01:31:34.286]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:37.668]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:31:37.668 --> 01:31:41.812]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:31:41.812 --> 01:31:44.554]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:31:44.554 --> 01:31:46.135]  It's what my family uses.
[01:31:46.135 --> 01:31:49.438]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:31:49.438 --> 01:31:54.702]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[01:32:00.343 --> 01:32:03.824]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[01:32:03.824 --> 01:32:09.785]  It is a nanocatalytic silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[01:32:09.785 --> 01:32:13.106]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[01:32:13.106 --> 01:32:19.407]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[01:32:19.927 --> 01:32:27.913]  Silversol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[01:32:27.913 --> 01:32:34.078]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[01:32:34.078 --> 01:32:40.824]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[01:32:41.204 --> 01:32:43.765]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[01:32:43.765 --> 01:32:46.687]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:03.992]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:03.992 --> 01:33:05.373]  A lie!
[01:33:05.373 --> 01:33:07.375]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:07.375 --> 01:33:09.257]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:09.257 --> 01:33:12.500]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.966]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:19.628]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:19.628 --> 01:33:20.709]  A crawling insect!
[01:33:21.389 --> 01:33:25.793]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:25.793 --> 01:33:27.295]  I am a human being!
[01:33:27.295 --> 01:33:35.042]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.183]  I don't care!
[01:33:36.183 --> 01:33:37.765]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:33:37.765 --> 01:33:39.406]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:41.969]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[01:33:42.759 --> 01:33:46.481]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:49.642]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:49.642 --> 01:33:57.345]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:33:57.345 --> 01:34:04.388]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[01:34:04.388 --> 01:34:08.490]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:08.490 --> 01:34:10.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:13.522 --> 01:34:19.948]  Alright we're going back to Max Keiser because I want to ask him what the collapse he's predicting will look like.
[01:34:19.948 --> 01:34:28.015]  I mean he's saying worse than 08 and that was a heart attack in the financial system orchestrated to hold us hostage and bring in control.
[01:34:28.015 --> 01:34:29.136]  How bad will this one be?
[01:34:30.265 --> 01:34:33.708]  Because Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, threatened martial law.
[01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:37.672]  And we first reported that with a congressman on the show who heard it and closed the committee.
[01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:38.793]  And people thought I made it up.
[01:34:38.793 --> 01:34:40.615]  And a week later it was big national news.
[01:34:40.615 --> 01:34:42.176]  We got no credit, of course.
[01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.437]  And it's not that that even matters.
[01:34:43.437 --> 01:34:48.602]  I'm just tired of people doubting it when I have a congressman on or, you know, I have somebody interesting on.
[01:34:48.602 --> 01:34:51.085]  And people just can't believe it was even real.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.662]  And I had like Willie Nelson on, and I've seen people who don't believe I had Christopher Walken on yesterday.
[01:34:56.662 --> 01:34:59.943]  I mean, they don't believe that the truth has been successful.
[01:34:59.943 --> 01:35:02.304]  They just can't get it through their heads.
[01:35:02.304 --> 01:35:04.906]  They're playing games with themselves, not us that are awake.
[01:35:04.906 --> 01:35:08.387]  We're going to go back and ask them that question in a moment, and go to your phone calls.
[01:35:08.387 --> 01:35:10.928]  Max Keiser at MaxKeiser.com is our guest.
[01:35:10.928 --> 01:35:12.969]  If you just joined us again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:35:12.969 --> 01:35:14.070]  We're here Monday through Friday.

[01:35:27.618 --> 01:35:30.660]  If you like this radio show and the info, then you're going to love the television show.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.641]  It's very informative.
[01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:35.644]  The guests, the in-studio, the documents, the many documentaries.
[01:35:35.644 --> 01:35:36.204]  That's 15 cents a day.

[01:35:42.162 --> 01:35:45.247]  It's all about getting the word out, and that just pays for our bandwidth.
[01:35:45.247 --> 01:35:49.172]  We're getting censored more and more, so we're promoting prisonplanet.tv more and more.
[01:35:49.172 --> 01:35:53.758]  And lastly, with this uncertain world, we have found the very best...

[01:36:51.636 --> 01:36:52.457]  We are capitalists.
[01:36:52.457 --> 01:36:53.597]  We are free market.
[01:36:53.597 --> 01:36:54.718]  We believe in the Constitution.
[01:36:54.718 --> 01:36:58.039]  We believe in free association.
[01:36:58.039 --> 01:37:06.363]  So if you believe in what we're doing and like what we're doing, buy stuff at InfoWarshop.com and watch us grow and expand in the face of the globalists big time.
[01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:09.145]  Okay, I got to ask you Max Keiser, what
[01:37:10.453 --> 01:37:12.234]  What then does a collapse look like?
[01:37:12.234 --> 01:37:17.816]  I mean, you're going out there big time, and I find it chilling because I respect your analysis.
[01:37:17.816 --> 01:37:24.098]  When you say collapse, some people then say that means road warrior, you know, bands of motorcycles feeding on people.
[01:37:24.098 --> 01:37:25.539]  Well, crime rates are already exploding.
[01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:28.460]  There are a lot of towns where there are no police.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:31.981]  Or if there are, they're there to make sure you don't have guns, or they are the gangs.
[01:37:31.981 --> 01:37:37.944]  So we're starting to see some road... Chicago, most dangerous city in the world now, but obviously
[01:37:39.309 --> 01:37:43.014]  By collapse, you don't mean full Road Warrior collapse, or how bad could it get?
[01:37:44.656 --> 01:38:02.203]  Well, first of all, before I get into that, I wanted to touch on some news here about the extent to which this fraud has perpetrated itself throughout the economy and why people are going to continue to be outraged and why that anger is building.
[01:38:02.203 --> 01:38:12.326]  Remember, John Corzine, former head of Goldman Sachs, former governor of New Jersey, he was caught when he moved over to MF Global stealing $1.2 billion.
[01:38:12.326 --> 01:38:13.627]  We talked about it on your show before.
[01:38:14.267 --> 01:38:18.311]  Now, he is basically allowed to go scot-free.
[01:38:18.311 --> 01:38:21.194]  There's no penalty at all for John Corzine.
[01:38:21.194 --> 01:38:26.299]  His defense, his defense is that the money vaporized.
[01:38:26.299 --> 01:38:36.029]  He has no idea where it went and he just can't seem to be able to generate any evidence of its whereabouts that ever existed or where it went.
[01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:45.017]  That's the kind of outrageous statement coming from a former governor, former head of Goldman Sachs, former head of MF Global, that gets under people's skin.
[01:38:45.017 --> 01:38:57.184]  And they say, wait a minute, this guy is part of a racket, the racket of the rating agencies, the fund managers, Wall Street, the auditors, as we just talked about, the media, CNBC.
[01:38:57.184 --> 01:38:59.466]  And it's a mafia style racket.
[01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:02.988]  They're practicing racketeering and they are stealing.
[01:39:03.348 --> 01:39:07.469]  Wholesale our wealth and by proxy our country.
[01:39:07.469 --> 01:39:31.197]  At some point there is a breaking point and the most victimized group in America will be the new generation that wakes up one day and finds gasoline at $15 a gallon, a bag of groceries for $300, and no way to get to work because the roads are completely in disrepair, and on and on and on.
[01:39:31.497 --> 01:39:37.919]  And those people will have no recourse whatsoever but to take back their country by any means necessary.
[01:39:37.919 --> 01:39:43.180]  It's just, it's not a big leap of faith here, this is just a logical progression of what happened.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:52.063]  That's right, and the bankers are gearing up with 1.4 billion plus rounds of ammo, checkpoints, giant armored tanks, vehicles, admitting they're going to put the army on the street.
[01:39:52.063 --> 01:39:58.824]  What's the army going to do when their wife can't, you know, with her paycheck, pay for groceries, or mama's thrown out on the street?
[01:39:58.824 --> 01:40:00.505]  I mean, what are these bankers thinking?
[01:40:01.172 --> 01:40:08.337]  Well, you know, when you say it won't be like road warriors, you know, it could be like, you know, a soft gulag.
[01:40:08.337 --> 01:40:09.397]  A soft gulag.
[01:40:09.397 --> 01:40:19.003]  And what I mean by that would be, on one hand, you've got this massive private prison industry that's growing the fastest, one of the fastest growing industries in America is private prisons.
[01:40:19.003 --> 01:40:21.585]  Corrections Corps of America hitting new all-time highs on their stock.
[01:40:21.585 --> 01:40:22.525]  We talked about it recently.
[01:40:22.525 --> 01:40:29.290]  And he'll put all the people in the new FEMA camps, where they're there for petty reasons, making things further driving down wages.
[01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:53.437]  Well, and prison labor, since we talked last time, has come out that factory owners in America are complaining to the Chamber of Commerce because the prison labor now, which works for 80 to 90 cents a day, is becoming such a big component of the American labor force that the only way you can get a job in America now is to go to prison, to find yourself in prison.
[01:40:53.437 --> 01:40:59.319]  And so the manufacturers, the factories in America, they don't have anybody to hire because the people...
[01:40:59.599 --> 01:41:10.230]  And look at the crime wave in France, the riots, the crime wave in Greece, and they've disarmed most of the people, so the criminals are just robbing, and it says the police can't help.
[01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.534]  Yeah, because it turns out the cops are the ones robbing a lot of people.
[01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:16.838]  I mean, this can only go on so long.
[01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:23.982]  All right, so my idea of the soft gulag is, first of all, you have the hard gulag, which are the prisons and the, you know, the camps.
[01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:35.348]  And we know, we see that being telegraphed in the stock market already because the capitalization of those companies is moving aggressively higher because they know that they're about to get 20, 30, 40, 50 million new inmates.
[01:41:35.348 --> 01:41:37.330]  And that's incredibly profitable.
[01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.231]  They get huge tax abatements.
[01:41:39.231 --> 01:41:41.932]  They get, they own the restaurants and hotels near the prisons.
[01:41:41.932 --> 01:41:43.153]  So people go visit their,
[01:41:43.453 --> 01:41:48.919]  Family in prison, they eat in the restaurants, they stay in the hotels, you lose your voting rights, it's a fantastic money center.
[01:41:48.919 --> 01:41:54.224]  But the soft gulag, we saw that last week with the introduction of face deals.
[01:41:54.224 --> 01:42:00.410]  You know, these new Facebook cameras in retail shops that are geared to face recognition.
[01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:04.814]  And you get discounts by giving up your liberties and freedoms, but that's only up front.
[01:42:04.814 --> 01:42:07.197]  Later, everyone will have to do it to buy and sell.
[01:42:07.728 --> 01:42:14.033]  Right, so, in other words, you give up your liberties and freedoms for a deal on some Chinese-made garbage.
[01:42:14.033 --> 01:42:22.140]  So you get 20 cents off, and you'll allow Facebook to essentially keep you in check, keep you in line.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:33.449]  Whenever you go into a mall or a shopping environment, and of course they'll hook it up to the grid, which includes every camera out there, you will be buzzed on your cell phone whenever you stray off the path.
[01:42:33.909 --> 01:42:44.492]  If you stray toward a retailing outlet that they don't want you to go to or doesn't have the deal that they want you to look at, you'll get buzzed, you'll get phoned, you'll start... Yeah, this is how they control markets.
[01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:47.792]  We've got to go to calls because I promised to, but new documents.
[01:42:47.792 --> 01:42:51.153]  Big Sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program.
[01:42:51.153 --> 01:42:53.974]  They're now rolling out giant... they have the army doing this.
[01:42:54.834 --> 01:43:09.606]  We have footage on local news from New York where they make you and your family drive under a high-powered x-ray machine that shoots through metal more powerful than a chest x-ray and they're still rolling it out.
[01:43:09.606 --> 01:43:13.309]  New documents Big Sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program.
[01:43:13.309 --> 01:43:16.792]  Homeland Security claimed it had dropped the plans in early stage.
[01:43:16.792 --> 01:43:21.296]  We've got the local newscast showing the idiot police and military
[01:43:21.796 --> 01:43:31.605]  Standing out there under high-powered, guys, show people this article, it's incredible, under giant high-powered x-ray machines that shoot through your car or your truck.
[01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.687]  I mean, this is suicide!
[01:43:33.687 --> 01:43:41.835]  I mean, these globalists are just setting up a system of total war against everybody with the GMO food, the radiation, the mass death.
[01:43:41.835 --> 01:43:44.157]  We are run by lunatics.
[01:43:45.384 --> 01:43:54.988]  The soft gulag concept is coming into focus and Facebook, by the way, also is introducing online gambling in the UK with British pounds.
[01:43:54.988 --> 01:44:01.131]  So that member I called the Gulag Casino, which is going to people will give up their liberties also for a chance to gamble online.
[01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:05.213]  Of course, they hold out these enormous mega multimillion dollar pots of money.
[01:44:05.213 --> 01:44:08.375]  Yeah, all fake dreams, all manipulating.
[01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:20.363]  The people going to the private prison to visit their family don't even know the restaurants, gas stations, hotels are owned by the big mega bank that owns that consortium that actually shipped the drugs in that their son or daughter got caught using.
[01:44:20.363 --> 01:44:29.069]  The troops grow the opium, total black op murder, massive record suicide by the troops, cancer viruses being injected in us, total insanity.
[01:44:29.069 --> 01:44:31.130]  Again, that's the type of collapse you're talking about.
[01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:32.671]  Let's go to Roy in Montana.
[01:44:32.671 --> 01:44:33.972]  Roy, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:44:35.063 --> 01:44:37.404]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Brother Alex.
[01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.665]  Mr. Kaiser, good to talk to you.
[01:44:39.665 --> 01:44:45.166]  My question is, I can't really afford gold, and obviously it's going to go way up.
[01:44:45.166 --> 01:44:54.670]  Do you think silver would be a good investment for somebody who can't afford gold, or do you just, at this point, just invest in... You're talking to Mr. Silver right now, Max.
[01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:58.332]  Yeah, silver, of course, they call it the poor man's gold.
[01:44:58.332 --> 01:45:01.254]  It's basically the same thing as owning gold.
[01:45:01.254 --> 01:45:02.655]  It'll operate the same thing.
[01:45:02.655 --> 01:45:06.217]  You know, gold and silver now, more and more, are being considered a currency.
[01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:15.603]  The commodity, the CME in Chicago, the Commodity Mercantile Exchange, just announced today that they are accepting gold as collateral.
[01:45:15.603 --> 01:45:19.065]  That means for the first time now, these commodity futures operations
[01:45:19.865 --> 01:45:21.486]  Or part of the banking system.
[01:45:21.486 --> 01:45:29.068]  They are so distrustful of the banks themselves that they are violating this idea that gold is somehow not a money.
[01:45:29.068 --> 01:45:30.649]  They're saying now gold is a currency.
[01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:32.129]  We will take gold as collateral.
[01:45:32.129 --> 01:45:34.330]  So gold is seeping its way into the economy.
[01:45:34.330 --> 01:45:36.731]  It's being monetized slowly but surely.
[01:45:37.711 --> 01:45:39.872]  Only thing that's going to be left standing.
[01:45:39.872 --> 01:45:41.433]  5,000 years of history will tell you that.
[01:45:41.433 --> 01:45:44.135]  Silver is just as good as gold in this environment.
[01:45:44.135 --> 01:45:48.657]  If you don't want to buy pure silver, you can buy junk silver, which is 90% silver.
[01:45:48.657 --> 01:45:52.800]  You know, the 1964 or previous... Everybody knows what those coins are.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.862]  And when all this paper fully goes down, people are going to still be transacting.
[01:45:57.862 --> 01:46:07.008]  It's going to be whiskey, cigarettes, silver, gold, bullets, firearms, food, people that know how to fix things, trades.
[01:46:08.308 --> 01:46:10.009]  I mean, that's where it's at.
[01:46:10.009 --> 01:46:22.533]  Yeah, well, Stacey, my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, you know, she has thousands of these miniature bottles of whiskey from the airplanes that she's going to use as currency, she says.
[01:46:22.533 --> 01:46:29.996]  By the way, Max, yeah, I've got a bunch of whiskey and stuff, obviously not drinking it, but I'm joking, but I do have a bunch of whiskey and stuff.
[01:46:29.996 --> 01:46:33.017]  I mean, I know that there's a good chance all this is going to happen.
[01:46:33.017 --> 01:46:35.198]  I hope it doesn't, but sir, I hope that answers your question.
[01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:37.109]  It does.
[01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:39.291]  And one quick follow-up.
[01:46:39.291 --> 01:46:41.692]  What would that do with a person with a mortgage?
[01:46:41.692 --> 01:46:49.096]  I mean, if the dollar tanks and you owe your mortgage in dollars, I mean, how does that affect the average homeowner?
[01:46:49.096 --> 01:46:51.157]  Well, sometimes... Max, you answer it.
[01:46:51.157 --> 01:46:51.557]  Go ahead.
[01:46:52.947 --> 01:46:59.397]  Well, theoretically, you inflate the mortgage value away and it's quote-unquote good for the homeowner.
[01:46:59.397 --> 01:47:08.430]  But I think we're in an environment where there's so much economic dislocation and there's so many other variables at play here that it's not worth it.
[01:47:09.011 --> 01:47:09.992]  In that sense.
[01:47:09.992 --> 01:47:11.954]  But you mean your point is well taken.
[01:47:11.954 --> 01:47:12.594]  It's a good point.
[01:47:12.594 --> 01:47:14.756]  But there are other things to consider.
[01:47:14.756 --> 01:47:19.640]  And real estate as a class of investment is problematic for a number of reasons.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.463]  You know, you have the society breaking down.
[01:47:22.463 --> 01:47:28.648]  You don't know what different neighborhoods today could suddenly become war zones next week.
[01:47:28.648 --> 01:47:30.590]  You know, there's a lot of things happening.
[01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:31.690]  But your point is well taken.
[01:47:31.690 --> 01:47:32.591]  It's a good point.
[01:47:32.591 --> 01:47:34.473]  And I can't, you know, say it's not a good point.
[01:47:34.847 --> 01:47:36.268]  All right, thank you so much, sir.
[01:47:36.268 --> 01:47:38.550]  Let's go to Jay in Texas.
[01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:40.552]  You're on the air, Jay.
[01:47:40.552 --> 01:47:41.733]  Hey, how you doing, Max?
[01:47:41.733 --> 01:47:47.798]  Hey, there's an article out in Veterans Today about foreign cash disqualifies Romney from presidential bid.
[01:47:47.798 --> 01:47:51.061]  Something about him being over in Israel and Italy or London.
[01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:52.202]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.222]  I haven't seen that specific, that particular article.
[01:47:56.222 --> 01:48:01.865]  You know, Romney, of course, is problematic for a number of different reasons.
[01:48:01.865 --> 01:48:07.889]  You know, the whole Bain Capital affiliation and everything that goes on there.
[01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:17.356]  I don't understand why people would want to look at a guy who said his tax rate for the past five years is averaging about 13 percent.
[01:48:17.356 --> 01:48:21.659]  So clearly he's not in the same country that we are living in.
[01:48:21.659 --> 01:48:22.940]  He lives in some other country.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.520]  He's a foreigner.
[01:48:24.421 --> 01:48:28.725]  No, he lives in global country where the globalists are all above the law.
[01:48:28.725 --> 01:48:30.646]  He can't really consider him to be an American.
[01:48:30.646 --> 01:48:33.589]  He pays taxes like he lives in the Cayman Islands.
[01:48:33.589 --> 01:48:37.552]  So go to the Cayman Islands and leave us alone.
[01:48:37.552 --> 01:48:38.613]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:48:38.613 --> 01:48:40.235]  You certainly had courage to live in France.
[01:48:40.235 --> 01:48:44.178]  Now you're going to the tax haven, as they call it, of England, Max.
[01:48:44.178 --> 01:48:46.821]  Let's go to Mark in North Carolina.
[01:48:46.821 --> 01:48:47.481]  You're on the air.
[01:48:47.481 --> 01:48:47.842]  Go ahead.
[01:48:48.803 --> 01:48:51.105]  Hey Alex, Max, thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:51.105 --> 01:48:54.307]  And doggone, you answered several of my questions while I was sitting here waiting.
[01:48:54.307 --> 01:49:05.195]  But I still have one good one, I think, and that's got to do with whether you've got coins or LLCs or other items, including the silver and the gold.
[01:49:05.195 --> 01:49:09.018]  Once you have it, what's the best ways or what's the best and safest bet for keeping it?
[01:49:09.963 --> 01:49:13.365]  Well, I mean, number one, don't tell anybody about it but your spouse.
[01:49:13.365 --> 01:49:16.407]  Number two, have guns to defend it and be ready to use them.
[01:49:16.407 --> 01:49:19.689]  And number three, don't put all your eggs in one basket, Max Keiser.
[01:49:19.689 --> 01:49:25.052]  Well, my understanding is that Infowars is opening up a huge warehouse down in Austin, Texas to store everybody's precious metals.
[01:49:25.052 --> 01:49:27.873]  That's where I send all mine!
[01:49:27.873 --> 01:49:28.614]  Very funny, Max.
[01:49:30.495 --> 01:49:31.296]  No, okay.
[01:49:31.296 --> 01:49:37.799]  So, yes, you don't want, obviously, you're at risk if you have it in your home or you know it.
[01:49:37.799 --> 01:49:41.362]  There's a lot of work on the web in terms of what people are doing with this.
[01:49:41.362 --> 01:49:49.887]  Personally, there are services that you can get involved with that store your metals in vaults that are completely outside the banking system.
[01:49:50.447 --> 01:50:00.018]  Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of private lockers, safety deposit boxes aren't 100% safer, but the point is, if you've got a couple of them, you can always get the stuff out later.
[01:50:00.018 --> 01:50:02.661]  So, I mean, just all over the place is basically it.
[01:50:03.434 --> 01:50:08.158]  This common sense, you know, you're right to be concerned.
[01:50:08.158 --> 01:50:11.300]  From there, there are a number of strategies you can use.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:20.607]  Each one has pluses and minuses, but tied to your individual circumstance, which I don't know, but it's easy enough to get the research on this.
[01:50:20.607 --> 01:50:26.452]  Yeah, I'm also, I'm investing in lead and the systems that project it.
[01:50:26.452 --> 01:50:30.015]  And I'm also, food and things like that.
[01:50:31.089 --> 01:50:47.595]  Well, yeah, but, you know, the funny thing is Portugal just announced that the folks there that are being exposed to austerity measures have just run out of all the gold that they can sell at the local pawn shop.
[01:50:47.595 --> 01:50:49.356]  No, I know, I know, absolutely.
[01:50:49.356 --> 01:50:52.117]  And the bankers drove the price down to hoard it themselves.
[01:50:52.117 --> 01:50:53.538]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:50:53.538 --> 01:50:57.279]  Logan, John, Terry, Scott, your call straight ahead.
[01:50:57.279 --> 01:50:57.719]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.719 --> 01:50:59.140]  I'm Alex Jones with Max Geiser.
[01:51:02.208 --> 01:51:08.053]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:08.053 --> 01:51:13.497]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:13.497 --> 01:51:15.679]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:15.679 --> 01:51:22.965]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:23.465 --> 01:51:27.168]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:51:27.168 --> 01:51:31.411]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:31.411 --> 01:51:38.095]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:51:38.095 --> 01:51:41.057]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:41.057 --> 01:51:44.080]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.722]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:51:47.722 --> 01:51:50.144]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:50.664 --> 01:51:55.626]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:51:55.626 --> 01:52:00.388]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:08.191]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.191 --> 01:52:16.515]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.148 --> 01:52:22.710]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:34.074]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:52:59.719 --> 01:53:02.880]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.342]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:53:07.342 --> 01:53:09.043]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:53:09.043 --> 01:53:15.586]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:53:15.586 --> 01:53:24.290]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:26.952]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?
[01:53:26.952 --> 01:53:39.523]  Watch the video at 123offgrid.com for a simple trick for generating your own off-grid power so that no matter what happens, your home will be a little island of light and warmth, even if it's dark everywhere else.

[01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:09.902]  Basically, an offshore criminal class has gotten control.
[01:54:09.902 --> 01:54:13.285]  They fund themselves by militarizing against us.
[01:54:13.285 --> 01:54:15.547]  They make money out of enslaving us.
[01:54:15.547 --> 01:54:19.330]  They brainwash people to be paranoid that their neighbors are terrorists.
[01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:23.394]  While the government runs Al Qaeda publicly, it is an insane time to be alive.
[01:54:23.394 --> 01:54:27.498]  Max Keiser is our guest for this little segment, and the next, and then in studio.
[01:54:28.058 --> 01:54:31.000]  We're gonna have Joe Bannister and his lawyer, political prisoner.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.201]  They tried to make him a political prisoner.
[01:54:33.201 --> 01:54:34.823]  Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent.
[01:54:34.823 --> 01:54:38.585]  This is very important in light of all the corruption for the IRS coming out.
[01:54:38.585 --> 01:54:41.367]  Logan in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:54:42.347 --> 01:54:44.108]  Nice to talk to you, AJ.
[01:54:44.108 --> 01:54:47.450]  Remember, apathy is treason, my brother.
[01:54:47.450 --> 01:55:03.239]  My question for Max Keiser is, I don't hear anybody speaking about commercial real estate and the fact that you can only claim a loss on your business for five years before you have to declare bankruptcy.
[01:55:03.239 --> 01:55:08.002]  And I believe that that is going to be one of the trigger mechanisms for the next collapse because
[01:55:08.562 --> 01:55:13.246]  Housing real estate was the bubble that popped the first time.
[01:55:13.246 --> 01:55:16.429]  And so I wanted to know what you thought about that, Max.
[01:55:16.429 --> 01:55:18.210]  Well, all I can say is that I would agree with you.
[01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:20.592]  OK, what you're saying is absolutely correct.
[01:55:20.592 --> 01:55:30.300]  The commercial real estate sector is kind of a huge bubble proportions, just like the student loan sector is a huge multi, you know, trillion dollar plus bubble ready to burst as well.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:32.482]  So there's still big bubbles yet to burst.
[01:55:33.959 --> 01:55:47.162]  Here in California, everywhere I look, strip malls, they have one business in ten units, and every single one of them has a for-rent sign, a for-sale sign, and they've been sitting for years.
[01:55:47.162 --> 01:55:49.503]  I have friends who are- Okay, hold on, let me jump in here.
[01:55:49.503 --> 01:55:50.783]  So think that through for a second.
[01:55:50.783 --> 01:55:54.784]  So in other words, you've got this commercial real estate that's vacant, that's not generating any income.
[01:55:54.784 --> 01:56:02.246]  It's backed by bonds, collateralized bonds of some nature, mortgage collateralized bonds, which have been sold back and forth amongst
[01:56:02.346 --> 01:56:03.067]  Thanks for watching.
[01:56:27.965 --> 01:56:32.429]  Mountain Vestuvius of bad debt that's building on the balance sheets of these banks.
[01:56:32.429 --> 01:56:32.750]  J.P.
[01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:33.991]  Morgan, classic example.
[01:56:33.991 --> 01:56:36.493]  Ninety trillion dollars worth of derivatives.
[01:56:36.493 --> 01:56:39.436]  Trillions of dollars worth of bad commercial real estate debt.
[01:56:39.436 --> 01:56:42.279]  And it's not being exposed because the... Well said.
[01:56:42.279 --> 01:56:42.879]  Well said.
[01:56:42.879 --> 01:56:43.620]  Thank you, Logan.
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.261]  Got to jump.
[01:56:44.261 --> 01:56:45.882]  Terry and Canada, you're on the air.
[01:56:45.882 --> 01:56:46.303]  Go ahead.
[01:56:48.221 --> 01:56:51.863]  Alex, Max, thank you very much, guys.
[01:56:51.863 --> 01:56:59.485]  I was first introduced to Max, Mike Maloney, and when he air-guitared the Sex Pistols, he had me hooked.
[01:56:59.485 --> 01:57:11.870]  So my question is, Bank of Canada Governor, Mark Carney, he does double duty at the Bank of International Settlements, so my exact question is, is the Bank of Canada buying gold?
[01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:21.392]  And once this financial collapse happens, where does Canada fit into it all, being the biggest trader with the U.S.?
[01:57:21.392 --> 01:57:26.634]  Well, Carney's an interesting case because, of course, just six months ago, Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P.
[01:57:26.634 --> 01:57:32.275]  Morgan, was lecturing Carney on why he needs to reduce his minimum capital reserve requirements in that country.
[01:57:32.275 --> 01:57:36.296]  Because doesn't he know that selling more derivatives is in the best interest of all the bankers around the world?
[01:57:36.696 --> 01:57:36.996]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:52.753 --> 01:57:57.615]  They didn't get rid of their Glass-Steagall because they'd done that previously and got into trouble with it.
[01:57:57.615 --> 01:57:58.195]  Great points.
[01:57:58.195 --> 01:58:02.036]  We're going to come back in five more minutes with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[01:58:02.036 --> 01:58:05.317]  Again, if you've just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[01:58:05.317 --> 01:58:09.798]  No, we're not dry, old, fake, left-wing media regurgitating fables.
[01:58:09.798 --> 01:58:13.199]  We're not old, dry, right-wing media regurgitating old fables.
[01:58:13.199 --> 01:58:16.780]  We're looking for real reality and freedom in our time.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:18.081]  I hope Max Keiser's wrong.
[01:58:18.081 --> 01:58:21.842]  He says it's going to happen in the next six, seven months, by next April, total collapse.
[01:58:22.342 --> 01:58:23.683]  I hope he's wrong.
[01:58:23.683 --> 01:58:26.406]  But there's a good chance he's going to be right.
[01:58:26.406 --> 01:58:30.769]  The globalists could always have some new bubble, some new scam, some new thing they do.
[01:58:30.769 --> 01:58:33.251]  But Max has never said it's coming down now.
[01:58:33.251 --> 01:58:35.653]  He's saying that and a lot of our other experts are.
[01:58:35.653 --> 01:58:37.034]  That's super creepy.
[01:58:37.034 --> 01:58:41.178]  But we're here warning people regardless.

[02:00:13.251 --> 02:00:17.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.433 --> 02:00:21.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.755 --> 02:00:26.938]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:32.217]  We've got five minutes left with Max Keiser.
[02:00:32.217 --> 02:00:34.619]  Invaluable information, maxkeiser.com.
[02:00:34.619 --> 02:00:35.780]  We're having him on a lot more.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:37.441]  We're very thankful for him coming on.
[02:00:37.441 --> 02:00:41.804]  You can find out about his TV and radio shows at maxkeiser.com.
[02:00:41.804 --> 02:00:44.066]  Be sure and support the alternative truthful media.
[02:00:44.066 --> 02:00:46.288]  It doesn't mean he has all the answers or I have all the answers.
[02:00:46.288 --> 02:00:48.390]  It doesn't mean we're infallible, nothing close to it.
[02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:51.052]  But we're trying to get to the truth.
[02:00:51.052 --> 02:00:55.935]  And Max has really proven he's got his pulse for being a former insider on where things are going.
[02:00:55.935 --> 02:00:57.837]  And this conversation is freaking me out.
[02:00:57.837 --> 02:00:58.417]  I live here too.
[02:00:59.301 --> 02:01:04.963]  And I see all the preparations, and I wish we weren't right.
[02:01:04.963 --> 02:01:16.666]  Somehow we've got to turn this around, try to educate as many military and police, because the globalist plan on having a civil war in this country that they trigger, instead of having us come together and fixing the system.
[02:01:16.666 --> 02:01:23.648]  I've grown up, I'm older, I'm not that old, but when I was 20, I was a little more, eh, we'll just have a war.
[02:01:23.648 --> 02:01:25.809]  I didn't want it then either, but now I've
[02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:27.151]  Yeah.
[02:01:49.267 --> 02:01:50.068]  Hey, Max, Alex.
[02:01:50.068 --> 02:01:51.028]  Good to talk to you guys.
[02:01:51.028 --> 02:01:55.351]  You know, I always enjoy listening to Max and you too, Alex.
[02:01:55.351 --> 02:01:58.553]  Just kind of wanted to tell you a little bit going on here.
[02:01:58.553 --> 02:02:05.077]  I'm about two hours outside of Chicago, close to a little place called Gary, Indiana.
[02:02:05.077 --> 02:02:09.980]  I don't know if you guys know about it, but it's a cesspit, basically.
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:11.221]  Just rampant crime.
[02:02:11.881 --> 02:02:22.026]  Um, but what they're doing here is, um, they've opened up, um, they're opening up, I should say, um, several churches in and around the area to, uh, confiscate guns.
[02:02:22.026 --> 02:02:26.908]  So you bring your guns in and basically get a, um, $15, $25 Walmart gift card.
[02:02:26.908 --> 02:02:30.409]  So, um, and that's just happened, uh, Wednesday.
[02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:31.610]  I just heard it on the radio here.
[02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:35.251]  Local radio station was just, uh, broadcasting it, um, here.
[02:02:35.251 --> 02:02:37.412]  Yeah, like, like I said, a couple of days ago.
[02:02:37.412 --> 02:02:38.673]  Give us your take on that, Max.
[02:02:40.018 --> 02:02:45.682]  Well, Walmart is the company's store on the plantation.
[02:02:45.682 --> 02:02:49.865]  You know, every dollar you save at Walmart, you destroy $1.50 in wages.
[02:02:49.865 --> 02:02:54.148]  If you shop at Walmart, you're putting yourself into a wageless prison environment.
[02:02:54.148 --> 02:02:54.909]  It's as simple as that.
[02:02:54.909 --> 02:02:56.250]  Same thing with Target, though.
[02:02:56.250 --> 02:02:57.951]  They're all the same.
[02:02:57.951 --> 02:02:58.772]  Yeah, okay.
[02:02:58.772 --> 02:03:01.253]  But Walmart is the biggest employer in the United States.
[02:03:01.253 --> 02:03:06.017]  No, I mean, it wrote the book, but it's now even being slave-marted out worse by Amazon.
[02:03:07.836 --> 02:03:08.496]  Possibly.
[02:03:08.496 --> 02:03:13.358]  But, in other words, the retailing environment... Race to the bottom.
[02:03:13.358 --> 02:03:14.838]  Race to the bottom.
[02:03:14.838 --> 02:03:16.339]  Yeah, it's okay to race to the bottom.
[02:03:16.339 --> 02:03:21.881]  I mean, if you want to segue into a discussion about guns, I mean, that's a different discussion.
[02:03:21.881 --> 02:03:23.161]  Yeah, but, I mean, I was interrupting.
[02:03:23.161 --> 02:03:25.522]  Give us, in closing, your take on what's happening to retail.
[02:03:26.994 --> 02:03:30.336]  Well, no, it's the race to the bottom.
[02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:35.740]  You know, I was trying to come up with a good metaphor for this transition to this total collapse state.
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:42.044]  And, you know, you see it in nature all the time, Alex, you know, the transition in these system dynamics when there's a shift.
[02:03:42.044 --> 02:03:51.271]  You know, when you have water, for example, retains a lot of heat, and then suddenly it only takes one degree to go from water to vapor.
[02:03:51.271 --> 02:03:54.033]  Okay, that's a phase shift.
[02:03:54.753 --> 02:03:56.014]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[02:03:56.014 --> 02:04:01.237]  The heat, the water, the system is heating up, systems break down.
[02:04:01.237 --> 02:04:11.004]  And once we get that one final degree shift in complexity and outrage, you have a phase shift from water to steam.
[02:04:11.004 --> 02:04:15.327]  And steam compared to water is extremely, you know, unstable.
[02:04:15.327 --> 02:04:15.507]  Yes.
[02:04:16.107 --> 02:04:21.329]  The society that we're heading for in 2013, something extremely unstable.
[02:04:21.329 --> 02:04:33.234]  So when you say collapse, you mean lots of instability, crazy stuff going on, and the globalists know this shift's happening, so they want to flip it like judo and take all that rage and use it for them to take over.
[02:04:33.234 --> 02:04:36.716]  But you're saying you don't see things going well for them, or will they stay in control?
[02:04:36.716 --> 02:04:40.497]  I think they're in good shape, Alex.
[02:04:43.117 --> 02:04:44.919]  We're going to have to have you back up very soon.
[02:04:44.919 --> 02:04:46.301]  Thank you so much, Max.
[02:04:46.301 --> 02:04:48.124]  I want to see where you think all this is going.
[02:04:48.124 --> 02:04:49.626]  Max Keiser has been our guest.
[02:04:49.626 --> 02:04:51.448]  We've got in-studio guests straight ahead.
[02:04:51.448 --> 02:04:55.013]  A guy that tried to make a political prisoner for his speech.
[02:04:55.013 --> 02:04:55.474]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.748 --> 02:05:06.894]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:05:06.894 --> 02:05:09.857]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:05:09.857 --> 02:05:15.263]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:05:15.263 --> 02:05:18.506]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[02:05:18.686 --> 02:05:20.207]  Blowing up your food prices.
[02:05:20.207 --> 02:05:27.853]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:31.716]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:05:31.716 --> 02:05:33.517]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:05:33.517 --> 02:05:37.540]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.142]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:05:40.422 --> 02:05:43.204]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:05:43.204 --> 02:05:47.786]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:05:47.786 --> 02:05:48.426]  Don't wait!
[02:05:48.426 --> 02:05:50.307]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:05:50.307 --> 02:05:51.888]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:05:51.888 --> 02:05:53.469]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:01.351 --> 02:06:07.677]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:12.942]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:06:12.942 --> 02:06:15.184]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:06:15.184 --> 02:06:22.672]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:06:23.172 --> 02:06:26.975]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:06:26.975 --> 02:06:31.319]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:06:31.319 --> 02:06:38.205]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:06:38.205 --> 02:06:41.248]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:06:41.248 --> 02:06:44.350]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:48.074]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:06:48.074 --> 02:06:50.556]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:06:51.096 --> 02:06:56.201]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:06:56.201 --> 02:06:57.842]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:07:02.025 --> 02:07:05.986]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:05.986 --> 02:07:14.848]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.848 --> 02:07:19.489]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.489 --> 02:07:30.291]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:40.453]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.453 --> 02:07:45.875]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.875 --> 02:07:53.356]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.356 --> 02:07:56.117]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:02.116 --> 02:08:08.759]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.759 --> 02:08:11.741]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:30.990]  You know, I should have hyped this up better, but our listeners know that we tend to be all bite and no bark, as they say.
[02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:32.952]  We've had a lot of amazing guests in the last few days.
[02:08:32.952 --> 02:08:34.814]  We just had Max Keiser on yesterday.
[02:08:34.814 --> 02:08:37.337]  We had Richard Belzer along with...
[02:08:37.898 --> 02:08:38.278]  I don't think so.
[02:08:59.742 --> 02:09:01.523]  Liberty is popular.
[02:09:01.523 --> 02:09:08.565]  Now, I knew this because I'd followed the trial, and I think once even, maybe even tried to call you as a guest, but who knows.
[02:09:08.565 --> 02:09:17.007]  I didn't even really realize until I was sitting in here with Joe Bannister, who we had on earlier in the week via phone, who of course I've been interviewing now for about 14 years or so, or 13 years.
[02:09:17.007 --> 02:09:18.007]  Well, this is about 99, right?
[02:09:18.007 --> 02:09:19.348]  So I guess about 13 years.
[02:09:21.348 --> 02:09:28.132]  He is here in studio with us and Robert G Bernhoft is also here in studio with us.
[02:09:28.132 --> 02:09:35.836]  He was Wesley Snipes lawyer who got him off on all of the felonies with the IRS and when they arrested
[02:09:36.818 --> 02:09:48.949]  Joe Bannister, for his thought crimes a few years ago, Mr. Bernhoff was able to get, I don't want to say get him off because he didn't do anything, but the point is it's hard to beat the criminal IRS.
[02:09:48.949 --> 02:09:53.634]  And I'm very excited, I didn't know this, I knew that you were I guess in the Midwest or what was it, Milwaukee?
[02:09:53.914 --> 02:09:55.495]  Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Alex, yeah.
[02:10:24.535 --> 02:10:26.058]  Well, first of all, we came down to Austin.
[02:10:26.058 --> 02:10:30.304]  My firm did, because that's where all the troublemakers are, and we figured this is a good place to be.
[02:10:30.304 --> 02:10:32.929]  And that's partly true, but we're really liking it here in Austin.
[02:10:32.929 --> 02:10:37.776]  Great people, a lot of energy, and of course, this show is here, so we're having fun.
[02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:42.192]  Yeah, now that you're here in town, look out, you're our legal expert.
[02:10:42.192 --> 02:10:43.053]  Good to have you here.
[02:10:43.053 --> 02:10:43.653]  Thank you.
[02:10:43.653 --> 02:10:51.918]  In fact, I wanted to get you on the TV show tonight, so hopefully next time you're both in town, come back, because I forgot I'm shooting for a documentary film today, a film cruise here.
[02:10:51.918 --> 02:10:55.060]  So, we've got to work it out somehow to get that done.
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:56.681]  Okay, I'm excited, I'm going to shut up.
[02:10:58.584 --> 02:11:04.091]  Tell us about your take on the IRS, the big scandals coming out, all the rest of the corruption.
[02:11:04.091 --> 02:11:12.342]  It seems like the veil is lifting, that we really do have a corporate mafia in control that exempts itself from the fraudulent laws that they put in place.
[02:11:12.751 --> 02:11:27.645]  I think that's right, Alex, and one of the hot topics in academic commentators, the federal judiciary, and defense practitioners is government misconduct after former Senator Ted Stevens and the subordination of perjury, falsification of evidence, and the scandal about that.
[02:11:27.645 --> 02:11:34.651]  What we're seeing, what I'm seeing now, is a cascade of investigative and prosecutorial misconduct that's infecting the courts.
[02:11:34.651 --> 02:11:38.695]  The difference now over the past four or five years is that it's being exposed to some extent.
[02:11:39.755 --> 02:11:50.743]  We will never know what sort of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct lay behind Joe's investigation and prosecution because we were, we did not get all the discovery we were entitled to.
[02:11:50.743 --> 02:12:02.411]  But I remember getting the call from Joe after the arrest and that was a really, that was a traumatic time I know for him and his family and we were able to jump in and help and we're grateful to be able to do it.
[02:12:03.737 --> 02:12:12.139]  Let's go through that case before Wesley Snipes because, I mean, you're just winning and winning and winning in a system where it's almost impossible to win.
[02:12:12.139 --> 02:12:16.240]  Tommy Cryer, God bless him, died this year.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.880]  He was able to defeat them.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.941]  When you can get a jury trial, I mean, is that how you're able to do this, actually exposing the fraud?
[02:12:21.941 --> 02:12:22.421]  Absolutely.
[02:12:22.421 --> 02:12:31.083]  The last bastion of freedom, the interposition between the government power and the executive and the citizens, citizens like Joe, is the jury.
[02:12:31.083 --> 02:12:32.444]  Now there's, unfortunately,
[02:12:33.944 --> 02:12:39.265]  The quality of the jurors that we're seeing in jury pools, it's a function of American culture.
[02:12:39.265 --> 02:12:43.306]  We have a lot of people that watch too much TV, that listen to government propaganda.
[02:12:43.306 --> 02:12:47.847]  It's very difficult to get free thinking, individualist type people on juries.
[02:12:47.847 --> 02:12:51.988]  So one of the things that you have to do is pay attention to your jury selection.
[02:12:51.988 --> 02:12:54.309]  Joe's jury, we like diversity on our juries.
[02:12:55.009 --> 02:12:56.790]  And, you know, I'll be candid about this.
[02:12:56.790 --> 02:13:04.696]  For example, the African-American community has a different perspective of the system than white America does generally.
[02:13:04.696 --> 02:13:06.497]  They've had an experience with the system.
[02:13:06.497 --> 02:13:08.379]  They're suspicious of system statements.
[02:13:08.379 --> 02:13:10.240]  Not as naive!
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.981]  That's a great way to put it.
[02:13:11.981 --> 02:13:18.386]  And they're more inclined to think and listen carefully to what otherwise other Americans might shut out.
[02:13:18.386 --> 02:13:22.749]  You know, how could it be that the government who wears the white hats indicts a good guy?
[02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:25.690]  Well, you know, the government comes into court with the white hats on.
[02:13:25.690 --> 02:13:27.431]  Joe's supposed to have the black hat on.
[02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:30.212]  And our trial theme was, no, they indicted the good guy.
[02:13:30.212 --> 02:13:32.513]  And so we tried to switch the hats.
[02:13:32.513 --> 02:13:35.095]  And that's a tough concept for most Americans.
[02:13:35.095 --> 02:13:38.456]  But thank God we still have jury trials in all of our criminal cases.
[02:13:38.456 --> 02:13:39.757]  And unanimity is required.
[02:13:39.757 --> 02:13:44.059]  It's got to be 12 unanimous jurors giving a unanimous verdict.
[02:13:44.059 --> 02:13:45.399]  And that's your last chance.
[02:13:45.399 --> 02:13:47.600]  That's your last chance to defend yourself.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:49.902]  The other thing that's going on, of course, is it's a
[02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:58.829]  An exemplar of despotic systems that they use their judicial process to single out and punish dissenters.
[02:13:58.829 --> 02:14:12.882]  That's always been the case throughout world history, but it's a real shame and it's a disgrace that the American federal criminal judicial process increasingly is being used as a forum to target and punish principled dissenters.
[02:14:12.882 --> 02:14:16.386]  And so that's the state of the American judicial process today.
[02:14:17.046 --> 02:14:17.747]  Well, it's scary.
[02:14:17.747 --> 02:14:19.608]  It's like you say, Joe.
[02:14:19.608 --> 02:14:22.090]  Hey, I'm not saying don't pay them, even though it's all a fraud.
[02:14:22.090 --> 02:14:23.010]  They'll break your legs.
[02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:24.351]  I mean, they'll worse than that.
[02:14:24.351 --> 02:14:27.073]  They'll put you in prison for 20 years and take everything you got.
[02:14:27.073 --> 02:14:29.555]  I'd rather have my legs broken than that 10 times.
[02:14:29.555 --> 02:14:31.616]  I mean, this is vicious what you went through.
[02:14:31.616 --> 02:14:39.182]  I know most of our listeners are aware of your story, but look at what happened to just the guest I had on the other day, the IRS.
[02:14:39.662 --> 02:14:40.423]  Yep, yep, yep.
[02:14:40.423 --> 02:14:41.564]  Sherry Peele Jackson.
[02:14:41.564 --> 02:14:43.367]  I mean, she did nothing wrong.
[02:14:43.367 --> 02:14:45.149]  And for her speech, look at Irwin Schiff.
[02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:47.532]  In prison for a book in America!
[02:14:48.595 --> 02:14:50.797]  Book burning, book burning is alive in America.
[02:14:50.797 --> 02:14:55.542]  We don't burn them anymore, we issue injunctions against their publication and dissemination.
[02:14:55.542 --> 02:14:59.826]  And that's what the court issued against Schiff prior to the criminal trial.
[02:14:59.826 --> 02:15:04.291]  The court enjoined Schiff from printing and publishing his book upon pain of contempt.
[02:15:04.291 --> 02:15:08.995]  I mean, it's interesting that even the Library Association of America came out in support of Schiff on that point.
[02:15:09.736 --> 02:15:26.390]  And it's also interesting that in an age where court decisions have said that free speech covers books on how to stalk, torture, and kill people, how to identify and groom children for sexual abuse, and that's free speech.
[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:28.612]  You know, that stuff's out there, that's okay.
[02:15:28.612 --> 02:15:34.316]  But God forbid someone like Erwin Schiff wants to print his thoughts and research conclusions about the scope and nature of the tax.
[02:15:35.077 --> 02:15:36.738]  That's something, you burn the book.
[02:15:36.738 --> 02:15:43.000]  Well, I mean, he found the key to it and proved all their fraud after decades of research, and they said, you're going to a dungeon.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:51.283]  Yeah, and the other speech, the other types of speech that, you know, I'm libertarian, but nevertheless, some of that speech is abhorrent.
[02:15:51.283 --> 02:15:53.804]  First Amendment covers that, but it doesn't cover Irwin.
[02:15:53.804 --> 02:15:56.785]  Yeah, you have to protect the abhorrent stuff or we lose our good stuff.
[02:15:57.205 --> 02:15:57.705]  That's right.
[02:15:57.705 --> 02:16:02.128]  You know, there was a famous Supreme Court justice that made it really a great profound comment.
[02:16:02.128 --> 02:16:06.771]  We tolerate the speech we hate because someday our speech might be hated.
[02:16:06.771 --> 02:16:07.732]  So I'm good with that.
[02:16:07.732 --> 02:16:08.532]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:16:08.532 --> 02:16:10.473]  I believe in the principles of this country.
[02:16:10.473 --> 02:16:16.017]  But what we're having now is selective identification of speech that the state deems subversive.
[02:16:16.557 --> 02:16:17.378]  I don't think so.
[02:16:33.354 --> 02:16:37.116]  In fact... No, they just make it more sophisticated and more covers.
[02:16:37.116 --> 02:16:37.456]  That's right.
[02:16:37.456 --> 02:16:38.656]  There's more velvet gloves.
[02:16:38.656 --> 02:16:39.176]  That's right.
[02:16:39.176 --> 02:16:40.257]  What were we going to say, interrupted?
[02:16:40.257 --> 02:16:55.983]  No, it has a perception of being more civilized, but in fact, if you were a heretic before in the colonies, you know, and you said something that they considered blasphemous, they'd put you in the stock for a day, a little public humiliation, and then they, you know, repatriated you to your family and to your home.
[02:16:55.983 --> 02:16:57.384]  They had to live in a community.
[02:16:57.384 --> 02:16:58.724]  And today we're much more civilized.
[02:16:58.724 --> 02:17:01.445]  We try and put people like Joe Bannister in federal prison for 15, 16 years.
[02:17:03.186 --> 02:17:19.660]  And they're now grabbing people I've seen that have protested the famous doctor case, what Cell, up in Missouri, where he's been in there for 15 years now, forced drugged, never having a trial, but he's in prison drugged for Medicare-Medicaid fraud, they claimed.
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:23.403]  I mean, now they drug you or electroshock you because of your views.
[02:17:23.403 --> 02:17:24.564]  That's like the old Soviet Union.
[02:17:24.784 --> 02:17:26.345]  It's barbaric.
[02:17:26.345 --> 02:17:27.906]  It's absolutely barbaric.
[02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:29.767]  And when you take a look at the U.S.
[02:17:29.767 --> 02:17:45.036]  sentencing guidelines, which determines sentencing ranges, and we take a look at the so-called white-collar guidelines, particularly regarding tax, and you have people that, you know, failed to pay a little bit of tax on a couple years of income, and the sentencing ranges can be five to ten years in federal prison.
[02:17:45.636 --> 02:17:47.417]  Uh, you know, everything is upside down.
[02:17:47.417 --> 02:17:53.560]  You can beat, uh, you can be out of a state prison in California on a murder one charge, 6.9 years, something like that.
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:57.703]  You know, but if you run afoul of the IRS, look forward to a double digit sentence.
[02:17:57.703 --> 02:17:59.404]  Uh, and this is systematic.
[02:17:59.404 --> 02:18:01.625]  This is not, uh, you know, this isn't accidental.
[02:18:01.625 --> 02:18:08.709]  This is absolute intentional policy that's being passed by Congress, enforced by its agency, the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:18:10.609 --> 02:18:12.010]  This guy ought to have a radio show.
[02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:14.350]  No wonder he's winning with all these juries.
[02:18:14.350 --> 02:18:16.511]  Hey, wow, amazing.
[02:18:16.511 --> 02:18:20.412]  Again, we have Joe Bannister and Robert G. Bernhoft, his incredible lawyer.
[02:18:20.412 --> 02:18:26.893]  You've got to go to BernhoftLaw.com because I've followed your cases and then I'm running around here with 20 things happening and you guys are here.
[02:18:26.893 --> 02:18:31.455]  And then it kind of re-clicks, you know, Joe goes, you know, he's the guy that's won all these other cases too.
[02:18:31.455 --> 02:18:33.935]  And I'm just realizing how rare that is.
[02:18:33.935 --> 02:18:36.836]  Why have you been so successful when very few others have?
[02:18:37.256 --> 02:18:39.177]  We're going to skip this break because it's so important, guys.
[02:18:39.177 --> 02:18:39.537]  Go ahead.
[02:18:39.537 --> 02:18:44.180]  Yeah, the conviction rate generally is roundabout body temperature in federal criminal trials.
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.921]  95-96% take your statistic.
[02:18:47.921 --> 02:18:54.505]  The way we approach these cases is, first of all, we have aggressive motion practice to get the discovery that our clients are entitled to.
[02:18:54.505 --> 02:18:58.487]  And there's various rules and cases, so we're very aggressive about getting discovery.
[02:18:58.487 --> 02:19:04.210]  And the devil's in the details, and the government's thematics, and sometimes investigative misconduct lurks in the discovery.
[02:19:05.010 --> 02:19:06.071]  Um, and then we prepare.
[02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:11.553]  It's about preparation, mastery of information, and it's also having an understanding of human nature.
[02:19:11.553 --> 02:19:13.734]  You know, this is an age where we want to change human nature.
[02:19:13.734 --> 02:19:15.354]  We don't want to acknowledge it.
[02:19:15.354 --> 02:19:24.338]  We acknowledge the functions of human nature, how it plays out, and, you know, court trials are, are theater dramatics where the stakes are very, very high.
[02:19:25.218 --> 02:19:28.259]  You have to understand what makes people tick when you pick a jury.
[02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:35.881]  You have to look at those people as individuals, ask them a few questions, and they will tell you things about themselves without even realizing it.
[02:19:35.881 --> 02:19:41.562]  So jury selection, and Joe assisted me at counsel table with jury selection in his trial.
[02:19:41.562 --> 02:19:47.043]  And you have to have good people instincts, and you have to be aggressive, and you have to know the law.
[02:19:47.043 --> 02:19:50.024]  But picking a jury is crucially important, as it was in Joe's case.
[02:19:51.673 --> 02:19:52.894]  And you're right, it is theater.
[02:19:52.894 --> 02:20:01.122]  People say, why do they do a year or 14-month, million-dollar investigation of Amish selling cheese and milk to their neighbors?
[02:20:01.122 --> 02:20:09.649]  Turns out the neighbors have moved in and demand they sell them their milk and cheese that their community's eating, so they could take it across state lines and sell it to make it a federal case.
[02:20:09.649 --> 02:20:13.873]  Then they SWAT team them and get them down on the ground when they're a known non-violent sect for 400 years.
[02:20:15.855 --> 02:20:17.676]  And all of this goes on.
[02:20:17.676 --> 02:20:18.938]  People say, why do they do that?
[02:20:18.938 --> 02:20:24.623]  So they can show an ignorant jury who doesn't know what Amish are, doesn't know the history of anything.
[02:20:24.623 --> 02:20:25.623]  Like, look, they're bad.
[02:20:25.623 --> 02:20:27.385]  We wouldn't have swapped team vote.
[02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:29.707]  And all of it is just dress-up theater.
[02:20:29.707 --> 02:20:30.208]  Absolutely.
[02:20:30.208 --> 02:20:37.074]  Increasingly, you know, especially in tax cases, especially in non-filing, and I'm not afraid to say tax protester cases.
[02:20:37.634 --> 02:20:44.996]  I mean, I did a case in Boston a few months ago, and they were completing building the Tea Party Museum, right there, inside of the courthouse.
[02:20:44.996 --> 02:20:51.057]  And so, we took the government's epithet, it's defamatory epithet, and we said, no, we'll accept that.
[02:20:51.057 --> 02:20:57.099]  That's right, my clients are principal tax protesters, and they're protesting taxation without explanation.
[02:20:57.739 --> 02:21:02.482]  Wrote letters to the IRS, asked for the code section that made them liable, no answers.
[02:21:02.482 --> 02:21:04.684]  And we reached that jury on a pretty good level.
[02:21:04.684 --> 02:21:12.809]  So it is drama, and increasingly these prosecutions are done by misleading the jury about things they don't know about, can't be expected to know.
[02:21:12.809 --> 02:21:15.711]  Misleading the jury about tax law, about how accounting is done.
[02:21:15.711 --> 02:21:20.895]  And in Joe's case, of course, it's just the drumbeat that this guy's dangerous.
[02:21:20.895 --> 02:21:24.237]  If you don't convict this guy, he's gonna get to the children.
[02:21:24.437 --> 02:21:29.678]  But if we rediscover 1776, common sense says the government's dangerous.
[02:21:29.678 --> 02:21:30.459]  Absolutely.
[02:21:30.459 --> 02:21:32.279]  We were very aggressive in Joe's trial.
[02:21:32.279 --> 02:21:38.121]  My co-counsel Jeff Dickstein did an incredible job and he put to the jury, which side is the con on?
[02:21:38.121 --> 02:21:39.381]  Which side is the con on?
[02:21:39.381 --> 02:21:41.322]  They charged Joe Bannister with conspiracy.
[02:21:41.322 --> 02:21:42.242]  Conspiracy.
[02:21:42.242 --> 02:21:44.262]  Was that a conspiracy?
[02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:46.043]  And we put it to the jury.
[02:21:46.043 --> 02:21:48.103]  You cannot win these cases by half measures.
[02:21:48.103 --> 02:21:50.804]  You can't go in there with soft themes.
[02:21:50.804 --> 02:21:51.244]  I agree.
[02:21:51.244 --> 02:21:53.045]  People say wake up America being nice.
[02:21:53.045 --> 02:21:53.185]  No.
[02:21:54.365 --> 02:21:55.646]  I never calculated anything.
[02:21:55.646 --> 02:21:57.668]  I'm aggressive like a bull in a china shop.
[02:21:57.668 --> 02:21:58.809]  That's what gets results.
[02:21:58.809 --> 02:21:59.629]  The truth.
[02:21:59.629 --> 02:22:00.270]  That's right.
[02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:04.473]  And you have to break through the barriers of people from seeing the truth.
[02:22:04.473 --> 02:22:06.474]  And you look at Joe's case again.
[02:22:06.474 --> 02:22:09.336]  I mean, he was... Did you go with this angle too?
[02:22:09.336 --> 02:22:10.757]  Because I followed some of the news.
[02:22:10.757 --> 02:22:11.618]  I was so busy.
[02:22:11.618 --> 02:22:14.200]  I was just following it in the paper and talking to Joe some on the phone.
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.461]  But I have a little inside stuff.
[02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:18.323]  But I would have made the point.
[02:22:18.323 --> 02:22:19.223]  He was moving up.
[02:22:19.223 --> 02:22:20.164]  He had a career.
[02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:21.005]  He had everything.
[02:22:21.465 --> 02:22:24.086]  He just did this to warn people of the truth!
[02:22:24.086 --> 02:22:26.007]  Why would he lose everything?
[02:22:26.007 --> 02:22:27.807]  They're the liars!
[02:22:27.807 --> 02:22:32.629]  That is a really interesting point, because the government's playbook in criminal tax is greed.
[02:22:32.629 --> 02:22:37.751]  You know, he chose to play, and then they point to the jury, well, you chose to pay.
[02:22:37.751 --> 02:22:41.652]  They create class economic envy and responsibility envy.
[02:22:41.652 --> 02:22:43.533]  They tried to trot that theme out in Joe's case.
[02:22:44.453 --> 02:22:46.435]  Closing argument, especially.
[02:22:46.435 --> 02:22:47.296]  He lost everything!
[02:22:47.296 --> 02:22:51.759]  Yeah, he put everything on the line, and yet the greed was the function, the factor.
[02:22:51.759 --> 02:22:52.580]  It was extraordinary.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:53.761]  It wasn't plausible.
[02:22:53.761 --> 02:22:55.402]  And the jury didn't buy it.
[02:22:55.402 --> 02:22:58.425]  Did you tell the story how he set out to disprove the tax protesters?
[02:22:58.425 --> 02:22:59.345]  Absolutely.
[02:22:59.345 --> 02:23:01.527]  There was tons of great testimony and evidence.
[02:23:01.527 --> 02:23:10.855]  And of course, Joe, being a man of integrity, had former colleagues that were videotaped in a deposition talking about what a great special agent he was.
[02:23:10.855 --> 02:23:13.357]  The integrity, the discipline, the work ethic.
[02:23:13.957 --> 02:23:15.858]  So, it was a tough go for the government.
[02:23:15.858 --> 02:23:17.700]  And that was their evidence, but it blew up in their face.
[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:18.380]  That's right.
[02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:20.722]  They put the evidence of Joe- I find that more and more.
[02:23:20.722 --> 02:23:35.212]  They'll stand up a huge room of like 500 Marines, officers, and say, you will not watch Alex Jones, you will make- give people demerits, and- and write them up, and we'll kick them out if they watch it three times, and then all of them go watch it until- and then- and then tell everybody to watch.
[02:23:35.212 --> 02:23:38.435]  So the whole military's watching, because for 10 years they tell them don't watch it.
[02:23:38.995 --> 02:23:44.061]  I mean, the system is so disconnected from reality, they seem to be their own worst enemy.
[02:23:44.061 --> 02:23:44.762]  Have you found that?
[02:23:44.762 --> 02:23:48.867]  They are alienated from where America is really at.
[02:23:48.867 --> 02:23:50.329]  They are disconnected.
[02:23:50.329 --> 02:23:57.377]  They believe their own fantasies and the things they want everybody else to believe, and they just assume people believe that.
[02:23:58.157 --> 02:24:11.801]  But when you've got Joe standing up there with the New York Times investigative reporter and a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he's asking questions and taking notes, and Joe is expressing some views and beliefs that he has, the government thought this was sedition of the first order!
[02:24:11.801 --> 02:24:13.882]  This is subversive!
[02:24:13.882 --> 02:24:19.723]  And the jury looked at him and said, well gosh, he's thoughtful, he's speaking his mind, I mean, that's a crime?
[02:24:19.723 --> 02:24:22.124]  And the government's theory was, in fact, that was a crime.
[02:24:22.124 --> 02:24:25.025]  That was a conspiracy to defraud the United States.
[02:24:25.325 --> 02:24:26.546]  And your motto nails it.
[02:24:26.546 --> 02:24:28.166]  There's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:28.166 --> 02:24:31.047]  There's a war on for the juror's mind.
[02:24:31.047 --> 02:24:40.391]  Because all that propaganda and all that conditioning all throughout their lives, the government just wants that to stick long enough to convict the defendant.
[02:24:40.391 --> 02:24:41.352]  People like you.
[02:24:41.352 --> 02:24:43.433]  But when you have somebody that can communicate your innocence,
[02:24:45.013 --> 02:24:46.653]  It snaps them out of that.
[02:24:46.653 --> 02:24:47.574]  Let me ask you this.
[02:24:47.574 --> 02:24:57.236]  Going through the fire, but also getting to defend people like Joe, because I've noticed you only take cases where it's really clear that the government's totally in the wrong there, and still that's an uphill battle.
[02:24:57.236 --> 02:25:04.217]  How good does it feel to actually find a niche in this increasingly corrupt world where you do get to do good work?
[02:25:07.529 --> 02:25:10.972]  I tell people all the time, I am an extraordinary lucky individual.
[02:25:10.972 --> 02:25:15.096]  Because we actually make a difference once in a while.
[02:25:15.096 --> 02:25:22.884]  And even moving more transcendently from helping Joe out and his family and avoiding 15, 16 years in federal prison, that would be gratifying.
[02:25:22.884 --> 02:25:26.448]  But we do get to make a difference on a larger scale.
[02:25:26.448 --> 02:25:28.590]  That's a blessing in today's world.
[02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:29.811]  You don't get to do that very often.
[02:25:30.091 --> 02:25:31.131]  We take it very seriously.
[02:25:31.131 --> 02:25:31.532]  It's humbling.
[02:25:31.532 --> 02:25:39.975]  I'll tell you one thing, before the jury came back with the verdict in Joe's case, and I kind of leaned over to him and I said, look, you know, I don't know where this is going.
[02:25:39.975 --> 02:25:46.977]  We've got a pretty good feeling, but win, lose, or draw, when that jury verdict comes in, you know, we're going to be even keel.
[02:25:46.977 --> 02:25:48.117]  Don't let them do it to it.
[02:25:48.117 --> 02:25:52.119]  We're going to walk out of this courtroom one way or the other with your head held up high.
[02:25:52.119 --> 02:25:53.199]  You're entitled to that.
[02:25:53.199 --> 02:25:55.280]  They can't take that away from you.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.701]  If it's a victory, we'll celebrate outside.
[02:25:58.001 --> 02:26:03.584]  You know, and that was one of the most emotional moments of my life when that jury verdict was returned.
[02:26:03.584 --> 02:26:06.606]  The special agent that investigated me?
[02:26:06.606 --> 02:26:09.887]  I want Bob to tell you what he said to Bob upon my acquittal.
[02:26:09.887 --> 02:26:12.569]  Yeah, I came over to, I think it was Special Agent Breslin.
[02:26:12.569 --> 02:26:13.709]  It was Howard and Breslin.
[02:26:13.709 --> 02:26:18.712]  I went over to Special Agent Breslin and, I mean, he had tears running down his face.
[02:26:18.712 --> 02:26:24.455]  And he looked at me and he said, thank you, Counselor, for taking care of our boy Joe.
[02:26:24.455 --> 02:26:25.196]  And I was just...
[02:26:25.916 --> 02:26:28.337]  Because there they are, pretty much even having to testify against him.
[02:26:28.337 --> 02:26:30.158]  Imagine the guilt they were going through.
[02:26:30.158 --> 02:26:30.858]  Yeah.
[02:26:30.858 --> 02:26:32.919]  Because when you do evil things, it comes back on you.
[02:26:32.919 --> 02:26:33.300]  That's right.
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:35.861]  It was a political prosecution, political persecution.
[02:26:35.861 --> 02:26:37.121]  Everybody knew that.
[02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:41.964]  And those special agents that used to work with Joe, they knew he was a man of integrity.
[02:26:41.964 --> 02:26:45.446]  They knew he didn't have any intent to commit any crime.
[02:26:45.446 --> 02:26:48.227]  He didn't want to commit a crime carrying out the IRS stuff.
[02:26:48.487 --> 02:26:53.850]  That's right, so he has a crisis of conscience, but knowing who Joe was, that was unexpected.
[02:26:53.850 --> 02:27:01.734]  I did not expect that to get a handshake and a congratulations counselor from one of the lead special agents, one of Joe's former colleagues.
[02:27:01.734 --> 02:27:03.055]  Very exciting story.
[02:27:03.055 --> 02:27:04.275]  What about Wesley Snipes?
[02:27:04.275 --> 02:27:09.378]  We've had so many famous trials, and you got him to not go to prison for all the fake stuff.
[02:27:09.858 --> 02:27:14.844]  Yeah, that was a really tough case because, you know, we were in Ocala, Florida.
[02:27:14.844 --> 02:27:17.288]  Everybody thought that he couldn't get a fair trial down there.
[02:27:17.288 --> 02:27:20.872]  It was going to be an all-white jury, and it was an all-white jury.
[02:27:20.872 --> 02:27:22.875]  But I picked that jury, and I like that jury.
[02:27:22.875 --> 02:27:25.258]  I thought I picked some really thoughtful people down there.
[02:27:25.798 --> 02:27:32.622]  And, you know, the problem with representing a high-profile celebrity is the fact of their high profile.
[02:27:32.622 --> 02:27:34.383]  Everything changes, it becomes surreal.
[02:27:34.383 --> 02:27:38.665]  There's an entourage, there was massive media down there, and everything gets distorted.
[02:27:38.665 --> 02:27:42.368]  So we actually had to try that case outside the courtroom as well as inside.
[02:27:42.368 --> 02:27:44.889]  That's the big difference between a non-celebrity
[02:27:44.889 --> 02:27:51.376]  Yeah, so many small-time lawyers who aren't, you know, super professional like yourself, they don't get, they always don't talk to the media.
[02:27:51.376 --> 02:27:53.378]  And I'm like, no, it's a media war.
[02:27:53.378 --> 02:27:56.041]  I mean, the prosecutors, they know that.
[02:27:56.041 --> 02:27:58.044]  They're out there giving their press releases.
[02:27:58.044 --> 02:28:00.827]  Prosecution issued a press release that Wesley Snipes was a fugitive.
[02:28:02.248 --> 02:28:06.272]  And he was in Namibia shooting Gallowalker, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:28:06.272 --> 02:28:09.295]  They don't have an extradition treaty at all with the United States.
[02:28:09.295 --> 02:28:15.220]  Wesley could have stayed in Namibia for a good long time, but his attorneys were negotiating with the government his surrender.
[02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:19.744]  So, out there in the media, and the jurors hear this, potential jurors hear this, oh, he fled.
[02:28:19.744 --> 02:28:20.465]  He's a fugitive.
[02:28:20.465 --> 02:28:21.806]  He won't come back.
[02:28:21.806 --> 02:28:22.667]  That's evidence of guilt.
[02:28:22.667 --> 02:28:23.908]  That shows that fraud.
[02:28:23.908 --> 02:28:25.109]  I mean, they're saying he's a criminal.
[02:28:25.109 --> 02:28:26.090]  He's run when he hadn't.
[02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:26.911]  We had to fight that.
[02:28:27.011 --> 02:28:34.015]  You have to go out to the media and dispel the misinformation and propaganda to get yourself back to a level playing field.
[02:28:34.015 --> 02:28:35.616]  And if you don't do that, you lose.
[02:28:35.616 --> 02:28:36.396]  And you lose bad.
[02:28:36.396 --> 02:28:38.317]  And Wesley goes to prison for 16 years.
[02:28:38.317 --> 02:28:42.880]  I have a view of the law, not that I'm a lawyer, but I've studied it a bit, that even if somebody's guilty,
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:50.363]  If the system cheats, the danger of the system cheating is more dangerous than a guilty person not going to jail.
[02:28:50.363 --> 02:28:51.923]  Well, there's no question about that.
[02:28:51.923 --> 02:29:00.066]  And that's why the discovery violations and the cascading misconduct into federal courts, particularly, is crucially important to stop and remedy.
[02:29:00.066 --> 02:29:02.187]  An exceptional event occurred.
[02:29:02.187 --> 02:29:09.290]  Judge Richard Tolman, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge after the Stevens case, issued an open letter to Attorney General Holder.
[02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:15.676]  Really an unprecedented event when a judge speaks to the executive branch at such a high level and it's a public letter.
[02:29:15.676 --> 02:29:25.487]  And he says, look at, paraphrasing, look Mr. Holder, we have got to do something about the discovery violations, the subordination of perjury, and the misconduct that's infecting our system.
[02:29:26.187 --> 02:29:27.907]  Um, we have to have clear rules.
[02:29:27.907 --> 02:29:29.868]  There has to be a level playing field.
[02:29:29.868 --> 02:29:34.029]  That old axiom that we learn as school children is vitally important.
[02:29:34.029 --> 02:29:41.090]  We would let a number of guilty men go free rather than sacrifice the rights of an innocent man.
[02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.890]  That's our system.
[02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:44.871]  It's what separates us from despotic systems.
[02:29:44.871 --> 02:29:45.371]  Amazing.
[02:29:45.371 --> 02:29:49.832]  Robert G. Bernhoft and Joe Bannister, both of them here with us, will give you their website straight ahead.
[02:29:49.832 --> 02:29:51.213]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.213 --> 02:29:52.733]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.752 --> 02:29:56.416]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.678 --> 02:30:06.181]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:30:06.181 --> 02:30:08.603]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:30:08.603 --> 02:30:17.688]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:17.688 --> 02:30:21.150]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:22.831]  There's no priming required.
[02:30:22.831 --> 02:30:25.093]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:30:25.093 --> 02:30:27.534]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to
[02:30:27.534 --> 02:30:28.014]  We're good to go.
[02:30:55.734 --> 02:30:59.376]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.376 --> 02:31:01.817]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.817 --> 02:31:07.400]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:12.422]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.422 --> 02:31:17.465]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:31:17.985 --> 02:31:23.229]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.229 --> 02:31:30.333]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.333 --> 02:31:31.454]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.454 --> 02:31:37.818]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.138 --> 02:31:41.319]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:41.319 --> 02:31:43.540]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:44.480]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:44.680]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:48.122]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:48.122 --> 02:31:49.862]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.166 --> 02:32:06.313]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:32:06.313 --> 02:32:09.276]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:32:09.276 --> 02:32:14.322]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:32:15.043 --> 02:32:19.625]  To feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:32:19.625 --> 02:32:27.269]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[02:32:27.269 --> 02:32:31.151]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:32:31.151 --> 02:32:32.932]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:32:32.932 --> 02:32:36.954]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[02:32:36.954 --> 02:32:39.555]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:32:39.855 --> 02:32:42.637]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[02:32:42.637 --> 02:32:47.181]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:32:47.181 --> 02:32:47.841]  Don't wait!
[02:32:47.841 --> 02:32:49.722]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:49.722 --> 02:32:51.304]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:51.304 --> 02:32:52.865]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:33:06.175 --> 02:33:08.097]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:08.097 --> 02:33:14.282]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.195 --> 02:33:37.296]  We've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[02:33:37.296 --> 02:33:47.319]  The websites to check out are AgentForTruth.com, that's Joe Bannister's, and there's Robert, or Bob G. Bernhoff's website, BernhoffLaw.com.
[02:33:47.319 --> 02:33:54.540]  And I can tell you, if I ever have the Collection Agency for the Private Federal Reserve come after me, I know who I'm going to get right over here.
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:55.541]  I hope I can get him.
[02:33:55.541 --> 02:33:56.301]  You were telling me that
[02:33:56.801 --> 02:34:00.863]  I was saying, boy, I bet killing is their business and business is good for them.
[02:34:00.863 --> 02:34:04.745]  I bet you trying to save people, I bet your business is just booming.
[02:34:04.745 --> 02:34:06.626]  You know, it is.
[02:34:06.626 --> 02:34:09.367]  And it's a bit of a mental torture because...
[02:34:11.069 --> 02:34:14.953]  Business is business, and in making a living, there's nothing to apologize for making a living.
[02:34:14.953 --> 02:34:16.494]  But it's grueling, too!
[02:34:16.494 --> 02:34:16.834]  It is.
[02:34:16.834 --> 02:34:19.857]  It takes its toll, and you deal with a lot of human road meat.
[02:34:19.857 --> 02:34:21.098]  The gristmill of the government.
[02:34:21.098 --> 02:34:24.662]  They grind people up, spit them out, don't look back.
[02:34:24.662 --> 02:34:29.807]  And particularly in trials where you have convictions, those are extraordinarily difficult.
[02:34:29.807 --> 02:34:32.089]  You get to know people very well over a 2-3 year period.
[02:34:32.549 --> 02:34:32.829]  That's right.
[02:35:02.549 --> 02:35:05.932]  They're kind of shocked by that and they kind of pause for 10 or 15 minutes.
[02:35:05.932 --> 02:35:06.992]  I mean, but that's what it is.
[02:35:06.992 --> 02:35:08.253]  Trials are combat.
[02:35:08.253 --> 02:35:13.557]  And I tell my clients, some of them really want to charge forward to trial and there's too much machismo going on.
[02:35:13.557 --> 02:35:16.159]  And I say, look, a couple of things I want to mention.
[02:35:16.159 --> 02:35:20.542]  Number one, there's going to be blood everywhere and we're going to measure the victors by the buckets of blood.
[02:35:20.542 --> 02:35:22.244]  That's reality at trials.
[02:35:22.924 --> 02:35:25.887]  And secondly, I always get to go home after the trials.
[02:35:25.887 --> 02:35:27.928]  So you have to have a sense of humility.
[02:35:27.928 --> 02:35:30.991]  It's better to win the war strategically by never getting to the battlefield.
[02:35:30.991 --> 02:35:31.972]  Oh, no question.
[02:35:31.972 --> 02:35:38.838]  And of course, we do a lot of representation that nobody sees, doesn't make the news, where we're helping people out of audits, collection, criminal investigations.
[02:35:38.838 --> 02:35:41.420]  Just letting the IRS know, hey, go pick on somebody else.
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:51.528]  Well, I think there is an element to that because, you know, we practice aggressively but collegially and professionally and I think my counterparts in the government that are opposite me respect that.
[02:35:51.528 --> 02:35:56.292]  So yeah, I think we do help our clients just by entering the fray and solving problems rather than just trial work.
[02:35:56.292 --> 02:35:58.013]  We do a ton of other stuff that nobody sees.
[02:35:58.902 --> 02:36:05.105]  Yeah, I've noticed that because I've got a really good lawyer here in town, and it just immediately gets people's attention.
[02:36:05.105 --> 02:36:08.987]  A lot of times, pretty big operation stuff comes up from time to time.
[02:36:08.987 --> 02:36:15.190]  Immediately, if you have a small lawyer, I mean, you know that, but for the audience, I'm just telling them that, that it really does matter.
[02:36:15.490 --> 02:36:16.251]  Well, it does matter.
[02:36:16.251 --> 02:36:24.697]  And the other thing is that we're not, you know, increasingly a huge percentage of federal criminal indictments are resolved by plea agreement.
[02:36:24.697 --> 02:36:28.400]  And there's a very, there's a huge coercion from the sentencing guidelines.
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:31.282]  I mean, you've got a businessman, he's indicted for tax.
[02:36:31.282 --> 02:36:35.226]  If he gets dinged with a felony count at trial, he does seven to eight years.
[02:36:35.226 --> 02:36:37.547]  Maybe the plea's 18 months, 24 months.
[02:36:37.547 --> 02:36:40.330]  So this has a hugely coercive effect to get pleas.
[02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:47.358]  Um, now when we come to a case, we do trials, we're not afraid of trials, and we win a lot of our trials.
[02:36:47.358 --> 02:36:52.625]  So immediately, our government counterparts understand, okay, this isn't going to be a bag man plea case.
[02:36:52.625 --> 02:36:53.846]  This case could go to trial.
[02:36:53.846 --> 02:36:56.149]  And they start counting their cost and their risk.
[02:36:56.730 --> 02:36:57.610]  You know, what's the problem?
[02:36:57.610 --> 02:37:07.715]  Yeah, they'd rather feed on a bunch of innocent old ladies, ruin their lives, grab wedding rings off their fingers, you know, just let them commit suicide, than actually go up against people that'll fight back.
[02:37:07.715 --> 02:37:08.155]  Absolutely.
[02:37:08.155 --> 02:37:09.776]  They operate like muggers.
[02:37:09.776 --> 02:37:12.117]  Well, easy targets, easy targets.
[02:37:12.117 --> 02:37:19.741]  When you have a predator type of system, those predators will go after the easy targets, because it's the path of least resistance.
[02:37:20.441 --> 02:37:27.102]  Well, you know what you're talking about, because I've just experienced this 17 years on air and getting out there and doing stuff, you know, up against these crooks.
[02:37:27.102 --> 02:37:28.283]  And that's how I see it.
[02:37:28.283 --> 02:37:33.984]  Some of them are Dudley Do-Rights, from my experience, who are stupid and are made fun of by the higher-ups.
[02:37:33.984 --> 02:37:35.044]  That's really how this works.
[02:37:35.044 --> 02:37:39.045]  But these are just criminals on the top that know exactly what they're doing.
[02:37:39.045 --> 02:37:43.526]  And I don't know how they sleep at night, wrecking the families, doing the things they've done to people.
[02:37:43.806 --> 02:37:49.011]  Yeah, you know, the rationalization justification for putting people in prison for double digits over tax.
[02:37:49.011 --> 02:37:55.436]  By the way, we're the only country of the so-called civilized industrial nations that has criminal tax at all.
[02:37:55.436 --> 02:37:56.697]  Criminal tax is the exception.
[02:37:56.697 --> 02:38:04.224]  Now, Russia, former Soviet Union, Russia, North Korea, China, there's a wonderful series of countries that have a criminal tax regime.
[02:38:04.224 --> 02:38:05.565]  That's not good company.
[02:38:05.565 --> 02:38:08.247]  We should not have criminal tax in the United States.
[02:38:08.247 --> 02:38:10.709]  Oh, that's my next question for you, and Joe, pop in any time.
[02:38:12.554 --> 02:38:16.878]  You know, they grab the kids in Russia, the orphans, train them to be tax enforcers, and they beat you up as well.
[02:38:16.878 --> 02:38:18.859]  So I guess it's the only country worse than us.
[02:38:18.859 --> 02:38:20.040]  Well, I mean, you're the expert.
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:21.561]  Is Russia worse than the U.S.?
[02:38:21.561 --> 02:38:24.924]  Yeah, well, the Russian tax police, that's a whole different world.
[02:38:24.924 --> 02:38:26.525]  Really a mafia, I mean.
[02:38:26.525 --> 02:38:26.966]  It is.
[02:38:26.966 --> 02:38:32.330]  But the fact is, is that civilized nations, truly civilized nations, do not criminalize something like tax.
[02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:36.614]  If you owe the government money, the government has plenty of mechanisms to get that money from you.
[02:38:37.234 --> 02:38:42.138]  But to put people in prison for owing tax liability or not filing the proper form.
[02:38:42.138 --> 02:38:44.960]  North Korea, China, Russia, Nazi Germany, not a good company.
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:46.782]  Well, you know, that's the company we're in.
[02:38:46.782 --> 02:38:50.345]  And I argued with David K. Johnson from the New York Times about that.
[02:38:50.345 --> 02:38:55.369]  He was appalled by my idea that criminal tax demonstrated we were uncivilized.
[02:38:55.369 --> 02:38:56.670]  Well, it does.
[02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:59.272]  And I've argued with Nathan Huckman, former Assistant U.S.
[02:38:59.272 --> 02:39:01.314]  Attorney General, Tax Division for the United States.
[02:39:01.314 --> 02:39:02.495]  He was appalled by that notion.
[02:39:02.955 --> 02:39:03.796]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:39:03.796 --> 02:39:07.858]  I want to go back to the Wesley Snipe because we got cut off by a break, then we went off in another direction.
[02:39:07.858 --> 02:39:09.499]  But finish up on this point.
[02:39:09.499 --> 02:39:29.713]  Is all the criminality and government coming out in triplicate and the fact that the IRS is giving out fake ID numbers and letting people steal and get fake returns, the illegals and all the rest of this, and then even blaming citizens when those get attached to Social Security numbers and using the fraud the IRS engaged in as a way to go grab citizens' bank accounts and things?
[02:39:30.453 --> 02:39:39.481]  I mean, is it making it easier for you to do your job as people begin to realize also that the ultra-rich basically have exempted themselves as well?
[02:39:39.481 --> 02:39:41.763]  I think there is a general awareness.
[02:39:41.763 --> 02:39:45.366]  You know, and I'm not going to do an explicitly political thing.
[02:39:45.366 --> 02:39:46.627]  I like dissenters.
[02:39:46.627 --> 02:39:48.149]  I want more dissenters in America.
[02:39:48.149 --> 02:39:49.910]  I want more people that are going to rock the boat.
[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:56.957]  So the Tea Party movement for me was a good thing because it showed that there could be a vibrant, robust political movement that wasn't party-centric.
[02:39:57.817 --> 02:39:58.678]  I don't
[02:40:12.534 --> 02:40:15.615]  Congress's popularity is down around 9%.
[02:40:15.615 --> 02:40:18.036]  It's really low.
[02:40:18.036 --> 02:40:19.837]  These are huge problems.
[02:40:19.837 --> 02:40:29.280]  I mean, once you lose the consent of the governed, you don't have a legitimate... You either go back to freedom or you go to North Korea.
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:30.221]  Absolutely.
[02:40:30.221 --> 02:40:31.341]  And that's where we're treading.
[02:40:31.341 --> 02:40:40.845]  But I believe that there's an increasing awakening in Americans regarding suspicion of the system, suspicion of statements by government.
[02:40:41.405 --> 02:40:42.605]  And I think that's positive.
[02:40:42.605 --> 02:40:43.986]  I have hope, you know.
[02:40:43.986 --> 02:40:47.907]  I have hope that more Americans will recognize that these are political problems.
[02:40:47.907 --> 02:40:49.607]  They're not necessarily legal ones.
[02:40:49.607 --> 02:40:50.868]  We don't need more legislation.
[02:40:50.868 --> 02:40:52.508]  We need less.
[02:40:52.508 --> 02:40:55.489]  And they need to get out there and start voting for people who are going to be truly independent.
[02:40:55.489 --> 02:40:56.209]  Well, I agree.
[02:40:56.209 --> 02:41:00.651]  Anybody that isn't in the cookie cutter mold is the way to go, just because it shakes up the system.
[02:41:00.651 --> 02:41:04.232]  This type of tyranny depends on a very smooth road to get away.
[02:41:04.932 --> 02:41:05.832]  You know, with the crimes.
[02:41:05.832 --> 02:41:06.573]  Let me bring this up.
[02:41:06.573 --> 02:41:10.894]  I also see this endless demonization of defense attorneys by media, by culture.
[02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:12.534]  Oh, they're the scum, they're the trash.
[02:41:12.534 --> 02:41:17.836]  From my experience, everybody deserves a good defense because government is the big danger.
[02:41:17.836 --> 02:41:20.757]  It's what killed more people in history than anything else.
[02:41:20.757 --> 02:41:22.837]  262 million in the last century.
[02:41:22.837 --> 02:41:25.658]  University of Hawaii did a study on democide.
[02:41:25.658 --> 02:41:27.119]  It's the big danger.
[02:41:27.119 --> 02:41:27.879]  And I have found...
[02:41:28.439 --> 02:41:34.561]  That it's the political prosecutors, because there's good prosecutors too that will go to the wall to really get bad guys.
[02:41:34.561 --> 02:41:36.862]  But more and more, they just make deals and let them out.
[02:41:36.862 --> 02:41:43.163]  They want, I notice, these prosecutors to hammer down good people that are just trying to live their lives.
[02:41:43.163 --> 02:41:46.464]  And for me, that's why I thank God for the defense attorneys.
[02:41:46.464 --> 02:41:51.346]  And I see this move to try to demonize defense attorneys, quote, getting bad guys off.
[02:41:52.086 --> 02:41:53.447]  And letting it go to courts.
[02:41:53.447 --> 02:41:57.468]  Boy, if they do that, they've already neutered the grand jury.
[02:41:57.468 --> 02:41:59.789]  All we're left with is the cartridge box.
[02:41:59.789 --> 02:42:07.692]  Yeah, there's a lot of pandering going on from mainstream media about defense attorneys and evil defense attorneys.
[02:42:07.692 --> 02:42:10.493]  Seems to be a general program of defamation.
[02:42:11.734 --> 02:42:19.481]  The fact is is that in the criminal defense realm we're accountable in open court on the record more so than any of the civil attorneys are.
[02:42:19.481 --> 02:42:29.149]  They can play games with discovery and engage in litigation thuggery while we're always accountable on the record every 30 to 60 days for what we're doing and how we're doing it.
[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:34.013]  My experience with the Federal Criminal Defense Bar is generally very positive.
[02:42:34.013 --> 02:42:35.595]  There's exceptions to that.
[02:42:35.595 --> 02:42:39.458]  And I noticed you mentioned something, Alex, and I want to make a point about this.
[02:42:39.458 --> 02:42:42.460]  I know some really fine lawyers and fine men at U.S.
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:51.448]  Department of Justice Tax Division that I've been opposite in cases and local prosecutors who believe in what they're doing, who follow the rules,
[02:42:52.048 --> 02:42:57.211]  Who don't violate the Constitution and laws of the United States respecting discovery to the defense.
[02:42:57.211 --> 02:43:07.256]  And really, one of the things that really bothers me is all of those good men and women that are actually inside the system and are behaving with integrity, they get stroked with all of this massive misconduct.
[02:43:07.256 --> 02:43:08.077]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:43:08.077 --> 02:43:15.521]  The good people get out historically, and then the criminals create little armies that then expand and then take over.
[02:43:15.521 --> 02:43:17.762]  Yes, when bad conduct is incentived,
[02:43:18.422 --> 02:43:24.405]  Rather than disincentive, it does drive out the ethical and the good and the men and women that want to do a public service.
[02:43:24.405 --> 02:43:25.826]  Because there's bad guys out there.
[02:43:25.826 --> 02:43:27.507]  We live in a dangerous world.
[02:43:27.507 --> 02:43:31.189]  And I believe in law and order, even though I'm a libertarian, but I believe in law and order.
[02:43:31.189 --> 02:43:32.650]  And I'm an objective moralist.
[02:43:32.650 --> 02:43:35.351]  And that means law and order and the government first.
[02:43:35.351 --> 02:43:36.192]  Absolutely.
[02:43:36.192 --> 02:43:37.472]  The government is the great teacher.
[02:43:37.472 --> 02:43:38.433]  We learn by them.
[02:43:38.433 --> 02:43:42.875]  If the government breaks the rules and gets away with impunity, what does that teach the citizens?
[02:43:42.875 --> 02:43:43.836]  Fish rots from the head.
[02:43:44.076 --> 02:43:44.877]  Absolutely.
[02:43:44.877 --> 02:43:46.678]  Some things roll downhill.
[02:43:46.678 --> 02:43:47.578]  Joe, you've been sitting here.
[02:43:47.578 --> 02:43:49.039]  This guy's amazing.
[02:43:49.039 --> 02:43:50.240]  I've seen him on TV before.
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:52.582]  I was sitting here looking, I see this guy on television.
[02:43:52.582 --> 02:43:53.362]  He's impressive.
[02:43:53.362 --> 02:43:57.305]  I mean, we know why he's one of the best lawyers out there, I guess.
[02:43:57.305 --> 02:43:59.126]  How did you snag this guy?
[02:43:59.126 --> 02:44:00.247]  Because you're a good guy, too.
[02:44:00.247 --> 02:44:09.453]  Well, a month or two after I resigned from the IRS in 99, really right around the same time that you first interviewed me, I get a call from this Bob Bernhoff from Milwaukee.
[02:44:09.453 --> 02:44:11.394]  And, you know, I was like a deer caught in the headlights.
[02:44:11.394 --> 02:44:12.015]  I just wanted to
[02:44:12.774 --> 02:44:18.980]  Make a living to support my family and leave the IRS behind, but people were calling me and wanting to get in contact with me.
[02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:29.250]  So that's when I first met Bob and had no idea the extent of the monster that was out there eating people up.
[02:44:31.492 --> 02:44:43.879]  It helped me to understand that and then I became involved in it and of course that's what led to the IRS, you know, really taking a disliking to me after I left because I was trying to get into that apparatus.
[02:44:43.879 --> 02:44:45.720]  Actually, I was not trying to get into the apparatus.
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:48.741]  People wanted me to come in and help the effort.
[02:44:48.741 --> 02:44:49.862]  No, I know you were drug into it.
[02:44:49.862 --> 02:44:55.125]  I didn't want... I had enough of the IRS, frankly, but... Because I remember at first I was trying to get you back on the radio and stuff.
[02:44:55.125 --> 02:44:56.465]  You're like, I don't know right now.
[02:44:56.465 --> 02:44:58.566]  I'm just... I might just be a CPA.
[02:44:58.566 --> 02:44:58.867]  I might...
[02:44:59.887 --> 02:45:03.349]  Well, you've been with me since the beginning, Alex.
[02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:08.533]  I mean, I was just... It was like March or... Was it Media Bypass you were first in?
[02:45:09.079 --> 02:45:09.499]  Yeah.
[02:45:09.499 --> 02:45:10.920]  Pat Shannon called me.
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:11.520]  That's right.
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:13.281]  We need to get Pat Shannon back on.
[02:45:13.281 --> 02:45:17.743]  He was on my radio show at Oklahoma City being a staged event.
[02:45:17.743 --> 02:45:26.326]  And he said, hey, I'm doing a story on this, you know, Treasury agent who investigated things and woke things up.
[02:45:26.326 --> 02:45:27.186]  You want to talk to him.
[02:45:27.186 --> 02:45:28.627]  I said, OK, well, what's his number?
[02:45:28.627 --> 02:45:33.889]  And so I had gone out and interviewed you by the time his newspaper article or magazine article came out.
[02:45:33.889 --> 02:45:35.210]  Now that my memory gets refreshed.
[02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:35.830]  Very exciting.
[02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:38.333]  Yeah, that was the tax issue for 1999.
[02:45:38.333 --> 02:45:40.014]  But you've now been through the fire, my friend.
[02:45:40.014 --> 02:45:45.000]  Well, thanks to, unfortunately, you don't, you're not innocent until proven guilty.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.644]  You need to find someone who can communicate your innocence.
[02:45:48.644 --> 02:45:55.792]  And I've just been blessed to have Mr. Bernhoft, Mr. Dick Stein, people that could communicate to the jury.
[02:45:56.903 --> 02:46:03.465]  No, the government really doesn't deserve that reputation for honesty and integrity that you think they have.
[02:46:03.465 --> 02:46:06.846]  Open up your mind and listen to the, and look at the evidence.
[02:46:06.846 --> 02:46:08.306]  And that's what it took.
[02:46:08.306 --> 02:46:09.786]  And they acquitted me.
[02:46:09.786 --> 02:46:13.287]  Mr. Bernhoff, let me ask you a question on this front.
[02:46:13.287 --> 02:46:19.869]  Can you bring in, let's say you were doing a trial right now of another agent, a whistleblower, somebody like
[02:46:21.758 --> 02:46:23.600]  Our guest here today.
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:24.501]  What?
[02:46:24.501 --> 02:46:29.766]  Could you bring in the fact that John Corzine was allowed to take billions of dollars and say he doesn't know where it went?
[02:46:29.766 --> 02:46:33.150]  And then now they admit he really did give it to another bank.
[02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:38.816]  I mean, could you bring up, hey, the big bankers, they get to keep billions, but he hasn't done anything and he's in trouble.
[02:46:38.816 --> 02:46:39.937]  Or is that not admissible?
[02:46:40.157 --> 02:46:40.817]  No, it's not.
[02:46:40.817 --> 02:46:42.959]  You know, that stuff doesn't come in now.
[02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:49.143]  There's an old Supreme Court case that says that in closing argument, defense attorneys have to be given wings to soar.
[02:46:49.143 --> 02:46:56.728]  That's a great quote, and it's true, but you can only bring in testimony and evidence that's going to be relevant to the charges that tend to disprove them.
[02:46:56.728 --> 02:47:00.951]  We can bring in impeachment evidence against government witnesses, and we can certainly do that.
[02:47:00.951 --> 02:47:07.675]  But you say this same government lets John Corzine take billions that disappear, but then they want to send him to jail when he hasn't taken a single cent.
[02:47:08.255 --> 02:47:10.917]  That can be done, and that can be done in closing argument.
[02:47:10.917 --> 02:47:14.520]  Closing argument in Joe's case was very, very aggressive.
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:19.003]  And I mean, there was talk of jackbooted thugs and all sorts of interesting things.
[02:47:19.003 --> 02:47:20.304]  But no, you can do that.
[02:47:20.304 --> 02:47:22.125]  Testimony and evidence is one thing.
[02:47:22.125 --> 02:47:24.467]  A closing argument, you can draw parallels.
[02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:36.255]  You can put it to the jury that they've got a decision to make, that there's a double standard operating here, and that the government is not behaving correctly towards your client, the defendant who's in the block and stands to go to prison for 15, 16 years.
[02:47:37.236 --> 02:47:39.398]  Finishing up with Wesley Snipes, we've got a final segment.
[02:47:39.398 --> 02:47:40.720]  You guys can talk about whatever you'd like.
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:44.864]  I'm just in awe here, hearing all of this.
[02:47:44.864 --> 02:47:49.789]  You had gotten to the point of how they were trying to try the case in the media and claiming he'd run from justice.
[02:47:49.789 --> 02:47:53.152]  And I remember right away in the news, you guys went, this is propaganda.
[02:47:53.152 --> 02:47:54.874]  He was always intending to be here.
[02:47:54.874 --> 02:47:55.655]  Here he is.
[02:47:55.655 --> 02:47:55.815]  Right.
[02:47:57.176 --> 02:48:03.781]  Whatever jury was finally in that box in the courtroom, and I'll tell you something, Judge William Terrell Hodges was an excellent judge.
[02:48:03.781 --> 02:48:12.308]  He's very hard-nosed, but I'll tell you what, he was a great evidence man, a great evidence judge, and he gave us a fair trial.
[02:48:12.308 --> 02:48:21.156]  Now, we fought for that fair trial through motion practice, and there's a certain thing that happens between advocates and federal judges who preside over particularly criminal trials.
[02:48:21.676 --> 02:48:24.778]  And you either obtain a respect for each other or you don't.
[02:48:24.778 --> 02:48:30.841]  But nobody gets any respect in the federal criminal process by not being aggressive and advocating zealously for your client.
[02:48:30.841 --> 02:48:36.384]  But in the Snipes case, you've got to get people to reject that propaganda, that misinformation.
[02:48:36.384 --> 02:48:40.506]  And we consistently said, look, 12 people are going to be in that jury box.
[02:48:40.506 --> 02:48:47.049]  And they're the ones who are going to hear actual testimony and evidence, not rumor, not innuendo, not propaganda.
[02:48:47.049 --> 02:48:48.670]  And those are the themes that we beat.
[02:48:48.670 --> 02:48:49.731]  We drilled those themes.
[02:48:50.231 --> 02:48:50.831]  And we had to.
[02:48:50.831 --> 02:48:58.734]  I did a walk and talk with Steve Barrett, a great reporter from Orlando, a TV station down there, and we pummeled back against this propaganda.
[02:48:58.734 --> 02:49:08.758]  If you don't do that, those jurors are going to go in there with absolute misinformation in their minds, and they won't pay attention to the actual truth, the actual testimony and evidence, and then you're in trouble.
[02:49:08.758 --> 02:49:10.479]  And that's when you lose, and that's when you get convicted.
[02:49:10.999 --> 02:49:14.622]  And that's what would have happened down there, no question about it.
[02:49:14.622 --> 02:49:18.025]  The other thing is, you know, there were some discovery violations in the Snipes case.
[02:49:18.025 --> 02:49:20.307]  Those never became really public.
[02:49:20.307 --> 02:49:23.009]  We were really put to it by the prosecution team.
[02:49:23.009 --> 02:49:30.195]  They were revealing sometimes hundreds of pages of crucial documents the day after a particular trial day at 5-5-30.
[02:49:30.195 --> 02:49:34.298]  And we had to spend all night mastering that material so we could step up the next morning.
[02:49:34.298 --> 02:49:40.483]  It was a very, very difficult... They were hoping you'd be lazy and go back to the hotel and get a scotch, but you'd have to stay up all night.
[02:49:40.663 --> 02:49:43.085]  I'll tell you something, people have a misapprehension of how trials work.
[02:49:43.085 --> 02:49:44.926]  Once you go, we call it going into the trial hole.
[02:49:44.926 --> 02:49:49.589]  You go into the trial hole, you are off the grid, nobody, you don't even know- If you're a winner.
[02:49:49.589 --> 02:49:50.349]  Absolutely.
[02:49:50.349 --> 02:49:55.533]  You've got to be prepared to get a couple of hours of sleep a night, take it seriously, and the work is extraordinary.
[02:49:55.533 --> 02:49:56.634]  Nobody sees that.
[02:49:56.634 --> 02:49:58.295]  That's all that work that goes behind the scenes.
[02:49:58.295 --> 02:49:59.876]  Joe can testify to that.
[02:49:59.876 --> 02:50:02.918]  How many nights- And the defendant better jump in and paddle along.
[02:50:02.918 --> 02:50:10.043]  That's another thing, people think high-powered lawyers, you know, cause the media acts like they just show up in a helicopter and win cause they're- No!
[02:50:10.823 --> 02:50:12.906]  It's a bunch of, it's a real work.
[02:50:12.906 --> 02:50:14.208]  And some of it's extremely tedious.
[02:50:14.208 --> 02:50:18.152]  You know, you've got a case, the Snipes case said over a million pages of discovery documents.
[02:50:18.152 --> 02:50:20.876]  You don't master those documents, you're going to lose.
[02:50:20.876 --> 02:50:24.420]  And that's the sort of paging through page after page after page.
[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:25.542]  That's where the nuggets come from.
[02:50:25.802 --> 02:50:29.846]  Yeah, I think you had, what, 58 boxes of discovery?
[02:50:29.846 --> 02:50:31.507]  A couple hundred thousand pages?
[02:50:31.507 --> 02:50:34.190]  So that's the sort of work that goes on behind the scenes.
[02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:41.476]  Trial success is a function of knowledge, skill, experience, but most importantly, mastery of the facts and the documents.
[02:50:41.476 --> 02:50:48.543]  If you're not willing to get dirty, roll up your sleeves with your team and your client, like Joe, who helped us through his discovery, and drill down night after
[02:50:48.643 --> 02:50:50.185]  Well, that sounds like life in general.
[02:50:50.185 --> 02:50:53.710]  I mean, the system counts on us just being lazy, lying the surface.
[02:50:53.710 --> 02:50:54.531]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:54.531 --> 02:50:56.995]  Final incredible segment with both our guests.
[02:50:56.995 --> 02:50:58.497]  I'm Alex Jones at FullWars.com.
[02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:03.380]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:06.321]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:51:06.321 --> 02:51:10.482]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[02:51:10.482 --> 02:51:16.304]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[02:51:16.304 --> 02:51:19.284]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:51:19.284 --> 02:51:25.886]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[02:51:26.346 --> 02:51:32.671]  The officer told me to go to EZArmor.com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[02:51:32.671 --> 02:51:38.935]  EZArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[02:51:38.935 --> 02:51:44.620]  I was surprised at how little EZArmor costs and I installed EZArmor in about 30 minutes.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:46.822]  Visit EasyArmor.com.
[02:51:46.822 --> 02:51:50.406]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R dot com.

[02:54:16.644 --> 02:54:26.389]  We're ending this segment, this interview with a good song, Johnny Cash, when the man comes around.
[02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:27.870]  When the man comes around.
[02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:29.491]  Robert G. Bernhoft, probably the most
[02:54:36.158 --> 02:54:38.560]  I mean, I can't think of anybody more preeminent than you when it comes to tax stuff.
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:39.621]  It's an honor to have you.
[02:54:39.621 --> 02:54:43.985]  And I can't think of somebody more honorable and preeminent when it comes to standing up for what's right.
[02:54:43.985 --> 02:54:45.926]  They ought to make a movie about your life.
[02:54:45.926 --> 02:54:56.875]  Joe Bannister, agentfortruth.com, agentfortruth.com, and again, bernhoftlaw.com, B-E-R-N-H-O-F-T-L-A-W-T-D-O-T-C-O-M.
[02:54:56.875 --> 02:55:00.158]  We'll make sure both these get linked up at infowars.com today.
[02:55:00.158 --> 02:55:04.782]  And if you're a radio listener on XM or on our 100 plus stations, by tomorrow,
[02:55:05.382 --> 02:55:09.848]  We will have this up on YouTube for everybody, not just people watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:55:09.848 --> 02:55:13.212]  And so please get this video and get it out to everybody.
[02:55:13.212 --> 02:55:17.357]  That's a question I have for you, Robert.
[02:55:17.357 --> 02:55:19.040]  When does the man come to town?
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:22.604]  Because earlier you said we're treading water between North Korea and Liberty.
[02:55:23.385 --> 02:55:24.306]  We're going to choose one or the other.
[02:55:24.306 --> 02:55:29.594]  We're going to go back the other direction towards freedom, or we're going to go down the black hole.
[02:55:29.594 --> 02:55:31.596]  I mean, is the man going to come around?
[02:55:31.596 --> 02:55:34.781]  People are waking up, but the system is deciding to go with tyranny.
[02:55:34.781 --> 02:55:37.625]  How do you see this with your considerable gravitas?
[02:55:37.625 --> 02:55:38.626]  How do you see this ending?
[02:55:38.626 --> 02:55:39.868]  I mean, what's your gut tell you?
[02:55:42.624 --> 02:55:44.326]  That's a heavy and loaded question.
[02:55:44.326 --> 02:55:46.468]  It's a great one.
[02:55:46.468 --> 02:55:56.941]  In my sphere, putting aside from politics, if we don't stop, if we don't stem this epidemic of investigative and prosecutorial misconduct, we're in deep trouble.
[02:55:57.481 --> 02:56:08.047]  If our federal criminal process continues to be debauched by concealment and deceit, ethics violations, constitutional violations, it's over for the American Republic.
[02:56:08.047 --> 02:56:13.770]  I mean, we used to be sort of like the lighthouse on the hill, the example of great judicial systems.
[02:56:13.770 --> 02:56:19.554]  The whole world looked to the United States for our rules, our evidence, our procedure, our process, our jury trials.
[02:56:20.134 --> 02:56:20.774]  We're losing that.
[02:56:20.774 --> 02:56:22.415]  We're becoming a laughing stock.
[02:56:22.415 --> 02:56:28.216]  Yeah, the great Americans and look at, they can't even get a fair trial for a former sitting United States Senator.
[02:56:28.216 --> 02:56:29.736]  If we don't stem it, if we don't stem it.
[02:56:29.736 --> 02:56:32.477]  Look at how they put that governor in jail in Alabama for no reason.
[02:56:32.477 --> 02:56:33.177]  Yeah.
[02:56:33.177 --> 02:56:34.877]  That was admitted a fraud.
[02:56:34.877 --> 02:56:42.319]  And the amazing thing about the former Senator Steven's prosecution, and there's thousands of these cases, that one gets all the publicity because he was a former U.S.
[02:56:42.319 --> 02:56:43.279]  Senator.
[02:56:43.279 --> 02:56:45.820]  And that shifted the balance of power in the United States Senate.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:54.504]  But when you think about the Stevens case, that was prosecuted by the highest level of Department of Justice in Washington, the Office of Public Integrity, OPR.
[02:56:54.504 --> 02:56:58.846]  They couldn't get that right, and they want to say that lying AUSAs, Assistant U.S.
[02:56:58.846 --> 02:57:02.688]  Attorneys, really understand the discovery rules.
[02:57:02.688 --> 02:57:10.712]  This needs to stop, and responsible prosecutors are for changing the rules and disciplining prosecutors who do not follow the rules.
[02:57:11.252 --> 02:57:13.134]  Federal judges are getting sick and tired of this.
[02:57:13.134 --> 02:57:16.716]  Well, what about when it comes out that we've got to do five minutes overdrive.
[02:57:16.716 --> 02:57:18.618]  You can do it just to finish up this little addendum we have.
[02:57:18.618 --> 02:57:22.080]  Kind of like, you know, that little extra reserve tank.
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:22.221]  What?
[02:57:23.263 --> 02:57:25.465]  How do they get away with this?
[02:57:25.465 --> 02:57:29.268]  Because more and more it's just coming out that the sky's the limit.
[02:57:29.268 --> 02:57:31.590]  I think they're doing it on purpose, basically.
[02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:34.573]  Well, the incentives are to win at all costs.
[02:57:34.573 --> 02:57:38.216]  And when you have an incentive to do that, people start breaking the rules.
[02:57:38.216 --> 02:57:43.841]  And then they start becoming rewarded for breaking the rules with conviction rates, promotions, and the things that they want.
[02:57:44.581 --> 02:57:49.226]  Um, and then they recognize that they never get caught, and if they do get caught, they never get punished.
[02:57:49.226 --> 02:57:56.612]  Well, you saw the case in Williamson County, it's a famous one, where they knew the guy really didn't do it, but, and they suppressed evidence, and they tried to keep the guy in prison.
[02:57:56.612 --> 02:58:04.920]  I mean, how does somebody try to put in, people who aren't even criminals, it's bad enough to set up an ex-con, and, and, and send them away, but well, they shouldn't have been out.
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:07.002]  But now it's just set up totally innocent people?
[02:58:07.222 --> 02:58:16.029]  Yeah, you look at the prosecutor in the non-rape Duke La Crosse case, for example, which, of course, no rape occurred, and that was all politics by that prosecutor.
[02:58:16.029 --> 02:58:23.095]  He's the only prosecutor that's been meaningfully disciplined for massive government misconduct in a very, very long time.
[02:58:23.095 --> 02:58:33.643]  So what happens is, even if the judge makes what's called a judicial referral of a prosecutor to the Bar Association, where that prosecutor has his license, the bars don't discipline the prosecutors.
[02:58:33.823 --> 02:58:38.089]  Tell you what, back in one minute of five minute overdrive, I've got to hear more about the lacrosse case.
[02:58:38.089 --> 02:58:42.495]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.495 --> 02:58:45.740]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.363 --> 02:58:54.844]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[02:58:54.844 --> 02:59:00.427]  It is a nanocatalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[02:59:00.427 --> 02:59:04.128]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[02:59:04.128 --> 02:59:10.431]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.

[02:59:25.082 --> 02:59:31.828]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[02:59:32.228 --> 02:59:34.789]  No silver solution is better or safer.

[02:59:55.378 --> 02:59:58.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:02.159 --> 03:00:08.091]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:08.091 --> 03:00:10.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:29.771]  Robert G. Bernhoft has been our guest with Joe Bannister for the last hour.
[03:00:29.771 --> 03:00:35.713]  He had Max Keiser on earlier, breaking down the financial meltdown that's happening as a fraud in government.
[03:00:35.713 --> 03:00:42.636]  And the big mega banks, BernhoftLaw.com is the excellent website of probably the top tax lawyer out there.
[03:00:42.636 --> 03:00:45.597]  And then we also have Joe Bannister's website.
[03:00:45.597 --> 03:00:48.638]  You have several, you have several websites, don't you?
[03:00:49.578 --> 03:00:55.121]  Agentfortruth.com, JosephBannister.com, and FreedomAboveFortune.com.
[03:00:55.121 --> 03:00:57.623]  And that's the original on FreedomAboveFortune.com.
[03:00:57.623 --> 03:01:02.365]  Okay, we've only got four minutes left, overdrive here.
[03:01:02.365 --> 03:01:05.807]  Finishing up with other points that you think are important for people that we forgot to get to.
[03:01:09.795 --> 03:01:13.356]  You know, you asked me a question before, Alex, about where I see things going.
[03:01:13.356 --> 03:01:17.457]  And that's always a tough thing to reach into the crystal ball and see it.
[03:01:17.457 --> 03:01:27.940]  But I'm really hopeful that particularly the young generations, I see my children, I see some of my age peers' children, they pay attention, they think more critically.
[03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:31.461]  I think we had a couple of lost generations.
[03:01:31.461 --> 03:01:34.482]  I'm hopeful that this new generation is paying attention.
[03:01:35.402 --> 03:01:36.963]  I know they are.
[03:01:36.963 --> 03:01:38.464]  I talked to my children's friends.
[03:01:38.464 --> 03:01:40.185]  These kids are engaged.
[03:01:40.185 --> 03:01:44.727]  I'm encouraged by all the youth that are supporting Ron Paul and backing Dr. Paul.
[03:01:44.727 --> 03:01:50.911]  And I know there's been some controversies with that, but the bottom line is I don't care which political tack they want to take.
[03:01:50.911 --> 03:02:00.856]  I want these kids to get out there, get awake, pay attention, and start holding people accountable in your local, your city, your county, your state government, your national government.
[03:02:00.976 --> 03:02:02.258]  By the way, the system, you're right.
[03:02:02.258 --> 03:02:03.860]  You've got your finger on the pulse.
[03:02:03.860 --> 03:02:08.745]  They have been bemoaning that this new generation, 20 or under, really don't trust the government.
[03:02:08.745 --> 03:02:11.168]  And they don't like abortion, even though we push it.
[03:02:11.168 --> 03:02:12.270]  And they don't like corruption.
[03:02:12.270 --> 03:02:13.050]  They like guns.
[03:02:13.050 --> 03:02:14.072]  They like freedom.
[03:02:14.072 --> 03:02:19.819]  Yeah, they're rebelling against their control freak, North Korea-loving, weirdo, corporate commie parents.
[03:02:20.279 --> 03:02:22.723]  And they're sick and tired of what they're watching on the TV.
[03:02:22.723 --> 03:02:30.513]  And that's why they're streaming to shows like this to get unbiased, different viewpoints.
[03:02:30.513 --> 03:02:32.356]  My daughters, they won't even watch the nightly news.
[03:02:32.356 --> 03:02:35.580]  They understand that that's absolute propaganda and corrupt propaganda at that.
[03:02:36.081 --> 03:02:37.362]  So I have hope for America.
[03:02:37.362 --> 03:02:43.026]  I think this generation that's coming up right now, between 15 and 25, they're going to make a difference.
[03:02:43.026 --> 03:02:56.555]  And it's our job, we're all older than they are, it's our job to set some leadership examples and give these kids something they can sink their teeth into, get politically active, so that they know they don't have to become, you know, desperate and weary by the fight.
[03:02:56.555 --> 03:02:57.816]  We need to give them hope.
[03:02:57.816 --> 03:02:59.156]  The fight's exciting!
[03:02:59.156 --> 03:02:59.497]  It is.
[03:02:59.497 --> 03:03:00.677]  Doing the right thing's exciting.
[03:03:00.677 --> 03:03:01.138]  It sure is.
[03:03:01.138 --> 03:03:03.499]  Robert G. Bernhoff, let me ask you this question in closing.
[03:03:03.499 --> 03:03:05.501]  We know what woke Joe Bannister up.
[03:03:06.561 --> 03:03:07.342]  What woke you up?
[03:03:07.342 --> 03:03:09.302]  How'd you get on this path?
[03:03:09.302 --> 03:03:12.604]  I've always had a problem with authority, Alex.
[03:03:12.604 --> 03:03:14.525]  And I think that's true.
[03:03:14.525 --> 03:03:21.228]  This goes way back when I just... I really despise and have a hatred for... Bullies?
[03:03:21.228 --> 03:03:30.772]  For bullies and for people who claim to have power that don't have the authority that's supposed to be behind the power, victimizing and abusing people who can't fight back.
[03:03:30.772 --> 03:03:31.932]  It's always been a problem for me.
[03:03:31.932 --> 03:03:35.314]  I think that's one of the reasons I'm motivated to do the work I do and
[03:03:35.994 --> 03:03:37.195]  So that's how it works for me.
[03:03:37.195 --> 03:03:38.636]  You're stopping bad people.
[03:03:38.636 --> 03:03:39.256]  Yeah.
[03:03:39.256 --> 03:03:42.037]  And we're helping good people like Joe and people all over the country.
[03:03:42.037 --> 03:03:43.198]  And that's exciting.
[03:03:43.198 --> 03:03:45.119]  It's really a blessing to be able to make a difference.
[03:03:45.119 --> 03:03:46.700]  I think all three of us are on the same page.
[03:03:46.700 --> 03:03:49.442]  That's why you got into law enforcement.
[03:03:49.442 --> 03:03:51.443]  I mean, I saw the police dealing drugs.
[03:03:51.443 --> 03:03:52.323]  I didn't even use them.
[03:03:52.323 --> 03:03:53.204]  I drank beer.
[03:03:53.204 --> 03:03:59.887]  I saw the police dealing drugs where I lived in Dallas and then arresting people for drugs that somebody they'd sold to.
[03:04:01.081 --> 03:04:02.022]  Dangerous to be right.
[03:04:29.367 --> 03:04:32.651]  I'm like, you're dealing drugs and you want to search my truck?
[03:04:32.651 --> 03:04:33.952]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:04:33.952 --> 03:04:38.958]  It's important to put the word out to all the people in law enforcement and government.
[03:04:38.958 --> 03:04:40.139]  Remember your anatomy class?
[03:04:40.139 --> 03:04:42.121]  You've got this little bone down the center of your back.
[03:04:42.121 --> 03:04:44.284]  It's called your spine.
[03:04:44.284 --> 03:04:44.744]  Exactly.
[03:04:44.744 --> 03:04:49.049]  And by the way, the cops that were doing that in Rockwall, Texas, six months after we moved out of there,
[03:04:49.870 --> 03:04:52.534]  They all got basically arrested for drug dealing.
[03:04:52.534 --> 03:04:55.699]  By the feds, though, who were actually bringing it in to begin with.
[03:04:55.699 --> 03:04:57.141]  Amazing interviews, gentlemen.
[03:04:57.141 --> 03:04:59.625]  Mr. Bernhoft, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:04:59.625 --> 03:05:01.308]  And, of course, Joe Bannister, you know we love you, brother.
