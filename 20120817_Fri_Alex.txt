[00:55.440 --> 00:58.840]  end of the world I think you're gonna see big things in 2012 because the
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.320]  globalists have planned that but you watch next year when it's not the end of
[01:03.320 --> 01:07.360]  the world there will be mainstream dinosaur corporate Decepticon media

[01:22.480 --> 01:27.920]  big development since then always informative and interesting Max Kaiser

[01:35.640 --> 01:39.560]  lawyer Joe Bannister former Treasury agent who exposed the facts of the IRS

[01:43.160 --> 01:48.200]  for his free speech he beat him in court thanks for that evil thing called
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.360]  juries so we're gonna be going over that as well but I'm gonna smatter
[01:53.360 --> 01:59.520]  throughout the transmission the unbelievable news Pentagon developing
[01:59.520 --> 02:06.480]  autonomous humanoid robots wait for it they've been doing this for decades and
[02:06.480 --> 02:09.520]  they're killer robots but they're classified I told you about that to
[02:09.520 --> 02:15.320]  perform evacuation operations don't run we are your friends kind of like the
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.200]  Bradley fighting vehicle ramming in and machine gunning and starting a fire on
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.120]  the branch of Indians with bull horns come out with your hands up we're here
[02:23.120 --> 02:31.440]  to help we come in peace you know that ends don't you everything's fine though
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.240]  they love you but but over the drones we're gonna be free humanitarian reasons
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.400]  they said that last year in the US we're only rolling them out for
[02:40.400 --> 02:44.800]  humanitarian and public safety and law enforcement weaponizing them in 1.4
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.800]  billion bullets but Alex Jones is wrong to be criticizing it yeah we've had
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.960]  George Soros group come out and say I'm evil worry about the bullets not they
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.640]  don't discuss the 1.4 billion bullets though they don't discuss that they just
[02:58.640 --> 03:03.960]  say oh with the they Alex made it up that the National Leather Service was
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.520]  buying a whole bunch of bullets really the federal purchase order said they
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.160]  were and now they say well actually a subgroup of organization so they play the
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.640]  semantical game and and then spin it again and say Alex Jones just made it
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.760]  up the government's buying bullets everybody knows that we the government
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.000]  is not building up an arming against you and everybody knows the government's
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.720]  loving and good everybody knows George Soros is a good man and everybody knows
[03:32.720 --> 03:36.480]  Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky and everybody
[03:36.480 --> 03:43.240]  knows oh Obama's out saying Romney needs to release his tax returns not
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.000]  fending you know not a big fan of Romney as everyone knows I'm not in love with
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.320]  a guy that's anti-gun pro-abortion all stuff but but here's the deal
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.680]  Obama won't release any of his college records when all his friends said he had
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.720]  the name Barry Citero because the word is he was getting pre-tuition as a
[04:01.720 --> 04:07.000]  foreign student on a grant and a bunch of other stuff so so I want to see all
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.800]  that I mean we're seeing stuff like Romney killed a woman with breast cancer
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.280]  because he fired her husband he lost his insurance folks when they get their
[04:16.280 --> 04:20.000]  government-run health care they say of course Romney wrote that she ought to be
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  happy I love him criticizing Romney saying he doesn't like government-run
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.200]  health care he helped write it because he works for the big banks that want it
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.040]  but yeah you want to die and not get surgery or get health care try having a
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.280]  socialist system oh no it's great in Europe it's all free oh really you've
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.880]  been to Europe you talked to your opinions you know the numbers I listen

[08:14.840 --> 08:24.040]  it is a big Friday the forces of liberty are fighting back worldwide in a big
[08:24.040 --> 08:30.200]  way but the faces of global corporate anti-free market are striking back
[08:30.200 --> 08:35.800]  through their collectivist tyrannies all the different flavors of it socialism
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.560]  communism fascism corporatism sitting up on top of it perching up there trying
[08:41.560 --> 08:48.520]  to create a monopoly system of cookie cutter controlled minions wow it is
[08:48.520 --> 08:54.000]  Friday Kaiser's coming up we're gonna get into QE3 I've got to say this is our
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.320]  top story Fox Business Financial Times of London they're all reporting that
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.040]  definitely the first time that it that they are gonna pretty much do QE3 by the
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.280]  end of the year the globalists like to hang it out there and wait so that they
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.840]  know the time when they're going to do it to be able to position themselves but
[09:11.840 --> 09:18.160]  chance of Fed printing more money jumps to 60% that's FoxBusiness.com and I've
[09:18.160 --> 09:20.480]  got a bunch of other articles saying basically similar thing and when you've
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.360]  got George Soros just jumping into gold with both feet and not just ending his
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.800]  his big brokerage firm last year and not investing people's money he's dumping
[09:29.800 --> 09:33.720]  his own money out of stocks and bonds and everything right now and so are a
[09:33.720 --> 09:37.400]  bunch of other globalists we've got a big stack of financial news we're gonna
[09:37.400 --> 09:40.800]  be covering with Max Kaiser so I'll wait till he's on with us in the next hour
[09:40.800 --> 09:47.480]  and then in studio a former Treasury agent will be joining us in studio he
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.280]  was off about 15 minutes earlier in the week on the phone Joe Bannister with his
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.160]  lawyer because when he went public and said I found out the IRS works for the
[09:55.160 --> 09:59.080]  private fellow reserve they arrested him for his free speech but the jury said
[09:59.080 --> 10:04.360]  we're still America he's gonna go free but other IRS agents and Treasury agents
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.800]  and people that write books are now going to prison if you expose the big
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.520]  secret because they got a jail you or kill you when the public finds out that
[10:12.520 --> 10:16.840]  we got the IRS in 1913 didn't really start paying taxes till the 40s and 50s
[10:16.840 --> 10:22.000]  you know mid 40s of the early 50s they phased it in and that not one cent as
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.320]  Ronald Reagan's Commission found in 81 but the Grace Commission not one cent
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.240]  goes around the country but it's one thing that I say that when Treasury
[10:30.240 --> 10:36.000]  agents and IRS senior fraud investigators go public when they're rising up
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.040]  through the organization of everything to lose they arrest them they've sent
[10:42.040 --> 10:45.280]  quite a few to jail I mean this is they're talking about trying to jail
[10:45.280 --> 10:50.840]  whoever went to you know to the Inspector General of the Treasury with the
[10:50.840 --> 10:56.440]  fact that in Austin Texas alone 10 homes because this all started here in
[10:56.440 --> 10:59.760]  Austin the big National Clearing Center for Fraud is here and then a five state
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.280]  total Clearing Center that's kind of an oxymoron the IRS Clearing Center for
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.920]  Fraud is here when the whole thing's a fraud and again this news was so big
[11:07.920 --> 11:11.080]  months ago when I learned about it from my whistleblowers I never codified it
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.080]  never properly vetted it never did the report in fact I even have more info
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.040]  that's in the news and I'm so busy I've not even done it people say you don't do
[11:19.040 --> 11:22.360]  a bunch of original journalism we do all the time we break stuff all the time
[11:22.360 --> 11:27.680]  but it's hard it's hard that's why we're hiring six more reporters was
[11:27.680 --> 11:32.200]  reporter backgrounds and so they can go out and do that and I can
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.040]  oversee it we're trying here all that cost federal reserve notes you know it
[11:36.040 --> 11:38.800]  is dollars money
[11:38.800 --> 11:45.840]  Hillary said no that's up on the drudge report they're now jumping it what
[11:45.840 --> 11:52.280]  what what no to VP oh yeah well the word is yeah I told you yesterday you
[11:52.280 --> 11:55.920]  could see it Obama meeting with Biden everyone's saying Biden needs to step
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.920]  down it's not too late for Biden to step down the word is that a old Biden is
[12:00.920 --> 12:06.000]  very close to going down the drain he is circling the drain they want to jazz
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.760]  things up with a new mummy and then print me that report place if Hillary
[12:10.760 --> 12:21.680]  indeed is saying no to VP that means that Obama is out and again this is not
[12:21.680 --> 12:32.040]  all just about the globalist is shelling their cult of Obama it's about the
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.320]  globalist moving their ball down the field so it isn't just about Obama
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.600]  being a star in all this it's about bring in their puppet wear them out
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.880]  destroy them bring in the next one but we know the military and police are
[12:44.880 --> 12:48.640]  gearing up for what they believe could be civil unrest after the election again
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.200]  before George Soros's groups twist that I'm not saying they'll be civil unrest
[12:53.200 --> 12:57.560]  it's all over the news they're preparing for civil unrest by the way look at the
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.360]  cover time magazine for sale asking 2.5 billion how to buy the White House the
[13:02.360 --> 13:08.120]  GOP architects grand design the decline of the small donor and ensure they
[13:08.120 --> 13:12.240]  advertise what's already known in here that big mega corporations and foreign
[13:12.240 --> 13:15.760]  corporations lobbying on the government but it's not just 2.5 billion
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.240]  you've got to be who they want and you've got to be basically already in line
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.800]  with the main global interest and then there's a race but it's kind of like
[13:26.800 --> 13:31.360]  Iran where the Ayatollah's the Supreme Council they have to pick who can run for
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.720]  president so they go okay you three people can run for president now you
[13:35.720 --> 13:40.480]  can have an election they'd be like going on a car lot and they said you can
[13:40.480 --> 13:46.400]  have a red Ford Focus a blue Ford Focus or a white Ford Focus you're like I
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.680]  don't want a Ford Focus not picking on Ford I just use that as an analogy or
[13:50.680 --> 13:54.120]  be like going on a Toyota dealership and saying you can have a red Avalon a
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.080]  black Avalon or a white Avalon I don't want an Avalon on a Dodge Charger a
[13:59.080 --> 14:07.800]  black one the point is is that yeah okay yeah it does cost 2.5 billion but
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.480]  that's like cherry on top the plastic cherry on top of this whole fake
[14:12.480 --> 14:16.920]  confection so we're gonna be talking about that but but let me I just digress
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.240]  off into politics let me get into all the other news here because it's big
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.800]  today US troops to get new headgear for Homeland Security operations to stop
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.360]  small arms that would be used by the American people they admit it's for the
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.000]  US gun confiscation drills declassified documents reeducation camps
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.400]  army midst those documents are real 1.4 billion rounds for non-military police
[14:39.400 --> 14:45.240]  in every agency arming themselves all of this going on in fact guys I've got an
[14:45.240 --> 14:49.120]  article about the Soros crowd in the printer in there we bring me that police
[14:49.120 --> 14:55.640]  thank you so we're gonna be getting in to that report today and how it connects
[14:55.640 --> 15:01.280]  into police department wants a blimp to spy on suspicious activity under a
[15:01.280 --> 15:06.480]  Homeland Security grant derogable would hover at height of 400 feet over the
[15:06.480 --> 15:14.720]  city now again they tether these they have them also their solar power that
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.680]  float around it's already been going on for a long time how many national news
[15:19.680 --> 15:24.440]  reports have you heard made fun of us we're talking about this I mean this was
[15:24.440 --> 15:31.080]  released by DARPA in 2000 that they were already launching low-earth orbit I
[15:31.080 --> 15:37.480]  mean edge of space 120 150,000 feet not really edge of space but up there big
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.920]  giant unmanned blimps we had solar panels on top of them with ground
[15:42.920 --> 15:50.440]  penetrating radar face scanning Intel grabbing you know NSA stuff it's a lot
[15:50.440 --> 15:54.440]  cheaper than satellites and you can also land them and stuff at night at
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.200]  Air Force bases or you can crash them in the ocean and just have the gear picked
[15:59.200 --> 16:02.800]  up I'm gonna give you some classified info they've got where they crash it in
[16:02.800 --> 16:05.760]  the ocean when they're done with when the life's over they have a ship just
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.720]  waiting because the the intelligence package with has inflatable balloons on
[16:11.720 --> 16:17.200]  it so that once it once the blimp crashes they then just extract that onto the

[25:34.480 --> 25:38.480]  and Wisconsin look if governments done it before and Obama's run false flags

[25:48.840 --> 25:54.680]  they have to be looked at as suspects as prime suspects and there's a bank robbery
[25:54.680 --> 25:57.360]  you go round up the bank robbers who've been let out of prison and the

[26:22.480 --> 26:25.320]  and get it out to everybody you know exclusive Dave Mustangs clarifies
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.760]  Obama staged shooting statement speaking of shootings finally people are
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.240]  striking back Politico family research counsel had blamed Southern Poverty Law
[26:36.240 --> 26:41.160]  Center for listing them as terrorists I mean you list somebody as extremist
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.680]  mix them a terrorist and then somebody goes and attacks them because the family
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.760]  research council who by the way is pretty milk dust but they say don't teach
[26:51.760 --> 26:58.520]  eight-year-olds about sex period whether it be heterosexual or homosexual and so
[26:58.520 --> 27:02.120]  the guy goes and attacks them over it saying he's mad at Chick-fil-A that's
[27:02.120 --> 27:05.800]  now official this is a hate crime but again I don't want to play into their
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.200]  game of going okay well then charging with a hate crime hey attempted murder
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.400]  shooting somebody you know that's that's a people stopped him there though
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.880]  wasn't a bunch of victims so no no no just charging with the attempted murder
[27:19.880 --> 27:23.760]  assault the deadly weapon he'll get 30 40 years in prison we don't want to play
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.240]  your game of oh because it was hate motivated he gets more time hey somebody

[27:36.400 --> 27:41.400]  you because you're black you need to get the death penalty that's where I stand
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.520]  on this stuff I mean the guys that drug that poor black man to death six seven
[27:46.520 --> 27:50.000]  years ago that's made so much news down in East Texas they all got the death

[27:55.120 --> 27:57.840]  there was this big thing on the news nothing I mean I remember Jesse Jackson
[27:57.840 --> 28:02.640]  nothing was done but nothing was done is there wasn't a hate law you mean a
[28:02.640 --> 28:07.600]  thought crime law we're now in Europe they arrest you for not smiling at the
[28:07.600 --> 28:13.640]  Olympics in England where they arrest you if you criticize somebody's religion
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.560]  or sexual they arrest people if you criticize Muslims they arrest you if
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.960]  you criticize homosexuals and by the way the homosexual lobby who I don't even
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.280]  go I'm not even attacking these people this is not even my big axe to grind
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.880]  except they're authoritarian at least the ones that speak for them are like
[28:29.880 --> 28:34.160]  yeah arrest somebody if you use the word homosexual Robin Page I had him on

[28:46.640 --> 28:50.480]  rights as Muslims and homosexuals they arrested him saying the word
[28:50.480 --> 28:55.000]  homosexual is hateful folks this is political correctness where you can't
[28:55.000 --> 29:03.200]  even use scientific words people are so ignorant now they think Caucasian is a
[29:03.200 --> 29:10.680]  slang term they think Negro is a slang worm and a a a insult a a a slight an
[29:10.680 --> 29:18.440]  attack they think homosexual is or heterosexual these are these are names

[33:30.120 --> 33:35.800]  anti-family garbage attacking me through his fake surrogates White House run
[33:35.800 --> 33:40.680]  tax exemption just absolutely disgusting we're gonna be breaking some of that down
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.800]  coming up against Soros propaganda front slander senator Rand Paul and Alex
[33:46.800 --> 33:52.440]  Jones Ecuador president Raphael we are not a colony he stands up to the jack
[33:52.440 --> 33:58.000]  booted British Gestapo Paul Craig Roberts absolutely I mean the British
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.040]  government that sucked off the great British people and the great Irish and
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.960]  Scottish people around them isn't even British it's it's it's Transylvania they
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.920]  call it German royalty they're not even German but my point is they have sucked
[34:10.920 --> 34:15.480]  off those people and built a global empire that the Brits paid for and
[34:15.480 --> 34:21.520]  remember the whole Falkens war remember the battleship getting sunk and all that
[34:21.520 --> 34:26.400]  where the submarine you know blew up the former US battleship that what was
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.360]  Brazilian wasn't it I mean it's ridiculous you've got Britain that is the
[34:31.360 --> 34:36.400]  globalists that run it picking on people and trying to take their islands
[34:36.400 --> 34:40.920]  their their waterways yeah they're not a colony and by the way we're not a
[34:40.920 --> 34:44.520]  colony of the globalist it's the British model that we're under today
[34:44.520 --> 34:50.000]  that's what the new older is in Carol Quigley's own words at Georgetown in
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.640]  Cecil Rhodes on words in the council on foreign relations on words we're gonna
[34:55.640 --> 34:59.720]  be getting into that with Max Kaiser as well the whole world's lining up for war
[34:59.720 --> 35:06.040]  here and you know our forebearer said that 236 years ago they said look we're
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.560]  not a colony okay we're not your slaves we're not gonna sit here and pay you all
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.520]  these taxes because they were Englishmen but they weren't being given the rights
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.480]  that had already been gained in England they said okay we'll just we'll just stand
[35:21.480 --> 35:25.920]  up to you because at a certain point you get past the fear and you're so
[35:25.920 --> 35:29.600]  disgusted at being a slave and being pushed around and having lesser men
[35:29.600 --> 35:33.680]  dominate you they just say you know what you're looking for a fight you better
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.120]  believe you got one that's how it works and no amount of drones and weapons and
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.960]  1.4 billion rounds ammo you're buying all that because you're scared because you
[35:44.960 --> 35:50.560]  see us buying millions of guns a month but again I don't even want to fight
[35:50.560 --> 35:55.400]  with the Americans that serve the globalist I want to wake them up I don't
[35:55.400 --> 36:01.200]  have some macho imperative that I need to go out and you know see a civil war
[36:01.200 --> 36:04.560]  you know because who it's sexy and fun there's nothing sexy and fun about it
[36:04.560 --> 36:11.760]  but I will not be a slave period the only reason we have so much prosperity in
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.640]  this country the media loves to tell you how bad America is and all our horrible
[36:15.640 --> 36:19.600]  past compared to other countries we've been great because the basic ideas of
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.120]  liberty that were later adopted that everyone demanded what's in the Bill
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.840]  of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence that idea is a hundred and
[36:27.840 --> 36:34.160]  eighty degrees against what the globalists want that's why they're so
[36:34.160 --> 36:37.520]  angry we've always had monopolies with a monopoly elites in every culture
[36:37.520 --> 36:42.320]  running things this system was the first time starting with the Renaissance and
[36:42.320 --> 36:48.480]  the general Enlightenment 500 years ago roughly 550 years ago or so right through
[36:48.480 --> 36:54.880]  to 1776 the the greatest flowering of it through to the prosperity it
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.480]  created and then the decadence and there's the modern sophistication of
[36:59.480 --> 37:04.120]  the world which allows corruption to hide better until it takes over and then
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.800]  declares war on the segments the remnants of goodness that are left because
[37:08.800 --> 37:17.040]  the remnants of good could it could could could sprout at any time and grow
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.880]  and overthrow the evil evil seeks to eradicate good because it's threatened
[37:21.880 --> 37:32.800]  by it it's it's at war with each other what an amazing show yesterday Richard
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.800]  Belzer on the show big movie star TV host author comedian and then he's like
[37:37.800 --> 37:43.160]  hey I'm at Chris Walken's house and the crews like did he just say Christopher
[37:43.160 --> 37:46.400]  walking so we go to break and the really good stuff was during that four minute
[37:46.400 --> 37:50.920]  break the long break at 20 after that we take the other breaks for three minutes
[37:50.920 --> 37:58.960]  long we'll top the hours one minute or into the hours one minute and I walk in
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.560]  the control room he goes yeah here he is and then there's Christopher Walken we
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.840]  talked for a few minutes and then he gets on air and plays you know plays it
[38:08.840 --> 38:15.160]  safe and wants to talk about cooking chickens and French wine that was
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.440]  probably one of the weirdest moments in my radio show and folks we've had a lot
[38:19.440 --> 38:23.440]  of them of course it was also streaming video at prismplanet.tv or no one
[38:23.440 --> 38:26.440]  would have believed it but I walked in there 30 seconds in he goes yeah you
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.440]  want to talk to him and there's Christopher Walken we're an interesting
[38:31.440 --> 38:35.560]  person looking at looking at us on Skype
[38:35.560 --> 38:43.880]  ridiculous there's the added funniness at first he was sitting in
[38:43.880 --> 38:48.280]  Belzer's lap because it was only one chair and they got another chair in there
[38:48.280 --> 38:53.160]  and the crew flipped their phones on and started taping all this we have it on
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.720]  tape and I'm saying stop that but but then there's that effect around celebrity
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.000]  people just can't help it even if you're over celebrity when it's really
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.440]  interesting celebrity it's not just that they're a celebrity that they're so
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.840]  interesting I'm gonna ask them next week we're gonna get Belzer back home and
[39:06.840 --> 39:09.760]  say hey by the way we have them sign me behind the scenes talk you want to put
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.560]  that out I told anybody puts that out before we get authorization you just
[39:13.560 --> 39:19.680]  delivered yourself a pink slip they are you a racer's well that wasn't good
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.280]  John they let us use it even though I told you not to shoot it okay well
[39:24.280 --> 39:28.800]  doesn't matter to it's funny people now are so quick on the draw those like
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.360]  gunslingers like bam they're you know their droids and iPhones are all
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.520]  recording so quickly but but but if you one thing if we had Christopher Walken
[39:38.520 --> 39:41.640]  coming on the show it's like you're interviewing a really interesting
[39:41.640 --> 39:45.720]  writer and researcher you know movie star on their own right about politics
[39:45.720 --> 39:51.560]  is why Richard Belzer was on the show and then boom it's Christopher Walken
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.040]  and if I could tell you that's the strangest moment on radio I've been
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.480]  taken to some elite parties in Hollywood and I have seen stuff you people
[40:00.480 --> 40:06.760]  wouldn't believe to a quote Blade Runner really baddie and I'm not name-dropping
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.520]  here the only reason I bring this up though is it's signpost that oh here's
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.480]  a book about you know government staging assassinations and blaming Patsy's
[40:15.480 --> 40:22.960]  dead wrong we sell an info or shop.com by Richard Belzer we get him on and then
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.960]  find out he's been a listener for many years and is a great guy and then boom
[40:27.960 --> 40:31.800]  by the way they didn't bite me up there to New York or Connecticut to hang out
[40:31.800 --> 40:36.840]  with those guys that's something I might go through TSA groping for to go cook
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.720]  over at Christopher Walken's house I tell you whose house I have cooked at
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.520]  and other people wouldn't believe it if my life is so weird man it is beyond
[40:47.520 --> 40:52.320]  bizarre all right I'm gonna stop right now we got all this crazy news and stuff
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.680]  the point is and then at the same time we're defending Dave Mustaine from
[40:56.680 --> 41:00.200]  comments made and he's giving us that exclusive I'm just telling you this show
[41:00.200 --> 41:05.080]  has already begun to orbit into the zeitgeist we're not even there yet but
[41:05.080 --> 41:12.960]  it is blast off now it is blast off oh boy speaking of that let's before we get
[41:12.960 --> 41:19.240]  this really hardcore serious news we're having a little fun here right now to show
[41:19.240 --> 41:25.400]  you how focused on politics we are we didn't even get into the Christopher
[41:25.400 --> 41:28.280]  Walken thing on the nightly news last night and then we put it up on YouTube
[41:28.280 --> 41:32.280]  the radio slash TV show yesterday we just mentioned that was Richard Belzer
[41:32.280 --> 41:38.800]  came on the show talk about government murders and cover-ups and didn't even
[41:38.800 --> 41:42.440]  point out that Christopher Walken was in it so the YouTube audience is all
[41:42.440 --> 41:48.200]  freaking out going hey ten minutes into this is Christopher Walken but now we

[46:46.360 --> 46:50.440]  admit for the world a new combat with us and of course the whole my security's
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.720]  got the 1.4 billion bullets on top of all this the Army admits gun
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.280]  confiscation drills and a reeducation camp training and we'll be going over
[46:59.280 --> 47:03.160]  that more Max Kaiser police department wants to blimp to spawn American
[47:03.160 --> 47:07.160]  suspicious activity all over the country they're getting tethered blimps that
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.720]  sit at 400 to a thousand feet right under the FAA
[47:11.720 --> 47:18.680]  limit and with the cameras on them and loudspeakers and face scanners barking
[47:18.680 --> 47:22.360]  orders at you and how do they have your face scan even though it's not a database
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.320]  yet well you the driver's license was a face scan and Facebook and of course
[47:27.320 --> 47:30.760]  these they've got the high altitude ones you know it's funny I said this in my
[47:30.760 --> 47:34.680]  film in 2005 because they had surveillance blimps over New York then I
[47:34.680 --> 47:38.520]  show it and I've been on countless talk shows where they raise this thing you're
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.000]  the crazy guy thinks there's blimps watching us I don't know I got video of
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.120]  them saying NYPD on me see the video right and they're like well here here's
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.560]  here's a document oh no there's no blimps or drones and by the way they're
[47:52.560 --> 47:55.560]  not weaponized they're not watching us okay well here's the FAA's admission I
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.960]  don't want to see that crazy man and now you this ADL seven probably lost center
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.840]  we've got the think progress run by the White House of Soros on record tax-free
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.440]  supposedly nonpartisan because they tell you they are nonpartisan really
[48:09.440 --> 48:12.120]  we're actually have meetings weekly with the White House have the former
[48:12.120 --> 48:15.720]  transition director runs it and Soros funds it three with three million a year
[48:15.720 --> 48:20.160]  and then they tell their readers that they're nonpartisan and they're a
[48:20.160 --> 48:23.320]  watchdog because they said so feel like if I announced I was the Queen of England
[48:23.320 --> 48:31.200]  because I said so or side issue they're God I forgot that they say it so it is
[48:31.200 --> 48:36.240]  but but here I am on CBS TV and they're playing a clip of my film martial law
[48:36.240 --> 48:39.720]  where I'm warning of the move towards tyranny in America and the Colonel on
[48:39.720 --> 48:43.080]  debate he's saying well Bush will be out of office in a few years I'm like no
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.480]  it's about Bush it's about the system taken over here's a clip of me well
[48:48.480 --> 48:54.280]  first is from martial law seven years ago and then this is from five years ago
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.240]  on CBS where they're playing the clip here it is to a cable with ground
[48:59.240 --> 49:02.520]  penetrating radar that looks right through your walls and gives the
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.120]  government a black and white in a post 9-11 World Security hire we're a country
[49:07.120 --> 49:10.920]  at war not an ideal situation for anyone but there are some that say if we
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.160]  have another terrorist attack on American soil the U.S. will be under
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.800]  martial law on the phone we have us with us the man you just saw in the video

[49:29.760 --> 49:33.040]  it let's first talk with you Alex by phone Alex you feel America is going to
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.560]  be under some martial law pressure as soon as we get attacked again is that
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.880]  correct well back at 99 I met with your police chief and we threw Delta Force out
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.240]  they brought in large bags of cash and tried to buy them off then I talked to
[49:44.240 --> 49:47.960]  emergency managers around the country when I was fighting this then and found
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.640]  out there was a covert plan to take over all of our major cities now that's been
[49:52.640 --> 49:57.160]  in the Associated Press the Homeland Security Committee in Congress the
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.920]  highest level security clearances are not allowed to see the details of PDD
[50:02.920 --> 50:08.760]  51 signed May 9th of this year that literally makes the president a
[50:08.760 --> 50:14.280]  dictator and last year the president funded the John Warner Defense
[50:14.280 --> 50:20.280]  Authorization Act for domestic then that university head who was a
[50:20.280 --> 50:22.920]  Colonel Jag officer we've interviewed him before he actually turned out was a
[50:22.920 --> 50:25.760]  listener and agrees with us I guess he was playing the part of the guy that
[50:25.760 --> 50:29.160]  disagreed with me that day of course that was a few years later I guess he did see
[50:29.160 --> 50:35.960]  it all come true now the president tells the Congress that NATO gives him
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.960]  orders that's called a dictator the office is becoming a dictatorship not
[50:41.960 --> 50:46.320]  the president himself let's be clear on that and it looks like Hillary doesn't
[50:46.320 --> 50:50.280]  want to run his VP that means the rat is leaving the sinking Obama ship and
[50:50.280 --> 51:02.840]  scurrying over to Mittens we'll be right back stay with us Alex Jones here with

[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.680]  launch the official interview here Max Kaiser syndicated radio host TV house
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.080]  Max Kaiser calm a one-stop shop for all things financial crystal ball gazing
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.920]  good to have you here with us yeah it's a great great to be with you and just
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.520]  continuing on the theme that we established a few months ago just
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.320]  trying to pick the exact date of when you have this global fiat money collapse
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.080]  I've said April of next year is the outside chance of that happening anytime
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.360]  between now and then and just try to figure out where the seismic shocks are
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.640]  in the system what'll what'll trigger the event so I'm looking at a couple of
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.920]  different things and as I mentioned on the last show I've done some more work
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.960]  looking into Japan you know Japan is a very interesting country because they
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.840]  funded 20 years of stagnant economic development with their savings account so
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.880]  people in Japan are almost forced to buy Japanese government bonds but now
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.920]  demographically these people are retiring so they have to sell to fund
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.360]  their retirement so that means a guarantee upward movement interest rates
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:47.480]  that could be the trigger that starts a global cascading effect in the entire
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.960]  what got me started on this is because it just emerged this past week Alex at the
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.880]  big the second biggest buyer of US Treasury debt now is no longer China
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.360]  number one of course is America America is the biggest buyer of its own debt but
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:07.440]  taking the second spot now is Japan China is walking away from the table
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.360]  Japan has always been under the Treasury of America's thumb they'll do whatever
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.080]  America says and now they are the number two biggest buyer of US Treasury bonds
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.480]  but that is extremely dangerous because their economy itself is a tinder box
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.200]  probably the weakest most fragile economy in the world but after the Fukushima
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.120]  disaster after 20 years of the zombie economy and the zombie banks but now
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.640]  they are supporting America Japan the zombie economy is supporting the
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.840]  American economy give you an idea of how fragile the system is China is walking
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.880]  away what is China buying with the money that they have well it's turned out that
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.440]  they are buying gold my sources tell me that China before the end of this year
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.560]  will come out with an official statement announcing that they've upped their
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.040]  gold by over a thousand tons stay there stay there we're gonna come right back
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:05.840]  with all things economic if you want an American company with American products
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.800]  made by Americans here is the cow Ben soap company Alex and his staff have

[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:59.680]  that's technically he's not reporting that she is a set to not be his VP
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.400]  because they want to get rid of biden I mean that's that's admitted after biden
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.680]  came out and so they want to put basically chains on black people
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:17.000]  Hillary rejected VP slot you ready your own 2016 run and go ahead and go to the
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.880]  exam now let's show people that they're watching on prison planet on TV and it
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.120]  goes on secretary of state Hillary Clinton was pressed by her husband and
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.000]  a top Obama aide to consider replacing vice president Joe Biden just a couple
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.640]  of weeks ago claims the author of the New York Times bestseller the amateur and
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.840]  they're going over it looks like a pretty good source but who knows continuing
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:45.320]  here following biden's footsteps MSNBC host says Romney engaging in inward
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:52.200]  adnization he actually said it I'm not gonna go the the route of their talk
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.880]  show hosts saying it's saying it's not that big of a deal they use it as a
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.280]  weapon let's use the word doesn't matter with the political correctness they can
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.240]  say that stuff to get everybody fighting with each other and to inject
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:08.600]  racial division divide and conquer and then it's cute and sweet yeah you can
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:16.280]  show the cruiser can we even show the headline oh he's allowed to say it to
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:23.480]  try to create race war but then we the evil whitey exactly we're we're bad
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.760]  and again it isn't a black white thing these people know this they're
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.800]  engaging in class warfare they're just literally pimping out racial conflict
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.880]  it's unbelievable just those black leaders make sure those black babies
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.800]  get aborted 51% of them so we're gonna be going over all of that but that's
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.520]  enough coming up in about 25 minutes where it open the phones up vector open
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.360]  now for your questions for former top stockbroker retired author researcher
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.400]  who's done BBC shows syndicated radio RT press TV does that every week max
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.120]  Kaiser was on with this Friday no no less Sunday now he's on with this this
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:09.280]  Friday it is the 17th day of August 2012 on this Friday edition this is
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.320]  teleprompter free radio TV talking point free as well we just cover it well
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.320]  like I see it my guest see it that's why sometimes we have differing views with
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.440]  guests we're not monolithic liberal show monolithic conservative show I'm into
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.280]  freedom I'm into an open debate I'm into getting people to think for
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.360]  themselves I think you deserve more than talking points I think you're smart I
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.520]  think when I tell you all this scary stuff you'll make preparation for it I
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.600]  don't tell you this stuff to scare you I think you're like me I think you want
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.040]  to know the truth the truth's always there anyways if you if you didn't know
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.880]  the elevator didn't actually come when the doors open you step out and go well
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.040]  I don't see an elevator I see a hundred floor shaft but I you know I just feel
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.160]  like I'll step on in there I'm gonna be positive I don't want to be scared and
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.600]  that you'd fall a hundred floors and die and you'll bounce at the bottom and
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.840]  splat everywhere like sloppy joes on the highway that's what we're talking about
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.400]  here okay the elevator doors have opened there is no elevator do not walk into it
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.440]  but people are like lemmings falling off the edge of the cliff after all
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.280]  Gloria Steinem says it's cool I mean she is CIA after all which means banker
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.840]  banker occupier max keiser of max keiser.com joins us he's also the
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.320]  inventor of the virtual trading system he's with a Hollywood stock exchange
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.360]  he's on with us Sunday and now things have really deteriorated Fox News AP
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.720]  Reuters they're all talking about global collapse banks prepared for collapse
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:38.520]  banks told prepare for collapse we've been now told and China has announced
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.120]  the government's pulling out of the US stock market saying it's fraudulent
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:48.080]  just what max has been saying George Soros and others rushing in to buy gold
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.960]  getting completely out of the market even privately they stopped managing
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.520]  people's money years ago what does all of this signify for those of us watching
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.960]  the writings on the wall massive war total collapse is it of can it be
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:10.040]  averted or max when you say collapse on the outside by next April at the latest
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.920]  are you saying that it will happen is there any way to averted what does the
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.840]  collapse look like max keiser you have the floor yeah I'm saying that it's a
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.480]  90% chance of collapse by next April and that but it could happen at any time
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.200]  between now and April the global economy you have to look at in terms of the way
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.000]  a systems analyst would look at any complicated system every time you add
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.200]  more to the system the complexity doesn't rise in a linear fashion it rises
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.320]  exponentially so every time the Fed puts on more quantitative easing every time
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.040]  investment banks bailout some other investment bank every time more
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.840]  derivatives are released into the system you don't go from let's say 700
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.240]  trillion in notional value derivatives to 800 trillion in a linear way you have
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.360]  to think of it in terms of this global quadrillion to two quadrillion
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:10.080]  derivative souffle being encumbered with exponentially more risk this is
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.280]  classic systems analysis because we no longer have an economy of supply and
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.200]  demand of output of factories of wages we've left that world 40 years ago when
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.360]  we went off the gold standard 1971 by the way this is the 41st anniversary of
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.560]  the closing of the gold window on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon but all this
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.760]  time since then we've been building in the complexity building in the debt and
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.600]  so now between now in April next year is my call you're gonna have complete
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:43.320]  systemic collapse much worse than a 2008 2008 was just a precursor to what will
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:49.200]  be a complete not a breakdown and just so the game here is to try to pick where
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:56.200]  it starts what the trigger and to kind of study it in terms of how the
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.480]  economy's rattle and roll as a result of this complete and utter systemic
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.240]  breakdown as I mentioned Japan to me seems like the weakest link in the chain
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.000]  once that goes it's the one of the top three armies in the world the second
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.040]  biggest creditor behind the u.s. itself the u.s. debt and they just have a lot
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:19.440]  of awful demographic and economic trends going against them so it looks more
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.280]  locally out to follow up on a story you've been talking about for a few
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.640]  weeks the fraud that is Facebook Groupon and Zynga I want to add something you
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.720]  said on this show let me just interrupt to give the number out 800-25-99231
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.280]  800-25-99231 calls coming up at the bottom of the hour max I hate to toot
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.920]  your horn I just want to point out mainstream media gets it wrong most the
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.640]  time beforehand because they're lying they have an agenda you keep getting it
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.760]  right and our guests do because it's you know what's happening but expanding on
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.800]  this you said six months ago a well before this you said Facebook was going
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.440]  to be a giant pump and dump everybody who knew what was going on knew that and
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.680]  now they get away with this but Martha Stewart goes to jail go ahead right it's
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.520]  a pump dump scandal and which is what you would see on Wall Street 20 years ago
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:15.600]  on the penny stock firms you know they're very famous companies back then
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.320]  who were big in the penny stock and they would call people up on the phone and
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.440]  get them to buy stock while they themselves were selling the stock and
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.080]  then suddenly there were no more sellers in the stock would collapse and the
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.320]  insiders made out like bandits now this is the first time we've seen it
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.800]  operated on this huge scale Facebook was a hundred and four billion dollar
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.840]  public offering Barack Obama had his arm around Mark Zuckerberg and he was
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.880]  involved in this pump and dump they go public at 104 billion and they are now
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.440]  down 50% from the IPO price 60 or 70% from the high just touched after the IPO
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.520]  price and you've got two other stocks I want to talk about Zynga and Groupon
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:58.040]  Groupon is a stock that won public at 20 traded near 30 is now at 5 and Zynga is
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.520]  down 60 or 70 80% as well what all these three companies have in common this is a
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.840]  dimension that hasn't been touched on a lot is that they all share a common
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.880]  auditor Ernst and Young Ernst and Young is one of the biggest auditors in
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.760]  America they are crooked they are as crooked as Wall Street there is crooked
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.920]  as the fund managers they are as crooked as the rating agencies there is crooked
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.720]  and explain how this works it's not just that they're crooked and cook the books
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.520]  only certain groups like Arthur Anderson and others who are politically
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.600]  connected with Justice Department people in a revolving door only you go to
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.680]  them not for them to cook the books even really that's on the surface it's
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.200]  really a payoff to regulators who are in a revolving door to let you be above
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.960]  the law well Arthur Anderson is one of the biggest accounting firms they got
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:51.240]  caught but Enron Enron blew up and our Anderson disappeared there were ten or so
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.420]  big firms at one point I think we're down to four but am I correct in what I
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:18:05.000]  said Ernst and Young is not necessarily hired to cook the books because the
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.400]  system is so corrupt that there is no genuine generally accounted accepted
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.400]  accounting principles worth anything anymore Ernst and Young they cover these
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.440]  three companies that I just mentioned they have just lost and in total these
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.560]  three companies alone the market caps have dropped by 62 billion dollars in
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.320]  the past just a few months since going public and just to give you an idea what
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.880]  Ernst and Young does are these big accounting firms do I hadn't experienced
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  myself when I was CEO of a company in Los Angeles we had one of these big
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.280]  accounting firms come in Price Waterhouse Cooper and they what the
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.960]  trick is basically they what depends on what they call revenue in the case of
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.800]  Zynga that they sell virtual tractors and they and they sell virtual raspberries
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.440]  as part of Farmville which is a game on Facebook the Ernst and Young would count
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.760]  the virtual money as real money so that was the fraud that they were committing
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.920]  in the case of the company I was involved with Price Waterhouse Cooper they
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.400]  were identifying losses as revenue we had two million dollars in losses they
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.820]  put in the filing for the IPO pair terms two million in revenues according to
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:18.320]  their formula that was the revenues of the company even though they were the
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.800]  losses of the company but they didn't get in trouble after that because the
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.520]  accounting rules in America just like all the banking rules and all the
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.720]  political rules and all the special interest rules and all the abrogation
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.680]  of all the civil rights and all the constitutional rules are now in the hands

[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:32.560]  1.4 billion bullets they've got drones and checkpoints going up everywhere and
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.640]  more and more they admit it's for a civil unrest collapse max keiser he's
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.120]  been stunningly accurate in his prediction so far unfortunately is
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:49.280]  saying in the next I don't know how far away is April 3 4 5 6 7 months 6 7
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.880]  months he sees it all imploding and now they're in fox news saying it looks like
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.120]  the Fed is going to go to QE 3 but they've already done other forms of
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.560]  stimulus that cause inflation max what happens when the corruption is so
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:09.200]  systemic I mean if we had crashes in the in 1929 not much of the economy was
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.920]  tied up in the market what happens when everything's tied up and fraud if things
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.040]  go belly up well it's a good point because back in the 20s and 30s you
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.000]  still had a very big farming component in the US economy and even during the
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.920]  Depression there was enough family farms in America people could eat to some
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.280]  degree that's not so many more you have the big industrial farming the Monsanto
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.560]  and farming the huge conglomerate farming you don't really have the small
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.640]  farms anymore so when the thing blows up there's no recourse there's nowhere to
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.680]  go back I'll make another prediction for 2013 you keep asking me is there any
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.360]  way to stop it I say no there's no way to stop this because systems analysis is
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.560]  you know tells me that when you complicate a system to the degree that
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.280]  this has been compromised and complicated there's a 99.9% probability
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:01.360]  of a total utter systemic collapse before April and that's my thought now
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:06.320]  following up on that there is only one possible outcome as a result of that and
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.080]  that's civil war there's got to be a civil war it's gonna be a civil war in
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.280]  America intergenerational all the people under 30 are gonna go to war with
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.120]  everybody who's 45 plus who basically stole all their money stole their
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.480]  country stole their wealth destroyed the the air ability and the viability of
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.680]  the of the soil and that will be the civil war there's only if you have one
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:37.640]  you're gonna have the other and that would come in 2013 maximum I'm I'm so
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.600]  spatial so I've got to interject something here that this is shaking me right
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.080]  now because I know you wouldn't just say this and put your credibility on the
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.440]  line you're really sure of this and I I hope you're wrong that's all I can say
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.600]  well I'm putting my flag you know planning my flag on this one as I have
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.760]  done before with predictions previously and there's because there's
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.960]  there's no avoiding the collapse there's no there's no remedy to the collapse
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:12.560]  and the the the underlying chaos is too is too great the 86 percent of all the
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.000]  trades in the New York Stock Exchange are computer to computer that's true of
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.680]  exchanges all over the world the algorithms that support all this trading
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.280]  are funded with zero percent interest rates from the Fed they can borrow money
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.480]  at zero they can do anything they want with any amount of money that they want
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.920]  and they ever make a mistake they get bailed out with more free money from
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:35.640]  the feds and they keep adding layer and layer and layer of problems on the on
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.720]  the system we already had the flash crash in 2010 we had the entire
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.360]  evisceration of night capital just a couple of weeks ago 440 million in
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.560]  45 minutes due to a spastic computer problem here's why you may be right I
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.680]  mean undoubtedly it's all a giant fraud waiting to blow up max but why why are
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.720]  the Chinese pulling out of the US stock market they're buying gold they're buying
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.920]  every this is going to be another surprise announcement Gallagher goodness
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.480]  come out before the end of the year and say that their gold holdings are not at
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.280]  roughly a thousand tons but they're closer to 2,000 tons they may even be up
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.960]  toward 3,000 tons which would put them right up with Germany number two biggest
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.560]  concentration of gold in the world is Germany with 3,000 tons then the US with
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.320]  8,000 tons China big surprise announcement coming this year they're
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.480]  either gonna double probably double their gold to 2,000 tons it'll shock the
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.000]  world it'll put a whole nother way of buying pressure on gold which we still
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.360]  see is going to continue its its climb to five six seven thousand dollars an ounce
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.280]  and China is a big part of that use as you mentioned Soros is now back in gold in a
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.840]  big way John Paulson one of the biggest hedge fund managers the world is now
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:53.280]  44% of his fund is entirely in gold bullion that's billions of dollars the
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.960]  hedge funds the smart money is always the first mover and they get in there first
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.600]  they know what's coming they see the collapse a lot of other hedge funds are
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  closing business because the system is too chaotic there's two treacherous out
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.400]  there funds are just pulling the plug well yeah well I mean that's what the
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.080]  Chinese said they they said Monday I mean of course you just mentioned earlier
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:19.000]  they said this system doesn't work it's not real in fact I had the article I
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.160]  forget their exact statement but they did the we'll try to find it during the
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.280]  break but they were like you know you know this system is no longer we can't
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.480]  gauge this they basically said it wasn't real exactly what you're saying Max
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:38.040]  yeah I know they listen to my show and they listen to reality I'm sure and they
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.000]  probably do listen to you well they're right back with Max Kaiser and your
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.800]  phone calls and he's got a lot more to cover stay with us

[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.800]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.480]  misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:33.840]  being words mr. Wordsworth they have no substance and no dimension like air like
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:40.560]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist and if I
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:46.360]  speak one for a lot that thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:53.680]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.000]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.240]  spindly limbs in a dream and the state has no use for your time resistance to
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:12.080]  tyrants is obedience to God it's alex jones
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.920]  all right we're going back to Max Kaiser because I want to ask him what the
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.600]  collapse he's predicting will look like I mean he's saying worse than 08 and that
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.680]  was a heart attack in the financial system orchestrated to hold his hostage
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:32.080]  and bring in control how bad will this one be because Paulson the secretary of
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.000]  the Treasury threatened martial law and we first reported that for the
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.200]  congressman on the show who heard it in closed committee and people thought I
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.600]  made it up and a week later it was big natural news we got no credit of course
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.920]  and it's not that that even matters I'm just tired of people doubting it when I
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.720]  have a congressman on or you know I have somebody interesting on and people
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.120]  just can't believe it was even real and I had like Willie Nelson on and I've
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.720]  seen people don't believe I had Chris if we're walking on yesterday I mean they
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.920]  just they don't believe that the truth has been successful they just can't get
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.360]  it through their heads there they're playing games with themselves not us
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.680]  that are awake we're gonna go back and ask him that question a moment and go to

[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.720]  Max Kaiser what what then does it collapse look like I mean you're you're
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.320]  going out there big time and I find it chilling because I respect your analysis
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.920]  when you say collapse some people then say that means road warrior you know
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.560]  bands of motorcycles feeding on people well crime rates are already exploding
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.680]  there are a lot of towns where there are no police or if there are there to make
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:33.880]  sure you don't have guns or they are the gangs so we're starting to see some road
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.400]  one Chicago most dangerous city in the world now but but obviously here by
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:43.960]  collapse you don't mean full road warrior collapse or how bad could it get
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.960]  first of all before I get into that I wanted to touch on some news here about
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.080]  the extent to which this fraud has perpetrated itself throughout the economy
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:38:01.760]  and why people are going to continue to be outraged and why that anger is
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.200]  building remember John Corzine former head of Goldman Sachs former governor of
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.600]  New Jersey he was caught when he moved over to MF global stealing 1.2 billion
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.760]  dollars we talked about on your show before now he is basically allowed to
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:23.120]  go scoffery there's no penalty at all for John Corzine his defense his defense
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.680]  is that the money vaporized he has no idea where it went and he just can't
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.440]  seem to be able to generate any evidence of its whereabouts that are ever
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.240]  existed or where it went that's the kind of outrageous statement coming from a
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.040]  former governor former head of Goldman Sachs former head of MF global that
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.520]  gets into under people's skin and they say wait a minute this guy is part of a
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.840]  racket the racket of the rating agencies the fund managers Wall Street the
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.200]  auditors as we just talked about the media CNBC and it's a mafia style racket
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.840]  they're practicing racket tearing and they are stealing wholesale our wealth
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:11.600]  and by proxy our country at some point there is a breaking point and the most
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:17.400]  victimized group in America will be the new generation that wakes up one day and
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:24.520]  finds gasoline at $15 a gallon a bag of groceries for $300 and no way to get to
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:30.520]  work because the roads that are completely in disrepair and on and on
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:36.120]  and on and those people will have no recourse whatsoever but to take back
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.600]  their country by any means necessary it's just it's not a big leap of faith
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.640]  here this is just a logical progression and the bankers are gearing up with 1.4
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.600]  billion plus rounds of ammo checkpoints giant armored tanks vehicles admitting
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.560]  they're going to put the army on the street what's the army going to do when
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.640]  their wife can't you know whether paycheck pay for groceries or mama's
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.000]  thrown out on the street I mean what are these bankers thinking well you know
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.920]  when you say it will be like road road warriors you know it could be like you
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:12.040]  know a soft gulag a soft gulag and what I mean by that would be on one hand you've
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.400]  got this massive private prison industry that's growing the fastest one of the
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.720]  fastest growing industry in America's private prisons corrections Corps of
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.360]  America hitting new all-time highs on their stock we talked about a reason
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.040]  as you'll put all the people in the new FEMA camps where they're there for petty
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:31.720]  reasons making things further driving down wages right that's well and as a
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.880]  labor since we talked last the last time has come out that factory owners in
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.840]  America are complaining to the Chamber of Commerce because the the prison labor
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.040]  now which works for 80 or 90 cents a day is becoming such a big component of the
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.480]  American labor force that the only way you can get a job in America now is to
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:54.200]  find it's a go to prison to find yourself in prison and it's so that the
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.920]  manufacturers the factories in America they don't have anybody to hire because
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:03.560]  the people and look at the crime wave in in France the riots the crime wave in
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:08.200]  Greece and they've disarmed most the people so the criminals are just robbing
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.720]  and it says the police can't help yeah because it turns out the cops are the
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.000]  ones robbing a lot of people I mean this is this I mean this is this can only go
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.040]  on so long all right so that my idea the soft gulag is you first of all you have
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.440]  the hard gulag which are the prisons and the you know the camps and we know we
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.100]  see that being telegraphed in the stock market already because the
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.360]  capitalization of those companies is moving aggressively higher because they
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.560]  know that they're about to get 20 30 40 50 million new inmates and that's
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.120]  incredibly profitable they get huge tax abatements they get they own the
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.880]  restaurants and hotels near the prisons so people go visit their family and
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.240]  prison they eat in the restaurants they stay in the hotels you lose your voting
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.280]  rights it's a fantastic money center but the soft gulag we saw that last week
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.440]  with the introduction of face deals you know these new Facebook cameras in
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.880]  retail shops that are geared to face recognition you get discounts by giving
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.840]  up your liberties and freedoms and run but that's only up front later everyone
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:10.000]  will have to do it to buy and sell right so you in other words you give up your
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.600]  liberties and freedoms for a deal on some Chinese made garbage so you get 20
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:20.800]  cents off and you'll still you'll allow Facebook to essentially keep you in
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.560]  check keep you in line whenever you go into a mall or a shopping environment and
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:28.360]  of course I'll hook it up to the grid which includes every camera out there
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:34.120]  you will be buzzed on your cell phone whenever you stray off the path if you
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.640]  stray toward a retailing outlet that they don't want you to go to or it
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.160]  doesn't have the deal that they want you to look at you'll get buzzed you'll get
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.080]  phone you'll start yeah this is how they control markets we've got to go to
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:49.280]  calls because I promised to but new documents big sis lied about canceling
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:53.440]  mobile body scanner program they're now rolling out giant they have the army
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.400]  doing this that we have footage on local news from New York where they make you
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:03.120]  and your family drive under a high-powered x-ray machine that shoots
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.960]  through metal more powerful than a chest x-ray and they're still rolling it out
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.000]  new documents big sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Homeland Security claimed it had dropped the plans in early stage and we've got
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.880]  the local newscast showing the idiot police and military standing out there
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.880]  under high-powered I show people this article it's incredible under giant
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.160]  high-powered x-ray machines that shoot through your car and your or your truck
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:36.200]  I mean this is suicide I mean these globalists are just setting up a system
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.440]  of total war against everybody with the GMO food the radiation the mass death
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:50.200]  we we are run by lunatics it is coming into focus and Facebook by the way also
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.520]  was introducing online gambling in the UK with British pounds so that memory
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.240]  called the gulag casino which is gonna people will give up their liberties
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.480]  also for a chance to gamble online of course they hold out these enormous
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:08.440]  mega multi-million dollar pots of money all fake dreams all manipulating the
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:11.280]  people going to the private prison to visit their family don't even know the
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.640]  restaurants gas stations hotels are owned by the big mega bank that owns that
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:19.400]  consortium that actually shipped the drugs in that their son or daughter got
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.920]  caught using the troops grow the opium total black op murder massive record
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.440]  suicide by the troops cancer virus is being injected in us total insanity
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.800]  again that's the type of collapse you're talking about let's go to Roy in
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.360]  Montana Roy you're on the air with Max Kaiser well thanks for taking my call
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:41.440]  brother Alex mr. Kaiser good to talk you my question is I can't really afford
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:46.600]  gold and obviously it's gonna go way up do you think silver would be a good
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.480]  investment for somebody who can't afford gold or do you just at this point just
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:56.960]  invest in talking to mr. Silver right now max yeah silver of course they call it
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.400]  the poor man's gold it's basically the same thing as owning gold it'll it'll
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:05.160]  operate the same thing you know gold and silver now more and more are be
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:10.160]  considered a currency the commodity at the CME in Chicago the commodity
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.320]  mercantile exchange just announced today that they are accepting gold as
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.440]  collateral that means for the first time now these commodity futures
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:23.600]  operations who are part of the banking system they are so distrustful of the
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:28.440]  banks themselves that they are violating this idea that gold is somehow not a
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.080]  money they're saying now gold is a currency we will take gold as collateral
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.320]  so gold is seeping its way into the economy it's being monetized slowly but
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.480]  surely it is the only thing that's going to be left standing 5,000 years of
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.160]  history will tell you that silver is just as good as gold in this environment if
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.720]  you don't want to buy pure silver you can buy junk silver which is 90% silver you
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:53.120]  know the 1964 or previous everybody knows what those coins are and when all
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.880]  this paper fully goes down people are going to still be transacting it's
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:05.240]  going to be whiskey cigarettes silver gold bullets firearms food people that
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.040]  know how to fix things trades I mean that's where it's at yeah well Stacey
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.160]  my fiancee soon to be wife you know she has thousands of these miniature
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.960]  bottles of whiskey from the airplanes that she's going to use as currency she
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.120]  says by the way max yeah I've got a bunch of whiskey and stuff obviously not
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.720]  drinking it's but I have to joking but I do have a bunch of whiskey and stuff I
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.760]  mean I've I know that there's a good chance all this is going to happen I
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.280]  hope it doesn't but sir I hope that answers your question it it does and I
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.680]  and in one quick follow-up what would that do with a person with a mortgage I
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:47.160]  mean if the dollar tanks and you know you owe your mortgage in dollars I mean how
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.560]  does that affect the average homeowner well sometimes well I mean max you
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:56.520]  answer it go ahead well theoretically you inflate the mortgage value away and
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.240]  it's quote-unquote good for the homeowner but I think we're in an
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.240]  environment where there's so much economic dislocation and there's so many
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.400]  other variables play here that it's not worth it in that sense but you mean
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:13.640]  your your point is well taken it's a good point but there are other things to
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.000]  consider and real estate as a class of investment is problematic for a number
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.920]  of reasons you know you have the the society breaking down you don't know
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.720]  with different neighborhoods today could suddenly become war zones next week you
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:32.000]  know there's a lot of things happening but your point is well taken it's a good
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.800]  point and I can't you know say it's not a good point all right thank you so much
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.800]  sir let's go to Jay in Texas you're on the air Jay hey how you doing max hey
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.960]  there's a article out in a veteran today about foreign cash just qualifies
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.920]  Romney from presidential bid something about him being over in Israel in Italy
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.400]  or London yeah do you know anything about that and I haven't seen that
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.040]  specific that particular article you know Romney of course is problematic for a
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:05.320]  number of different reasons you know the whole Bain capital affiliation and
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.520]  everything that goes on there I don't understand why people would want to look
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.760]  at a guy who said his tax rate for the past five years is averaging about
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.920]  13% so clearly he's not in the same country that we are living in he lives
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:25.840]  in some other country he's a foreigner he lives in no he lives in global country
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.720]  where the globalists are all above the law he can't really consider him to be
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.160]  an American he doesn't you know he pays taxes like he lives in the Cayman
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.640]  Islands so go to the Cayman Islands and leave us alone yeah I hear you you
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.600]  certainly had courage to live in France so you're going to the tax haven as they
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.560]  call it of England Max let's go to Mark in North Carolina you're on the air go
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.480]  ahead hey Alex max thanks for taking my call and dog on your answers several of
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.520]  my questions while I was sitting here waiting but I still have one good one I
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.560]  think and that's got to do with whether you've got
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.680]  honest or arrow from seeds or other items and including the silver and the gold
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.600]  once you have it what's the best ways or what's the best and safest bet for
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.560]  keeping it well number one don't tell anybody about it but you're
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.000]  spouse number two have guns to defend it be ready to use them and number three
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.800]  don't put all your eggs in one basket Max Kaiser well my understanding is that
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.960]  info wars is opening up a huge warehouse down in Austin Texas to store
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.760]  everybody's precious metals that's why I send all mine no with very funny Max
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.560]  no okay so yes you make it you don't want obviously you're at risk if you have
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.680]  it in your home or you you know there's a lot of work on the web in terms of what
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.400]  people are doing with this personally there are services that you can get
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.040]  involved with that store your metals involves that are completely outside of
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.800]  the banking system yeah I mean I mean I mean there's all sorts of private
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:56.760]  lockers safety deposit boxes aren't a hundred percent safer yeah but but the
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:59.520]  point is if you got in a couple of them you can always get the stuff out later
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.400]  so I mean I mean just all over the place is basically it this common sense you
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.160]  know you know you're right to be concerned you know from there there are
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:13.920]  a number of strategies you can use some you know each one is has pluses and minuses
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.880]  but you know tied to your individual circumstance which I don't know but you
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.480]  know it's easy enough to get the the research on this yeah I'm also I'm
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:29.600]  investing in lead and the systems that project it and I'm also food and things
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.920]  like that well yeah but you know funny thing is Portugal just announced that
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:42.960]  the folks there that are being exposed to austerity measures have just run out of
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:48.000]  all the gold that they can sell at the local pawn shop it's the swap no I know
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.240]  I know absolutely and the bankers drove the price down to hoard it
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:56.240]  themselves more calls straight ahead Logan John Terry Scott your calls

[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.200]  our guest for this little segment and the next and then in studio we're gonna
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.400]  have Joe Bannister and his lawyer political prisoner they tried to make
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.320]  him a political prisoner Joe Bannister former Treasury agent this is very
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:39.160]  important in light of all the corruption of the IRS coming out Logan in
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.920]  California you're on the air worldwide nice to talk to you AJ remember apathy
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:52.160]  is trees in my brother my question for max keiser is I don't hear anybody
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:58.360]  speaking about commercial real estate and the fact that you can only claim a
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.760]  loss under business for five years before you have to declare bankruptcy and
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.920]  I believe that that is going to be one of the trigger mechanisms for the next
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:12.680]  collapse because housing real estate was the bubble that popped the first time
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.360]  and so I wanted to know what you thought about that max well all I can say is that
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.640]  I would agree with you okay that what you're saying is actually correct the
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.080]  commercial real estate sector is kind of a huge bubble proportions just like the
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.440]  student loan sector is a huge multi you know trillion dollar plus bubble ready
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.840]  to burst as well so there's still big bubbles yet to burst here in California
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:40.040]  everywhere I look strip malls or they have one business in a and in ten units
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:45.760]  in every single one of them has a for rent sign for sale sign and they've been
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.480]  sitting for years okay well let me jump in here so take that through for a
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.120]  second so in other words you got this commercial real estate that's vacant
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.920]  does not generate any income it's backed by bonds collateralized bonds of
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.880]  nature mortgage collateralized bonds which have been sold back and forth
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:04.800]  amongst banks and those banks when they sell those back and forth to each other
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.000]  they value them for a hundred cents on the dollar none of the banks yet have
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  said wait a minute the strip malls are empty those bonds are not worth a hundred
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.440]  cents on the dollar they're worth only five cents on the dollar no one's done
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  that yet they keep trading them back and forth for fees and they're allowed to do
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:21.600]  that because they do it a really off balance sheet they do it on the dark
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.440]  exchange they do it outside of the regulators eyes and so as a result you
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.400]  have this building Mount Vestuvius of bad debt that's building on the balance
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.560]  sheets of these banks JPMorgan classic example ninety trillion dollars with the
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.320]  derivatives trillions of dollars with a bad commercial real estate debt and
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:43.760]  it's not being exposed because the well said well said thank you Logan got a
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:49.880]  jump Terry in Canada you're on the air go ahead Alex Max thank you very much
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:57.520]  guys I was first introduced to Max Mike Maloney and when he air guitared the
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:03.520]  Sex Pistols he had me hooked so my question is Bank of Canada governor is
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.440]  Mark Carney does double-duty at the Bank of International Settlements so my
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:13.720]  exact question is is the Bank of Canada buying gold and once this financial
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:19.520]  collapse happens where does Canada fit into it all being the biggest trader
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:24.640]  with the US well Carney's interesting case because of course just six months ago
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.880]  Jamie Diamond CEO JPMorgan was lecturing Carney on why he needs to reduce his
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.080]  minimum capital reserve requirements in that country because doesn't he know
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.000]  that selling more derivatives is the best interest of all the bankers around
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.240]  the world you know Carney said you know get lost punk and for that reason you
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.080]  have to give them big kudos and they went through a huge banking crisis in
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.120]  early 90s they recapitulate everything you know the Canadian banks are
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:52.960]  basically nationalized they're not so they have a much more strict oversight
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.680]  they didn't get rid of their Glass-Steagall because they'd done that
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.000]  previously and got in a trouble with it great points we're gonna come back to
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.880]  five more minutes with Max Kaiser of Max Kaiser.com again if you just tuned in

[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.440]  Kaiser's wrong he says it's gonna happen in the next six seven months by next
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.040]  April total collapse I hope he's wrong but there's a good chance he's going to
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.600]  be right the globalists could always have some new bubbles some new scams some
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.960]  new thing they do but Max has never said it's coming down now he's saying that a

[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:31.880]  this Friday worldwide transmission that five minutes left with Max Kaiser
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.760]  invaluable information Max Kaiser.com you know we're having him on a lot more
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:39.800]  we're very thankful for him coming on and find out about his TV and radio shows
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.280]  head Max Kaiser.com be sure and support the alternative truthful media doesn't
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.040]  mean he has all the answers or I have all the answers doesn't mean we're
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:51.040]  infallible nothing close to it but we're we're trying to get to the truth and
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.840]  Max is really proven he's got his pulse for being a former insider on where
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.040]  things are going and this this conversation is freaking me out I live
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:04.120]  here too and I see all the preparations and I wish we weren't right I just man
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.840]  just somehow we got to turn this around try to educate as many military and
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.440]  police because the globalist plan on having a civil war in this country that
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.600]  they trigger instead of having us come together and fixing the system and you
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.840]  know I've grown up I'm older I'm not that old but I just when I was 20 you know
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.360]  I was a little more I will just have a war now I mean I didn't want it then
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:30.480]  either but now I've lived enough to know what a bad idea that is even though
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:34.440]  we'll totally crush the globalist forces that's part of the plan and then
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.680]  the real globalists just set off sure Max Kaiser is our guest so be sure and
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:42.040]  spread the word about all the work we're doing here because it is so cutting
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:46.520]  edge to use that cliche John in Indiana you're on the air with our guest Max
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:52.840]  Kaiser yeah hey Max Alex good to talk to you guys you always enjoy listening to
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.680]  Max and you too Alex just kind of wanted to tell you a little bit going on
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:04.320]  here just I'm about two hours outside of Chicago close to a little place called
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.360]  Gary Indian I don't know if you guys know about it but it's a suspect
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:14.560]  basically just rampant crime but what they're doing here is they've opened
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:19.120]  up they're opening up I should say several churches and then around the
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:25.680]  area to confiscate guns so you bring your guns in and basically get a 15-25
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.880]  dollar Walmart gift card so and that's just happened Wednesday I just heard on
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.480]  the radio here local radio station was just broadcasting it here yeah like I
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:43.360]  said a couple days ago give us your take on that Max well Walmart it is the the
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.600]  company store on the plantation you know every dollar you save a Walmart you
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.360]  destroy a buck 50 in wages if you shop at Walmart you put yourself into a
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.000]  wage-less prison environment it's as simple as that same thing with target
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.960]  they're all the same yeah okay but the Walmart is the biggest employer now I
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.560]  mean it wrote the book but but it's now even being slave marted out worse by
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:12.680]  Amazon possibly but in other words the the the the retailing environment race
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.000]  to the bottom race the bottom yeah it's okay the race the bottom I mean if you
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.200]  want to segue into a discussion about guns I mean that's a different discussion
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:24.860]  yeah but I mean I was interrupting give us in in closing your take on what's
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:30.680]  happening to retail well no it's the it's the race the bottom you know I was
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.600]  trying to come up with a good metaphor for this this transition to this total
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.080]  collapse state and you know you see it in nature all the time Alex you know the
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.240]  transition in these in these system dynamics when there's a when there's a
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.880]  shift you know when you have water for example retains a lot of heat and then
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.320]  suddenly it only takes one degree to go from water to vapor okay that's a
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.880]  system phase shift and that's what I'm talking about the heat is the water the
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:02.480]  system is heating up yes systems breakdown and once we get that one
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:09.280]  final degree shift and complexity and outrage you have a phase shift from water
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:15.840]  to steam and steam compared to water is extremely you know unstable yes that's
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:21.480]  the society that we're heading for in 2013 something extremely unstable so
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:26.040]  when you say collapse you mean lots of instability crazy stuff's going on and
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.320]  the globalists know this shifts happening so they want to flip it like
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:33.720]  judo and take all that rage and use it for them to take over but you're saying
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:41.200]  you don't see things going well for him or will they stay in control I think
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.160]  they're in good shape we're gonna have to have you back up very soon thank you
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.720]  so much max I want to see it where you think all this is going max geyser's
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.240]  been our guest we got in-studio guest straight ahead got it trying to make a
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:57.400]  political prisoner for his speech stay with us
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.760]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:09.060]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:13.360]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.600]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.160]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.240]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.800]  supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:33.440]  eat foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.600]  recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all known
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.520]  this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable foods the
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:44.080]  fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:47.560]  25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost

[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:18.520]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:22.680]  dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:27.240]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you

[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:00.440]  sponsors we couldn't do this without you and it also shows that liberty is
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:05.480]  popular now I knew this because I'd fallen of the trial and I think once
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.920]  even maybe even trying to call me a chance a guest but who knows I didn't
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.360]  even really realize until I was sitting in here with Joe banister we had on
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.560]  earlier in the week be a phone of course I'm interviewing now for about 14
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:21.480]  years or so or 13 years what's this about 99 right and says about 13 years he
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:28.080]  is here in studio with us and Robert G. Bernhoft is also here in studio with us
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:33.520]  he was webs Wesley Snipes lawyer who got him off on all of the felonies with the
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:39.720]  IRS and when they arrested Joe banister for his thought crimes a few years ago
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:45.200]  mr. Bernhoft was able to get a night I don't want to say get him off because he
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:49.240]  didn't do anything but the point is it's hard to beat the criminal IRS and I'm
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.880]  very excited I didn't know this I knew that you were I guess in the Midwest or
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.760]  was it Milwaukee walkie Wisconsin Alex yeah yes so now you've moved to Austin
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.560]  Texas show I was saying during the break you know if I ever need a good
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.240]  lawyer thank God you're here I should be groveling because I mean it's hard to
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.560]  find good lawyers but just amazing to have both of you here in studio Robert G.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:13.440]  Bernhoft and again the website is Bernhoft law.com
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:21.040]  b-e-r-n-h-o-f-t law.com and Joe banister agent for truth.com so gentlemen I
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:25.240]  don't know where to start where should we start here today well first of all we
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:27.840]  came down to Austin my firm did because that's where all the troublemakers are
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.440]  and we figured this is a good place to be but and that's partly true but we're
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.560]  really liking it here in Austin great people a lot of energy and of course this
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.080]  show is here so we're having fun yeah now that you're here in town look out
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.440]  we're our legal expert good to have you here thank you in fact I wanted to get
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:47.320]  you on the TV show tonight so hopefully next time you're both in town come back
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.400]  because I forgot I'm shooting them for a documentary film today a film cruise here
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.280]  so we've got to work it out somehow to get that done okay I'm excited I'm gonna
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:02.800]  shut up tell us about your take on the IRS the big scandals coming out all the
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.600]  rest of the corruption it seems like the veil is lifting that we really do have a
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.760]  corporate mafia in control that exempts itself from the fraudulent laws that they
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.480]  put in place yeah I think that's right Alex and one of the hot topics in
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:20.320]  academic commentators the federal judiciary and defense practitioners is
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.400]  government misconduct after former senator Ted Stevens in the subordination
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:28.560]  of perjury falsification of evidence and the scandal about that what we're
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.360]  seeing what I'm seeing now is a cascade of investigative and prosecutorial
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.320]  misconduct that's infecting the courts the difference now over the past four or
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.960]  five years is that it's being exposed to some extent we will never know what's
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.600]  sort of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct laid behind chose
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:49.520]  investigation and prosecution because we were we did not get all the discover
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.120]  we were entitled to but I remember getting the call from Joe after the
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:57.960]  arrest and that was a really that was a traumatic time I know for him and his
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:01.880]  family and we were we were able to jump in and help them we're grateful to be
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:07.120]  able to do it let's go through that case before Wesley Snipes because I mean
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:10.800]  you're just winning and winning and winning in a system where it's almost
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:16.800]  impossible to win Tommy Crier God bless him died this year he was able to
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:19.960]  defeat them when you can get a jury trial I mean is that how you're able to
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:24.160]  do this actually exposing the fraud absolutely the last bastion of freedom
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.040]  the interposition between the government power and the executive and the
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:34.640]  citizens citizens like Joe is the jury now there's unfortunately the quality of
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.840]  the jurors that we're seeing in jury pools it's a function of American
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.840]  culture we have a lot of people that watch too much TV that listen to
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.320]  government propaganda it's very difficult to get free thinking
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:49.520]  individualist type people on juries so one of the things that you have to do is
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:54.000]  pay attention to your jury selection Joe's jury we like diversity on our
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.320]  jurors and you know I'll be candid about this for example the African-American
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.960]  community has a different perspective of the system than white America does
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:07.560]  generally they have had an experience with the system they're suspicious of
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:12.360]  systems thing not as naive I would that's a great way to put it and they're
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.160]  more inclined to think and listen carefully to what otherwise other
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:20.400]  Americans might shut out you know how could it be that the government who
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.400]  wears the white hats indicts a good guy well you know the government comes into
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:27.160]  court with the white hats on Joe's supposed to have the black hat on and
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.720]  our trial theme was no they indicted the good guy and so we tried to switch the
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.120]  hats and that's a tough concept for most Americans but thank God we still have
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:40.120]  jury trials in all of our criminal cases and unanimity is required it's got to be
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.040]  12 unanimous jurors giving a unanimous verdict and that's your last chance
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:48.600]  that's your last chance to defend yourself the other thing that's going on
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.360]  of course is it's a an exemplar of despotic systems that they use their
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:59.520]  judicial process to single out and punish dissenters that's always been the
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.840]  case throughout world history but it's a real shame and it's a disgrace that the
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:08.560]  American federal criminal judicial process increasingly is being used as a
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.120]  forum to target and punish principal dissenters and so that's that's the state
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:18.960]  of the American judicial process today well it's scary it's like you say Joe
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.440]  hey I'm not saying don't pay him even though it's all a fraud they'll break
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:25.440]  your legs I mean no they'll worse than that they'll put you in prison for 20
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.520]  years and take everything you got I'd rather have my legs broken than that 10
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.440]  times I mean this is vicious what you went through I know most our listeners
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:38.040]  are aware of your story but look at what happened to you know just the guest I
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.120]  had on the other day the IRS sure yeah yeah sherry peel Jackson I mean she did
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.920]  nothing wrong and for her speech look at everyone shift in prison for a book in
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:51.320]  America book burning book burning is alive in America we don't burn them
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:55.120]  anymore we issue injunctions against their publication and dissemination and
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.880]  that's what the court issued against shift prior to the criminal trial the
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.320]  court enjoined shift from printing and publishing his book upon pain of
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:07.080]  contempt I mean it's interesting that even the library Association of America
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.400]  came out in support of shift on that point and it's also interesting that in
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:18.280]  an age where court decisions have said that free speech covers a books on how
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:24.760]  to stalk torture and kill people how to identify and and groom children for
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:27.840]  sexual abuse and that's free speech you know that stuff's out there that's okay
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.720]  but God forbid someone like Irwin Schiff wants to print his thoughts and
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:36.000]  research conclusions about the scope and nature of the tax that's something you
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.520]  burn the book well I mean he he found the key to it and proved all their fraud
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  after decades of research and they said you're going to a dungeon yeah and the
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.600]  other the other speech the other you know the other types of speech that you
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.440]  know I'm libertarian but nevertheless some of that speech is abhorrent first
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.160]  amendment covers that but it doesn't cover Irwin yeah you have to protect the
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:58.160]  abhorrent stuff or we lose our good stuff that's right you know there was a
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.200]  famous Supreme Court justice that made it really a great profound comment we
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:07.000]  tolerate the speech we hate because someday our speech might be hated so I'm
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  good with that I'm a libertarian I believe in the principles of this country
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.240]  but what we're having now is selective identification of speech that the state
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:21.600]  deems subversive harmful or dangerous back in the old days frankly we used to
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:27.000]  talk about our founders and the middle ages and then 1600 1700s and oh there was
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.680]  torture going on in terms of criminal punishment and now we're so much more
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:34.840]  civilized and I don't think that's the case in fact no they just make it more
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.120]  sophisticated and more covers that's there's more velvet gloves that's right
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.320]  we're gonna say interrupted no it has that it has a perception of being more
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:46.240]  civilized but in fact if you were a heretic heretic before in the colonies
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.320]  you know and you you said something that was they considered blasphemous they
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.520]  put you in the stock for a day a little public humiliation then they you know
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:57.040]  repatriated you to your family at your home they had to live in a community and
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:00.520]  today we're much more civilized we we try and put people like Joe Bannister in
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:05.160]  federal prison for 15 16 years and they're now grabbing people I've seen
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.400]  that have protested us you know the famous doctor case what sell up in
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.160]  Missouri where he's been in there for 15 years now forced drug they never
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:19.000]  having a trial but he's in prison drug for Medicare Medicaid fraud they
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.320]  claimed I mean now they drug you or electro shock you because of your views
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.840]  that's like the old Soviet Union it's barbaric it's absolutely barbaric and
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:31.520]  when you take a look at the U.S. sentencing guidelines which determines
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:35.240]  sentencing ranges and we took a take a look at the so-called white collar
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:39.440]  guidelines particularly regarding tax and you have people that you know failed
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:42.920]  to pay a little bit of tax in a couple years of income and the sentencing
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.720]  ranges can be five to ten years in federal prison you know everything is
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.600]  upside down you can beat you can be out of a state prison in California on a
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:54.120]  murder one-chart six point nine years something like that you know but if you
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.240]  run a file of the IRS look forward to a double-digit sentence and this is
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.640]  systematic this is not you know this isn't accidental this is absolute
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:07.720]  intentional policy that's being passed by Congress enforced by its agency the
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:12.600]  Internal Revenue Service and this guy have a radio show no wonder he's went
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.840]  in with all these juries hey wow amazing again we have Joe Bannister and
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.200]  Robert G. Bernhoft his incredible lawyer you got to go to Bernhoftlaw.com
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:25.480]  because I've followed your cases and then I'm running around here with 20
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.520]  things happening and you guys are here and then it kind of re-clicks you know
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:31.600]  Joe goes you know he's the guy that's won all these other cases too and I'm
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.280]  just realizing how rare that is why have you been so successful when very few
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.240]  others have and we're gonna skip this break because it's so important guys go
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.880]  ahead yeah the conviction rate generally is around about body temperature in
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:48.640]  federal criminal trials 95 96 percent take your statistic the way we approach
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:51.920]  these cases is first of all we have aggressive motion practice to get the
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.120]  discovery that our clients are entitled to and there's various rules and cases so
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:59.560]  we're very aggressive about getting discovery and the devil's in the details
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:03.240]  and the government's thematics and sometimes investigative misconduct
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.760]  lurks in the discovery and then we prepare it's about preparation mastery
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.760]  of information and it's also having an understanding of human nature you know
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:14.880]  this is an age we want to change human nature we don't want to acknowledge it
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.560]  we acknowledge the functions of human nature how it plays out and you know
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:25.320]  court trials are our theater dramatics where the stakes are very very high you
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.560]  have to understand what makes people tick when you pick a jury you have to
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.720]  look at those people as individuals ask them a few questions and they will tell
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.560]  you things about themselves without even realizing it so jury selection and Joe
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:42.440]  assisted me at council table jury selection in his trial and you have to
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:45.960]  have good people instincts and you have to be aggressive and you have to know the
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:51.720]  law but picking a jury is is crucially important as it was in Joe's case and
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:56.400]  you're right it is theater people say why do they do a year or 14 months
[02:19:56.400 --> 02:20:00.280]  million-dollar investigation of Amish selling cheese and milk to their
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:04.240]  neighbors turns out the neighbors have moved in and demand they sell them their
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.040]  milk and cheese at their communities eating so they could take it across
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:10.640]  state lines and sell it to make it a federal case then they swat team them
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:13.600]  and get them down on the ground when they're a known non-violent sect for
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:19.360]  400 years and all of this goes on people say why do they do that so they can
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:23.200]  show an ignorant jury who doesn't know what Amish are doesn't know the history
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:27.920]  of anything like look they're bad we wouldn't have swat team them and all of
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.560]  it is just dress-up theater absolutely increasingly you know especially in tax
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.280]  cases especially in non-filing and I'm not afraid to say tax protester cases I
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:41.640]  mean I did a case in Boston a few months ago and they were completing building
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:47.000]  the Tea Party Museum right there inside of the courthouse and so we took the
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.440]  government's epithet its defamatory epithet and we said no we'll accept
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:54.520]  that that's right my clients are principal tax protesters and they're
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:59.480]  protesting taxation without explanation wrote letters to the IRS asked for the
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:03.480]  code section that made them liable no answers and we reached that jury on a
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:08.120]  pretty good level so it is drama and increasingly these prosecutions are done
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:12.080]  by misleading the jury about things they don't know about can't be expected to
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:16.880]  know misleading the jury about tax law about how accounting is done and in Joe's
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:21.440]  case of course it's just the drumbeat that this guy is dangerous if you don't
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:26.720]  convict this guy he's going to get to the children but if we rediscover 1776
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.840]  common sense says the government's dangerous absolutely we were very
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:35.760]  aggressive in Joe's trial my co-counsel Jeff Dixon did an incredible job and he
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:39.800]  put to the jury which side is the con on which side is the con on they charged
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:46.120]  Joe banister with conspiracy conspiracy and we put it to the jury with you
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:49.880]  cannot win these cases by half measures you can't go in there with soft themes
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:55.480]  I agree people say wake up America being nice no I I never calculated anything
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:59.120]  I'm aggressive like a bowl in a china shop that's what gets results the truth
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:03.760]  that's right and you have to break through the barriers of people from
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:07.040]  seeing the truth and you look at you look at Joe's case again I mean he was
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:10.480]  did you go with this angle to I mean because I follow Charles some of the
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.600]  news was so busy you know we're just following the paper and talking to Joe
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:17.160]  some on the phone but I you know don't have a little inside stuff but I would
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:21.800]  have made the point he was moving up he had a career he had everything he just
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:26.200]  did this to warn people of the truth why would he lose everything that they're
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:30.520]  the liars that is that is a really interesting point because the government's
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:35.320]  playbook and criminal tax is greed you know he chose to play and then they
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:39.660]  point to the jury while you chose to pay they create class economic heavy and
[02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:43.480]  respond and responsibility envy they tried to trap that theme on Joe's case
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:48.520]  closing argument especially you lost everything yeah he put everything on
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:52.280]  the line and yet the greed was the function the factor it was extraordinary
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:56.240]  it wasn't plausible and and the jury didn't buy it did you tell the story how
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.280]  he set out to disprove the tax protesters absolutely there was a tons of great
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:04.720]  testimony and evidence and of course Joe being a man of integrity had former
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.200]  colleagues that were videotaped in a deposition talking about what a great
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:14.640]  special agent he was the integrity the discipline the work ethic so it was a
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:17.360]  tough go for the government and that was their evidence but it blew up in their
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:20.840]  face that's right they put the evidence of I find that more and more they'll
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:25.600]  stand up a huge room of like 500 Marines officers and say you will not watch
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.080]  Alex Jones you will make give people demerits and and write them up and we'll
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:33.040]  kick them out if they watch it three times and then all of them go watch it
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.520]  until and then and then tell everybody to watch so the whole military is watching
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:40.880]  because for 10 years they tell them don't watch it I mean the system is so
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:44.440]  disconnected from reality they seem to be their own worst enemy have you found
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:49.080]  that they are alienated from where America is really at they are
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:53.400]  disconnected they believe their own that they believe they own their own
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:56.120]  fantasies and the things they want everybody else to believe and they
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:00.000]  just assume people believe that but when you've got Joe standing up there with
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:03.800]  the New York Times investigative reporter and a Pulitzer Prize winner and
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:07.960]  he's asking questions and taking notes and Joe is expressing some views and
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:11.320]  beliefs that he has the government thought this was sedition of the first
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:16.360]  order and the jury looked at him and said well gosh he's thoughtful he's
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:20.920]  speaking his mind I mean that's a crime and the government's theory was in fact
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:25.600]  that was a crime that was a conspiracy to defraud the United States and your
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.680]  motto nails that there's a war on for your mind there's a war on and for the
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:35.400]  jurors mind because all that propaganda and all that conditioning all throughout
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.720]  their lives the government just wants that to stick long enough to convict the
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:42.760]  defendant people like you and but when you have somebody that can communicate
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:48.240]  your innocence it snaps them out of that let me ask you this going through the
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.720]  fire but also getting to defend people like Joe because I've noticed you only
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:54.080]  take cases where it's really clear that you know the government's totally in
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:59.240]  the wrong there and still that's an uphill battle how good does it feel to
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:02.400]  actually find a niche in this increasingly corrupt world where you do
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:08.800]  get to do I mean do get to do good work well I I tell people all the time I am
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:12.760]  an extraordinary lucky individual because I actually we actually make a
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:18.000]  difference once in a while and and even moving more transcendently from helping
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.840]  Joe out in his family and avoiding 15 16 years in federal prison that that would
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.520]  be gratifying but we do get to make a difference on a larger scale that's a
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:29.440]  really that's a blessing in today's world you don't get to do that very
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:33.120]  often we take it very seriously it's something I'll tell you one thing before
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.200]  the jury came back with the verdict in Joe's case and I kind of leaned over to
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.680]  him and I said look you know I don't know where this is going we've got a
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:44.840]  pretty good feeling but when loser draw when that jury verdict comes in you know
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:49.200]  we're gonna be even keel don't let him do it to it we're gonna walk out of this
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:52.200]  at the courtroom one way or the other with your head held up high you're
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.720]  entitled to that they can't take that away from you if it's a victory we'll
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:01.160]  celebrate outside you know and and and that was that was one of the most
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:04.000]  emotional moments of my life when that jury verdict was returned that was a
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.400]  special agent that investigated me well I want Bob to tell you what he said to
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:12.040]  Bob upon my acquittal yeah he I came over to I think with special agent
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:16.400]  Breslin there's Howard and Breslin I went over to a special agent Breslin and I
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:20.440]  mean yes he had tears running down his face and he looked at me and he said
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.280]  thank you counselor for taking care of our boy Joe and I was just because there
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:29.040]  they are pretty much even having to testify against him imagine the guilt
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:32.280]  they were going through yeah they because when you do evil things it comes
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.160]  back on you that's right it was a political prosecution political
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:39.200]  persecution everybody knew that and and and those special agents that used to
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  work with Joe they knew he was a man of integrity they knew he didn't have any
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.920]  intent to commit any crime and so for that he didn't want to commit a crime
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.160]  carrying out the IRS stuff that's right so he has a crisis of conscience but
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:56.240]  knowing who Joe was and I was that was unexpected I did not expect that to get
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.200]  a handshake and a congratulations counselor from an elite special
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.800]  agents when a Joe's former colleagues very exciting story what about Wesley
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.160]  Snipes we've had so many famous trials and you got him you know to not go to
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.640]  prison for all the fake stuff yeah that was a that was a really tough case
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.040]  because you know we were in Ocala, Florida everybody thought that he
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.400]  couldn't get a fair trial down there it's going to be an all-white jury and
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.880]  it wasn't all white jury but but I picked that jury and I like that jury I
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:27.800]  thought I picked some really thoughtful people down there and and you know the
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.040]  problem with representing a high-profile celebrity is the fact of their high
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.200]  profile that everything changes it becomes surreal there's an entourage
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:39.080]  there was massive media down there and everything gets distorted so we actually
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:42.680]  had to try that case outside the courtroom as well as inside that's the
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.000]  big difference between a non-celebrity so many small-time lawyers you aren't
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.240]  you know super professional like yourself they don't get there always
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:54.640]  don't talk to the media and I'm like no it's a media war oh I mean the
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.600]  prosecutors they know that they're out there given their press releases
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:02.440]  prosecution issued a press release that Wesley Snipes was a fugitive and he
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.720]  was in Namibia a shooting gala walker if I'm not mistaken they don't have an
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:10.280]  extradition treaty at all with the United States Wesley could have stayed in
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.040]  Namibia for a good long time but his attorneys were negotiating with the
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:17.480]  government his surrender so out there in the media and the jurors here this
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:21.920]  potential jurors here this oh he fled he's a fugitive he won't come back that's
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.440]  evidence of that shows that fraud I mean they're saying he's a criminal he's run
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.840]  when he had we had a fight that you have to go out to the media and dispel the
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.520]  misinformation and propaganda to get yourself back to a level playing field
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:37.280]  and if you don't do that you lose and you lose bat and Wesley goes to prison
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:40.360]  for 16 years well I have a view of the law not that I'm a lawyer but I studied
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:45.800]  it a bit that even if somebody's guilty if the if the system cheats the danger
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:50.360]  of the system cheating is more dangerous than a guilty person not going to jail
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:54.120]  there's no question about that and that's why the discovery violations and the
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:58.560]  cascading misconduct into federal courts particularly is crucially important to
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:03.880]  stop and remedy an exceptional event occurred Judge Richard Tolman a Ninth
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:08.280]  Circuit Court of Appeals judge after the Stevens case issued an open letter to
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.160]  Attorney General Holder really an unprecedented event when a judge speaks
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:15.800]  to the executive branch at such a high level and it's a public letter and he
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.280]  says look at the paraphrasing look Mr. Holder we have got to do something about
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:23.840]  the discovery violations the subordination of perjury and the
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:28.400]  misconduct that's infecting our system we have to have clear rules there has to
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:32.160]  be a level playing field that old axiom that we learn as school children is
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:37.760]  vitally important we would let a number of guilty men go free rather than
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:42.840]  sacrifice the rights of an innocent man that's our system at what separates us
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:47.920]  from despotic systems amazing Robert G. Bernhoft and Joe Bannister both of them

[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:39.760]  we got a lot of stuff to talk about the websites to check out our agent for
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:44.560]  truth dot com that's show banisters and there's Robert or Bob G. Bernhoff's
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:49.360]  website Bernhoff law dot com and I can tell you if I ever have the collection
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.000]  agency for the private Federal Reserve come after me I know who I'm gonna get
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.560]  right over here I hope I can get him you were telling me that that I was saying
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:01.720]  boy I bet killing is their business and business is good for them I bet you
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:05.240]  trying to save people I bet your business is just booming you know it is
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:11.520]  and it's a it's a it's a it's a bit of a mental torture because business is
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:14.400]  business and when they're making a living there's nothing to apologize for
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:18.680]  making a living but it's grueling to it is it takes its toll and you deal with a
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:21.960]  lot of human road meat the grist mill of the government they grind people up
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:26.240]  spit them out don't look back and it's but particularly in trials where you
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:30.200]  have convictions those are those are extraordinarily difficult you get to
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.280]  know people very well over a two three-year period if there's not a good
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.760]  outcome at trial you don't sleep very well for a very very long time I
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:41.640]  remember the good ones and there have been plenty of those because it's like a
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:46.880]  fight isn't it I mean absolutely you lose as a man you really feel like you
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:50.600]  lost oh yeah I disappear for several weeks after any trial when loser draw I
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:55.280]  just got to disappear for a while get my head together you know we use a sort of
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:58.800]  symbolism of combat it is like I call it the government in case the other day I
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.680]  said boys you all ready to sheath your swords and stop the bloodletting they're
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:06.120]  kind of shocked by that they kind of pause for 10 or 15 minutes and I mean
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:09.520]  but that's what it is trials are combat and I tell my clients some of them
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.440]  really want to charge forward to trial and there's too much machismo going on
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.880]  and I say look a couple of things I want to mention number one there's going to
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:20.240]  be blood everywhere and we're going to measure the victors by the buckets of
[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:24.960]  blood that's reality at at trials and secondly I always get to go home after
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:28.880]  the trials you have to have a sense of humility it's better to win the war
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.480]  strategically by never getting to the battlefield no question and of course we
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:35.600]  do a lot of representation that nobody sees doesn't make the news where we're
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:39.280]  helping people out of audits collection criminal investigations just letting the
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:43.080]  IRS know hey go pick on somebody else well I think there is an element to that
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.280]  because you know we we practice aggressively but collegially and
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:48.920]  professionally and I think my counterparts in the government that are
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:53.080]  opposite me respect that so yeah I think we do help our clients just by
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:56.800]  entering the fray and solving problems rather than just trial work we do a ton
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:00.640]  of other stuff that nobody sees but yeah I've noticed that because I've got a
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.640]  really good lawyer here in town and it just immediately gets people's
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:08.440]  attention a lot of times you pretty big operation stuff comes up from time to
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:12.160]  time immediately if you have a small lawyer I mean I mean you know that but
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.680]  for the audience I'm just telling them that that it really does matter well it
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:21.240]  does matter and the other thing is that we're not you know increasingly a huge
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:24.160]  percentage of federal criminal indictments are resolved by plea agreement
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.720]  and there's a very there's a huge coercion from the sentencing guidelines
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:32.080]  I mean you've got a businessman he's indicted for tax if he if he gets
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:35.520]  dinged with a felony counted trial he does seven to eight years maybe the
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:40.000]  please 18 months 24 months so this has a hugely coercive effect to to get
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.360]  please now when we come to a case we do trials we're not afraid of trials and
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:49.360]  and we win a lot of our trials so immediately our government counterparts
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:53.400]  understand okay this isn't going to be a bag man plea case this case could go to
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.320]  trial and they start counting their cost and their risk you know what's the
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:00.320]  problem yeah they'd rather feed on a bunch of innocent old ladies ruin their
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:03.960]  lives grab wedding rings off their fingers you know just let them commit
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.680]  suicide then actually go up against people that'll fight back they operate
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.280]  like muggers well easy targets easy targets when you have a predator type
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:18.320]  of system that those predators will go after the easy targets because it's the
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:21.760]  path of least resistance and well you know what you're talking about because
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:24.920]  I've just experienced this 17 years on air and getting out there and doing
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:28.640]  stuff in the you know up against these crooks and that's how I see it some of
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.040]  them are deadly do rights from my experience who were stupid and are made
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:35.520]  fun of by the higher ups that's really how this works but these are just
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.760]  criminals on the top that know exactly what they're doing and I don't know how
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:43.280]  they sleep at night wrecking the families doing the things they've done to
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:46.960]  people yeah you know the rationalization justification for putting people in prison
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:51.160]  for double digits over tax by the way we're the only country of the so-called
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:56.120]  civilized industrial nations that has criminal tax at all the criminal tax is
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:01.400]  the exception now Russia former Soviet Union Russia North Korea China knows
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.600]  a wonderful series of countries that have a criminal tax regime that's not
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:08.640]  good company we should not have criminal tax in the United States oh that's my
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:13.720]  next question for you and Joe popping anytime you know they grab the kids in
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.920]  Russia the orphans trying to be tax enforcers they beat you up as well so
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:20.440]  I guess that's only country worse than us well I mean you're the expert is Russia
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:24.760]  worse than us yeah well the Russian tax police that's a whole different
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:29.520]  really a mafia I mean it is but the fact is is that civilized nations truly
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:32.960]  civilized nations do not criminalize something like tax if you owe the
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:36.240]  government money the government has plenty of mechanisms to get that money
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:41.360]  from you but to put people in prison for owing tax liability or not filing the
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:45.320]  proper form North Korea China Russia Nazi Germany not good company well you
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.360]  know that's the company we're in and I argued with David K. Johnson from the
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.040]  New York Times about that he was appalled by my idea that criminal tax
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.960]  demonstrated we were uncivilized well it does and I've argued with Nathan
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:00.960]  Hulckman former assistant US Attorney General Tax Division for the United
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:04.080]  States he was appalled by that notion let me ask you a question I want to go
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:07.320]  back to the Wesley snipe because we got cut off by a break then we went off in
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:10.680]  another direction but finish up on this point is all the criminality and
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:14.680]  government coming out in triplicate and the fact that the IRS is giving out fake
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:20.000]  ID numbers and letting people steal and get fake returns the illegals and all
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.560]  the rest of this and then and then even blaming citizens when those get attached
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:27.640]  to social security numbers and using the fraud the IRS engaged in as a way to go
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:32.080]  grab citizens bank accounts and things and I mean is it making it easier for
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.720]  you to do your job as people begin to realize also that the ultra rich
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:40.000]  basically have it have exempted themselves as well I think there is a
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.840]  general awareness you know and I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do an
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.640]  explicitly political thing I like dissenters I want more dissenters in
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:50.920]  America I want more people are gonna rock the boat so the Tea Party movement
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:54.200]  for me was a good thing because it showed that there could be a vibrant
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:58.800]  robust political movement that wasn't party centric and it doesn't matter
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:02.840]  whether I endorse what they believe or not I like the communist workers I like
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:05.880]  the socialist workers party I want people that are gonna rock the boat and
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:10.000]  diselect Democrats and Republicans and I think there's a mood in the country of
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.920]  deepening suspicion I think Congress's popularity is down around and I'm not
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:20.280]  trying to say nine percent it's really low these are huge problems I mean once
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:25.920]  you lose the consent of the governed you have a you don't have a legitimate you
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:28.720]  don't have a legitimate you either go back to freedom or you've got a North
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:32.760]  Korea absolutely and that's where we're treading but I believe that there's an
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:38.680]  increasing awaken awakening in Americans regarding suspicion of the of the
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.440]  system suspicion of statements by government and I think that's positive
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:46.480]  I have hope you know I have hope that more Americans will recognize that these
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:50.160]  are political problems they're not necessarily the ones we don't need more
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.080]  legislation we need less and they need to get out there and start voting for
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:56.800]  people who are going to be truly independent well I agree anybody that
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.000]  isn't in the cookie cutter mold is the way to go just because it shakes up the
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.080]  system this type of tyranny depends on a very smooth road to get away you know
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.440]  with the crimes let me bring this up I also see this endless demonization of
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:12.640]  defense attorneys by media by culture oh they're the scum they're the trash from
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:17.080]  my experience everybody deserves a good defense because government is the big
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:21.720]  danger it's what killed more people in history than anything else 262 million
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:26.160]  the last century University of Hawaii did a study on democide it's the big
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:31.240]  danger and I have found that it's the it's the political prosecutors because
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:34.640]  there's good prosecutors to that will go to the wall to really get bad guys but
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.040]  more and more they just make deals and let them out they want I noticed these
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.240]  prosecutors to hammer down good people that are just trying to live their
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:47.000]  lives and for me that's why I thank God for the defense attorneys and I see this
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.600]  move to try to demonize defense attorneys quote getting bad guys off and
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.800]  letting it go to courts boy if they do that they've already neutered the
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:01.200]  grand jury all we're left with is the cartridge box yeah there's a lot of
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.760]  pandering going on from mainstream media about defense attorneys and evil
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:12.520]  defense attorneys seems to be a general program of defamation the fact is is
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:16.680]  that in the criminal defense realm we're accountable in open court on the record
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:21.320]  more so than any of the civil attorneys are they can play games with this discovery
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:25.640]  and engage in litigation thuggery while we're always accountable on the record
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:31.040]  every 30 to 60 days for what we're doing and how we're doing it my experience
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.160]  with the federal criminal defense bar is generally very positive there's
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:37.440]  exceptions to that and I notice you mentioned something Alex and I want to
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:42.360]  make a point about this I know some really fine lawyers and fine men at US
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:47.640]  Department of Justice tax division that I've been opposite in cases and local
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:52.360]  prosecutors who believe in what they're doing who follow the rules who don't
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:56.000]  violate the Constitution and laws of the United States respecting discovery to
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:59.760]  the defense and really what one of the one of the things that really bothers me
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:03.040]  is all of those good men and women that are actually inside the system and are
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.240]  behaving with integrity they get stroked with all of this massive misconduct
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.600]  well that's the problem the good people get out historically and then the
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:15.880]  criminals create little armies that then expand and then take over yes when
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:20.760]  bad conduct is incentive rather than disincentive it does drive out the
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:24.360]  ethical and the good and the men and women that want to do a public service
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.920]  because there's bad guys out there we live in a dangerous world and I believe
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:30.880]  in law and order even though I'm a libertarian but I believe in law and
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:34.360]  order and I'm an objective moralist that means and that means law and order in
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:37.760]  the government first absolutely the government is the great teacher we learn
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:41.400]  by them if the government breaks the rules and gets away with it with impunity
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:45.640]  what does that teach the fish rods from the head absolutely some things roll
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:49.400]  downhill Joe you've been sitting here this guy's amazing because I've seen him
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:51.840]  on TV before I was sitting there looking I want to see this call over
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.440]  television he's impressive I mean we know why he's one of the best lawyers out
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:59.800]  there I guess I just really how did you snag this guy I guess you're a good guy
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:03.960]  too well a month or two after I resigned from the IRS in 99 really right around
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.360]  the same time that you first interviewed me I get a call from this Bob
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:11.200]  Bernhoff from Milwaukee and you know I was like a deer caught in the headlights
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:15.440]  I just wanted to make a living to support my family and leave the IRS
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:19.080]  behind but people were calling me and wanting to get in contact with me so
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:27.480]  that's when I first met Bob and had no idea the extent of the monster that was
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:33.200]  out there eating people up and so it helped me to understand that and then
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.160]  I became involved in it and of course that's what led to the IRS you know
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:41.560]  really taking a dislike into me after I left because I was trying to get into
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:46.400]  that apparatus actually was not trying to get into the apparatus people wanted
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:51.040]  me to come in and help the effort now you were drug into I didn't want I had
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:54.320]  enough of the IRS frankly but remember at first I was trying to get you back on
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:57.680]  the radio and stuff you're like I don't know right now I'm just I might just be
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:02.600]  a CPA I might a lot of it but now like you've you've been with me since the
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:07.080]  beginning Alex I mean I was just I was like March who was it was it was it
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:11.240]  media bypass you were first in yeah Pat Shannon called me that's right
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:15.920]  we get Pat Shannon back on he he was on my radio show to my Oklahoma City being
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.120]  a staged event and he said hey I'm going I'm doing a story on this you know
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:27.040]  Treasury agent who investigated things and woke things up you want to talk to
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.240]  him I said okay well what's his number and so I had gone out and interviewed you
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:34.240]  by the time his newspaper article or magazine article came out now that my
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.400]  memory gets refreshed very exciting yeah that was the tax issue for 1999 but
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.000]  you've now been through the fire my friend well thanks to unfortunately you
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.320]  don't you're not innocent till proven guilty you need to find someone who can
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:52.840]  communicate your innocence and I've just been blessed to have mr. Bernhoft mr.
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.800]  Dijkstein people that could communicate to the jury no the government
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:02.040]  really doesn't deserve that reputation for honesty and integrity that you think
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.400]  they have open up your mind and listen to the end what you look at the evidence
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:10.520]  and that's what it took and and they acquitted me and mr. Bernhoff let me
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:15.960]  ask you a question on this front can you bring in let's say you were doing a
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:21.760]  trial right now of another you know agent whistleblower somebody like our
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:26.800]  guest here today what could you bring in the fact that John Corzine was allowed
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:30.080]  to take billions of dollars and say he doesn't know where it went and then now
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:34.040]  they admit he really did give it to another bank I mean could you bring up
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.840]  hey the big bankers they get to keep billions but he hasn't done anything and
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:41.240]  he's in trouble or is that not admissible no it's not you know that
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:45.280]  stuff doesn't come in now there's an old-spring court case that says that in
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:49.600]  closing argument defense attorneys have to be given wings to sore that's a great
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:52.960]  quote and it's true but you can only bring in testimony and evidence that's
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:57.160]  going to be relevant to the charges to either that tend to disprove them we we
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:00.520]  can bring an impeachment evidence against government witnesses and we can
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:03.480]  certainly do you say this same government let's John Corzine take
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:06.880]  billions that disappear but then they want to send him to jail when he hasn't
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  taken a single sin that can be done and that can be done in closing argument
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:15.440]  closing argument in Joe's case was very very aggressive and I mean there were
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:19.200]  there was talk of jack booted thugs and all sorts of interesting things but no
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:22.560]  you can do that yet they would testimony and evidence is one thing a closing
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.560]  argument you can draw parallels you can put it to the jury that they've got a
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:30.320]  decision to make that there's a double standard operating here and that the
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.080]  government is not behaving correctly towards your client the defendant who's
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:37.640]  in the who's in the block and stands to go to prison for 15 16 years finishing up
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:40.280]  with Wesley Snive something at a final segment you guys can talk about whatever
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:45.360]  you'd like I'm just in awe here you know hearing all of this you had gotten to the
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:49.040]  point of how they were trying to try the case in the media and claiming he'd run
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:52.160]  from justice and I remember right away in the news you guys went this is
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:57.400]  propaganda he was always intending to be here here he is right we had to whatever
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:00.800]  jury was finally in that box in the courtroom and and I'll tell you some
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:07.440]  judge William Terrell Hodges was an excellent judge he's very hard-nosed but
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.280]  I'll tell you what he was a great evidence man a great evidence judge and
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:14.680]  he gave us a fair trial now we fought for that fair trial through motion
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.440]  practice and there's a certain thing that that happens between advocates and
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.840]  federal judges who preside over particularly criminal trials and you
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:26.000]  either obtain a respect for each other or you don't but nobody gets any respect
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.280]  in the federal criminal process by not being aggressive and advocating
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.040]  zealously for your client but in the Snipes case you've got a you've got to
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:37.720]  get people to reject that propaganda the misinformation and we consistently said
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.520]  look 12 people are going to be in that jury box and they're the ones who are
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:46.080]  going to hear actual testimony and evidence not rumor not innuendo not
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:50.440]  propaganda and those are the themes that we beat we drilled those themes and we
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:53.920]  had to I did a walk and talk with Steve Barrett great reporter from Orlando a
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.920]  TV station down there and we we pummeled back against this propaganda if you
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:03.000]  don't do that those jurors are going to go in there with absolute misinformation
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.280]  in their minds and they won't pay attention to the actual truth the
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:09.240]  actual testimony and evidence and then you're in trouble and that's when you
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:12.200]  lose and that's when you get convicted and that's what would have happened down
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:16.200]  there no question about it the other thing is is you know there was some
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:20.560]  discovery violations in the Snipes case those never became really public we were
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:25.040]  really put to it by the prosecution team they were revealing sometimes hundreds
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:29.760]  of pages of crucial documents the day after a particular trial day at 5 5 30
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:33.320]  and we had to spend all night mastering that material so we could step up the
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:37.000]  next morning it was a very very difficult they were hoping you'd be lazy
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:40.360]  and go back to the hotel and get a scotch you'd have to stay up all night
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:43.200]  but tell you some people have a misapprehension of how trials work once
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:46.320]  you go we call it going into the trial hole you go into the trial hole you are
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.720]  off the grid nobody you don't even know if you're a winner absolutely you've got
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:54.120]  to be prepared to get a couple of hours to sleep a night take it seriously and
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:57.600]  the work is extraordinary nobody sees that that's all that work that goes
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.840]  behind the scenes joke and testify to that how many how many nights and the
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.480]  defendant better jump in and paddle that's another thing people think high
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:08.120]  powered lawyers you know because the media actually just show up in a
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:13.160]  helicopter and win because they're no it's a bunch of it's a real work in some
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:16.040]  of it's extremely tedious you know you got a case the Snipes case said over a
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:19.720]  million pages of discovery documents you don't master those documents you're
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.120]  gonna lose and that's the sort of paging through page after page after page I
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:28.960]  mean that's what it's come from yeah I think I think you had what 58 boxes of
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:32.560]  discovery a couple hundred thousand pages so that's the sort of work that
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:36.720]  goes on behind the scenes trial success is a function of knowledge skill
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.680]  experience but most importantly mastery of the facts and the documents if you're
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:44.920]  not willing to get dirty roll up your sleeves with your team and your client
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:48.760]  like Joe who helped us through his discovery and drill down night well
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:51.840]  that sounds like a life in general I mean the system counts on us just being
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:56.040]  lazy lying the surface we'll be right back final incredible segment with both
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:02.680]  our guests I'm Alex Jones info wars.com we've lived in this neighborhood for
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:06.760]  years we have an alarm system and all of our doors have dead bolts they kicked
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:10.800]  in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes the police
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:15.080]  arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:20.360]  guns I kept thinking what if my family had been home the police officers said
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:24.480]  that more than 85 percent of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:29.640]  alone don't stop intruders the officer told me to go to easy armor.com if we

[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:25.400]  we're ending this segment this interview with a good song Johnny Cash when
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.160]  the man comes around there'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:36.720]  comes around Robert G. Bernhoft probably the most I can't think of
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:39.280]  anybody more preeminent than you when it comes to tax terms honored to have you
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:42.680]  and I can't think of somebody more honorable and preeminent when it comes
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:46.560]  to standing up for what's right that'll make a movie about your life Joe Banister
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.800]  agent for truth.com agent for truth.com and again Bernhoft law.com

[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:12.440]  watching at prisonplanet.tv and so please get this video and get it out to
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:18.680]  everybody that's a question I have for you Robert when does the man come to
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.160]  town because you earlier you said we're treading water between North Korea and
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:25.120]  Liberty we're gonna choose one or the other we're gonna go back the other
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:30.360]  direction towards freedom or we're gonna go down the black hole I mean is the man
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.040]  gonna come around people are waking up but the system is deciding to go with
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:38.240]  tyranny how do you see this with your considerable gravitas how do you see this
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:43.560]  ending I mean what's your gut tell you that that that's that's a heavy and
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:49.240]  loaded question it's a great one in my sphere taking a putting aside from
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:54.600]  politics if we don't stop if we don't stem this epidemic of investigative and
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.240]  prosecutorial misconduct we're in deep trouble if our federal criminal process
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:04.280]  it continues to be debauched by concealment and deceit ethics violations
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.680]  constitutional violations it's over for the American Republic I mean we used to
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:13.320]  be sort of like the lighthouse on the hill the example of great judicial
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:17.120]  systems the whole world look to the United States for our rules of evidence
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:21.280]  of procedure our process our jury trials we're losing that we're becoming a
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.240]  laughing stock yeah the great Americans and look at they can't even get a fair
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:29.400]  trial for a former sitting United States senator if we don't stem it if we
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  don't look at how they put that governor in jail in Alabama for no reason
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.840]  yeah that was admitted a fraud and the amazing thing about the former senator
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:40.240]  Stevens prosecution and there's thousands of these cases that one gets
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.960]  all the publicity because he was a former US senator and that shifted the
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:47.280]  balance of power in the United States Senate but when you think about the
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:50.880]  Stevens case that was prosecuted by the highest level of Department of Justice
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:55.240]  in Washington the Office of Public Integrity OPR they couldn't get that
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:59.600]  right and they want to say that line a USA's assistant US attorneys really
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:05.880]  understand the discovery rules this needs to stop and and responsible
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:09.960]  prosecutors are for changing the rules and disciplining prosecutors who do not
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:13.560]  follow the rules federal judges are getting sick and tired of what about
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:16.960]  when it comes out that we've got to do five minutes overdrive you can do it
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:19.680]  just to finish up this little addendum we have kind of you know that little
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:25.920]  extra a reserve tank what how do they get away with this because because more
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.760]  and more it's just coming out that the sky's the limit yeah I think they're
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:34.000]  doing it on purpose basically well the incentives are to win at all cost and
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:38.080]  when you have an incentive to do that people start breaking the rules and
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:42.080]  then they start becoming rewarded for breaking the rules with conviction
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:46.040]  rates promotions and the things that they want and then they recognize that
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:49.400]  they never get caught and if they do get caught they never get punished well you
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:52.040]  saw the case in Williamson County it's famous when where they knew the guy
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:55.160]  really didn't do it but and they suppressed evidence and they tried to
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:59.480]  keep the guy in prison I mean how does somebody try to put in people who aren't
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:03.840]  even criminals it's bad enough to set up an ex-con and send them away but well
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:07.000]  they shouldn't have been out but now it's just set up totally innocent people
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:12.040]  yeah you look at the prosecutor in the non-rape duke lacrosse case for example
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:15.680]  which of course no rape occurred and that was all politics by the prosecutor
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:19.440]  he's the only prosecutor that's been meaningfully disciplined for massive
[02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:25.000]  government misconduct in a very very long time so what happens is even if the
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.560]  judge makes what's called a judicial referral of a prosecutor to a for the
[02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:33.000]  bar association where that prosecutor has his license the bars don't discipline
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:36.240]  the prosecutors tell it back in one minute of five minute overdrive I've got
[02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:40.640]  to hear more about the lacrosse case stay with us

[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:10.360]  are important for people that we forgot to get to. Well you asked me a
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:14.680]  question before alex about where I see things going and that's always a tough
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:18.520]  thing to reach into the crystal ball and see it but I'm really I'm really
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:23.080]  hopeful that particularly the young generations I see my children I see some
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:27.360]  of my age peers children there they pay attention there they think more
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:32.280]  critically I think we had a couple of lost generations I'm hopeful that this
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:37.960]  new generation is paying attention I know they are I talked to my children's
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:41.920]  friends these kids are engaged I'm encouraged by all the youth that are
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:45.600]  supporting Ron Paul and backing Dr. Paul and I know there's been some
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:48.920]  controversies with that but the bottom line is I don't care which political
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:54.200]  tack they want to take I want these kids to get out there get awake pay
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:57.960]  attention and start holding people accountable in your local you know your
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:01.080]  local your city your county your state government your national government by
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:04.200]  the way the system you're right you've got your finger on the pulse they have
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:08.320]  been bemoaning that this new generation 20 or under really don't trust the
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:11.200]  government and and they don't like abortion even though we push it and
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:14.440]  they don't like corruption they like guns they like freedom yeah they're
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:18.760]  rebelling against their control freak North Korea loving weirdo corporate
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:22.600]  commie parents and they're sick and tired of what they're watching on the TV and
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:28.600]  that's why they're streaming to shows like this to get unbiased different
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:32.440]  viewpoints among my daughters they won't even watch the nightly news they
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.240]  understand that that's absolute propaganda and crop propaganda at that so I
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:39.760]  have hope for America I think this this generation that's coming up right now
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:44.000]  between 15 and 25 they're gonna make a difference and it's our job we're all
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.440]  older than they are it's our job to set some leadership examples and give these
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:52.000]  kids something they can seek they sink their teeth into get politically active
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  so that they know they don't have to become you know desperate and weary by
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.920]  the fight we need to give them hope the fight's exciting it is doing the right
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:02.800]  things exciting sure Robert G. Bernhardt let me ask you this question in
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:07.840]  closing we know what woke Joe banister Rob what woke you up how'd you get on
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:13.120]  this path hmm I've also had a problem with authority Alex and I think that's
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:19.080]  true this goes way back when I just I really despise and have a have a hatred
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:25.200]  for bullies for bullies and for people who claim to have power that don't have
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:29.120]  the authority that's supposed to be behind the power victimizing and abusing
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:32.960]  people who can't fight back it's always been a problem for me I think that's one
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:37.040]  of the reasons I'm motivated to do the work I do and so that's how it works for
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:41.160]  me you're stopping bad people yeah and we're helping good people like Joe and
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:44.160]  people all over the country and that's exciting I it's really a blessing to be
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:46.840]  able to make a difference I think all three of us are on the same page that's
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:51.520]  why you got into law enforcement I mean I I saw the police dealing drugs I
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:54.680]  didn't even use them I drank beer I saw the police dealing drugs where I lived
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.280]  in Dallas and then and then arresting people for drugs that somebody they'd
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:04.160]  sold to had sold them and I and the cops will pull me over want to search my
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:06.880]  car is on a few years high school there in a few years here that's why you had
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:10.120]  to move down here is they were threatened to kill me my dad's lawyer called and
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:12.240]  said the word is they're gonna kill your son if you don't move them out of the
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:15.000]  school district we say well whatever we'll sell the dental office and move to
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:18.680]  awesome my mom already wanted to but in closing I'm telling that story and I
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:21.480]  just in the cops will pull me over I'd go I don't deal drugs like you they would
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:26.360]  get so mad they'd arrest me for no reason my dad come get me out I mean
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:30.120]  that was my wake-up dangerous to be right you go I'm like you're dealing
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:34.080]  drugs and you want to you want to search my truck what we're saying just it's
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:37.140]  important to put the word out to all the people in law enforcement and
[03:04:37.140 --> 03:04:40.400]  government you know do a little in Adam remember your anatomy class you've got
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:44.840]  this little bone down the center your back it's called your spine exactly and
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:48.400]  by the way the cops that were doing that Rockwell Texas six months after we
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:52.680]  moved out of there they all got basically arrested for drug dealing by the
[03:04:52.680 --> 03:04:56.520]  feds though who were actually bringing in to begin with amazing interviews
