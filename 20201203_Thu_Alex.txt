[00:00.000 --> 00:22.960]  The Democrats had this election rigged right from the beginning.
[00:22.960 --> 00:29.220]  They used the pandemic, sometimes referred to as the China virus, where it originated,
[00:29.220 --> 00:35.160]  as an excuse to mail out tens of millions of ballots, which ultimately led to a big
[00:35.160 --> 00:41.840]  part of the fraud, a fraud that the whole world is watching, and there is no one happier
[00:41.840 --> 00:44.640]  right now than China.
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.520]  So we're not looking to show you 25 faulty or fraudulent votes, which don't mean anything
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.440]  because it doesn't overturn the state, or 50 or 100.
[00:56.440 --> 01:04.680]  We're showing you hundreds of thousands, far more than we need, far more than the margin,
[01:04.680 --> 01:07.740]  far more than the law requires.
[01:07.740 --> 01:13.480]  We can show many times what is necessary to win the state.
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.520]  The media knows this, but they don't want to report it.
[01:17.520 --> 01:25.000]  In fact, they outright refuse to even cover it, because they know the result, if they
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.100]  do.
[01:27.100 --> 01:33.480]  Even what I'm saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that's okay.
[01:33.480 --> 01:41.800]  I just keep on going forward because I'm representing 74 million people, and in fact, I'm also
[01:41.800 --> 01:46.500]  representing all of the people that didn't vote for me.
[01:46.500 --> 01:52.160]  The mail-in voting scam is the latest part of their four-year effort to overturn the
[01:52.160 --> 01:58.520]  results of the 2016 election, and it's been like living in hell.
[01:58.520 --> 02:05.720]  Our opponents have proven many times, again and again, that they will say and do anything
[02:05.720 --> 02:07.520]  to get back into power.
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.640]  The corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.120]  people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another.
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.640]  We've been watching it now for four years.
[02:23.640 --> 02:29.960]  These entrenched interests oppose our movement because we put America first.
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.120]  They don't put America first, and we're returning power to you, the American people.
[02:36.120 --> 02:38.040]  They don't want America first.
[02:38.040 --> 02:40.840]  They only want power for themselves.
[02:40.840 --> 02:42.720]  They want to make money.
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.720]  That's why they don't want me as your president.
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.560]  I've been investigated from soon after I announced I was running for president.
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.320]  When I immediately went to number one in the Republican primary polls, the investigations
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.960]  never stopped.
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.720]  They went on for four years, and I won them all.
[03:02.720 --> 03:03.920]  I beat them all.
[03:03.920 --> 03:05.800]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.680]  The impeachment hoax, and so much more.
[03:09.680 --> 03:17.600]  Robert Mueller spent $48 million of taxpayer money investigating me for two and a half
[03:17.600 --> 03:29.800]  years, issued over 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, issued 230 orders
[03:29.800 --> 03:36.600]  for communications records, and conducted 500 witness interviews all looking to take
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.560]  me down.
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.960]  There was no collusion in the end, none whatsoever.
[03:42.960 --> 03:49.400]  Senator Marco Rubio, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated the committee
[03:49.400 --> 03:57.160]  found no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.720]  government, and I thank Senator Rubio for that statement.
[04:01.720 --> 04:07.600]  Now I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.640]  of information to New York so that they can try to get me there.
[04:12.640 --> 04:15.720]  It's all been gone over, over and over again.
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.000]  For $48 million, you go through tax returns, you go through everything.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.560]  The New York Attorney General, who recently ran for office, campaigned without knowing
[04:27.560 --> 04:35.840]  me, stating, we will join with law enforcement and other attorneys general across this nation
[04:35.840 --> 04:38.760]  in removing this president from office.
[04:38.760 --> 04:40.560]  I never met him.
[04:40.560 --> 04:46.800]  It's important that everybody understands, she said, that the days of Donald Trump are
[04:46.800 --> 04:48.840]  coming to an end.
[04:48.840 --> 04:57.200]  And all it's been is a big investigation in Washington, New York, and any place else
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.200]  that...
[04:58.200 --> 05:06.040]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with MyPatriot because they have agreements with

[06:05.400 --> 06:30.880]  And by the way, without question, deeply affected the outcome of our presidential election here
[06:30.880 --> 06:36.000]  in the United States, the coronavirus pandemic, and it's not what we thought it was.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.640]  We've been lied to.
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.360]  The latest evidence comes from samples collected during Red Cross blood drives last year and
[06:43.360 --> 06:46.240]  now analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control.
[06:46.240 --> 06:50.840]  In a study published on Monday, researchers tested 39 blood samples from the states of
[06:50.840 --> 06:54.280]  California, Washington, and Oregon.
[06:54.280 --> 07:01.160]  That blood was collected between December 13 and December 16, 2019.
[07:01.160 --> 07:04.600]  No one in the United States had heard of COVID-19.
[07:04.600 --> 07:09.240]  The Chinese government didn't even acknowledge its existence until December 31.
[07:09.240 --> 07:15.040]  And yet every one of those samples just tested has come back positive for the coronavirus
[07:15.040 --> 07:17.680]  antibodies, all of them.
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.920]  Keep in mind that antibodies don't develop for at least a week after exposure to the
[07:21.920 --> 07:23.320]  virus.
[07:23.320 --> 07:28.720]  That means the Wuhan coronavirus was being transmitted throughout the American population
[07:28.720 --> 07:33.800]  far earlier, possibly months earlier, than we were told.
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.440]  What does that mean exactly, and how did it happen?
[07:37.440 --> 07:41.120]  We don't know yet how it happened, but we know for certain that it did.
[07:41.120 --> 07:46.640]  The CDC has found dozens more positive samples from blood tests taken at the beginning at
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.560]  the end of December, and they found them in many other parts of the country, across the
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.440]  country, Michigan, Iowa, Massachusetts.
[07:54.440 --> 07:59.840]  Analysis of tests in other countries has shown even earlier spread of the virus.
[07:59.840 --> 08:05.400]  Scientists now know the coronavirus spread to Italy as early as last September, and
[08:05.400 --> 08:08.640]  to South America two months later in November.
[08:08.640 --> 08:13.720]  So clearly what we have been told for almost a year about the origins of the coronavirus
[08:13.720 --> 08:16.240]  is not true.
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.400]  Why are we just learning this now, a month after a presidential election?
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.240]  We've had reliable antibody tests since the summer, so no one thought to test Red Cross
[08:25.240 --> 08:28.040]  blood samples until now?
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.880]  Why weren't elected officials demanding a coherent account of where this virus, this
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.640]  virus that has changed American history forever, where this virus came from, how it got to
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.360]  the United States, and how it spread through our population?
[08:41.360 --> 08:43.120]  Why don't we know that yet?
[08:43.120 --> 08:45.400]  Because nobody seemed to care.
[08:45.400 --> 08:48.680]  Elected officials were too busy enjoying their newfound power.
[08:48.680 --> 08:53.760]  They were shutting down small businesses, arresting people for kayaking without masks.
[08:53.760 --> 08:58.440]  Back in January, 11 months ago, the Department of Homeland Security warned that American
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.160]  airports could be ground zero for a new pandemic.
[09:02.160 --> 09:03.760]  But Congress yawned.
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.640]  They were occupied that day.
[09:05.640 --> 09:11.680]  On January 24th, a day when these blood samples now prove the virus had already spread across
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.560]  the continent, the Trump administration held a classified briefing on the coronavirus for
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.080]  the entire U.S. Senate, but only 14 senators showed up for it.
[09:21.080 --> 09:22.680]  Why was that?
[09:22.680 --> 09:29.360]  Well, that briefing was held on the very same day as the deadline, for instance, for impeachment.
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.240]  So the people in charge of protecting the country were not worried about coronavirus.
[09:33.240 --> 09:37.640]  Instead, they were standing in front of their mirrors rehearsing their star turns, the moment
[09:37.640 --> 09:42.880]  when they could finally confront Alan Dershowitz about the dreaded Zelinski phone call.
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.920]  Now they're claiming the pandemic caught them completely by surprise.
[09:46.920 --> 09:48.560]  How do they get away with that?
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.040]  They get away with it because their public health establishment gives them cover and
[09:52.040 --> 09:54.920]  has all year.
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.880]  Two days before that classified senate briefing that only 14 senators showed up for, Dr. Tony
[09:59.880 --> 10:03.440]  Fauci went on television to reassure Americans they could relax.
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.160]  Calm down, America.
[10:05.160 --> 10:07.800]  You can trust the Chinese government.
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.800]  If the Chinese are telling us that this virus jumped from a pangolin in a wet market and
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.120]  no one even knew it existed until New Year's Eve and we're doing our very best to contain
[10:17.120 --> 10:20.240]  it, then that's what happened.
[10:20.240 --> 10:23.720]  China has been known to fiddle with their stats before.
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.400]  Do you trust what they are telling us about this illness?
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.360]  From what I can see right now, they really are being much, much more transparent than
[10:33.360 --> 10:37.720]  what happened with SARS, where they really kept back information for a while.
[10:37.720 --> 10:39.680]  It was embarrassing to them.
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.240]  They're really transparent now.
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.680]  They put the sequence of the virus up on the public database right away.
[10:45.680 --> 10:49.160]  So in that respect, they've been transparent.
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.800]  They're really transparent now, said Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.760]  Now in a well-functioning country, a line like that would make certain that you never
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.360]  work in public policy again.
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.120]  Transparent, transparently dishonest.
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.840]  We know that for certain.
[11:06.840 --> 11:10.440]  These officials are now claiming the virus came to their country from somewhere else.
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.720]  It arrived in frozen food, possibly as a bio-weapon, staged by the U.S. military.
[11:16.720 --> 11:18.400]  They're not saying that in secret.
[11:18.400 --> 11:20.800]  They're saying it on social media.
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.960]  But so far, Twitter hasn't bothered to fact-check that claim.
[11:24.960 --> 11:28.040]  Like Tony Fauci, Silicon Valley trusts China.
[11:28.040 --> 11:30.560]  Trust China far more than they trust you.
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.880]  Ron Klain trusts China too.
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.000]  Ron Klain is Joe Biden's pick for White House Chief of Staff.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.040]  On January 27th of this year, Klain told Axios that China has been, quote, more transparent
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.040]  and more candid than it has been during past outbreaks.
[11:46.040 --> 11:48.680]  Why did Ron Klain think that?
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.720]  Possibly because the World Health Organization told him to think so.
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.600]  On January 8th, the WHO, funded of course by the Chinese government, released a similar
[11:57.600 --> 11:58.600]  message.
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.040]  Here it is, quote, preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.600]  is a notable achievement and demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.
[12:08.600 --> 12:10.920]  It was like a press release.
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.520]  In other words, the rest of us ought to be thanking the government of China for the blessing
[12:15.520 --> 12:17.280]  of COVID-19.
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.280]  Much appreciated.
[12:18.280 --> 12:24.640]  A week later, the WHO was back with more demonstrably untrue propaganda straight from their overlords
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.920]  in Beijing, quote, preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have
[12:29.920 --> 12:35.320]  found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.
[12:35.320 --> 12:40.920]  That was yet another dangerous lie that without question cost American lives, but Twitter
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.720]  didn't fact check that either.
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.640]  Instead, the American media, as a group, dutifully amplified the message.
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.320]  China did nothing wrong, they told us.
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.440]  Anyone who suggests otherwise, who suggests this thoroughly Chinese virus came from China,
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.920]  is by definition a racist.
[12:57.920 --> 13:00.720]  Whose fault is it that Americans are dying from the virus?
[13:00.720 --> 13:02.160]  It's America's fault.
[13:02.160 --> 13:03.160]  It's your fault.
[13:03.160 --> 13:04.160]  Stop asking questions.
[13:04.160 --> 13:07.680]  And by the way, they're still saying that.
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.200]  So thorough was the news blackout on the origins of this virus, the Chinese origins, that you
[13:13.200 --> 13:17.040]  had to go to Australian television to find out what was actually happening.
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.680]  From the very beginning throughout December, it was spreading, and we now know it was spreading
[13:22.680 --> 13:29.920]  human-to-human, but the official line of the Chinese government was that this was all related
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.320]  to an animal market, and once they closed the market.
[13:34.320 --> 13:41.080]  And if you said that back in March, and back in April, and back in May, Twitter, Facebook,
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.160]  Google would all block you.
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.480]  And then when medical doctors and hospital heads and top virologists, the head of universities
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.440]  came out and said, it does have gained a function, it has spread human-to-human, but it only
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.880]  kills you if you're debilitated and don't have the right vitamins and minerals.
[13:58.880 --> 14:02.080]  They would then censor them as well.
[14:02.080 --> 14:08.920]  And now, all these different videos of legislative testimony in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.760]  Arizona, and other areas, powerful eyewitnesses from the Postal Service, and UPS, and whistleblowers
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.760]  that got video of the fraud and the thumb drives being illegally loaded with info and
[14:20.760 --> 14:22.520]  taken away and then brought back.
[14:22.520 --> 14:28.240]  When one of those videos goes up and gets a half million views in a couple hours, they
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.200]  don't just put a label saying it's disputed, they take down legislative, sworn under oath
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.200]  testimony.
[14:35.200 --> 14:42.720]  This isn't just censorship, this is an electronic, straight jacket to push the gaslighting that
[14:42.720 --> 14:49.960]  Joe Biden won, but finally, President Trump, yesterday afternoon, in that 49-minute press
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.640]  conference that we basically aired the whole thing on the war room, we aired large excerpts
[14:54.640 --> 15:01.360]  of it on election countdown, people kept asking me, well, why do you have a show called Election
[15:01.360 --> 15:05.960]  Countdown that you say is going to go through into February?
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.480]  Because we knew this was going to be disputed, the Democrats were never going to concede,
[15:10.480 --> 15:17.160]  and so they just announced Biden the winner with fraud.
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.920]  Plan A was to have a huge landslide victory through fraud, that didn't work, Trump's landslide
[15:20.920 --> 15:26.280]  was so big, so they froze the polls, froze the counting, said they did, really kept it
[15:26.280 --> 15:31.800]  going and brought in, in some cases, thousands of votes without even one Trump vote in them,
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.240]  they're that lazy, they don't care, they think they've got media cover to engage in whatever
[15:37.240 --> 15:38.960]  crime they want.
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.200]  And now, they're calling it the American virus, and if you call it the Chinese virus, you
[15:44.200 --> 15:46.440]  get restricted on the line as well.
[15:46.440 --> 15:52.360]  Big tech are anti-American criminals, merging with Big Pharma to carry out this medical
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.560]  technocracy dictatorship takeover, we must resist it.
[15:57.560 --> 16:04.680]  Introducing M4Ware's life, pure turmeric extract, this is taken under the tongue, it is pure
[16:04.680 --> 16:10.600]  turmeric, it goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that
[16:10.600 --> 16:15.600]  is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.760]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.920]  then absorbed by the stomach, so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.400]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates, and our first product got rave
[16:28.400 --> 16:31.960]  reviews, we've now been testing this out for several months, some of our staff like it
[16:31.960 --> 16:37.440]  more than bodies, some like bodies better, for me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.040]  action and so much more, and they fund the M4Ware.

[16:56.200 --> 17:00.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.600]  That means a globalist-imposed, worldwide depression to break us and bring us under
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.600]  their control.
[17:05.600 --> 17:06.600]  That's their state-admitted plan.
[17:06.600 --> 17:11.200]  Justin Trudeau is on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors, they admit
[17:11.200 --> 17:15.280]  it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.320]  But if we expose that they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[17:19.320 --> 17:20.800]  power and total control.
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.200]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world, here in the US, thousands of sheriffs
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.920]  are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally starting to fight back.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.120]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.

[18:24.440 --> 18:32.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the Infowars.com
[18:32.120 --> 18:53.720]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[18:53.720 --> 18:58.480]  We are back live, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.640]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to show you the inventor of the PCR test, coming
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.720]  out and saying it is not accurate to test for viruses, that is not what it's designed
[19:08.720 --> 19:13.200]  to do, and you can turn it up to any point you want to find whatever it is you claim
[19:13.200 --> 19:21.680]  you're looking for, PCR test in the crosshairs, next segment.
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.280]  As they're all over the news saying we're testing more Americans, now they've tested
[19:25.280 --> 19:34.680]  something like 60 million Americans, and oh my gosh, now 2,777 people died yesterday,
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.280]  they're saying from COVID or COVID related things, which means you give them a test
[19:40.280 --> 19:48.440]  that the German courts have now ruled are 96% false positive, but if the hospitals test
[19:48.440 --> 19:54.280]  you and you say you're positive, if it says you're positive, they get an additional, what
[19:54.280 --> 20:02.800]  is it, $13,000 just to admit you, if they intubate you, another $39,000, and then if
[20:02.800 --> 20:06.440]  you die, even more money.
[20:06.440 --> 20:09.640]  That's why it's only certain hospitals where you have most of the death, because they are
[20:09.640 --> 20:18.200]  killing people that they see as useless eaters, mainly homeless, and in the few promo videos
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.720]  that are out there of the supposed full hospitals that we know are empty, they'll have a few
[20:22.720 --> 20:27.600]  homeless in there that they can dress up and wear their old spacesuits with and try to
[20:27.600 --> 20:31.600]  scare everybody, but I've talked to the top medical doctors, you've seen all the interviews,
[20:31.600 --> 20:36.120]  you've seen all the evidence, and I talked to the owner of one of the big genetic engineering
[20:36.120 --> 20:41.680]  companies, just happened to run into him, not going to say how or where, because after
[20:41.680 --> 20:49.360]  he talked to me, his lawyers found out he talked to me, and he said it was, don't repeat
[20:49.360 --> 20:53.920]  this for me, but you can tell people this, and his lawyers found out about it, and I
[20:53.920 --> 20:59.400]  got calls within an hour of talking to that guy to say, please do not say his name, please
[20:59.400 --> 21:00.400]  do not say it, please.
[21:00.400 --> 21:04.200]  But he's just like one of these rich billionaire scientists, I tell you what he really thinks,
[21:04.200 --> 21:10.440]  Fauzi's a total fraud, Gates is a fraud, he works with them, his company does real genetically
[21:10.440 --> 21:17.760]  engineered nanotech with anti cancer antibodies for the colon, all sorts of stuff, and he said
[21:17.760 --> 21:25.680]  it's absolutely like you say, Jones, they turn the PCR test up so high that everybody
[21:25.680 --> 21:30.360]  supposedly has COVID when you don't have ever had a coronavirus, last decade it shows it,
[21:30.360 --> 21:35.960]  or a flu virus, but he said plus the Corona vaccine is a fraud, because your body doesn't
[21:35.960 --> 21:41.080]  even see COVID-19 as enough of a threat to keep an immunity going, most people won't
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.880]  even get antibodies with it, and that's what's come out in other big studies, is you don't
[21:46.880 --> 21:52.360]  keep the immunity because your body doesn't even see it as a threat, so they have to add
[21:52.360 --> 21:56.120]  all these other adjuvants into the shots to try to make your body see it as a threat
[21:56.120 --> 22:00.080]  to have a response, and now they're worried that every time you get a regular cold you
[22:00.080 --> 22:06.240]  could die of an autoimmune response, so what they're giving you is an allergic reaction
[22:06.240 --> 22:12.800]  to the regular cold virus that's the most common, so instead of you beating it 99% of
[22:12.800 --> 22:17.360]  the time, you're going to get deathly ill and have an autoimmune response, and they're
[22:17.360 --> 22:22.520]  going to call it COVID-19, when what really killed almost everybody during the Spanish
[22:22.520 --> 22:36.320]  flu, 50 million is estimated, was the autoimmune response, the autoimmune response, and of
[22:36.320 --> 22:42.000]  course masks were all the rage then, and they became incubators for bacterial pneumonia,
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.880]  and they estimate Dr. Fauci wrote a paper on this in 2007 that most of the deaths were
[22:47.880 --> 22:56.120]  caused by bacterial pneumonia, so this is what the real medical science is saying, and this
[22:56.120 --> 23:01.720]  is what they're trying to suppress, and I've got a lot of news on that coming up, and then
[23:01.720 --> 23:06.240]  I'm going to hit from some credible speech yesterday, we've got the highlights here,
[23:06.240 --> 23:10.160]  that's exactly what he needs to be doing, with 49 days left he did it, now he's got
[23:10.160 --> 23:15.840]  48 days, now he must expose communist China being behind Fauci, being behind Gates, being
[23:15.840 --> 23:21.280]  behind Biden, take the gloves off, only the president has a big enough bully pulpit to
[23:21.280 --> 23:28.000]  break through the electronic Berlin wall and savage the globalist, only directly from the
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.800]  resolute desk in the Oval Office talking directly to the American people, leveling us, this
[23:32.800 --> 23:36.760]  is a foreign takeover, we have a shot, the good news is you hear Len Wood saying it's
[23:36.760 --> 23:40.920]  a communist Chinese takeover, now the Democrats are clients of him, he's to be a Democrat,
[23:40.920 --> 23:45.520]  he understands it, Tucker Carlson says the coronavirus pandemic is a global fraud perpetrated
[23:45.520 --> 23:51.160]  by China, abetted by the powerful, totally true, the real talking point that I've been
[23:51.160 --> 23:58.320]  hammering like the devil is now becoming the dominant point and that's victory, to win
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.920]  a war you got to admit you're in a war, you got to know who the enemy is, you got to know
[24:01.920 --> 24:09.600]  what their goals are, and the globalists are incredibly weak right now, they have a daughtering
[24:09.600 --> 24:14.120]  mindless puppet president that they believe they're going to be able to install fraudulently,
[24:14.120 --> 24:21.640]  they have all their blue cities and blue states collapsing, they have an ideology that's total
[24:21.640 --> 24:27.960]  fraud and total evil and couldn't be sold to anybody that had half a brain, and so we
[24:27.960 --> 24:31.800]  have to simply say, hey, you tried to say Trump wasn't legitimate, tried to stop him
[24:31.800 --> 24:39.480]  from being inaugurated, with no proof saying he was a Russian, all we have is proof with
[24:39.480 --> 24:45.000]  Joe Biden, Trump, somebody calls in, hey, he's got a dead woman, there's Trump, this
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.800]  is an allegory, an analogy, cops pull him over, no dead woman, no blood, no nothing,
[24:50.800 --> 24:56.520]  no woman's been announced missing, Trump's got an alibi where he just was, Joe Biden,
[24:56.520 --> 25:00.480]  they call in, hey, Joe Biden's driving an 18 wheeler full of dead bodies, cops pull
[25:00.480 --> 25:08.160]  him over, full of dead bodies, he's got blood all over him, scratches on his face, and they
[25:08.160 --> 25:16.000]  open up a bag and it's a bunch of memory sticks of him videotaping him torturing women to
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.280]  death, I mean, that's the level of open and shut, you have the dead bodies, you have the
[25:21.280 --> 25:28.120]  serial killer killing them, you have everything, I mean, it's ridiculous and here's the danger
[25:28.120 --> 25:37.960]  though, with someone as incredibly compromised as this, with somebody as out of control controlled
[25:37.960 --> 25:44.240]  like this, they are going to know that Biden's weak and scared and will do whatever the globalist
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.960]  the chai comms telling and the media has already been trained to cover up the laptop and Hunter
[25:48.960 --> 25:59.480]  Biden and barisma and the Moscow mayor paying him off 3.5 million, so now all they're going
[25:59.480 --> 26:05.120]  to do is get 10 times worse and of course, try to bring in such a depression that their
[26:05.120 --> 26:09.800]  people just need food and so when you're starving, you'll do what you're told a lot of times,
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.480]  if you don't know who did it to you and that's why the left's declaring martial law all over
[26:14.480 --> 26:18.600]  the blue cities and states, same thing in Europe, same thing in Australia, this is a
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.080]  UN world government plan with the left coming down on us with both feet to drive us into
[26:23.080 --> 26:29.120]  submission and clow swab admits it all, so this is open and shut, this is their takeover,
[26:29.120 --> 26:33.240]  all the big major corporations are essential, your business isn't, you go bankrupt, you're
[26:33.240 --> 26:36.880]  permanently under their control, that's their plan, we have the footage when we come back
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.480]  of the business owner being let out and changed in New York from his bar, all the other big
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.840]  businesses can stay open but he can't, he's a mom and pop, he's not essential, he didn't
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.880]  want to go on welfare, live in a shack, so he goes to jail, the answer is a chain reaction
[26:50.880 --> 26:56.000]  resistance and not following any of the government's damn illegal orders, there is an economic
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.360]  war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control, there's a headline out
[27:01.360 --> 27:05.760]  there from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose
[27:05.760 --> 27:13.920]  $157 billion this year by the end of December, it's already over $130 billion they've lost,
[27:13.920 --> 27:19.800]  why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts them,
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.200]  we'll see, that'll knock out all the small airlines and it's all they control, it's
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.640]  the same in every single industry, and the big megabanks have unlimited capital, they
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.280]  want to bankrupt the world economy, go to buy it up, for pennies on the dollar, that's
[27:32.280 --> 27:36.120]  why the great stock market crash in 29 later turned out was engineered by some central
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.000]  banks, this is how the globalists take control, it stars the third world to death, makes the
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.600]  first world poor, it's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks that
[27:46.600 --> 27:51.720]  created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives, only the truth will set
[27:51.720 --> 28:00.400]  us free in FullWars.com, the trick that social engineers use is very, very simple, they just
[28:00.400 --> 28:07.760]  teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of the species is designed
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.600]  by these ever-knowing, loving liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit back and enjoy the
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.120]  ride everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans are obsolete, not essential,
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.080]  that we're bad for the earth, that we need to be phased out, so they're very open about
[28:23.080 --> 28:28.640]  what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix-like
[28:28.640 --> 28:34.960]  system that they're building, but what defines humans more than anything from the rest of
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.840]  the quote, animal kingdom, is that we control our environment, we build our own environments,
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.840]  we create our own systems, we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and it's systems
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.160]  towards our aims, but instead we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the
[28:51.160 --> 28:56.280]  part of humans, and us as cattle, and that's the trick.
[28:56.280 --> 29:01.040]  It really is simple, the left are into being deviant, and I don't mean sexually deviant,
[29:01.040 --> 29:06.040]  that goes to territory, I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.520]  their own species, deviant against the order of nature, even though that deviance is destructive
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.240]  and poisonous they still do it because they want to play God, everything they touch they
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.840]  destroy, their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts, their religion
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.480]  is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them, their whole system is designed for the
[29:27.480 --> 29:31.960]  UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.360]  and then watching all that new fruit down the vine, to continually reproduce the same
[29:37.360 --> 29:41.600]  nightmares over and over and over again, they truly are the children of Satan, they are
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.200]  the children of the devil, and if you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.120]  Harris, it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable, sin is
[29:50.120 --> 29:58.360]  not profitable, I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[29:58.360 --> 30:27.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:27.200 --> 30:36.040]  Danny Presetti, he's the owner of the popular restaurant and bar there on Staten Island,
[30:36.040 --> 30:40.840]  New York, New York told hey you're not essential buddy, you can have a little patio out here
[30:40.840 --> 30:45.000]  and you can have maybe 5% of your patrons for the whole winter and maybe next year you're
[30:45.000 --> 30:51.080]  going to go bankrupt, and he said no we're essential, the police said we're going to
[30:51.080 --> 30:57.840]  arrest you, so he said you know what, I'm an autonomous zone like the Commies, but they
[30:57.840 --> 31:02.560]  sent in their undercover police as if they were doing something secret and arrested
[31:02.560 --> 31:06.320]  him, we'll go ahead and roll the footage of that again, this is the Alex Jones show,
[31:06.320 --> 31:12.960]  we're into hour number one here, 30-something minutes in, Joe Rogan in studio coming up
[31:12.960 --> 31:18.480]  ladies and gentlemen and some other special guests, we have one of the main groups exposing
[31:18.480 --> 31:25.440]  China's selling of human body parts of political dissidents, they don't even hide it, Apple
[31:25.440 --> 31:30.920]  is a big part of it, that's coming up as well today, and remember how we override the globalist,
[31:30.920 --> 31:36.160]  you tell people about the forbidden show, that is white hot thanks to you spreading
[31:36.160 --> 31:41.440]  the word, and the fact that everything we've warned about and broken down is now all manifesting
[31:41.440 --> 31:48.840]  because we've studied the globalist, but here is New York City bar owner who defied coronavirus
[31:48.840 --> 31:56.040]  restrictions arrested, you mean the martial law, here's some of the other headlines dealing
[31:56.040 --> 32:08.600]  with all of this, LA residents are ordered to stay in their homes, LA residents are ordered
[32:08.600 --> 32:22.160]  to stay in their homes, LA mayor refusing to wear a mask is an act of domestic terrorism,
[32:22.160 --> 32:32.440]  you're a terrorist, UK government medical officer says wear a mask for years to come,
[32:32.440 --> 32:41.080]  yeah it's permanent, this is all martial law, this is all cult training, that's all
[32:41.080 --> 32:46.560]  it is, it's people being let out and changed because big tech says you're not essential,
[32:46.560 --> 32:50.560]  oh but big tech and their restaurants and Wal-Mart, in fact I sent this to the producers
[32:50.560 --> 32:55.280]  a few days ago, they probably can't find it while we're live, but it was a picture tells
[32:55.280 --> 33:01.560]  a thousand words and it shows an empty church, but a full Wal-Mart, a Wal-Mart with big lines,
[33:01.560 --> 33:11.240]  full of people, parking lot full, but a church is closed, and that's all you've really got
[33:11.240 --> 33:18.400]  to know about any of this, and then you see the numbers, Jeff Bezos has doubled his wealth
[33:18.400 --> 33:24.720]  this year and they admit because of the lockdown, oh but all your businesses were disclosed,
[33:24.720 --> 33:29.960]  his wasn't, they all came up with this and it was big tech and South by Southwest and
[33:29.960 --> 33:35.320]  the left had all closed first and all cancelled their big events to create the dominoes, then
[33:35.320 --> 33:42.240]  they all opened right back up, 44 million US workers have filed for unemployment while
[33:42.240 --> 33:50.480]  billionaires got $637 billion richer business insider, and those are old numbers, it's far
[33:50.480 --> 34:01.760]  worse than that now, so this isn't our opinion, this is economic, cultural warfare, and this
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.520]  is obliterating the old system and bringing in a top down consolidated system, so yeah
[34:06.520 --> 34:12.240]  go ahead and roll the owner of the bar being let out last night in handcuffs for keeping
[34:12.240 --> 34:16.120]  his business open and saying that he's essential, by the way a lot of these businesses tried
[34:16.120 --> 34:23.000]  to get the stimulus and they never got the stimulus, a lot of cops, what are they arresting
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.720]  a member of MS-13, no it's just a guy who owns a bar who had the nerve, the nerve to
[34:29.720 --> 34:36.120]  open for business in violation of Governor Cuomo's new COVID restrictions which were
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.080]  just in place for certain neighborhoods, his name is Danny Preci, he's in custody right
[34:42.080 --> 34:49.520]  now, that's a real shame, now let's show you a town in Michigan where the business owner
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.080]  comes up and takes over the local live feed and says listen, you're forcing me to fight
[34:54.080 --> 35:00.240]  back, you're bankrupting me, I tried to get the damn stimulus last time and I was not
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.360]  eligible, listen, we went and tried just to see, we tried to log on thousands of times
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.080]  over a couple months, thousands of times, I'm talking 20 times a day I had like five
[35:09.080 --> 35:12.520]  employees trying because we were losing a ton of money and things were falling apart
[35:12.520 --> 35:16.240]  and I wanted to just see if we could get it, then I hired a law firm to check and they
[35:16.240 --> 35:27.160]  said no you can't get it, Amazon got 33 billion of the stimulus money, here's the headline,
[35:27.160 --> 35:31.560]  watch what happens when a struggling business owner walks into a live news feed, here it
[35:31.560 --> 35:42.480]  is, the details on why the judge said no, my government leaders have abandoned me,
[35:42.480 --> 35:51.680]  are you the owner, they gave it to who, special interest groups and campaign donors, I'm Dave
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.760]  morse, I own the place, so what's going on, what's going on, you know what's going on,
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.160]  tell me, you tell me, hey, we got a government that has taken the stimulus money, they gave
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.880]  it to special campaign donors, they gave it to special interest, they abandoned me and
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.600]  then put me in a position where I have to fight back, okay, so do you feel that this
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.760]  is the right thing to do, absolutely, I feel everybody needs to stand up, hey listen, there
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.440]  was enough money to give every family, every family in this country $20,000 to go home
[36:22.440 --> 36:27.960]  for two months, they chose to give it to special interest and campaign donors, the Kennedy
[36:27.960 --> 36:33.160]  Space Center, and they abandoned us, you could have given me money, I'd gladly walk away
[36:33.160 --> 36:38.200]  for 60 days and let this virus settle down, I'm not going to do it alone, okay, are you
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.360]  going to continue to violate the state's orders and stay open, state order, this isn't an
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.000]  order, this is a conspiracy, this is a tyranny, what do you want to tell other restaurant
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.440]  owners, wake up, stand up, this is America, be free, I got patriots coming out supporting
[36:52.440 --> 36:59.800]  me, that's Dave Morris, business owner, he's essential, but see he didn't get the money,
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.720]  but here's the problem, you were never supposed to get it, it's meant to bankrupt you and
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.000]  get you out of the business chain to consolidate control, Klaus Schwab admits, this is economic
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.520]  warfare to kill the capitalist economy and have the mega banks come in and take control
[37:13.520 --> 37:19.600]  and dictate, they admit it and people are finally getting it, already two million people
[37:19.600 --> 37:22.880]  starved to death, that's an old number, hundreds of millions are set to starve to death, the
[37:22.880 --> 37:31.640]  UN admits, the very group that's done the lockdown then tells the world that now you
[37:31.640 --> 37:34.800]  need to give us tens of billions to feed people that are starved to death, but the UN doesn't
[37:34.800 --> 37:42.520]  even do that, the UN goes around sex trafficking and mass murdering from Haiti to the Congo,
[37:42.520 --> 37:52.640]  from Guatemala to Bangladesh, I mean you name it, they do it, to Burma, my God just
[37:52.640 --> 38:01.720]  type in UN sex trade, UN slavery, they run the damn thing, bigger than it ever was, look
[38:01.720 --> 38:07.480]  at the AP, 25 page article came out a few years ago, got zero coverage, where they went
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.000]  and found tens of thousands of missing children, hundreds that had been killed, Haitians, oh
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.360]  and guess whose foundation was at the center of it, and whose head of the Haiti operation
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.840]  for the Clintons went to jail, but got out in a couple of years and changed her name
[38:22.840 --> 38:30.520]  and she now runs Amber Alert, can't make it up, you're going to be snatching kids folks,
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.600]  you got to be in control and knowing who saw them and who's reporting them, they got their
[38:35.600 --> 38:44.360]  people on the inside everywhere and they are the most ruthless demons the world has ever
[38:44.360 --> 38:54.240]  seen, we have a serious case of Satanist pedophiles, okay, so they know what they're
[38:54.240 --> 39:00.080]  doing ladies and gentlemen and I'll play the PCR test when we come back, the inventor
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.560]  of it saying it's a total fraud and they know that and the German courts have said it's
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.800]  a total fraud, but you know what Twitter and Facebook do when you try to share those articles,
[39:07.800 --> 39:14.080]  they shut it down, they shut down legislature hearings with total proof, I mean they have
[39:14.080 --> 39:23.080]  the Amistat Institute, super respected nonpartisan law firm for around out of the subgroup it's
[39:23.080 --> 39:34.120]  followed by 100 years, you know, Amistat that's like a British abolitionist, folks that ended
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.640]  slavery all over the world, they have found total proof with the eyewitnesses and everything
[39:36.640 --> 39:40.360]  of total fraud in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of votes being shipped in for Biden,
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.880]  I mean they have it, it's done, it's done, it's done, just this one case overturns it
[39:44.880 --> 39:54.320]  all and it's just hundreds and hundreds of cases, we'll be right back.

[40:47.440 --> 40:54.920]  today.
[40:54.920 --> 40:58.960]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[40:58.960 --> 41:03.880]  of the two, one is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest, one bases its power
[41:03.880 --> 41:09.520]  on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity,
[41:09.520 --> 41:16.080]  art and skill and strength, the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls
[41:16.080 --> 41:22.320]  with a tiny elite above it, America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.720]  and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery, that's why the globalists tell us
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.240]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't, they point out one of our evils so they can
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.680]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters, a global permanent lockdown is here
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.960]  that is already causing millions and millions of starved to death, when they are done billions
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.240]  of starved to death, even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Antitope
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.520]  General have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world
[41:49.520 --> 41:54.960]  war, that's the facts, this is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[41:54.960 --> 42:02.160]  Back in 1996 the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[42:02.160 --> 42:08.160]  due to a virus scare to bring in world government, that also came out the North American Union
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.320]  documents the judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well, so we
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.120]  know their plan and if they are able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not
[42:17.120 --> 42:21.960]  just a worldwide depression but mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already
[42:21.960 --> 42:26.000]  starved to death, not from COVID but from the lockdown, that's why it's important for
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.200]  people in North America to get prepared for all over the world, but we have high quality

[42:54.680 --> 43:01.920]  The great reset, where have I heard of that before, oh the great leap forward, Mao Zedong
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.520]  ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.720]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.280]  commune control and that's all this is, the big mega banks want to break us into the same
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.000]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.360]  old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.880]  a prisoner, well everything's free but you're also a slave, Scotland is going to have universal
[43:28.880 --> 43:33.040]  guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course you've got to take those vaccines,
[43:33.040 --> 43:38.760]  you can't have any kids and oh don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.840]  that's free too as well, I'm not kidding, so give me some free paper, give me enough
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.840]  money to basically live in a tiny apartment but they own you, they control you, that's
[43:47.840 --> 43:51.920]  the great reset, that's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting
[43:51.920 --> 43:53.920]  it at InfoWars.com
[44:21.920 --> 44:43.440]  We are Backline broadcasting worldwide, thank you so much for joining us, I've known Joe
[44:43.440 --> 44:50.200]  Rogan 22 years, he's a really interesting guy, a really fun guy to know personally and
[44:50.200 --> 44:55.240]  he is a tough guy, he is a very focused person but at the same time he's a really sweet person
[44:55.240 --> 45:00.240]  and he really genuinely wants everybody to get along and really believes in humanity
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.600]  and he projects his own goodness onto people.
[45:03.600 --> 45:09.120]  I did a four hour interview with him Tuesday night and I was going to air it yesterday
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.840]  but it was four plus hours long and then quite a bit during the interview we shot like it
[45:14.840 --> 45:23.160]  was live, just non-stop, took a few bathroom breaks, he would say hey why don't we play
[45:23.160 --> 45:26.880]  a clip with that or play a clip with this, he wasn't fact checking me, he was like hey
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.400]  why don't you play this clip here and I'm like we'll have to do that in post so we ended
[45:30.400 --> 45:35.080]  up staying up here until about midnight last night adding a lot of the clips and things
[45:35.080 --> 45:42.440]  in to back up what Rogan said into it so it's like four and a half hours long and he was
[45:42.440 --> 45:46.600]  in studio here two days ago and I say he'll be in studio, it's the footage of that.
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.240]  We're going to air some of the highlights and excerpts coming up at the bottom of the
[45:50.240 --> 45:58.320]  next hour and then at about one o'clock or so we're going to post the full four plus
[45:58.320 --> 46:04.600]  hour interview and the reason this is important is everything Joe does gets millions of views
[46:04.600 --> 46:08.440]  and everything he does with me gets 20, 30, 40 million views and a lot of other people
[46:08.440 --> 46:15.600]  interviews or he talks to her big as well but Joe doesn't do a lot of interviews and
[46:15.600 --> 46:20.920]  so this is a great way to reach out to new people that oh I don't want to look at Alex
[46:20.920 --> 46:26.920]  Jones but they'll look at something Joe Rogan's doing and so this is a powerful interview.
[46:26.920 --> 46:33.000]  Four and a half hours long and it's going to be posted to Band-Aid video very very soon
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.400]  we'll be playing excerpts here on the air and it's a great tool for you to reach out
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.320]  to your friends and your family and your neighbors with hey you know Alex Jones is forbidden
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.080]  well Joe Rogan was on his show it's wild and then give it to him and by the way everything
[46:48.080 --> 46:55.800]  I do is free to air everything I do is copyright free meaning that you can take it you can
[46:55.800 --> 47:01.120]  share it you can edit it you can cut it you can play it on your show we get so many emails
[47:01.120 --> 47:07.080]  and so many letters saying can I can I paint info wars on my barn or can I make copies
[47:07.080 --> 47:13.040]  of your DVD and give them out you better but as conservatives and patriots and Christians
[47:13.040 --> 47:20.000]  and nationalists we're so into the rules that we curtail ourselves we're in a war I don't
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.480]  care about my website getting the traffic let me tell you what happened last time Joe
[47:24.480 --> 47:30.680]  Rogan was on this show it was a year and a half ago I just got on his he was in here
[47:30.680 --> 47:33.440]  in Austin visiting was already thinking about moving to Austin he's already thinking about
[47:33.440 --> 47:36.840]  starting a comedy club here was already going on his brain the lockdown just pushed over
[47:36.840 --> 47:46.800]  the edge and we hung out not to dinner much stuff that's me there at Joe's studios in
[47:46.800 --> 47:53.280]  LA back when you have them there cool Conan the barbarian original painting reprint of
[47:53.280 --> 48:04.640]  an original and what was my point I get distracted by what I see on screen sometimes oh I'm not
[48:04.640 --> 48:10.960]  allowed on YouTube so the interview gets posted by just a little sub channel of somebody I
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.800]  never heard of it gets three million views in two days it's going to get 50 million
[48:15.800 --> 48:23.440]  views probably and they deleted it and so that's the thing is that I just want this
[48:23.440 --> 48:32.360]  information to get out and it's a very thought-provoking interview and I'm proud of it and again Joe
[48:32.360 --> 48:39.280]  went four plus hours with us and we had some fun so a lot of it silly a lot of it's very
[48:39.280 --> 48:47.320]  very serious there's some surprises but like I said that'll be at band video and that will
[48:47.320 --> 48:54.360]  be at info wars calm and a lot more by the end of the next hour and I hope you share
[48:54.360 --> 49:03.040]  it because again your hardcore political like I am you got to understand something that's
[49:03.040 --> 49:11.200]  a cultural icon like Joe Rogan and we're political 1776 defeat the globalist that's the most
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.320]  important thing and it's huge and it's the key to everything but Joe Rogan is a bridge
[49:17.320 --> 49:22.200]  to other people and Joe likes what I do he knows that most of what I cover is accurate
[49:22.200 --> 49:25.280]  and he has a lot of courage come on the show believe me he's went through a lot to have
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.120]  me on went through a lot to come on here went through a lot of pressure so you can sit back
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.200]  and say oh well Joe Rogan should do more no one else in his position is and look I like
[49:35.200 --> 49:41.360]  Tucker Carlson I admire him he's a friend we talk I'll leave it at that but I'm banned
[49:41.360 --> 49:44.800]  from going on this show and he used to plug in four words on there and you know obviously
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.480]  you don't see that anymore because they you know it's it's it's nobody's been willing
[49:49.480 --> 49:56.160]  to go to bat for me in a big position of power other than Trump behind the scenes and you
[49:56.160 --> 50:02.920]  know Biden gets in I got told last week I got told two days ago that I'm enemy number
[50:02.920 --> 50:12.080]  two I got told by them they said Jones I got this call by one of the folks that works
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.240]  with the Clintons is a Republican he said Jones you had enough yet you ready to come
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.200]  in out of the cold and I said just as soon as you stop running slave camps in China just
[50:21.200 --> 50:31.000]  as soon as you guys stop being involved don't feel you about that so you know it's obvious
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.440]  what Matt drugs did whatever they did to him he finally rolled over so here's the thing
[50:37.440 --> 50:42.920]  I can't do it I can't roll over I can't give up I just can't do it people are too evil
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.920]  doesn't mean that I'm not sick of fighting them doesn't mean I don't want to look at
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.480]  Joe Biden I don't want to I don't even hate these people I just can't stand them they're
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.880]  repulsive it's like hating a dead dog in the street that has maggots all over it do I hate
[50:56.880 --> 51:05.200]  it no I just don't want to smell it or look at it I mean Joe Biden is a creepy evil twisted
[51:05.200 --> 51:13.360]  hard scary looking dude man the lights are on but nobody's home you think I want to spend
[51:13.360 --> 51:21.680]  my time looking at him spend my time with my mind my energy no I'm sick of these people

[58:10.640 --> 58:14.520]  to present a message to all you and the stuff I said I'd get into on the covid stuff next
[58:14.520 --> 58:18.440]  segment right now here's a few powerful clubs of what trump said in that speech that's exactly
[58:18.440 --> 58:22.400]  what we needed yesterday here is that trump getting into some of the key areas that are
[58:22.400 --> 58:28.600]  so blaring the most significant indications of widespread fraud is the extraordinarily
[58:28.600 --> 58:34.760]  low rejection rates for mail-in ballots in many key states these are the states that
[58:34.760 --> 58:40.880]  I had to win in swing state after swing state the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically
[58:40.880 --> 58:47.400]  lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience that means years and years
[58:47.400 --> 58:57.440]  of voting in georgia just point 2% that's substantially less than 1% of mail-in ballots
[58:57.440 --> 59:03.400]  have been rejected in other words almost none have been rejected they took everything nothing
[59:03.400 --> 59:11.840]  was rejected practically compared to 6.4% in 2016 and there are those that think that
[59:11.840 --> 59:20.440]  6.4 was a low number so think of it almost none were rejected and the previous election
[59:20.440 --> 59:29.520]  6.4% were rejected we have seen similar declines in pennsylvania nevada and michigan ballots
[59:29.520 --> 59:35.960]  weren't rejected especially if they happen to be in democrat areas these irregularities
[59:35.960 --> 59:43.840]  are inexplicable unless there is a deliberate effort to accept ineligible ballots or fraudulent
[59:43.840 --> 59:50.480]  ballots in pennsylvania the secretary of state and the state supreme court in essence abolish
[59:50.480 --> 59:57.440]  signature verification requirements just weeks prior to the election in violation of state
[59:57.440 --> 1:00:04.320]  law you're not allowed to do that it has to be approved by the legislature a judge can't
[1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:12.000]  do it a state can't do it an official can't do it the only one that can do it is the legislature
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.280]  the reason for this is clear they were not verifying signatures because they know the
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:26.440]  ballots have not been filled out by the voters in whose names they were cast in other words
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:32.600]  people filled them out that had nothing to do with the names of the ballot a simple recount
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:38.960]  of the ballots under these circumstances only compounds the fraud the only way to determine
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:46.160]  whether there was an honest vote is to conduct a full review of the envelopes in the relevant
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:53.160]  states you will find that many of them tens of thousands have fraudulent signatures a
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:59.480]  full forensic audit is required to ensure that only illegal ballots from lawfully registered
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:07.600]  voters that were properly cast are included in the final count what an incredible 49 minute
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.960]  speech and I almost just came in the day and said we're airing the speech because it got
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:16.360]  very little coverage on national news because they've already censored out all his supporters
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.720]  that would try to share it and they're putting all these little oh this was disputed that's
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:27.520]  disputed but we have the speech posted in full at bandod video president trump gives
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:34.760]  his most important speech on election fraud 2020 all right I'm going to be a good boy
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:40.120]  and put my nose the grindstone we come back to cover the waterfront and a key message
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:45.800]  to you president trump and the world and the total proof of covid being the giant chai
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:56.400]  com scammed ish stay with us we'll be right back most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:01.360]  criminal lockdowns directed by the communist chinese and the united nations and now because
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:07.440]  the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:12.320]  you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced and in germany
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:17.520]  the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:21.960]  that protest the fact that merkel the dictator has put them under her control that's right
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:27.120]  she's been rigging elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here to
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:31.360]  the united states this is world government in philadelphia they've announced four people
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:36.280]  are more seen together will be arrested they're announcing the christmas is cancelled this
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:40.640]  is what the communists takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:47.200]  process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet how long have we warned
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:03:04.640]  you about this but you can fight back america is the last bastion stop submitting you're
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:16.320]  listening to the alex jones show knowing that president trump could be fraudulently
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:23.760]  removed from office in our do-full election of him overturned in 48 days is like watching
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:30.920]  the sunset when you're in the arctic without a house without a heater without even a robe
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:39.880]  you know is that sunsets all hell is going to be breaking loose oh i've gotten the calls
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.480]  they've told me biden's people are already taken over all the main positions and they
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:56.320]  said you are target number two boy very proud i get to sign my john handcock on 1776 part
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:04.800]  two you know i'm gonna play the most powerful piece of trump's speech here in a moment he's
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:12.520]  so strong he's so good believing in us standing at this evil he wanted a landslide 11 million
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:18.360]  more votes than he got last time the fraud absolutely proven he let it out in 49 minutes
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:29.960]  but first let's play linwood outside the georgia capital yesterday gallantly fighting and exposing
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:36.440]  this communist chinese takeover in those words and pointing out this is the new 1776 our spirit
[1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:42.200]  of 1776 will trump their lies no matter what they do and they're not demoralizing us we've
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:48.280]  just begun to fight and just like these business owners in LA and the business owners in new
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:53.280]  york who are refusing to close all the democrats stay open all their systems have waivers they're
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:59.120]  waging war on us these are monster creatures that want to bankrupt us like the poor people
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:03.040]  they control black and white and hispanic in their poor neighborhoods they're just making
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:08.640]  us all their slaves right now and if we recognize this is a conspiracy this is a tyranny as that
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:14.400]  business owner in detroit said it's over it's not done for a place of goodness they've broken
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:22.440]  the social contract their criminal frauds here is the lawyer at the big event that happened
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:28.640]  in georgia we're again we're there 500 people great and i said watch in weeks it'll be bigger
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:32.280]  and that was thousands and thousands it's a chain reaction ladies and gentlemen that's
[1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:40.280]  how you do it here it is we're gonna send a message from wills park in alpharetta georgia
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:50.680]  to the state capitol in the golden dome of georgia to the tin roof of the governor's
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:06:00.000]  mansion of georgia we're gonna send him a message and the message is this it's 1776
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:09.360]  in america again and you're not gonna take our freedom we're gonna fight for our liberty
[1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:13.600]  we're gonna send that message from wills park today and we're gonna send it all the way
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:18.880]  over to beijing china we're not gonna let you take our country over never gonna happen
[1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:27.320]  on our watch this is america you picked a fight with the wrong people now yeah you picked
[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:34.120]  a fight with the wrong people now linwood has been a democrat and a republican he's
[1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:42.720]  a southerner and bright bart funded by the mercers is scared of it obviously he's pissed
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:46.400]  obviously he's real i watched the whole speech last night only played part of it live on
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:52.600]  the show yourself and i watched it last night in bed and i watched pals as well and others
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:58.720]  about an hour and a half watching it and they're like oh he used to be a democrat uh he's trying
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:04.000]  to make us lose the senate seats in georgia he didn't do any of that in his speech they're
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.560]  scared of that because when you get all those democrats that know their countries in trouble
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:13.120]  to finally activate and that guy sounds like a southern baptist preacher doesn't he so does
[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:19.200]  the black state rep jones super well spoken when you start having men like that that are
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:25.000]  as good as speakers as i am or better and just as smart popping up it's game over vernon
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.160]  jones used to be a democrat too i've looked at his eyes when he's got tears in them talking
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:34.360]  about them stealing the election in georgia and now he's not gonna stand for it there
[1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:38.160]  are a lot of good people that have been democrats that have been conned by it and they're pissed
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:44.160]  now you can't fool that type of authenticity and so here comes bright bart who i try not
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:47.880]  to attack rommel reagan's rule was don't attack other conservatives and they had a lot of great
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:51.760]  folks at bright bart but every comment on that article attacking linwood says you're
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:56.920]  full of crap you know if we're gonna win a war we want to get the other side over to
[1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:03.360]  us the republican is telling us trump should step down he didn't win the election bill
[1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:07.840]  bars saying there's no evidence when that's all there is like a battleship in the ocean
[1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:12.200]  and there's a they say there's no water sir what the hell are you talking about open your
[1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:19.920]  eyes we're floating on it but then linwood comes along with the covington kids and all
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:25.560]  this other stuff as a champion and wakes up and say oh don't trust him well if you're
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:28.800]  not gonna trust the people trying to get a real recount and overturn it and get a special
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:36.440]  session who are you gonna trust jesus christ said you judge a tree by its fruits that's
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:43.280]  what i do you have a big old fat milk cow and it doesn't have any milk you have a little
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:51.000]  bit of skinny jersey jersey cow this produces more milk you never drink you judge a tree
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:58.320]  by its fruits and you judge a big old pink top teddy off how much milk comes out of it
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.080]  and that's all i'm telling you here is that that's how this works folks what do you get
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:12.120]  from info wars founts of fruit of milk of truth just gut like and the enemy absolutely
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:19.480]  hates it and they hate vernon jones and they hate linwood and they hate your ass because
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:25.280]  they are so scared that we come together for a pro human future i mean look america's
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:29.040]  not perfect we've got problems with the idea of human liberty and justice and a middle
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:34.400]  class and due process the globalists can't stand it and the chai com model is what they're
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:39.760]  trying to replace us with saying we're over and we're done they've got a good portion
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:47.000]  of democrats openly saying that they don't want america to even exist and they want
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:59.520]  to replace it with the chai com system where you are literally a slave it's unbelievable
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:02.880]  of course wood comes out and says they're lying he's been mainly republican he's known
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:10.800]  to vote for both it doesn't matter what matters is action who's the heavyweight champion in
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:21.280]  a boxing match it's whoever beats up the former one who's mike tyson in 1988 mike tyson who's
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.160]  tiger woods who's the golf champions tiger woods it's all about the proof in the pudding
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:30.920]  ladies and gentlemen not about talk not about games but about what you stand for and what
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:37.720]  you do and your enemies and that's why they're always telling you oh jones isn't real oh no
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:45.880]  jones he works for the cia or he works for the blah blah blah because they don't want
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:49.480]  you to believe there's anybody real they don't want you to feel like there's anybody else
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.460]  with you out there that stands for what's right because you know you're real you know
[1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:58.400]  you're strong you know what you stand for you know you have a relationship with god
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.600]  but they don't want you to think there's anybody else out there that's like you well let me
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.200]  tell you there's a lot of people out there and they got brown skin and they got white
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.280]  skin and they got pink skin and they got black skin but they got red hearts and they got
[1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:19.680]  red blood and they got will and they've got ancestors and they've got a destiny and we're
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.600]  not rolling over to the globalist when they come in with all the forced inoculations
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:28.440]  and world government and tell us we're not essential and we gotta roll over to die those
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:34.600]  are fighting words when you tell me I'm not essential that's how every damn science fiction
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:38.960]  movie begins when the aliens pull up and say we're gonna blow your planet up you're not
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:50.040]  essential unless you submit to us and I don't believe your whips I don't believe your cowards
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:54.520]  I just don't think people see enough example of leadership and people just are still stunned
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:59.880]  in days to be in this position but as soon as people see action and folks standing up
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:04.600]  like these business owners in California and these business owners in New York these business
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:10.240]  owners in Michigan as soon as that chain reaction begins it's over for the new world order they've
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:16.520]  desperately run this gamble they've run this confidence game and it's time for it to stop
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:28.000]  it's not the great reset baby it's the great awakening there it is this isn't about your
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:36.480]  health it's about power and it's about control and it's about suspending logic where all
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:41.840]  the globalists can fly around and go to restaurants and not wear masks but your business is shut
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:46.480]  you lose your job and now they got a forced inoculation for you if you want the welfare
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:13:04.000]  check we'll be your right back stay with us now it's easier than ever to have band

[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:57.360]  I hope we can stop the great reset that means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:01.320]  break us and bring us under their control that's your stated admitted plan just introduce
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:06.680]  on record claus swab all the different democrat mayors they admit it's clowered in heaven implode
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:11.280]  the economy to make us go to their control but if we expose they're the ones doing it
[1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control and there are major
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:19.600]  uprisings happening across the world during the US thousands of sheriffs are saying hell
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:24.000]  no to the lockdowns people are finally starting to fight back but regardless you need to get

[1:14:50.520 --> 1:15:06.400]  So I would say you know if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:12.240]  book it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation and I don't believe
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:18.120]  in dividing our nation it hurts our great nation and so CNN is really the enemy of the
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:25.000]  truth and that's my opinion thank you no American is an enemy of another American no news outlet
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  is an enemy of America no news outlet is an enemy of America no news outlet is an enemy
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  of America no news outlet is an enemy of America no news outlet is an enemy of America no news
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:31.880]  outlet is an enemy of America
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:33.760]  andere
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:36.960]  All right Alex jones here back live.
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:43.720]  Let's go to the PCR inventor Kerry mulliss just a year or so ago pointing out that the
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:49.760]  PCR test is not good for viruses and that you can turn them up like the us has done
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:58.000]  20 plus times what you're supposed to get this the UK 45 times to give you false positives
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.960]  and now because you get money with a false positive at hospital. So now they've turned
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:07.720]  those little computers, little tests in your nose up to where a papaya, a goat, remember
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:12.440]  the Tanzanian president's a scientist. He's like, he's like 98% of our people test positive
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:23.320]  COVID with the UN. He goes, send a papaya piece and send a goat, both positive. So that was
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:29.560]  seven months ago. So that's how this fraud operates. Ladies and gentlemen, here's what
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:35.360]  he had to say about it. If they could find this virus in you at all. And with PCR, if
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.680]  you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody. It starts making you believe in
[1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:44.640]  the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained in everything else, right? I
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:49.720]  mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really
[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:56.520]  measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:18:00.200]  least one single one of them in your body. Okay. So that could be thought of as a misuse
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:04.920]  of it just to claim that it's meaningful. Those tests are all based on things that are
[1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:10.120]  invisible and they are the results are inferred in a sense. PCR is separate from that. It's
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:14.520]  just a process that's used to make a whole lot of something out of something. That's
[1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:18.800]  what it is. It's not, it doesn't tell you that you're sick and it doesn't tell you that
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.280]  the thing you ended up with really was going to hurt you or anything like that.
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:29.880]  I always forget her name, but guys try to pull it up. It's like billionaire woman. She
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:34.920]  was the big star hooked in with Obama and Netflix. Billion and Bill Gates billionaire
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:40.200]  CEO woman develops tests to find cancer in your blood and all other illnesses and it worked
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:44.440]  for like five years. They made hundreds of millions of dollars. It was all lies. It
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:48.720]  was all fake. They killed people with cancer surgeries over it. And it was basically a
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:54.960]  PCR test where they claim a computer finds all this in your blood. Well, we have the
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:59.920]  articles. I put it out in a video a couple of days ago with band on video. There it
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:06.360]  is. Elizabeth Holmes CEO of Silicon Valley star accused of fraud and now it's all admitted.
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:14.640]  It just isn't real. You just put it in the computer a blood sample and it just puts
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:21.520]  out this BS here. Look at this landmark legal ruling finds that COVID test not fit for purpose.
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:27.680]  So what does MSM do? They ignore it. Just like John Hopkins came out with a report saying
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:31.520]  almost everyone that died of COVID died of something else or that the test are fake.
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:36.120]  Boom. John Hopkins pulls it. Not because it isn't true, but because it's this big information
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:43.960]  management scam. It's incredible. And then yes, any virus can kill you if you don't
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:47.280]  have your essential vitamins and minerals, but they won't even tell you you need that.
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:51.760]  And they have the FPLG be going, don't claim vitamins and minerals help you or will arrest
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:20:01.560]  you. I mean, this is just crazy. Absolutely nuts. You know, I've got this big Trump clip
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:04.560]  that I think is the best out of the 49 minute speech that we're going to air when we come
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:08.880]  back after that. And then I guess we'll push other guests back into the Joe Rogan stuff
[1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:18.200]  tomorrow, maybe, but because I'm not sure we can air that. But you know, there's so much
[1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:30.320]  more to get to here today and so many angles to all of this. But I'm being sarcastic this
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:33.960]  morning. I said, can I just have three clips, just one clip from each person involved in
[1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:39.640]  editing this? And then I'm just going to air those at 1230. It's other than like 15 clips
[1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:44.000]  and I don't have them yet. And I'm not mad. It's just, we just won't do it because that's
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:49.280]  the only power I've got at this point is that every time we do this, just to give up because
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:52.880]  I got a lot of political news and a lot of important stuff to cover. And at least I can
[1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:57.040]  post the whole Joe Rogan interview. We can get that done, demand on video. So that should
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:02.240]  be up by that should be up by next hour for you. But again, the news websites are info
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:12.920]  wars.com and news wars.com and so much more separately to fund this operation. We need
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:20.480]  your support and I'm very, very appreciative to all of your support. So what you can do
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:27.600]  is go to info wars store.com and get great products that are good for you and your family

[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:43.520]  are both essential, the good clean iodine, X2 is one type of B4th crystal. The other
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:46.680]  is the deep earth crystals with other types of people like that better. It's different
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:54.240]  for everybody. It just goes on and on how amazing these products are and what they
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:02.760]  do for folks and the fact that they also then fund this operation. And so without your support,
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:09.560]  we can't do this with your support. We can do this and I'm trying as hard as I can. So

[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:39.080]  three one three nine. Okay, you just saw the proofs the inventor of the test for covid
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:43.240]  saying it is a hoax and a fraud. And this whole thing is based on a giant fraud. They've
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:46.680]  got so many people involved in the fraud. The other is how to prop up the giant fraud
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:53.240]  Donald Trump's coming up. There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:57.440]  power and control. There's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:04.160]  numbers that global airlines are set to lose 157 billion dollars this year by the end of
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:10.520]  December. It's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost. Why would they take part in
[1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:15.080]  the hoax in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them? We'll see that'll knock out
[1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:19.720]  all the small airlines and it's solid a control. It's the same in every single industry and
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.760]  the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They want to bankrupt the world economy until
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:28.840]  the buy it up for pennies on the dollar. That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:34.200]  turned out was engineered by some central banks. This is how the globalist take control.
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:39.280]  It stars the third world to death makes the first world poor. It's economic warfare and
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:43.920]  it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:52.360]  navigation. Only the truth will set us free in bullwars.com. Imagine a dystopian novel
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.840]  or a dystopian science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:02.560]  in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:07.880]  as vaccines that actually change your very DNA. That's where you are in the year 2020.
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:11.120]  Global government of the United Nations. All these authoritarian groups admit they're
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.920]  doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:21.960]  not even worried about COVID-19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said. Think about
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:25.720]  how insane that is. Oh, and big tech's got to track you. They've got to trace you. They've
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:30.040]  got to control you. You've got to have absolutely your house. Why? You've got to have secret
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:34.720]  police come disappear you because, my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:39.800]  of killing you. Give your ability to have cancer or heart attack. This is their take
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:45.920]  over. Imagine on America's death certificate, killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah,
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:50.360]  that's fear monitoring. That's mind control.
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:57.640]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands. But if you
[1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:01.880]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic. You wouldn't
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:06.360]  even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them. So for that person,
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:11.840]  it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit. And it's similar to how ducks
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:15.160]  and butterflies are many other species of animal. They'll have to fly thousands and
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.000]  thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born. They're following magnetic
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  lines. They have magnetic cells in their brains. We now know side-diflutes are going off. There's
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.440]  even a lot more than that. So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.720]  the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:35.960]  it's there. And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.160]  what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people. And that's
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:46.560]  how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulative
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:27:11.120]  space time continuum.
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:27.800]  I've got this Trump interview cut down into 30 clips. Only air three or four today, but
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:32.320]  most of them are short. This four and a half minute clip, I think says it all. And it's
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:36.040]  more of what we need to see from the president immediately. We're going to play this clip
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:38.920]  and I've got some advice to the president, advice to the country, and the world if you
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:43.720]  think my advice is worth anything. And then we'll get to some of the Joe Rogan excerpts.
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:49.280]  The full interview is now live at infowars.com and band.video, a big exclusive interview
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:53.720]  with Joe Rogan, four plus hours, spilt his guts, it'll reach a lot of new people. Please
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:58.120]  share it widely. But first, El Presidente.
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:04.040]  So we're not looking to show you 25 faulty or fraudulent votes, which don't mean anything
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:12.660]  because it doesn't overturn the state or 50 or 100. We're showing you hundreds of thousands
[1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:21.640]  far more than we need, far more than the margin, far more than the law requires. We can show
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:29.320]  many times what is necessary to win the state. The media knows this, but they don't want
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:38.200]  to report it. In fact, they outright refuse to even cover it because they know the result
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:46.960]  if they do. Even what I'm saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that's okay.
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:55.960]  I just keep on going forward because I'm representing 74 million people. And in fact, I'm also representing
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:02.900]  all of the people that didn't vote for me. The mail-in voting scam is the latest part
[1:29:02.900 --> 1:29:09.800]  of their four-year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election. And it's been
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:16.640]  like living in hell. Our opponents have proven many times, again and again, that they will
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:23.320]  say and do anything to get back into power. The corrupt forces who are registering dead
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:30.600]  voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:38.040]  fraudulent hoax after another. You've been watching it now for four years. These entrenched
[1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:45.480]  interests oppose our movement because we put America first. They don't put America first.
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:51.520]  And we're returning power to you, the American people. They don't want America first. They
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:57.480]  only want power for themselves. They want to make money. That's why they don't want
[1:29:57.480 --> 1:30:02.320]  me as your president. I've been investigated from soon after I announced I was running
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:09.800]  for president. When I immediately went to number one in the Republican primary polls,
[1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:16.600]  the investigations never stopped. They went on for four years. And I won them all. I beat
[1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:24.520]  them all. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax, and so much more. Robert Mueller spent
[1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:34.640]  $48 million of taxpayer money investigating me for two and a half years, issued over 2,800
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:45.720]  subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, issued 230 orders for communications records,
[1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:53.000]  and conducted 500 witness interviews, all looking to take me down. There was no collusion
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:58.920]  in the end. None whatsoever. Senator Marco Rubio, the head of the Senate Intelligence
[1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:08.840]  Committee, stated the committee found no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump or his campaign
[1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:15.160]  colluded with the Russian government. And I thank Senator Rubio for that statement.
[1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:21.080]  Now I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece
[1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:27.680]  of information to New York so that they can try to get me there. It's all been gone over,
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:34.480]  over and over again. For $48 million, you go through tax returns, you go through everything.
[1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:41.040]  The New York Attorney General, who recently ran for office, campaigned without knowing
[1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:49.320]  me, stating, we will join with law enforcement and other attorneys general across this nation
[1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:55.400]  in removing this president from office. I never met her. It's important that everybody
[1:31:55.400 --> 1:32:03.880]  understands, she said, that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end. And all it's been
[1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:13.680]  is a big investigation in Washington and New York and any place else that can investigate
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:20.040]  because that's what they want to do. They want to take not me, but us down and we can
[1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:28.480]  never let them do that. And on top of everything else, we have a company that's very suspect.
[1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:35.960]  Its name is Dominion. With the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button
[1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:43.560]  for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this? We have to go to
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:51.800]  paper. Maybe it takes longer, but the only secure system is paper. Not these systems
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:59.440]  that nobody understands, including in many cases, the people that run them. Although unfortunately,
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:05.040]  I think they understand them far too well. In one Michigan county, as an example, that
[1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:11.800]  used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from
[1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:19.760]  Trump to Biden. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:25.480]  many didn't we catch? Are there hundreds of other examples throughout the country?
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:31.960]  Are there thousands? We just got lucky and they called it a glitch, but we found numerous
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:38.480]  glitches that evening. 96% of the company's political donations went to Democrats, not
[1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:45.480]  surprisingly. And frankly, when you look at who's running the company, who's in charge,
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:51.200]  who owns it, which we don't know, where the votes counted, which we think are counted
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:58.240]  in foreign countries, not in the United States, Dominion is a disaster. Election authorities
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:03.880]  in Texas have repeatedly blocked the deployment of Dominion systems due to concerns about
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:11.320]  security, vulnerabilities, and the potential for errors and outright fraud. Every district
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:19.280]  that uses Dominion systems must be carefully monitored and carefully investigated. But
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:25.520]  not only for the future, right now, we're worried about the present and what went on
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:28.840]  with an election that we won without question.
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:39.680]  All right, let me say this right now. Trump waited three weeks until he really made that
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:43.840]  powerful statement because he wanted to have the evidence. And in three weeks to go out
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.560]  and gather all that was amazing. A lot of whistleblowers, a lot of hard work, and a lot
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:53.000]  of courage. And boy, in 49 minutes, he lays out incredible evidence and they've laid it
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:59.720]  out at the legislatures in Michigan, in Arizona, in Pennsylvania and other areas. And the left
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:03.720]  is in a total panic because they just keep doubling down with their fraud. They keep
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:09.080]  doubling down with their scams. They keep doubling down with the fact that Trump's still legitimate.
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:13.120]  And now they've just announced Biden the winner with these fraudulent ballots and they've
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:18.720]  been caught. And so as negative as things are, and even if Biden's able to somehow sneak
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:22.320]  his way in, if all the courts and everybody abandons President Trump, except the Supreme
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:29.640]  Court really, we aren't going to accept it. We're the ones that were robbed and disenfranchised.
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:37.400]  And it's what I call, it's what history calls, a peric victory. A peric victory is a victory
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:42.880]  that inflicts such devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Winning
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:48.640]  a peric victory takes a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement or damages long
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:55.840]  term progress. The phrase originates from a quote by Cyrus of Ifrus, whose triumph against
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:03.680]  the Romans in the Battle of Asilium in 279 BC destroyed much of the forces. And while
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:11.040]  a tactical victory forced the end of his campaign, later the collapse of his system, it is a
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:18.560]  peric victory. And believe me, they admit that in the CFR reports that are public. They
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:22.200]  say, my God, we tried to steal everything and they're going to keep the Senate and the
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.840]  House probably or gain a lot of seats in the House and everybody hates us and the media
[1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:30.840]  is totally headed and they've shot their wives. So they weren't just fighting Trump,
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:33.840]  they were fighting all of us as long as we don't give up and keep pushing. They exposed
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:38.840]  China Joe. At a sick level, it's almost better they put him in, except then they're going
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:42.480]  to go for broke. It's just too dangerous. But I mean, let me tell you, there's more
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.480]  than one way to skin a cat. So put me in that briar patch all day long. I mean, they had
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:52.160]  really hanging themselves. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:58.160]  be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:05.600]  from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:10.360]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:16.120]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.120]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:28.920]  studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:35.080]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:41.960]  now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:12.800]  Joe Biden has said to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.440]  for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:24.680]  coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown. That way he can say that Trump is to blame
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:30.960]  for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID. Then of course, when that
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:35.000]  new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.880]  be blamed for it. And that's when all the masks arrest start sometime towards the end
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:44.200]  of next year. This is a permanent martial law plan. Trump must repudiate it, expose
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:49.800]  Fauci and Gates and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:56.000]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with my patriot because they have agreements with
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:00.840]  other distributors that they all sell the same low price, high quality, horrible food.

[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:51.160]  Get prepared now. You know, something very sad is happening.
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:54.640]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago and infowars got
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:00.080]  banned off of more than 60 major platforms. I warned everybody that was a precedent for
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:05.520]  the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:11.360]  down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:15.760]  against conservatives, nationalists and populists. And now that's happened. And then I told everybody
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:20.040]  that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate in protest using
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:26.080]  a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate.
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:30.920]  COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax. He started to do that in the last few months
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:34.920]  of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:39.080]  to use. They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:42.760]  people and divide us. And they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:48.000]  to try to control us. I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.520]  me what's coming next.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:59.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:20.160]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:30.680]  to Alex Jones.
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:52.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:42:17.160]  Politicians hide themselves away. Politicians hide themselves away. They only started the
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:27.160]  war. They leave that to the poor.
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:38.160]  Yeah. All right. All right, folks. We are back live. Alex Jones here. We've got a special
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:42.560]  guest coming on that heads up on the main groups exposing global organ harvesting, something
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:47.160]  Apple and others are really a big part of, but it's okay because they're liberal. They
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:51.720]  were turtlenecks and they were, so it's all right.
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:56.160]  But the Joe Rogan interview four plus hours long, really groundbreaking. Never seen Joe
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:00.120]  spill his guts like this. It's a great way to reach out to new listeners, new viewers
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:09.000]  and wake them up. It's at band.video and at 79days.news. And Joe got into tribalism.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:13.120]  He got into fighting globalism. He got into Biden. He got into hunting. He got into a
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:17.640]  whole bunch of subjects. And I can't think of a cool name of it. You know, I'm saying
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:21.800]  Alex Jones and Joe Rogan into the world part three, because he did two into the world pieces
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:28.200]  for the election that were viral. But how about Joe Rogan visits info wars for Epic four
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:32.120]  hour plus podcast breaking? You know what I mean? I mean, that's really what it is.
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:35.600]  And it's not the end of the world. If we don't want it to be the end of the world, there's
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.200]  the info wars headline Joe Rogan, Alex Jones into the world emergency broadcast. Send
[1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:42.520]  this out on your email, your Twitter, your Facebook, you can grab clips of it. They're
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:48.920]  all going to go viral. It's free to air. Everybody get it. Have fun. Ping trip and place bong
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:53.320]  and everybody else. You better have some fun with this because we definitely had some fun
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:59.480]  ourselves. Here's Joe Rogan on the war against questioning. Here it is.
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:04.960]  One of the things that makes me excited about about some conspiracy theories is how some
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:09.920]  people are so reluctant to admit that any of them exist. And we start going back in
[1:44:09.920 --> 1:44:14.840]  history. You're like, where do we have to start? Let's start with Vietnam. How do you
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:18.360]  think we got into Vietnam? Do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin? And they're like, what's
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  that? And they're like, you show them that and you take it to a website and you send
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:26.000]  them an email. You're like, Hey, I'm going to send you a video and this video explains
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.480]  a lot more. And then you call them the next day. You're like, what do you think about
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:35.560]  Kennedy? How did Kennedy die? Well, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Really? Interesting. I'm
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:39.320]  going to send you this and I'm going to send you that. And have you ever shot anything with
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:44.880]  a rifle? I have. You know what happens to bullets? They can explode. They hit bones.
[1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:48.640]  They splatter. They don't look anything like the original bullet, but the bullet that they
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:55.360]  attributed to the murder of JFK, they found on the gurney of Governor Colin Damage, Connolly
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:45:00.280]  Rather, who happened to just be, you know, where the bullet was, the bullet just fell
[1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:06.920]  out of his pocket or something. It's the dumbest idea of all time. So it's a war on questioning.
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:12.520]  And just as a case example, I used to get attacked a lot. Now most I get a lot less
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:17.120]  attacks now after the system came after me. When they ignored me, nobody really cared when
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.280]  they attacked me. The system so discredited that it actually built me up. And that's a
[1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:26.000]  weird phenomenon. You're an awesome test case. You know, why? Because you're a test case
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.320]  where it's like, if you look at the pot, one of the things that people I think are upset
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:35.920]  at me about the podcast we just did is that I gave you a platform, right? This is the
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:42.800]  words that you give someone a platform. This is this the mindset of a person that's afraid
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:48.080]  of competing ideas, even if those competing ideas are awful. And I understand that you
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:58.840]  would be reluctant to ever accept or or multiply awful ideas. But the best way to combat that
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:04.320]  and it's been shown throughout history is better ideas. The simplest way to combat that
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:10.400]  is to shut it down. It's like, if you have a kid, and you're in you say, you got to go
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:17.880]  to bed, and your kid goes, why do I have to go to bed? And you go, shut the f**k up.
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:23.480]  It's sort of the same thing. It's a crazy interview four plus hours long, a lot of
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:29.640]  leaves, a lot of surprises. Here's more of it. This is Joe saying we can work it out.
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:33.880]  If you could just here's what's conflicting, right? If you could live your life the way
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:38.280]  you live your life right now, if you love your wife and you love your family, you love
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:44.560]  your friends, you love your job, wouldn't you want to do this forever? And I can tell
[1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:52.400]  you right now, I would be happy to do this forever. I don't need to come to some new place.
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:47:01.680]  I don't need to expand some new dimension of the universe. If I could just do this right
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:08.360]  now forever, I would be happy. And I think I really do believe this, that the very best
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:18.080]  way to be happier is to be in harmony with other people, to have more friends, to be
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:26.840]  more like if you have had conflict with people to work it out, to expand your range of friends,
[1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:31.280]  to be kind to people, to make people feel more comforting, and to recognize that who
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.160]  a person is is not just who a person is in a vacuum. It's like people are a formulation
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:40.520]  when they get together, it's not one person, one person. It's a bunch of projections together.
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:46.520]  There's a lot of shit happening. And we all need to accept that. And it seems like a simplistic
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:51.200]  thing to talk about. It seems like a small thing to do. But if we can figure out how
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:57.440]  to do that, I honestly earnestly believe that we can work our way towards middle ground
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:03.480]  and have a new ethic for how we approach and how we appreciate each other. I think we've
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:11.880]  got to approach and appreciate each other based on only ideas and only like abandoning
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:17.880]  preconceived notions of who the other person is and what their end goals and what they're
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:24.160]  working towards are. And instead to look at each other and say, I assure you that I want
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:30.160]  what's best for my friends, and for my loved ones, and for my family, and I assume you
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:43.160]  want the same for your friends and your family and your loved ones. Let's work this out.
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:47.360]  If you could just, here's what's conflicting, right? If you could live your life the way
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:51.760]  you live your life right now. If you love your wife and you love your family, you love
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:58.040]  your friends, you love your job, wouldn't you want to do this forever? And I can tell
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:05.000]  you right now, I would be happy to do this forever. I don't need to come to some new
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  place.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.680]  But what about how comedy, the last passion of free speech?
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:10.800]  If you can hit that joint, then ask me this question.
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  But think about...
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:13.200]  Oh, excuse me, it's a cigar.
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.200]  It's tobacco.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:20.680]  They say it's really good tobacco.
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:25.840]  It's the best tobacco that they make in Nicaragua.
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:28.160]  What do we share in tobacco? That's weird, man.
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:29.160]  It's gay.
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:30.160]  I was serious.
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:32.760]  I'm not scared of being gay, bro.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  I hear you.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:35.640]  Well, I mean, what do we got to help with that?
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:36.640]  I'm scared of being gay.
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:40.160]  I'm scared of being scared of being gay. How about that?
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:41.160]  I'm more scared of that.
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:42.160]  That's why we have sex with them.
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:43.160]  There you go.
[1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:44.160]  I'm good.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:45.160]  Just put it there.
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:51.640]  We're going to edit all this out. It's a joke.
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:52.640]  LOL.
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:54.320]  People actually believe that stuff.
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:57.080]  Why do they believe? They believe a lot of things, man.
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:49:58.080]  Oh, yeah.
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:49:59.080]  Yeah.
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  So...
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:05.720]  Don't edit this out. Do you have to edit this out?
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  No, I'm not going to.
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:07.720]  Good.
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:08.720]  How is your dog doing?
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:09.720]  He's great.
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:15.640]  Oh, yeah, there's a whole 30 minutes on his dog.
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:16.640]  So it's a good thing.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:19.880]  And Joe has a lot of courage to have me on his show, and it's all super viral and it's
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:20.880]  all fun.
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:23.240]  It's a weird universe that he's a few miles away from us.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:28.320]  We're his studio and our studio, but we have a big guest coming on about the death camps
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:31.920]  in China and how the left is all promoting them and defending them and apples lobbying
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:37.200]  against laws that just condemn U.S. corporations that use slave labor.
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:38.200]  Wow.
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:41.160]  You're not going to see bumper stickers on liberal cars about that, though, because they're
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:42.160]  all awoke.
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:47.280]  They're fighting that Nazi Trump that tried to end all those wars separately.
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:50.040]  We cannot fund this operation without your support.

[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:44.160]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:47.360]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:51.680]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:53.720]  Why do they love death?
[1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:56.320]  Because they hate themselves.
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:53:03.120]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us and once you understand that basic
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:07.320]  psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:08.880]  That's why they hate info wars.
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:09.880]  We believe in humanity.
[1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:10.880]  We think you're beautiful.
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:13.040]  We think you're amazing.
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:18.040]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:20.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:21.680]  It's now upon us.
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:25.080]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when
[1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:28.160]  the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:29.720]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:30.720]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:34.800]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done because God's
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:42.120]  on our side and the globalists know it.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:56.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:56.160 --> 1:53:57.720]  We got really serious subjects.
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:04.120]  The globalist AI death camps in Communist China that is coming up.
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.120]  About 15 minutes.
[1:54:05.120 --> 1:54:08.520]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, but we had some fun with Joe Rogan.
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:12.960]  A lot of it was also very, very serious interviews gone live at band.video, the full four plus
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:13.960]  hours.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:14.960]  I hope you'll share it.
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:15.960]  I hope you'll clip it out.
[1:54:15.960 --> 1:54:16.960]  I hope you'll meme it.
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:17.960]  That's how it gets legs.
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:18.960]  We reached new people that way.
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:21.440]  But here's Joe Rogan intro to conspiracy.
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.680]  And then Joe Rogan talking about Joey Diaz, the funniest person he believes on earth.
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.800]  I think there's a very good chance that Joe Rogan is right about all that.
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:34.240]  But remember, Joe is taking a risk with all the censors coming on my show.
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:36.840]  He's trying to promote us, trying to say we're okay.
[1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:40.840]  That's the value here with all the trendies, everybody that watches podcasts, a lot of
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:41.840]  nice folks too.
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:44.040]  I watch it, but, but it's, it's, it's a big deal.
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:47.480]  So you know, you're like, well, I mean, I'll be a Joe Rogan fan, maybe you're a huge fan.
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:49.360]  Share the video at band.video.
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:51.520]  It's the top featured video right there.
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:56.920]  Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, into the world emergency broadcast or Ford slash beginning of the new
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:54:57.920]  golden age.
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:54:58.920]  Who knows?
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:00.440]  But there it is.
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:01.760]  Be sure and get it out.
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:02.760]  Here are those clips.
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:09.080]  There, there was a bit that I was doing that was based on conversations with you.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:16.320]  I had a giant amount of bits that were about, about conspiracy theories.
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:20.920]  And a lot of them was from hanging out with you and also people's reactions to conspiracy
[1:55:20.920 --> 1:55:21.920]  theories.
[1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:27.760]  One of the things that makes me excited about, about some conspiracy theories is how some
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:31.400]  people are so reluctant to admit that any of them exist.
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:35.280]  And we start going back in history, you're like, where do we have to start?
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.640]  Let's start with Vietnam.
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:38.840]  How do you think we got into Vietnam?
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:40.600]  Do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin?
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:41.600]  And they're like, what's that?
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:45.400]  And you're like, you show them that and you take them to a website and you send them
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:49.040]  an email and you're like, Hey, I'm going to send you a video and this video explains
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:50.400]  a lot more.
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:51.400]  And then you call them the next day.
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:53.720]  You're like, what do you think about Kennedy?
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:54.720]  How did Kennedy die?
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:57.240]  Well, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  Really interesting.
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:01.520]  I'm going to send you this and I'm going to send you that.
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:03.400]  And have you ever shot anything with a rifle?
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  I have.
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:05.400]  You know what happens?
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:07.280]  The bullets, they fucking explode.
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:08.280]  They hit bones.
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  They splatter.
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:12.880]  They don't look anything like the original bullet, but the bullet that they attributed
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:19.080]  to the murder of JFK, they found on the gurney of Governor Collins, a Connolly rather, who
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:24.360]  happened to just be, you know, where the bullet was, the bullet just fell out of his pocket
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:25.360]  or something.
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:37.360]  And it's the dumbest idea of all the time, so it's a war on questioning for the American
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:38.360]  public.
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:42.800]  No, that every four years, they buy the same, they've been buying it before years and the
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:48.080]  same people with their Harvard articulation and how they don't curse and their Christians
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:49.080]  and they have a family.
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:52.440]  And these are the same people that shove it up your ass every year.
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:56.680]  The one thing that you get about me is, I'll say fuck, but I will not fucking rob you.
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:56:59.000]  If I need something, I'll ask you like a man on your ass.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.800]  Hey, hey, so go fuck yourself, you cop, hold on, hold on one second, take a joke, take
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:08.000]  a shuttle, Joey Diaz, Facebook, Twitter, check yourself before you wreck yourself, big
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  dicks in your ass.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  I'll get it out.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.120]  Get out of here, you're in trouble.
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:15.240]  When was the moment, was it Joey Diaz convinced you or who was it?
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:17.000]  Because he acts like he convinced you.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  He convinced me to leave LA?
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.800]  Well, he just was like, I told Joe and watch, he's probably going to be.
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:23.760]  No, no, he definitely told me a long time ago.
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:25.520]  He's told me for years.
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:30.040]  Joey knows me about as good as any human being that I've ever met.
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:34.480]  And you know, we did the road together so long, we did the store together for so long,
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:40.680]  we spent so many nights together, so many, so many like from like fucking 8pm to 2 in
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:45.640]  the morning, eating at a diner, laughing, I spent so much time with him.
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:49.360]  So he would just tell me, he's like, Joe Rogan, you don't need these motherfuckers, you should
[1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:53.120]  get the fuck out of here, grab your family, you got a beautiful family, get the fuck out
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:54.120]  of here.
[1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:55.920]  And he was saying this when everything was great.
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.760]  And I was like, well, I've been looking at property in different places, like get your
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.640]  fucking shit, get out of here.
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:04.960]  And he was telling me from the beginning, he's like these people are mutts.
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:08.040]  Why didn't he move to Texas instead of New Jersey?
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:09.560]  Well, he loves New Jersey.
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:10.560]  He's nostalgia.
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:14.840]  He's going to go in the porno parlors with the hookers.
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:15.840]  He knows a lot of people.
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:21.640]  He has like very close friends down there, and it's nostalgic for him because, and he
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:24.280]  gets accepted there, like they love him there.
[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:25.400]  That's his Texas.
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:28.480]  Like Joey Diaz, like gets so much love in New Jersey.
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:30.120]  So he's just going back to his roots.
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:31.440]  Yes, that's where he's from.
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:33.120]  My dad's basically moved back to East End.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:36.280]  There's great comedy around there too.
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:44.360]  Anyway, some of the fun clips that we have from the interview, a little bit of it's
[1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:49.440]  crazy, but you know, that's what Joe does is how we reach back in 1996, the head of
[1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:55.840]  the World Food Program said that they would use food and global lockdowns due to a virus
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:58.800]  scare to bring in world government.
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:03.000]  That also came out in the North American Union documents that judicial watch and Lou Dobbs
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:05.320]  got more than 15 years ago as well.
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:09.000]  So we know their plan and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:13.760]  cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions.
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:17.560]  Have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[1:59:17.560 --> 1:59:21.720]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared, how all of the world,
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.640]  but we have high quality, swarble food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare

[1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:07.520]  Time is on my side, but it's not on the side of the globalists.
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:10.760]  You know, we got so much to cover and so much to get to, but you know, I really thought
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:12.280]  about this long and hard.
[2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:15.880]  I may, I think over the rest of the hour, I'm just going to air the Trump speech because
[2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:18.720]  you know, it's so historic.
[2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:20.120]  It's being blacked out.
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:21.880]  People aren't supposed to see it.
[2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:26.960]  People aren't supposed to talk about it and they don't want the public to know there's
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:27.960]  real fraud.
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:31.440]  The full speech, 49 minutes is on band.video.
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:36.440]  President Trump gives his most important speech on election fraud 2020.
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:43.200]  I would say documenting, proving election fraud 2020, but there it is.
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:46.280]  And it's so incredibly important.
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:47.280]  You know this stuff.
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:49.120]  You're paying attention, but the general public doesn't.
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  They see the news.
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:51.760]  They hear, oh, there's no evidence.
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:56.040]  Bill Barr, there's no evidence because the system is so scared of Trump or so scared
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:57.040]  of a real president.
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:00:58.040]  They want to get rid of him.
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.360]  They want to put the Crip Keeper Joe Biden in.
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:01.360]  Here it is.
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:02.760]  Thank you.
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  This may be the most important speech I've ever made.
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:13.600]  I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose the tremendous voter fraud
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:20.760]  and irregularities which took place during the ridiculously long November 3rd elections.
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:24.640]  We used to have what was called election day.
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:30.120]  Now we have election days, weeks and months, and lots of bad things happened during this
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:36.480]  ridiculous period of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing to exercise
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:39.680]  our greatest privilege, the right to vote.
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:45.200]  As president, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and the Constitution of
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:46.880]  the United States.
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:53.160]  That is why I am determined to protect our election system, which is now under coordinated
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:55.520]  assault and siege.
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:00.760]  For months leading up to the presidential election, we were warned that we should not
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:03.480]  declare a premature victory.
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:09.240]  We were told repeatedly that it would take weeks, if not months, to determine the winner
[2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:13.840]  to count the absentee balance and to verify the results.
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:18.680]  My opponent was told to stay away from the election, don't campaign.
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:19.840]  We don't need you.
[2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:21.160]  We've got it.
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:23.000]  This election is done.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:28.760]  In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be.
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:33.800]  They had it covered, and perhaps they did, very sadly for our country.
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:36.240]  It was all very, very strange.
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:41.880]  Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint a winner
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:45.440]  even while many key states were still being counted.
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:49.440]  The constitutional process must be allowed to continue.
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:56.040]  We are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:03:00.560]  counted and that no illegal ballot is counted.
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:06.600]  This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me.
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:13.960]  It's about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections.
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:20.680]  Today I will detail some of the shocking irregularities, abuses, and fraud that have been revealed
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:22.080]  in recent weeks.
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:27.040]  But before laying out just a small portion of the evidence we have uncovered, and we
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:32.600]  have so much evidence, I want to explain the corrupt mail-in balloting scheme that Democrats
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:38.640]  systematically put into place that allowed voting to be altered, especially in swing
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:41.120]  states, which they had to win.
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:47.360]  They just didn't know that it was going to be that tough because we were leading in every
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:52.640]  swing state by so much, far greater than they ever thought possible.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:59.320]  While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:09.640]  fraud from Detroit to Philadelphia to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places, what changed
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:18.480]  this year was the Democrat Party's relentless push to print and mail out tens of millions
[2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:26.160]  of ballots sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind.
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:33.680]  This allowed fraud and abuse to occur on a scale never seen before, using the pandemic
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:41.520]  as a pretext. Democrat politicians and judges drastically changed election procedures just
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:47.160]  months and, in some cases, weeks before the election on the 3rd of November.
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:54.520]  Very rarely were legislatures involved, and constitutionally they had to be involved.
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:05:02.320]  But very, very rarely, and you'll see that as we continue to file our suits, it's constitutionally
[2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:08.360]  absolutely incorrect what took place even from a legal standpoint.
[2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:14.560]  Many states such as Nevada and California set millions of live ballots to every person
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:21.240]  on their voter rolls, whether those individuals had requested ballots or not, whether they
[2:05:21.240 --> 2:05:25.440]  were dead or alive, they got ballots.
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:30.560]  Other states such as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin instituted universal absentee
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:37.600]  balloting right in the middle of an election year, sending absentee ballot request forms
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:45.640]  to all voters on all rolls. It didn't matter who they were. This colossal expansion of
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:50.000]  mail-in voting opened the floodgates to massive fraud.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:56.400]  It's a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully
[2:05:56.400 --> 2:06:03.680]  eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state, and
[2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:09.880]  even are non-citizens of our country. Beyond this, the records are riddled with errors,
[2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:16.160]  wrong addresses, duplicate entries, and many other issues.
[2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:24.080]  This is not disputed. It has never been disputed. Dozens of counties in the key swing states
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:31.440]  have more registered voters on the rolls than they have voting age citizens, including
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:39.480]  67 counties in Michigan. All of this is evidence. In Wisconsin, the state's Board of Elections
[2:06:39.480 --> 2:06:46.520]  could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to
[2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:54.640]  remove those names from its voter rolls before the election. They knew why nobody else did.
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:07:02.080]  I knew why. They're illegal voters. It is a travesty that in the year 2020, we do not
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:09.120]  have any means of verifying the eligibility of those who cast ballots and an election,
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:16.320]  and such an important election it is, or determining who they are, whether they live in the state
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:23.920]  or whether they are even American citizens. We have no idea. We have in all swing states
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:31.040]  major infractions or outright fraud, which is far more in numbers or votes than we need
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:37.400]  to overturn the results of a state. In other words, in Wisconsin, as an example, where
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:48.480]  we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes.
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:08:02.640]  And I can show you right here that Wisconsin, we're leading by a lot. And then at 3.42 in
[2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:14.520]  the morning, there was this. It was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden, almost all Biden.
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:19.780]  And to this day, everyone's trying to figure out, where did it come from? But I went from
[2:08:19.780 --> 2:08:28.000]  leading by a lot to losing by a little. And that's right here. That's at 3.42 in the morning.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:36.080]  That's Wisconsin. A terrible thing. Terrible, terrible thing. But we will have far more,
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:44.080]  many times more, than the 20,000 votes needed to overturn the state. If we are right about
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:51.800]  the fraud, Joe Biden can't be president. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes.
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:57.280]  We're talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before. Just as an example in certain
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:08.120]  debates, we'll be down by, let's say, 7,000 votes. But we'll find later on 20,000, 50,000,
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:19.480]  100,000, 200,000 discrepancies or fraudulent votes. And that includes votes that went through
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:25.920]  when they were not allowed to be seen by Republican poll watchers, because the poll watchers were
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:32.880]  locked out of the building. Or people that innocently came to vote on November 3rd, who
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:41.240]  were all excited about their vote. They were happy. They were proud to be citizens of the
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:45.080]  United States of America.
[2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:52.280]  The great reset. Where have I heard of that before? Oh, the great leap forward, Mao Zedong
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:56.880]  ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:01.120]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:05.640]  commune control. And that's all this is. The big mega banks want to break us to the same
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.360]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power. And they're creating the process of getting rid of our
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.760]  old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free, because when you're
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:19.280]  a president, well, everything's free, but you're also a slave. Scotland is going to have universal
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:23.720]  guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level. But of course, you got to take those vaccines.
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:29.120]  You can't have any kids. And oh, don't worry, though, all of the tampons and stuff like
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:34.200]  that's free to as well. I'm not kidding. So give me some free paper. They give me enough
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:38.200]  money to basically live in a tiny apartment, but they own you. They control you. That's
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.280]  the great reset. That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover. And we're fighting
[2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:48.600]  it at info wars.com, ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset. That means
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:53.560]  a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:57.600]  That's the stated admitted plan. Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:02.040]  Democrat mayors, they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:06.840]  go into their control. But if we expose, they're the ones doing it. They go to prison instead
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.960]  of getting total power and total control. And there are major uprisings happening across
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:15.240]  the world. You're going to us. Thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[2:11:15.240 --> 2:11:19.240]  People are finally starting to fight back. But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:24.200]  We have high quality, swarable food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:28.200]  containers ready to ship. But when people figure this out in a few months, I think they'll
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:32.440]  be long lines again to get swarable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:38.080]  So get your orders in today at preparewithallux.com. You get an additional 10% off and they're
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:42.720]  ready to ship. The sale ends next Wednesday, or I guess that's December 2nd. So get your
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:49.720]  orders in now, preparewithallux.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  Thank you for joining us on this live December 3rd, Thursday, global transmission. And something
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:25.200]  that I want to really try to get front and center here on the Alex Jones show is that
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:30.480]  Communist China, by their own admissions, has killed more people than Stalin and Hitler
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:36.600]  combined. And here are just some of the headlines. China is harvesting thousands of human organs
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:43.600]  from its Uighur Muslim minority UN health rights body finds.
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:52.320]  Night Coca Cola lobbying to weaken China forced labor bill. So is Apple Fox Business. Man
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:13:00.120]  locked up in torture to Chinese concentration camp almost had organs harvested. China is
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:07.120]  harvesting organs from detainees tribal tribunal concludes. China organ harvesting four doctors
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:15.880]  are jailed for taking patients liver and kidneys illegally. China forcefully harvest organs
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:23.200]  from detainees NBC news. China doctors jailed it goes on and on concentration camps and
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:27.440]  forced labor China's repression of not just the Muslims Christians, Buddhists as well.
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:33.840]  It's all wrong. And then it gets worse. You've got Apple lobbying against the bill. Let's
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:39.920]  let's pull that up if we can. It's Leningradian AP Reuters. They've even have to admit it.
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:46.920]  The headline is Apple lobbying against law that would condemn slave labor. Even condemning
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.600]  slave labor is bad. No, I mean, I'm not running any slave labor. You hear from Google and
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:56.160]  Apple everybody. I'm the worst guy ever. I'm the devil incarnate. There it is. Apple's
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:01.640]  lobbying against bill aimed at stopping forced labor in China. We mean brutal forced labor
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:08.640]  of prisoners because of their religious beliefs. Mitchell Gerber is an activist who's dedicated
[2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:15.640]  his life to expose and help stop the brutal persecution and human rights atrocities. And
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:19.760]  I'm going to go over all his great work and 16 plus years traveling the world and working
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:25.800]  with Falun Gong practitioners and just visiting the death camps and the hospitals and just
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:32.800]  exposing it all but stop organ harvesting.org and falloninfo.net. And we just salute him
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:40.120]  with us for the rest of the hour. Mr. Gerber, where should we start here as we warn the
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:45.000]  world? Because for me, it's horrible what's happening. And it's terrible. But if the West
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.320]  previously criticized it and China denied it, now they admit it, we don't criticize it.
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:53.960]  Big companies don't criticize it. They actually support it. Come on in. The water's warm.
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:59.360]  I mean, for me, this is like a real crisis of conscience and is a harbinger of where
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.480]  the West is going. If we won't stand up against something that's very Joseph Mingalesh.
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:10.760]  Absolutely, Alex. I am just so grateful and honored to be with you. I was with Owen a
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:15.760]  couple of months ago. I was with Lian Makadu about two or three years ago. You are truly
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:21.840]  the resistance and this is a new form of evil that is going on in China. And we still yet
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:27.400]  have not come to expose this on a large scale because the mainstream media doesn't want
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:34.080]  to cover this. You were actually one of the first that exposed this in Endgame, the blueprint
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:40.480]  for global enslavement in 2007 in your documentary, which was amazing. And that's why I am so
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:45.320]  grateful to reach out to you and expose this particularly against the innocent spiritual
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:49.880]  movement called the fallen gong, which hasn't been exposed like the Uighur Muslims or the
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  House Christians or the Tibetans. But this is a new form of evil where hundreds and thousands
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:00.920]  of innocent fallen gong petitioners and others have just been sent under the military watch
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:06.000]  of the Chinese military colluding with the highest ranking members of the Chinese Communist
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:12.320]  Party to state mandated hospitals. Their organs just cut out of their bodies while alive.
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:17.640]  The organs then sold for massive amounts of profit, producing a multi-billion dollar
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:23.440]  Alex profiteering business for the last 20 years covered up by the mainstream media covered
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:27.720]  up by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, which are controlled by the
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:33.560]  Chinese Communist Party. And just by your your incredible resistance by info wars by
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:37.920]  you by Owen Schreuer, it's amazing. So I'm very grateful to be with you on this show.
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:40.380]  Well, brother, we're honored to have you. Sorry, we got you on late. So you've got the
[2:16:40.380 --> 2:16:45.280]  floor of the next two and a half, three segments, punch right into it, the history of it, what's
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:48.840]  going on, who's being targeted. But you're absolutely right. We hear about the Uyghurs
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:53.120]  all day and I'm and I care about them and it needs to stop. But the fallen gong, what
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:57.320]  the last 20 years that the Communist Party really has come after this totally peaceful
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:03.640]  group. Absolutely. There's there's actually no limit to how far the Chinese Communist
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:09.400]  Party, the CCP will go to wipe out something or someone. And fallen gong is a very peaceful
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:14.640]  spiritual meditation, very similar to yoga, Tai Chi, ladies and gentlemen. And Alex, you
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:19.080]  know, when I came to learn about fallen gong, I was studying international business. I wasn't
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:23.640]  in good shape. And I started to practice these exercises. I believe in God, I come from
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:29.880]  a Jewish Jewish Judeo Christian family. So I didn't want anything dogmatic or religious.
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:34.640]  And I came across this beautiful innocent spiritual group, namely fallen gong, that incorporates
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:40.600]  five simple exercises, and a truly great philosophy grounded in Christianity, Judaism,
[2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:46.040]  socialism, which encompasses truthfulness and compassion and tolerance. And I found out
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:51.040]  that these people were targeted because of three reasons. Number one, it became the largest
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:57.400]  spiritual movement Alex in Chinese history, one out of every 10 Chinese national citizens
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:03.560]  were practicing fallen gong, the spiritual movement by 1998, one out of every 10 Chinese
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:09.680]  national citizens, that's more than half of upper class society. The highest ranking members
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:15.160]  of the communist regime at that time were practicing as well. To the ideology of fallen
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:21.720]  gong, like Christianity, stands in stark contrast to the anti universe, the diabolical nature
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:27.200]  and the evil killing nature of the Chinese Communist Party. And three, because of the
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:34.080]  organs, the benefits of health and longevity, emotional and physiological of fallen gong,
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:41.960]  there was actually investigated and researched by the actual Chinese government to announce
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:48.120]  officially that the fallen gong became the leading health and wellness practice in China.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:52.840]  They did the most worst thing or evil thing. They demonized the spiritual practice as a
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:59.880]  terrorist cult and demonized it to the point where they started to send hundreds and thousands
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:05.560]  of innocent fallen gong petitioners to death camps and state mandated hospitals and concentration
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.320]  camps and cut their organs out of their bodies while alive. And the allegations actually
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:16.680]  started to come out in 2006 with the honorable David Kilgore and David Mattis. And if you
[2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:20.920]  would like to play a clip, I have three clips prepared for you. I sent to Doria. If you
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:26.640]  would like to play one clip and just to put people into context, I think visuals send
[2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:30.800]  to Doria. We'll come back and play those three clips. On the other side, we really appreciate
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:36.240]  Mitchell Gerber at stoporganharvesting.org for joining us. What's crazy is I would cover
[2:19:36.240 --> 2:19:41.240]  Chinese Communist Organ Harvesting 25 years ago. They would say it wasn't real. It wasn't
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:45.320]  human rights groups who documented it. Then China like 12 years ago had like articles saying
[2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:49.560]  we've got the freshest organs. They don't even hide this anymore. And you've got the
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:54.880]  big Australian reports coming out on all of it. And again, to have Apple and Coca Cola
[2:19:54.880 --> 2:20:00.120]  and all of them going along with this really shows you how dangerous these people are and
[2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:03.880]  how these corporations seem to be totally soulless. And then how have you criticized
[2:20:03.880 --> 2:20:09.040]  that you're demonized? So how has the evil Communist Chinese party become the operating
[2:20:09.040 --> 2:20:12.880]  system of this global system? You'll have the floor in the next two seconds. We'll go
[2:20:12.880 --> 2:20:16.520]  in the next hour too. Matt Bracken's coming up, but I got you on late. So we can go in
[2:20:16.520 --> 2:20:21.200]  the next hour if we need to. And then so much more. The big exclusive Joe Rogan interview
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:25.840]  I just did. He was in studio with us. Very rare interview. Four plus hours just went live
[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:30.920]  at band.video. All of you clip it out, share it, whatever. Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, into
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:34.560]  the world emergency broadcast. It's kind of a fun thing. He did it into the world broadcast
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:38.400]  on election day. He did two pieces. So that's the part three of that. It's kind of a joke.
[2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:44.160]  But check the interview out. It's no joke. We'll be right back. There is an economic
[2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:49.520]  war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control. There's a headline out
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:56.360]  of zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose 157 billion
[2:20:56.360 --> 2:21:01.160]  dollars this year by the end of December. It's already over 130 billion dollars they've
[2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:07.760]  lost. Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:11.360]  them? We'll see. That'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control. That's
[2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:15.800]  the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They
[2:21:15.800 --> 2:21:20.440]  want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up. For pennies on the dollar, that's
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:24.280]  why the great stock market crash in 29 later turned out was engineered by some central
[2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:30.160]  banks. This is how the global estate control. It stars the third world to death, makes the
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:34.760]  first world poor, it's economic warfare, and it gives cover to the big megabanks that
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:39.880]  created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives. Only the truth will set
[2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:47.840]  us free in full wars dot com. Prepare with Alex dot com is a special website with my

[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:29.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:41.600]  You're listening to Alex Jones of all the evils on the planet. Communist China has killed
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:45.280]  over 100 million of its own people. That's more than Hitler and Stalin combined. It's
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:50.720]  the heavyweight champion of death. And Mitchell Gerber is a researcher, author does a great
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:55.400]  job at stop organ harvesting dot org. And he's getting into the organ harvesting and
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:25:01.480]  the enslavement and the evil and the suppression, but then also the great resistance we see
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:05.560]  forming against it worldwide. So you've got the floor, sir, cover all the points, what's
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:10.280]  happening when people need to know about the pure evil, like we folks said, oh, we didn't
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:13.520]  know about Hitler. Later it came out, or we didn't know about this. Well, we know about
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.520]  this and our biggest corporations are aiding and abetting it, which shows us if we don't
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:23.400]  have empathy, people think empathy is some loving, wonderful thing. Well, it comes from
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:27.200]  because you're a good person. But empathy, as you realize, if something's happening to
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:31.800]  them, it can happen to me. That's why we have empathy. And the sociopathic corporate leaders
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:36.600]  don't have it. They think they're immune from it. No one is immune from the evil that is
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:40.160]  the Communist Chinese Party. Please, please lay it out for us.
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:44.440]  Absolutely, Alex. I couldn't agree more. And you said it best 25 years ago and now it's
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:48.200]  smacking them in the face. They're like cornered rats. They got nowhere to hide, nowhere to
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:54.120]  ride on a sinking ship. And for me, I've been dealing with 20 years of my life trying to
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:59.600]  expose this as well, particularly against the fallen gong. And that that group hasn't
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:04.320]  come to the limelight yet, the Uighur Muslims have the house Christians and Tibetans. But
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:09.200]  this innocent group of people called the fallen gong have not. But for the first clip is taken
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:15.240]  from hard to believe documentary and 18 award winning documentary 18 awards to it actually
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:20.360]  and the Peabody Award a very prestigious European award given to this documentary. I'd love
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:25.120]  to share the clip one and clip two with you and your audience. Go ahead and roll clip
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:27.200]  one. Here it is.
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:32.400]  Crimes in history began taking place in hospitals throughout the country as organ transplants
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:38.600]  suddenly began to skyrocket. We've been asked to investigate allegations that there has
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:44.320]  been harvesting of organs of fallen gong in China. Our bottom line conclusion after considering
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:49.440]  everything as best we could was that the allegations are true. I began conducting comprehensive
[2:26:49.440 --> 2:26:54.640]  interviews with medical professionals, Chinese law enforcement personnel and over 50 refugees
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:59.600]  from the Lao guy system. But I estimate that 65,000 fallen gong were murdered for their
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:05.040]  organs from 2000 to 2008. Essentially what organ harvesting means is they're taking
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:11.880]  fallen gong practitioners literally like cattle holding in prison camps, testing their blood
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:17.360]  and other vital organs and when someone comes into the country that needs a heart, a liver,
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:22.400]  a kidney, they find a match, they take the fallen gong practitioner, extract their organs
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:28.120]  of course killing them in the process.
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:33.400]  People who are expecting this to sort of just be solved naturally by all we have to do is
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:42.200]  sit back and they'll fix it. This is wrong. The West has to take a role and the one role
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:47.880]  the West can do is say these are our values. We cannot go beyond this. There are certain
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:51.720]  lines we can't cross. This is a red line. That's an absolute red line.
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:57.240]  Enver Toti, the surgeon turned bus driver says it's been 20 years since he removed the organs
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:03.680]  from that live prisoner. It remains a mystery why so few people have ever heard about the
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:14.680]  thing he says he cannot forget. This is my experience. This is a real true story. If
[2:28:14.680 --> 2:28:24.200]  you keep silence, this tragedy will continue. People just don't want to touch this evil
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:31.080]  because if you touch this evil, maybe at the end of the day, you may not be able to tackle
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:38.480]  this and the consequences. Wow. That is my guess.
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:45.160]  Let's hit pause here. This is clip two. And that's exactly it. The evil is so big, people
[2:28:45.160 --> 2:28:49.960]  just can't believe it, so they're scared they don't fight it, which makes it even stronger.
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:55.760]  Amazing. Tell folks where that clip came from. That's from the documentary Hard to Believe
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:01.440]  and it kind of reminds me about the resistance that you put forward in Endgame. When I saw
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:06.280]  Endgame and you mentioned about the Fallen Gong in 2007, when nobody wanted to listen
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:12.800]  about it, I thought you are a hero to humankind, Alex Jones. You are someone that has got
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:16.600]  God on his side and is going to bring so many people to the light.
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:20.480]  Let's be calm on a hero. If they can kill all these hundreds of thousands of people,
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:26.440]  I'm next. This is evil. Yes, absolutely. But the light will always
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:31.600]  triumph over evil. What is a man who cannot make the world a better place than you or
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:37.720]  that man? As I am and as Owen is and as David is and as other people on your shows are.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:42.240]  I want to see this film. Tell folks the name of it again.
[2:29:42.240 --> 2:29:46.120]  Hard to Believe and it's a free documentary on YouTube and I just wanted to share it with
[2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:48.680]  you. I haven't even seen it. I'm glad you shared it. What's the next clip? Tell us
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:52.280]  we'll play it. The next clip is also continuing on the Hard
[2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:58.400]  to Believe documentary and I think it's poignant tips and irrefutable evidence that is going
[2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:04.800]  on and then I'll explain the investigators behind this who came out in 2006 that exposed
[2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:10.080]  the irrefutable evidence, at least now 54 pieces of evidence that is irrefutable and
[2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:12.240]  cannot be denied. Oh, the Australian government confirmed
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:17.200]  it all. Here it is. 2000 Falun Gong practitioners were disappearing
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:22.960]  into labor camps and mass numbers. At the same time, Chinese hospitals began promoting
[2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:30.160]  their organ transplant expertise. I'm David Maitis. With me is David Kilgore. We've been
[2:30:30.160 --> 2:30:35.960]  asked to investigate allegations that there has been harvesting of organs of Falun Gong
[2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:40.040]  in China. David Kilgore is a former member of parliament and former cabinet minister
[2:30:40.040 --> 2:30:44.760]  for Asia Pacific and I'm a Winnipeg lawyer doing immigration, refugee and international
[2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:51.120]  human rights law in Winnipeg and we have now done our investigation and we're producing
[2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:56.600]  this report. And I didn't know whether it was true or not and so my task initially was
[2:30:56.600 --> 2:31:02.520]  to try to figure out a way of approaching the issue so I could either prove it or disprove
[2:31:02.520 --> 2:31:07.360]  it and not just walk away and say I don't know. The number of executions in China varied
[2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:12.920]  widely depending on who was counting but Maitis says no matter which number he used, the number
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:19.760]  of executions and the number of organs didn't add up. The transplant volumes increased substantially
[2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:23.480]  after the persecution of Falun Gong began and I mean there's a lot of other evidence
[2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:30.900]  but the most likely explanation for the increase is the Falun Gong. We pursued every investigative
[2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:36.000]  trial we could find. In the report you will see that there are 18 different avenues of
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:41.520]  proof and disproof we considered and evaluated. Our bottom line conclusion after considering
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.240]  everything as best we could was that the allegations are true. We believe them to be true, that
[2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:52.520]  this harvesting is indeed happening. Maitis says what made Falun Gong organs especially
[2:31:52.520 --> 2:31:57.360]  attractive was the practitioner's healthy lifestyle. They do not drink or smoke. On
[2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:01.880]  many of the recordings of phone calls made to more than 100 Chinese hospitals, doctors
[2:32:01.880 --> 2:32:15.800]  assure callers that transplant organs are from healthy Falun Gong practitioners. They put
[2:32:15.800 --> 2:32:21.680]  up brochures that call them fresh and healthy. If we allow this to happen it's going to
[2:32:21.680 --> 2:32:27.640]  happen to us. So to read it's not some heroic action it's a defensive action. This is evil,
[2:32:27.640 --> 2:32:34.400]  this is wrong, this is out of control and now it's been scaled up massively. Why are
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:41.720]  we hearing Uyghurs, I don't care who they are, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Falun Gong,
[2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:46.520]  but why are we hearing about Uyghurs but not Falun Gong or Christians as much? Is it the
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:53.680]  Muslim lobby or what? No because this is a new form of evil that the Chinese Communist
[2:32:53.680 --> 2:33:02.440]  Party has produced Alex a multi-billion dollar profiteering business. Basically Falun Gong
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:07.720]  is the Krim De La Krim. 95% of the organs are coming from the Falun Gong plus the Uyghur
[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:13.400]  Muslims, house Christians and Tibetans. But the 95% of all organs combined over the last
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:18.400]  20 years have been coming from Falun Gong. So this is a cover-up of all cover-ups, a
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:22.400]  new form of evil. No other government has done this in the past. There hasn't been a
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:29.400]  killed organ order, legal, state-sanctioned, forced live organ harvesting genocide. Even
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:33.920]  the Nazis did not do something like this. So when the real truth comes out about Falun
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:39.760]  Gong, the real donor pool that has been harvested, 95% of the time.
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:34:03.240]  We'll stay there. Let's talk about when you come back.
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:14.760]  Let's talk about when you come back.
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:30.080]  Let's talk about when you come back.
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:43.800]  Let's talk about when you come back.
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:35:10.800]  Globalists in their minions want to play God, Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:17.800]  Trump.
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:23.540]  I think you have God's potential that God gave you ladies and gentlemen the great epic battle is now here
[2:35:23.540 --> 2:35:24.400]  It's now upon us
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:30.280]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about infill wars now more than ever when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:33.640]  We know you're gonna override these globalists. We know you're gonna defeat them
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:36.540]  I just want to salute you all for your action everything you've already done
[2:35:36.840 --> 2:35:40.040]  Because God's on our side and the globalists know it
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:48.060]  The trick that social engineers use is very very simple
[2:35:48.180 --> 2:35:50.980]  they just teach us that the architecture of
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:59.580]  civilization that the trajectory of the species is designed by these ever-knowing loving liberal technocrats and
[2:36:00.140 --> 2:36:03.080]  That if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great
[2:36:03.080 --> 2:36:08.940]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth and we need to be faced out
[2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:13.360]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:17.720]  Just being very passive living in the matrix like system
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:24.600]  That they're building but what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:30.560]  Is that we control our environment? We build our own environments. We create our own systems
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:36.240]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:42.680]  But instead we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle. That's the trick
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:47.360]  The great reset. Where have I heard of that before? Oh the great
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:50.160]  Leak forward Mao Zedong
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:53.120]  Ordering all the small towns and small farms
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:59.680]  To basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:01.120]  commune control
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.480]  And that's all this is the big mega banks want to break us of the same ones that put Mao Zedong into power
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:10.900]  And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy bringing in the new economy where everything's free
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:13.120]  Because when you're a prisoner
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:15.120]  Well, everything's free, but you're also a slave
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:20.040]  Scotland is gonna have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:25.420]  But of course you got to take those vaccines. You can't have any kids and oh and don't worry though all of the
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:29.680]  Campons and stuff like that's free too as well. I'm not kidding
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:36.240]  So give me some free paper. They give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment, but they own you they control you
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:42.300]  That's the great reset. That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars.com
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:38:04.480]  If Jeffrey Dahmer killed 1015 people in harvest of their organs, oh my gosh
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.920]  Special TV shows about it movies and everyone's scared. Oh, he's a monster
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.800]  But when a government does it to hundreds of thousands of people. Oh, it's a good thing
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:21.400]  An apple stem cook helps run it. Look at these headlines coming up next hour
[2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:24.040]  I'm gonna cover this security cam catches poll watchers
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:29.440]  Bringing out hidden ballots after kicking out poll watchers. Oh
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:39.920]  Meanwhile top microbiologist has covered vaccine downright dangerous will send you to your doom on Fox News and
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:47.360]  All the big rich people on their private jets they exempt from the quarantines not wearing masks all caught on video
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:51.160]  But you're the one that follows the orders so they laugh about it
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:59.280]  That's all coming up next hour going back to Mitchell Gerber of stop organ harvesting dot or G
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:04.280]  Very well-spoken journalists and Patriot getting into all this you have one more clip you want to play when I go to that
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:06.560]  Now or what else you want us to know about what's really happening?
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:10.840]  Let's play with that. Let's play the last clip Alex and I'll share with you
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:16.600]  Here's the next clip from the EP body award-winning documentary about the organ harvesting. Here it is
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:23.920]  And the most outrageous example of no human rights in China is killing a
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:27.920]  peaceful community of fellow golf practitioners and
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:35.920]  and and Uighurs who are Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists and Christians house Christians for their
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:42.840]  Organs kidneys liver and so on and then selling the organs to wealthy Chinese or foreigners
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:45.160]  And the people are killed in the process
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:54.320]  The belief that I have I share with David Kilgore that organ harvesting is widespread in China and
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:59.960]  And it is restricted almost exclusively to Falun Gong practitioners
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:07.400]  the Falun Gong art of the Chinese regime of today what the Jews were to the Nazis during the war and
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.880]  We should all take note of this and look at China with new eyes
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:17.480]  There's no evidence that Falun Gong is a cult of any sort
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:23.480]  There's no evidence of political action to try and bring down the Chinese government
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:28.920]  There's no evidence of anything other than a deep desire to be left alone to practice
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:36.080]  Their spiritual beliefs in peace and to not be locked up and murdered David and I have met Falun Gong practitioners in probably 50 countries
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:40.360]  for even more me all walks of life all
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:45.600]  Ages all backgrounds all education. I've found them to be a wonderful group of people
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:49.760]  Yeah, I mean I wouldn't disagree with any of that. I mean it fell on gong
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:55.240]  First of all, it's not even an organization because it's a set of exercises at the spiritual foundation
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:41:00.320]  Everything's on the internet. You don't pay anything. You don't sign up to anything
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:05.600]  You can start whenever you want you can stop with it whenever you want you really have to tell anybody you're doing it
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:07.720]  Their principles are
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:11.520]  Is it's non-centralized
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:19.800]  That's why they hate it is it's non-centralized and and and that's why they're targeting it and that's why they've it's like Satanic
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:23.760]  I'm gonna absorb you. I'm gonna cut your guts out. I'm gonna sell you and
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:27.880]  You're right. They're not doing it as much to the Christians or the Muslims
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:33.520]  They're just working them to death and killing them that it was Falun Gong. It's like we're absorbing you. We're selling your organs
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:35.520]  This is so satanic
[2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:43.640]  Absolutely Alex and what makes it more satanic is that on June 10th 1999 one one month before the complete
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:48.200]  Band of Falun Gong because Falun Gong is completely banned in China
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:50.600]  The Chinese Communist Party leader
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:54.040]  Zhang Zemin who is the evil head of the Communist Party?
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:59.240]  He is basically there's two factions right now in China of the Communist Party on a verge of collapse
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:07.560]  The president she factor and the Jiang Zemin factor and a faction and Jiang Zemin was a president who completely outlawed Falun Gong in
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:09.000]  1999
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.800]  Established a Gestapo type office. Well, let's stop there
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:15.240]  Talk about it. You're a smart guy. You've stated tell people about the the
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:21.960]  Interfactions the party and like you said on the verge of collapse. I totally agree. It's what they launched the covid bio attack explain the different factions
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:28.800]  100% that's why they launched it exactly because the president she faction is in complete cohoots
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:30.760]  They're basically at war with each other
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:38.440]  It's a demonic specter the Communist specter and they are completely on a verge of collapse because their social political and economic realms
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:45.440]  Have completely depleted and Trump was a mastermind behind that only Trump and that's why God bless our president
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:47.720]  I'm an American citizen. I come from South Africa
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:52.560]  I was raised in America for 25 years in in Atlanta, Georgia where the CDC is
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:59.480]  We're where FBI is we coca-cola is so I know very much the complicit criminality of the deep state and only Trump
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:03.960]  Out of all the presidents because Obama has been with the tricombs and bear with the tricombs
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:09.680]  Joe Biden is the is is the the Trojan horse for the Chinese Communist Party. I actually love it how
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:14.960]  We I saw that the animation of Joe Biden. You're removing the face and you see president. She
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:18.480]  Behind it. That's exactly what is going on
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:25.460]  So with Trump putting the death now in the Communist Party, it is only a matter of time when it completely collapses and the and the
[2:43:25.460 --> 2:43:32.360]  Chinese people will regain the freedom that they once had before the communist regime and the globalist took control of China
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:36.200]  So yeah, Alex, I don't I know you're not a hero
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:41.920]  But you are only the very few in this world that are exposing this and allowing us people like myself to come on
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:45.560]  Because many mainstream don't they won't even cover that they won't even touch it
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:50.840]  Especially the leftist the radical I get it info wars is incredibly important. You're incredibly important
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:55.160]  I think the listeners the listeners are enforced all of us together don't want to be slaves
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:00.480]  We want freedom. That's why financially supporting us spreading the word keeping us on air is so critical
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:02.040]  I know we're super important
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:07.000]  I'm just saying it's all of us collectively wanting to be free and and I agree with you all the numbers show
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:10.360]  The Chinese people don't want to be under the communist rule
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:17.320]  The Chinese people are great people versus the leadership of that. I want you to talk about their their their hunger for freedom is incredible
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:22.080]  Absolutely, and that's why I wish I could you know, I saw Joe Rogan with you
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:23.440]  I wish I could be on Joe Rogan
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:28.280]  I wish I could be on Steven Crowder with Candice Owens because these people have got incredible
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:35.760]  Incredible backing and and millions of people listening. So I hope that and we say this this is the issue just like
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:39.800]  Trump gets it. It's globalism in China against America
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:47.000]  Everyone must hammer China hammer big tech for being in bed with China and discredit them. I mean my god
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:55.360]  Apple helps run death camps Coca-Cola does they they help take organs. They're discredited. They're over. They're done
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:00.080]  We have instead they want to do it to us here. No, no, no
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:06.240]  Yeah, no, they cannot and under Trump's reign Trump's administration. Thank God, he must stay in Alex
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:12.080]  He must stay in he cannot concede. This has been a stolen read election backed by the Chai comms and
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:18.080]  It's it's it's so easy to see but yet so deceptive. They're the masters of manipulation
[2:45:19.080 --> 2:45:28.080]  And there's a great documentary in a publication before I forget called the nine commentaries on the Communist Party by the Epoch Times out of New York
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:33.080]  It's a real phenomenal newspaper. I think Trump reads it all the time. It's amazing
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:41.080]  It's an amazing group. But like I said, I hope Joe Rogan and I hope Steven Crowley and Candice Owens and others and
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:47.080]  And the blaze tp. This is the cause celeb for humanity China is the model for us
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:51.080]  We must discredit that model and say the people of China to save ourselves
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:56.080]  Exactly exactly and I and you are the resistance you are the leader of the resistance and I and I like I said
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:46:01.080]  I hope they get me on their show or people like ourselves like David Kilgore David matters
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:03.080]  I hope you can get the investigators on your show
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:09.080]  To share about this because they are the ones that are actually bringing the evidence to the forefront
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:12.080]  I'm just the one that brings them to the to do
[2:46:12.080 --> 2:46:19.080]  You tell us who to have on and we'll have you on with them and we love you and we appreciate you stop organ harvesting
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:21.080]  dot org
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:26.080]  Follow on info dot net. We got a few minutes to break here. What else you want to add?
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:33.080]  I just want to say Alex, you know to all the patriots out there. Don't give up believing yourself. Stay strong believing in our
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:40.080]  Crater believing our great president because he's truly making America great again. These deep states
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:47.080]  Traitors will not get away with this. The tricoms are collapsing and you know
[2:46:47.080 --> 2:46:52.080]  To fail to support the good and to fail to expose evil is unacceptable
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:55.080]  So God bless you Alex and God bless your entire info war team
[2:46:55.080 --> 2:46:59.080]  I think I'm going with I want to go speaking with Owen in a couple of hours
[2:46:59.080 --> 2:47:01.080]  Totally
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:04.080]  You're right if you don't oppose it you're part of it
[2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:06.080]  Exactly
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:10.080]  Everyone now has a choice to stand on the right side of destiny or the wrong
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:12.080]  So thank you very much for allowing me to share
[2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  It's not like we're doing this because we're heroes. We cannot join with Satan you either oppose it or you're with it
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:23.080]  People you know that you're either fighting it or you're with it. There's no middle ground here
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:31.080]  Exactly. You are that you are the with you align yourself with the red devil and Satan or you are against it
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:35.080]  Fighting it on the front lines as we are as info warriors
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:39.080]  Talk about this briefly. We'll do five more minutes on this side because you've studied China you've traveled there
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:44.080]  You know all people have been through it. There's such a scientific commitment of evil by the Chinese communists
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:50.080]  Like David Rockefeller found his perfect evil of them that at all CFR all the sickness in the world
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:56.080]  That on China to be the champion dragon like revelation says that the you know that everything rides on
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:47:58.080]  We're gonna come back in one minute
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:04.080]  Give me your take on what enters people know the true face of evil straight ahead with Mitchell Gerber
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:11.080]  I'm Alex Jones. You can find him at stop organ harvesting dot org you can find us at info wars.com and news wars.com
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:18.080]  They want to shut us down the Joe Rogan interview just broke at Bandai video share that and by the products info or store.com promo code

[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:32.080]  You know listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  And for word of mouth and we're all this together and I you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey

[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:57.080]  That is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:01.080]  And we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out the open
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:06.080]  Our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off here. That's why America has got to be taken down
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:11.080]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:16.080]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:21.080]  Because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all and get an info wars store.com
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  Get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and so much more
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:27.080]  They're wonderful products and they support the info we're thank you
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:33.080]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:44.080]  There's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose 157 bills
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  There's 157 billion dollars this year by the end of December
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:52.080]  It's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:58.080]  Why would they take part in the hoax in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:04.080]  We'll see that'll knock out all the small airlines and it's all they control and it's the same in every single industry
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:08.080]  And the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They want to bankrupt the world economy
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:15.080]  Right up for pennies on the dollar that's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:18.080]  This is how the globalists take control
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:23.080]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  And it gives cover to the big megabanks to create thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:39.080]  Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:04.080]  Hey, we're big listeners and we've got epic times out here and we love you Alex Jones
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:06.080]  There's all these Chinese people around me loving me
[2:51:06.080 --> 2:51:11.080]  And that's most American Chinese that have been through this evil or have family that's there, they know it
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  So it's not the Chinese people, they're wonderful hard-working people
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:19.080]  The globalists saw, put Mao in, took control of them, have enslaved them
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:22.080]  So our enemies, not the Chinese people, they're amazing people, they're the victims of this
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:27.080]  And the same global corporations that put Mao in are now trying to merge us with this
[2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:32.080]  And this evil, so Mitchell Gerber, what is the spirit of evil in China, the Red Dragon?
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  Why is it the model of the globalist program?
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:42.080]  The specter of communism is a red rain of terror
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:47.080]  There's no other regime on the face of the earth that has wiped out over 100 million people
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:50.080]  Alex decimated 5,000 years of Chinese culture
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:54.080]  The communist specter made arrangements to corrupt both the East and the West
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  So in the East they committed ruthless slaughter and forced people to accept atheism
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:06.080]  Completely intentionally destroying the spirit, connecting the divine to humanity
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:12.080]  And destroying millions of people who would not be controlled as their slaves
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:17.080]  So the globalists with the CCP now are trying to destroy America
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:24.080]  But the Chinese people like the American patriots do not want this and cannot allow this
[2:52:24.080 --> 2:52:31.080]  So it's just a matter of time when this rain of specter that conquered in order to kill
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  The intentional killing nature is horrendous, is going to die out
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:40.080]  We cannot have this kind of darkness poison our world anymore
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:42.080]  It's cancer
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:45.080]  And it's infiltrated into the leftist liberal university students
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:49.080]  You've seen with Caitlyn Bennett who's done an incredible job with Liberty Hangout
[2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  Going to the universities and look at how she's met
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:52:56.080]  She has to have five bodyguards because they want to hurt her
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:53:00.080]  And for those that don't know, it's not that women are bad, the system targets them
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:04.080]  Under Mao it is teenage girls become the main murder army
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:07.080]  This isn't children of corn, this is real
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  Absolutely
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  So if people do not value virtues, the Chinese Communist Party what made it so evil
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:22.080]  Is the killing nature and the intentional dismantling of the morality of human beings
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  There's no code of conduct, there's no moral standards to maintain
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:29.080]  Remember they had those dinners where they would eat the dead bodies?
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:31.080]  Yes, exactly
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:37.080]  And the foetuses said, oh it's horrendous
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:44.080]  The cannibalism, the killing of dogs or boiling of puppies and dogs in boiling water
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:50.080]  The Chinese Communist Party is not the Chinese people and certainly not the Chinese civilization
[2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:53.080]  This is the reign of terror Alex that is going to be stopped
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:57.080]  And thank God Trump is in power and he must stay in power
[2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:02.080]  He cannot concede to this rotten Trojan treasonous, deep state scum
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:05.080]  That is in bed and aligned with the Chinese Communist Party
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:10.080]  So thank God for you, thank God for me, thank God for people like the investigators
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:14.080]  David Kilgore, David Mattis, Ethan Gutman who I really would love on your show
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:20.080]  And one of these days because when this Pandora's box blasts open
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:24.080]  And people come to realize how evil the communist regime has gone
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:27.080]  To destroy an innocent practice like the fallen gong
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.080]  People are going to be shocked and soul stirred
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  So again Alex, I know we haven't got much time but God bless you man, thank you very much
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:41.080]  Well Mitchell, I appreciate you but just to see Google and Apple defending the slave camps
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:46.080]  And lobbying against laws that condemn them
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:48.080]  They don't even get in trouble under these laws
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:52.080]  Congress is going to condemn it, they don't want to condemn slave camps
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  But then there are censors that want to tell us how we're bad because we support President Trump
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  These people are too authoritarian and America has a blind spot
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:08.080]  Because we've not been this evil to where we just project the whole world our goodness
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:11.080]  It's incredible, Mitchell Gerber, stoporganharvesting.org
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  Thank you so much for the time
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:17.080]  Thank you sir, and as you were saying just one quick point
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:19.080]  Extinction before loss of profit
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:24.080]  But like I said this evil monstrosity are like cornered rats on a sinking ship
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:27.080]  They've got no place to hide, no place to run
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:30.080]  We are the resistance and we will win out the day
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:33.080]  Because good will always triumph over evil, Alex, and you know that
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  To the metaphysical truth, Mitchell Gerber, thank you so much

[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:22.080]  I'm only here because of you, and I'm very thankful to all of you
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:26.080]  Because believe me, I have seen a lot of stuff
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  And I'm just very thankful that I'm on the side with God, barely
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  Because I see the other stuff they do
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:42.080]  They're bad
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:44.080]  Just thank God you're not with them
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:47.080]  Don't worry even about your body, folks, what people think about you or any of it
[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:52.080]  Nothing matters, just make sure with God
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:56.080]  Because the devil's real, man, you don't want to be with the devil
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:57:59.080]  And you're going to see stuff, you know, you're going to see a lot
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:01.080]  So am I
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:03.080]  We're just going to have to go through this together
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:05.080]  But at the end, God's real know that
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:07.080]  So look at these big headlines on infoawards.com
[2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:11.080]  So much big breaking news that Matt Bracken is taking over soon
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:15.080]  Security cam catches poll workers
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:18.080]  Bringing out hidden ballots after kicking out poll watchers
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:21.080]  I mean, yeah, they ship in the fake ballots
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:26.080]  They kick everybody out and now you have the footage completing the circuit
[2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:28.080]  We saw them kick the poll watchers out
[2:58:28.080 --> 2:58:32.080]  We saw Chinese men get out of hands and bring them in in all these states
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:35.080]  We saw the records of private jets flying in to drop the ballots off
[2:58:35.080 --> 2:58:39.080]  We saw all of it
[2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:43.080]  And now they have the final footage, here it is
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:47.080]  At about 8 o'clock in the morning, we're going to roll this back and show it to you
[2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:48.080]  There you go
[2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:52.080]  So now they're going to start pulling these ballots out from under this table
[2:58:52.080 --> 2:58:58.080]  This table, the black one, was placed there by the lady with the blonde braids
[2:58:58.080 --> 2:59:01.080]  At about 8.22 a.m. in the morning
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:04.080]  So she put that table there
[2:59:04.080 --> 2:59:07.080]  So the same person who's staying behind now, the same person who cleared the place out
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:10.080]  Under the pretense that we're going to stop counting
[2:59:10.080 --> 2:59:15.080]  Is the person who put the table there at 8.22 in the morning
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:19.080]  Yeah, I saw four suitcases come out from underneath the table
[2:59:25.080 --> 2:59:28.080]  Yeah, upper right hand, you see the gentleman in the red
[2:59:28.080 --> 2:59:30.080]  So he just pulled one out
[2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:35.080]  So this is a smoking gun, it's closed, keep going, you can't be there
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:37.080]  And now they're pulling out the special ballots
[2:59:37.080 --> 2:59:41.080]  So what are these ballots doing there separate from all the other ballots?
[2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:46.080]  And why are they only counting them whenever the place is cleared out with no witnesses?
[2:59:46.080 --> 2:59:49.080]  Is the question
[2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:56.080]  So these machines can process about 3,000 ballots an hour
[2:59:56.080 --> 3:00:01.080]  You have multiple machines there, and they're there for two hours
[3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  So you do the math
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:07.080]  How many ballots went through those machines in those two hours when there was no one there to supervise
[3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:11.080]  To be present consistent with your statutes and rules
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  To supervise the tabulation
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  We believe that could easily be and probably is certainly beyond the margin of victory in this race
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  And of course, they announced that, oh, we're freezing it, no more counting
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:26.080]  And then in all the states, the counting continued
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:30.080]  Caught, read, fricken, handed
[3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:35.080]  But if you put it on Twitter or Facebook, oh, they banned you, you're not allowed to
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:41.080]  Meanwhile, watch Man Bullhorn, Austin Mayor, who told residents to stay home, not go out to eat
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:44.080]  While he was on a private jet party in Cancun
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:46.080]  Here's some of that video
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:49.080]  You see that there?
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:52.080]  Calls all over
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  We want you out of office
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:56.080]  And if you'll call in a minute
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:58.080]  You hear me call all of them?
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:00:59.080]  Calls all of them
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:02.080]  And there are other, how's Mexico?
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:09.080]  Can we have Thanksgiving or a Christmas yet?
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:11.080]  You see that there?
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:13.080]  By the way, I'm going out tonight to protest him
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  I'll be out there tonight
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:18.080]  Join me at nine o'clock at the W tonight
[3:01:18.080 --> 3:01:20.080]  Nine o'clock at the W tonight
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  To protest Adler, I'll be there
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:25.080]  To protest Adler's criminal activity, nine p.m. tonight
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:27.080]  Join me or roll over and die
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  Top microbiologist says COVID vaccine downright dangerous will send you to your doom
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:37.080]  They waved all the studies, waved all the research, they admit eight percent get sick
[3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  If you say it, you're a conspiracy theorist
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:44.080]  But here is Dr. Schuchart Bacardi
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:47.080]  Retired microbiologist prestigious slanging out
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  Here it is
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:52.080]  So you hear a book titled Corona, False Alarm Exploded in Germany
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:54.080]  Became an instant best seller
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:57.080]  That's a simple question, is COVID panic worse than the disease?
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:02:00.080]  The controversial co-author of this book
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:03.080]  Corona, False Alarm Facts and Figures joins us now
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:06.080]  Award-winning researcher, retired microbiologist
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:09.080]  Dr. Schuchart Bacardi
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:12.080]  Doctor, thank you for getting up early for all of us
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:15.080]  For all these policies, lockdowns, social distancing
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:20.080]  Which in your view has been the most injurious to the public
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:23.080]  And not suited to the science?
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:29.080]  The looming vaccination
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:32.080]  So the vaccination, on the issue of the vaccination
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  We'll get to that in a moment, but on the social distancing and the masks
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.080]  Just focusing on that for a moment
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:45.080]  Which of those two in your research and your work has been the most displaced?
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:48.080]  Both
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:49.080]  Both have
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  Not at all backed up by the science
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:57.080]  Zero science
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  So why are they pushing this?
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:00.080]  It's zero science
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  I mean they'll show videos of people coughing through masks and without masks
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  And it's terrifying people here in the country
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  This is something that we, and when I say we
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:16.080]  It's hundreds and thousands of people
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  Are standing up to say, please, all of you
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  Sit down and think about this
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:26.080]  Read up on this and then make up your own mind
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  Don't believe things that people are telling you
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  Think for yourself and come to your own conclusions
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:34.080]  That is why we wrote this book
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:39.080]  Because all the arguments saying, telling you why
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:44.080]  What you are doing is absolutely nonsense
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  Are in that book
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:52.080]  And there's no question that is left open to you
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  All you have to do is go and read and think
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  And Dr, on the issue of the vaccine
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:03.080]  Tonight Anthony Fauci on this network
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:09.080]  Actually said that 75% of Americans are going to have to get vaccinated
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:11.080]  To reach what they call herd immunity
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:13.080]  Do you?
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:15.080]  Do you buy that?
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:17.080]  What utter nonsense?
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  I know that Dr. Fauci is a renowned
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:23.080]  Immunologist
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:26.080]  Medical scientist and immunologist
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:30.080]  But what he says has to be wrong
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:34.080]  And this is also what we have taken great lengths
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:36.080]  To explain in the book
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:41.080]  And why, you know
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  Someone who says this has not the slightest inkling
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:50.080]  Of the basics of immunology
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  And this is very, very surprising
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:55.080]  For someone of Dr. Fauci standing
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:00.080]  And I would dare to defy him anywhere in the world
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:02.080]  At any time
[3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:07.080]  But I cannot do this in two minutes
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  Well, so you believe that the COVID vaccine is not necessary?
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:15.080]  I think it's downright dangerous
[3:05:15.080 --> 3:05:18.080]  And I warn you
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:20.080]  If you go along these lines
[3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:25.080]  You are going to go to your doom
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:30.080]  And it's so, so unnecessary
[3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:33.080]  That's right folks
[3:05:33.080 --> 3:05:37.080]  The mRNA vaccine reprograms your whole body
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:39.080]  It's a takeover
[3:05:39.080 --> 3:05:42.080]  When they got away with brain-damaging tens of millions of young boys
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:45.080]  They just said, let's head up with everything
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:48.080]  If Hitler attacked with tanks and airplanes, you'd fight
[3:05:48.080 --> 3:05:53.080]  When they come with the vaccine, you're going to roll over
[3:05:53.080 --> 3:05:56.080]  And the neurological disorders, the cancer, the sterilization
[3:05:56.080 --> 3:05:58.080]  It hits you years later
[3:05:58.080 --> 3:06:01.080]  And there's a medical doctor, a prestigious scientist looking up
[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:05.080]  Telling you something's going on, don't take this shot
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:08.080]  And almost all real scientists say that, by the way
[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:10.080]  These are moral men and women
[3:06:10.080 --> 3:06:12.080]  And then they go, oh, the science
[3:06:12.080 --> 3:06:14.080]  All scientists agree, global warming's real
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:16.080]  All scientists agree, take the shot
[3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:18.080]  This is their big move, folks
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:20.080]  They're all making hundreds of billions of dollars
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:22.080]  They're shutting us down saying you're not essential
[3:06:22.080 --> 3:06:24.080]  They're saying you're not essential
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:26.080]  It's Bill Gates says, I want to depopulate you
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  But take this shot so you live longer
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:32.080]  Matt Bracken takes over right now
[3:06:32.080 --> 3:06:34.080]  Please spread the word
[3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:36.080]  Joe Rogan's interview has been posted at Band-Aut Video
[3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:38.080]  Please share, we'll be right back
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:43.080]  Introducing InfoWars Life, pure turmeric extract
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:47.080]  This is taken under the tongue, it is pure turmeric
[3:06:47.080 --> 3:06:52.080]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:06:52.080 --> 3:06:57.080]  That is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:00.080]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:03.080]  And then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:05.080]  So it's more of an intense delivery system
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:09.080]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated
[3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:11.080]  And our first product got rave reviews

[3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:18.080]  Some like bodies better, for me, they're both amazing
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:20.080]  For their anti-inflammatory action and so much more

[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:14.080]  Matt Bracken takes over
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:16.080]  But first, the big Joe Rogan interview
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:19.080]  Four hours long
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:22.080]  Just went live at fan.video
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:25.080]  And at infowars.com
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  In a new bombshell interview, Joe Rogan exposes the true impact of COVID lockdowns
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:34.080]  On society and how children are being trained to accept the new form of social engineering
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:36.080]  The interview is live now
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:39.080]  And the globalist hope you don't share it
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:41.080]  Matt Bracken takes over
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:43.080]  Matt Bracken
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:45.080]  Thanks, Alex
[3:09:45.080 --> 3:09:49.080]  People, if you're not pissed off right now
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:51.080]  I don't know what to tell you
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:55.080]  You know, it's like the rhinos, they're always ready to fight the next battle
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:57.080]  They always want to roll over today
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:01.080]  Just, you know, come out and support us next time
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:04.080]  Half of these congressmen and senators
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:06.080]  They probably wouldn't have even been reelected
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:10.080]  Except they drafted on Donald J. Trump's coattails
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:14.080]  Lindsey Graham being a perfect example
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:19.080]  But now that there's an actual fight that requires all hands
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:21.080]  They're nowhere to be found
[3:10:21.080 --> 3:10:24.080]  Just a couple people like Linwood and Sidney Powell
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:29.080]  Of course, the Trump team with Rudy Giuliani
[3:10:29.080 --> 3:10:31.080]  DeGenova and his wife
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:36.080]  But where are these rhinos senators and congressmen hiding?
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:39.080]  They just want to keep the graft going
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:43.080]  You know, we saw two weeks before the election
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:49.080]  The Hunter Biden laptop story was completely buried by the mainstream media
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:54.080]  Along with the Tony Bobalinsky interviews where he had actually met with Joe Biden
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:58.080]  To talk about these billion dollar China deals
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:01.080]  That Joe Biden said he never talked to Hunter about
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:03.080]  They completely buried it
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:09.080]  Now they're completely burying the greatest election theft
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:11.080]  Probably in the history of the world
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:13.080]  You know, starting from Venezuela
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:15.080]  Going to places like the Philippines
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.080]  Now they're trying in prime time in America
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.080]  And they're basically spitting in our face
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:23.080]  Or worse
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:26.080]  And telling us not only is it raining
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:29.080]  But they expect us to salute and smile
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:31.080]  And say, thank you, sir
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:33.080]  May I have another?
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:35.080]  Well, I'll tell you what
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:39.080]  I think that we need to be just about done with this
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:43.080]  When we see the truck driver Jesse Morgan
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:45.080]  Brave guy didn't even vote
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:46.080]  A political
[3:11:46.080 --> 3:11:50.080]  He's hauling a truckload of ballots
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:55.080]  You know, probably a quarter of a million pre-filled out ballots
[3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:57.080]  From New York
[3:11:57.080 --> 3:12:00.080]  What the hell were they doing in Bethpage, New York?
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:06.080]  Take some according to his bill of lading to Harrisburg, PA
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:09.080]  And they won't even acknowledge it
[3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:12.080]  They won't give him a receipt or any kind of a ticket
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:13.080]  To show he was there
[3:12:13.080 --> 3:12:16.080]  They send him to a vacant lot in Lancaster
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:19.080]  And the next day the trailer's gone
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:21.080]  Where's the trailer?
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:23.080]  Another question
[3:12:23.080 --> 3:12:25.080]  Where's the FBI?
[3:12:25.080 --> 3:12:28.080]  Federal Bureau of Investigation
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:29.080]  Where's the trailer?
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:31.080]  Where's the FBI?
[3:12:31.080 --> 3:12:34.080]  Now today we're seeing, you know, the video
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:37.080]  These cheaters in Georgia
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:42.080]  Didn't realize there was a surveillance camera up in the corner
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:46.080]  Where they're shown bringing in a special table
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:50.080]  That's got special suitcases full of ballots underneath of it
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:53.080]  They clear the room out, get rid of the witnesses
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:57.080]  And then start running thousands of bogus ballots through it
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:00.080]  It's right there, folks
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:03.080]  You can watch it with your own eyes
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:05.080]  You've got the truck driver
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  Bringing ballots from New York to Pennsylvania
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:11.080]  Crossing state lines with the fraud ballots
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:13.080]  You've got the video in Georgia
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:15.080]  Watching them
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:20.080]  The rolling bins of ballots out
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.080]  While the room is cleared
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  It goes on and on from state to state
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:27.080]  What will it take?
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:31.080]  We are watching our freedom be killed
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:33.080]  If the Democrats get away with this
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:37.080]  It really won't matter the Senate election
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:39.080]  The runoff election in January 5th
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:41.080]  They're going to use the same Dominion
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  Frautomatic machines
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:46.080]  They're going to use the same machines
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:48.080]  But they're saying, don't worry, trust us
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:50.080]  We'll really check the machines this time
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:53.080]  Make sure no hanky-panky's going on
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:13:57.080]  That's the entire point of these electronic voting machines
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:00.080]  Is to allow fraud
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:03.080]  You know, they don't just add one-in-one integers
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  The numbers come out as fractional decimals
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:12.080]  Because they're literally assigning these quotients
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:15.080]  To the ballots so that a Trump ballot
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  Will count for one value
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:19.080]  And a Biden value will count for another
[3:14:19.080 --> 3:14:22.080]  So they've got it coming and going
[3:14:22.080 --> 3:14:25.080]  They've got the fraud built into the machines
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:27.080]  But because Trump was leading by so much
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:29.080]  On election night
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:33.080]  It was beyond the setup inside of the machines
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:37.080]  To automatically edge Biden into the lead
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:39.080]  Trump was still going to win
[3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  That's why they had to close the counting centers
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:44.080]  And that's one of the big tells
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:48.080]  In Atlanta, they made up this bogus story
[3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:51.080]  About a burst pipe, which did not exist
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:54.080]  Never happened, it was just a lie
[3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:58.080]  Made up to clear out the counting centers
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:01.080]  So they could bring in the bogus ballots
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  Because electronic automatics weren't enough
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:07.080]  They had to bring in the truckloads
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:10.080]  And folks, it's all in front of our own eyes
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  So what's also going on here
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:15.080]  At a higher level
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:18.080]  Is a battle of the narratives
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:21.080]  And this is a battle for our hearts
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:23.080]  And minds and souls
[3:15:23.080 --> 3:15:25.080]  I have relatives
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:29.080]  Who will only watch mainstream media news
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:34.080]  Who don't think one thing went wrong with this election
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:37.080]  They read left wing press
[3:15:37.080 --> 3:15:39.080]  They read Huffington Post
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:42.080]  They read the New York Times
[3:15:42.080 --> 3:15:45.080]  And they think everything is hunky dory
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:47.080]  They think what fraud
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  It's just some fever swamp dream of the Republicans
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:52.080]  Trump has gone crazy
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:55.080]  Imagine where we are as a country
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:15:58.080]  When the President of the United States
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:03.080]  Has a major 47-minute address
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:06.080]  Which is a bombshell to the country
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:09.080]  About fraud, about the election being stolen
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:12.080]  And the major networks don't cover it
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:16.080]  He has to put out a video like some vlogger
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:19.080]  The networks not only don't cover it
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:22.080]  They selectively edit it to deride it
[3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:25.080]  And make him sound like there's nothing there
[3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:28.080]  We are in a battle
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:30.080]  And this is really as much as anything else
[3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:33.080]  A war between the new media
[3:16:33.080 --> 3:16:35.080]  Including info wars
[3:16:35.080 --> 3:16:38.080]  Right side broadcasting has been doing great
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:43.080]  There's a lot of great new media venues
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:45.080]  To see this
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:47.080]  But if your relatives and friends
[3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:50.080]  Are still just watching CNN and MSNBC
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:52.080]  Reading The Washington Post
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:55.080]  They have no clue
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:16:59.080]  So it's our job to push this message out
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:01.080]  You can't just be a passive receiver
[3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:03.080]  Of this information
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:06.080]  You can't just say, well that's really disturbing
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:08.080]  A truck driver is talking about
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:10.080]  Driving hundreds of thousands of ballots
[3:17:10.080 --> 3:17:14.080]  This lady is talking about the identical ballots
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:16.080]  That are all marked by a machine
[3:17:16.080 --> 3:17:18.080]  Exactly the same on the wrong paper
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:20.080]  With no folds
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:22.080]  I hope somebody does something about it
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:25.080]  No, nobody's going to do anything about it
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:29.080]  Because it does not fit the elite narrative
[3:17:29.080 --> 3:17:31.080]  The person that has to do something about it
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:33.080]  Is you and me
[3:17:33.080 --> 3:18:01.080]  And we'll continue this on the other side
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:06.080]  We have a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.080]  Into one of total mass high tech slavery
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:11.080]  That's why the globalists tell us America
[3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:13.080]  Was founded on slavery when it wasn't
[3:18:13.080 --> 3:18:14.080]  They point out one of our evils
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:16.080]  So they can invert the fact that they are
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:18.080]  Truly the slave masters
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:20.080]  A global permanent lockdown is here
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:22.080]  It is already causing millions and millions
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:23.080]  To starve to death
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:25.080]  When they're done, billions will starve to death
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:27.080]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense
[3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:29.080]  In England, and a top general have come out and said
[3:18:29.080 --> 3:18:31.080]  The covered lockdown is going to trigger
[3:18:31.080 --> 3:18:33.080]  A giant new world war
[3:18:33.080 --> 3:18:34.080]  That's the facts
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:36.080]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:40.080]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:43.080]  Criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese
[3:18:43.080 --> 3:18:44.080]  And the United Nations
[3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:47.080]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.080]  To be subservient
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:51.080]  The worst Australian models of complete lockdowns
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:53.080]  You can't even leave your house
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:55.080]  For months and months are being announced
[3:18:55.080 --> 3:18:57.080]  And in Germany, the police are using
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:18:59.080]  Giant armored tanks with water cannons
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:01.080]  To blast men, women and children
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:03.080]  That protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:05.080]  Has put them under her control
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:07.080]  That's right, she's been rigging elections
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:08.080]  For years and years
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:10.080]  And the same thing is coming here
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:12.080]  To the United States, this is world government
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:14.080]  In Philadelphia, they've announced
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:16.080]  Four people or more seen together
[3:19:16.080 --> 3:19:17.080]  Will be arrested
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:19.080]  They're announcing that Christmas is cancelled
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:21.080]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:23.080]  To bankrupt you
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:25.080]  To take rid of all your due process
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:27.080]  And absolutely transform the world
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:29.080]  Into a prison planet
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:31.080]  How long have we warned you about this?
[3:19:31.080 --> 3:19:33.080]  But you can fight back
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:35.080]  America is the last bastion
[3:19:35.080 --> 3:19:37.080]  Stop submitting
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:39.080]  It really is simple
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:41.080]  The left are into being deviant
[3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:43.080]  And I don't mean sexually deviant
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:45.080]  That goes to territory
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:47.080]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:19:49.080]  Deviant against their own species
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:51.080]  Deviant against the order of nature
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:53.080]  Even though that deviance is destructive
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:55.080]  And poisonous, they still do it
[3:19:55.080 --> 3:19:57.080]  Because they want to play God
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:59.080]  Everything they touch, they destroy
[3:19:59.080 --> 3:20:01.080]  Their sacrament is aborting babies
[3:20:01.080 --> 3:20:03.080]  And then using their body parts
[3:20:03.080 --> 3:20:05.080]  Their religion is
[3:20:05.080 --> 3:20:07.080]  Not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them
[3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:09.080]  Their whole system is designed
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:11.080]  For the UN to keep their world countries
[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:13.080]  In serious poverty and poor
[3:20:13.080 --> 3:20:15.080]  Ballooning populations and then watching
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:17.080]  All that new fruit down the vine
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:19.080]  To continually reproduce
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:21.080]  The same nightmares over and over
[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:22.080]  And over again
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:24.080]  They truly are the children of Satan
[3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:25.080]  The devil
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:26.080]  And if you look at the slaves that serve the
[3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  Biden and Kamala Harris
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:29.080]  It really is manifested
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:31.080]  That being a slave of Satan is not profitable
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:33.080]  Sin is not profitable
[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:34.080]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:56.080]  And this is The Info War
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:20:58.080]  Live from Austin, Texas
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:01.080]  Broadcasting worldwide
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:04.080]  It's Alex Jones and Mel
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:07.080]  Your host, Matt Bracken
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:12.080]  Alright, you know, if you're thinking about
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:14.080]  A Christmas gift, you can always
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:16.080]  Buy some good books like mine
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:17.080]  That you just saw there
[3:21:17.080 --> 3:21:19.080]  And if you get them imprinted
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:21.080]  They can't delete them later on
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:23.080]  Like they can with e-books
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:25.080]  And audio books
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:27.080]  Zap, one day they'll be gone
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:29.080]  If Biden actually manages to
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:31.080]  Sneak his way into the White House
[3:21:31.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  To steal his way into the White House
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:36.080]  You know we're going to see some
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:40.080]  Some repression like we've never seen before
[3:21:40.080 --> 3:21:42.080]  If we can't stop the fraud
[3:21:42.080 --> 3:21:44.080]  At the presidential election
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:46.080]  Don't for a minute think we're going to stop it
[3:21:46.080 --> 3:21:49.080]  With these two senators in the runoff
[3:21:49.080 --> 3:21:52.080]  When they have 50 senators
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:55.080]  Plus Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker
[3:21:55.080 --> 3:21:57.080]  It's game over, folks
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:21:59.080]  I mean it's game over
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:01.080]  Puerto Rico and DC become states
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:03.080]  They pack the Supreme Court
[3:22:03.080 --> 3:22:05.080]  And it's off to the races
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:07.080]  So just as an aside
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:09.080]  When there's the current flap
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:11.080]  It's painful to watch
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:13.080]  Between some of the people
[3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:15.080]  At Breitbart for example
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:17.080]  And some others on the right
[3:22:17.080 --> 3:22:19.080]  That are basically calling
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:21.080]  Linwood and Sidney Powell
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:23.080]  Traders for not just clicking
[3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:25.080]  Their heels and saying all good Republicans
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:28.080]  Must vote for the two Rhinos
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:31.080]  In Georgia do or die
[3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:33.080]  And then there are other people saying
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:35.080]  What's the point of voting if they're just going to
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  You know fraud it again
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:39.080]  They're just going to set the fraud
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:41.080]  Of Maddox to give the votes to the Democrats
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:43.080]  And if that's not enough
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:45.080]  They'll bring in the pallets of ballots
[3:22:45.080 --> 3:22:47.080]  Hopefully this time
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:49.080]  People will be watching a little bit more closely
[3:22:49.080 --> 3:22:51.080]  But who knows
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:53.080]  I would say that in my opinion
[3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  Sidney Powell and Linwood are just trying
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:57.080]  To use the leverage that they've got
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:22:59.080]  They're not
[3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:01.080]  Pushovers
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:03.080]  They don't have round heels
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:05.080]  They are dug in patriots
[3:23:05.080 --> 3:23:07.080]  And the only
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:09.080]  Pressure that they can use right now
[3:23:09.080 --> 3:23:11.080]  In these Rhinos
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:13.080]  To try to get them to support
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:15.080]  Trump in the current battle
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:17.080]  The ongoing presidential
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:19.080]  Election coup battle
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:21.080]  Is to hint
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:23.080]  Or even more than hint
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:25.080]  That if these Rhinos don't get on board
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:27.080]  Defending Trump
[3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:29.080]  Then why should conservative patriotic
[3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:31.080]  Republicans get on board
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:33.080]  Supporting these two Rhinos
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:35.080]  If they want to
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:37.080]  Just work along with Biden
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:39.080]  You know and
[3:23:39.080 --> 3:23:41.080]  Play the Washington generals
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:43.080]  The sucker-patsy team
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:45.080]  To the Democrat Harlem Globetrotters
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  You know just placeholders
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:49.080]  Will be the B team
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:51.080]  The practice team
[3:23:51.080 --> 3:23:53.080]  We'll still get to go to the parties
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:55.080]  We'll still get the special perks
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:23:57.080]  The great pension
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:23:59.080]  The bribes will be coming to our brothers and sons
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:01.080]  But we really don't want to fight back
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:03.080]  We just want to go along
[3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:05.080]  You know that the Democrats
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:07.080]  Are going to open the floodgates, for example
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:09.080]  On the illegal alien invasion
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:11.080]  At least
[3:24:11.080 --> 3:24:13.080]  They've been using 11 million
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:15.080]  Illegals in the country for years
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:17.080]  It's probably that much
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:19.080]  In California
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:21.080]  One of the first things that's going to happen
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:23.080]  Is Biden's going to amnesty
[3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:25.080]  Everybody in this country
[3:24:25.080 --> 3:24:27.080]  Legal or illegal, no matter what
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:29.080]  And then there will never be
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:31.080]  Another election won by Republicans
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:33.080]  So the Rhinos
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:35.080]  Have better get behind Trump
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:37.080]  This is an existential battle
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:39.080]  It's not just let Trump
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:41.080]  Go away and
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:43.080]  We'll work hard on the Republicans
[3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:45.080]  In Georgia and hopefully keep a majority
[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:47.080]  In the Senate
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:49.080]  And then we'll just work with Biden
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:51.080]  Go for the amnesty
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:53.080]  Bring in millions more dreamers
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:55.080]  And give them amnesty
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:57.080]  Work on a little bit
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:24:59.080]  Of common sense gun control
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:01.080]  No, this is the battle
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:03.080]  This is the ditch we fight in
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:05.080]  This is the hill we fight on
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:07.080]  This election is being stolen
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:09.080]  You can't say
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:11.080]  We're going to surrender on the presidential election
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:13.080]  But then expect us to come out
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:15.080]  And just fight real hard
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:17.080]  For those Republicans in Georgia
[3:25:17.080 --> 3:25:19.080]  Doesn't work that way
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:21.080]  It's the two sides of the same coin
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:23.080]  You want us to come out and fight
[3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:25.080]  For the Republican Senate candidates
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:27.080]  Then you better get out and fight
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:29.080]  For Trump, like he's fighting for us
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:31.080]  And that is just a fact
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:33.080]  Now
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:35.080]  I've been watching the Georgia hearings
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.080]  Today and it's been
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:39.080]  Some pretty spicy stuff
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:41.080]  Not only the
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:43.080]  The tables full of
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:45.080]  Hidden ballots rolled out
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:47.080]  For the fake ballots
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:49.080]  When the room is closed
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:51.080]  But the lady that said
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:53.080]  She saw the ballots that were on the wrong
[3:25:53.080 --> 3:25:55.080]  Paper had no folds
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:57.080]  And all of the Biden
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:25:59.080]  Circles were filled out
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:01.080]  She was trying to describe
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:03.080]  They were printed, she said they had
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:05.080]  A identical little crescent
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:07.080]  Like a perfect circle
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:09.080]  Inside the voting circle
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:11.080]  A perfect black dot
[3:26:11.080 --> 3:26:13.080]  With an identical crescent
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:15.080]  Meaning they were all printed
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:17.080]  They were just rammed through the printer
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:19.080]  And we've, you know, just copies
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:21.080]  And we've seen this in state after state
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:23.080]  And if we just take this
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:25.080]  If we just say
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:27.080]  Well, what the heck
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:29.080]  They steal elections, so what
[3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:31.080]  Then just folks, just get ready
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  To beat Marisuela
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.080]  Just get ready for it
[3:26:35.080 --> 3:26:37.080]  That's what's coming next
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:39.080]  It's your own eyes
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  You're watching this with your own eyes
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:43.080]  So you say, all right, well, Matt
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:45.080]  You know, if it's not a scandal
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:47.080]  If the media won't report it, what can I do?
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:49.080]  Well, not only do we push all of these
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:51.080]  Videos out, you know, just
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:53.080]  Continue, I don't care if you've got
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:55.080]  You know, 100,000 followers
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:57.080]  On Twitter or 10
[3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:59.080]  If you completely
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:01.080]  Just say, oh, I'm just going to watch
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:03.080]  I just want to, I'll see the video
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:05.080]  But I don't want to share it, I might get
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:07.080]  The list, folks, your name's already
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:09.080]  On the list, your name's
[3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:11.080]  Been on the list since you got on social media
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:13.080]  They say if you
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:15.080]  Like five things on Facebook, you know
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:17.080]  The deal, if you like
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:19.080]  20 things on Facebook, Facebook knows
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:21.080]  You better than your wife, so don't worry
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:23.080]  About being on any lists, because
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:25.080]  When the time comes for the gulag
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:27.080]  Roundups, they're going to know
[3:27:27.080 --> 3:27:29.080]  Who to get, it's not going to be
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:31.080]  Based on, did you share some
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:33.080]  Video, it's going to be based
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:35.080]  On the ammo you've bought
[3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:37.080]  And the websites you go to
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:39.080]  So you're already on the list
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:41.080]  So our job is to fight against
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:43.080]  This media blockade
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:45.080]  And push these stories out
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  And physically, this Saturday
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:49.080]  Trump is coming to Georgia, I'm not sure
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:51.080]  Where he's going to be yet
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:53.080]  But this needs to be the Trump
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:55.080]  Rally of all Trump rallies
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:57.080]  This needs to be so big
[3:27:57.080 --> 3:27:59.080]  That the mainstream media
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:01.080]  Has to fear us
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  And the next level of this
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:05.080]  They started talking about this
[3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:07.080]  In the Georgia hearings, Giuliani did
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:09.080]  He was addressing the Georgia
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  Legislature saying you
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:13.080]  Have the power, you know
[3:28:13.080 --> 3:28:15.080]  It's not up to the supreme court
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:17.080]  In the long run, and it's certainly
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:19.080]  Not up to the governor
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:21.080]  Camp or any of these
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:23.080]  State governors or secretaries
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:25.080]  Of state, it's up to the state
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:27.080]  Legislatures, but what's the problem
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:29.080]  There, they're afraid
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:31.080]  They're known, their houses
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:33.080]  They're doxxed
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:35.080]  They don't want Antifa coming
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:37.080]  To their house with Molotov cocktails
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:39.080]  They're scared
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:41.080]  They're going to just probably
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:43.080]  Take the easy way out and certify
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:45.080]  These elections, so what Giuliani
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:47.080]  Has been saying is
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:49.080]  If you certify a false
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:51.080]  Election, you know, morally
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:53.080]  That is going to be on your
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:55.080]  Soul, and that's going to be on
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:57.080]  Your record for elections
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:28:59.080]  But I think that more than anything
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:01.080]  These state legislators are
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:03.080]  Terrified, they are
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:05.080]  Afraid of Antifa and BLM
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:07.080]  They are afraid of the repercussions
[3:29:07.080 --> 3:29:09.080]  So we need to support them
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:11.080]  We need to contact them
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:13.080]  There's an old saying, one visit
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:15.080]  To Congress is worth
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:17.080]  Ten phone calls is worth
[3:29:17.080 --> 3:29:19.080]  A hundred emails
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:21.080]  So if you can go to Congress
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:23.080]  You can actually get in there
[3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:25.080]  And even if you don't get to see the congressman
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:27.080]  They record that you tried to
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:29.080]  And like I said
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:31.080]  One visit is
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:33.080]  Ten phone calls is a hundred emails
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:35.080]  If you can get
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:37.080]  Not only to Washington, but to
[3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:39.080]  Your state legislator's office
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:41.080]  Your local office
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:43.080]  Even if he's not in town
[3:29:43.080 --> 3:29:45.080]  They take down, you know
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:47.080]  They've got secretaries taking all that information down
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:49.080]  And it has power
[3:29:49.080 --> 3:29:51.080]  Let them know that you expect them
[3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:53.080]  To, you know, to buck up
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:55.080]  To show some courage
[3:29:55.080 --> 3:29:57.080]  It really is up to them now
[3:29:57.080 --> 3:29:59.080]  To save this republic
[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:01.080]  We can support Trump
[3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:03.080]  We can share all of these stories
[3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:05.080]  But in the end
[3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:07.080]  It's these state legislatures
[3:30:07.080 --> 3:30:09.080]  And these swing states that are going to
[3:30:09.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  You know, either fold
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:13.080]  Or stand tall
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:15.080]  So getting to those guys
[3:30:15.080 --> 3:30:17.080]  And telling them, we expect them
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:19.080]  To do their duty and not
[3:30:19.080 --> 3:30:21.080]  To ratify a
[3:30:21.080 --> 3:30:23.080]  Lord Venezuela-style
[3:30:23.080 --> 3:30:25.080]  Election
[3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:27.080]  That's what we've got to do
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:29.080]  If time is running out
[3:30:29.080 --> 3:30:31.080]  But forget about the Georgia Senate runoff
[3:30:31.080 --> 3:30:33.080]  If we can't, you know, save the presidential election
[3:30:33.080 --> 3:30:35.080]  Nothing else is going to be
[3:30:35.080 --> 3:30:37.080]  It's going to matter
[3:30:37.080 --> 3:30:39.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:41.080]  That means a globalist imposed
[3:30:41.080 --> 3:30:43.080]  Worldwide depression to break us
[3:30:43.080 --> 3:30:45.080]  And bring us under their control
[3:30:45.080 --> 3:30:47.080]  That's your state-admitted plan
[3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:49.080]  Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab
[3:30:49.080 --> 3:30:51.080]  They admit it's clowered in heaven
[3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:53.080]  Implode the economy to make us go under their control
[3:30:53.080 --> 3:30:55.080]  But if we expose that they're the ones
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:30:57.080]  Doing it, they go to prison
[3:30:57.080 --> 3:30:59.080]  Instead of getting total power and total control
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:01.080]  And there are major uprisings happening
[3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:03.080]  Across the world
[3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:05.080]  During the U.S. thousands of sheriffs are saying
[3:31:05.080 --> 3:31:07.080]  Hell no to the lockdowns
[3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:09.080]  People are finally starting to fight back
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:11.080]  But regardless, you need to get prepared
[3:31:11.080 --> 3:31:13.080]  We have high-quality, twerble food
[3:31:13.080 --> 3:31:15.080]  Last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices
[3:31:15.080 --> 3:31:17.080]  Great containers, ready to ship
[3:31:17.080 --> 3:31:19.080]  With this out in a few months
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:21.080]  I think there'll be long lines again to get storeable food
[3:31:21.080 --> 3:31:23.080]  After the lockdown's been going for a few months
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:25.080]  So get your orders in today
[3:31:25.080 --> 3:31:27.080]  At preparewithalix.com
[3:31:27.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  You get an additional 10% off
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:31.080]  And they're ready to ship
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:33.080]  The sale ends next Wednesday
[3:31:33.080 --> 3:31:35.080]  Or I guess that's December 2nd
[3:31:35.080 --> 3:31:37.080]  So get your orders in now
[3:31:37.080 --> 3:31:47.080]  Globalists and their minions want to play God
[3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:49.080]  Why do they hate humanity so much?
[3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:51.080]  Why do they love death?
[3:31:51.080 --> 3:31:53.080]  Because they hate themselves
[3:31:53.080 --> 3:31:55.080]  They project their own
[3:31:55.080 --> 3:31:57.080]  Discussed with their soul
[3:31:57.080 --> 3:31:59.080]  On to us
[3:31:59.080 --> 3:32:01.080]  And once you understand that basic psychological point
[3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:03.080]  Every other answer is completely clear
[3:32:03.080 --> 3:32:05.080]  That's why they hate info wars
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:07.080]  We believe in humanity
[3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:09.080]  We think you're beautiful
[3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:11.080]  We think you're amazing
[3:32:11.080 --> 3:32:13.080]  Info wars knows you're fallen
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:15.080]  But that you have God's potential
[3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.080]  That God gave you
[3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:19.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle
[3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:21.080]  Is now here, it's now upon us
[3:32:21.080 --> 3:32:23.080]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word
[3:32:23.080 --> 3:32:25.080]  About info wars now more than ever
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:27.080]  When the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth
[3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:29.080]  We know you're going to override these globalists
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:31.080]  We know you're going to defeat them
[3:32:31.080 --> 3:32:33.080]  I just want to salute you all for your action
[3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:35.080]  Thank you
[3:33:03.080 --> 3:33:05.080]  This is their takeover
[3:33:05.080 --> 3:33:07.080]  Imagine on America's Death Certificate
[3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:09.080]  Killed by the fear of the common cold
[3:33:09.080 --> 3:33:11.080]  And they're not even worried about COVID-19
[3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:13.080]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said
[3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:15.080]  Think about how insane that is
[3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:17.080]  Oh and big techs got to track you
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:19.080]  They've got to trace you
[3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:21.080]  You've got to control you
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:23.080]  You've got to have absolutely your house
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:25.080]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you
[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:27.080]  Because, my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent
[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:29.080]  You had some killing you
[3:33:29.080 --> 3:33:31.080]  Give your debilitated death cancer
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:33.080]  By the fear of the common cold
[3:33:33.080 --> 3:34:02.080]  Yeah, that's fear monitoring, that's mind control
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:05.080]  Where everything's free
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:07.080]  Because when you're a prisoner
[3:34:07.080 --> 3:34:09.080]  Well, everything's free, but you're also a slave
[3:34:09.080 --> 3:34:11.080]  Scotland is going to have universal
[3:34:11.080 --> 3:34:13.080]  Guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level
[3:34:13.080 --> 3:34:15.080]  But of course you've got to take those vaccines
[3:34:15.080 --> 3:34:17.080]  You can't have any kids
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:19.080]  Oh, don't worry though, all of the tampons
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:21.080]  And stuff like that's free too as well
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:23.080]  I'm not kidding
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:25.080]  So they'll give you some free paper
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:27.080]  They'll give you enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:29.080]  But they own you, they control you
[3:34:29.080 --> 3:34:31.080]  That's the great reset
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:33.080]  That's why it's got to be resisted
[3:34:33.080 --> 3:34:35.080]  To total takeover and we're fighting it
[3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:37.080]  At InfoWars.com
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:43.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:45.080]  You
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:15.080]  In this last segment
[3:35:15.080 --> 3:35:17.080]  I'm going to change gears a little bit
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:21.080]  And talk about the vaccine
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:23.080]  The COVID vaccine
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:25.080]  And maybe have a few insights
[3:35:25.080 --> 3:35:29.080]  You haven't heard about or not in this context
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:31.080]  Alex is completely right obviously
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:33.080]  This is a control mechanism
[3:35:33.080 --> 3:35:35.080]  You know, Klaus Schwab
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:37.080]  World Economic Forum
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:39.080]  Big Buddy of George Soros
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:41.080]  They all seem to be connected to Soros somehow
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:45.080]  Even the Dominion Smartmatic guys like
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:47.080]  Lord Mark Malik Brown
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:49.080]  Connected to Soros for decades
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:53.080]  But in terms of this vaccine
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:55.080]  It's a control mechanism
[3:35:55.080 --> 3:35:57.080]  In Britain they're already talking about
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:35:59.080]  A health passport
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:01.080]  You won't be able to travel
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:03.080]  Unless you can prove you've had the vaccine
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:05.080]  Australia is talking about
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:09.080]  Not letting you on their national airline, Qantas
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:11.080]  Unless you've had the vaccine
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:15.080]  Well this is going to start stratifying society
[3:36:15.080 --> 3:36:17.080]  Into those that have taken it
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:19.080]  And those that haven't taken it
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:21.080]  If you're a businessman who depends on travel
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:23.080]  Are you just going to say, honey
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:25.080]  I guess I got to quit
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:27.080]  I can't fly
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:29.080]  I'm not taking the vaccine
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:31.080]  We're going to have to move out of our house
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:33.080]  Into a trailer down by the river
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:35.080]  Because I ain't taking that vaccine
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:37.080]  Or your competition is just going to say
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:39.080]  What the hell, you know
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:41.080]  I'm taking the vaccine
[3:36:41.080 --> 3:36:43.080]  This much we've already thought about this
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:45.080]  In pretty good depth
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:49.080]  But I want to throw in a little bit of historical context
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:53.080]  I was born in the end of the 50s
[3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:55.080]  And when I was a child traveling around
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:59.080]  I remember on vacations and here and there
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:03.080]  Seeing some children that had been born with
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:06.080]  What were very sad and tragic birth defects
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:08.080]  Where their arms might have ended
[3:37:08.080 --> 3:37:10.080]  Right at their elbows
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:12.080]  Or their faces were deformed
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:14.080]  Or instead of hands they had like
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:18.080]  Flippers like a little white dolphin flipper
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:20.080]  Instead of fingers
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:24.080]  This was from a FDA approved, scientifically tested
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:26.080]  Completely safe, good to go
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:30.080]  Morning sickness drug called phalidomide
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:32.080]  That mothers took
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:35.080]  And they didn't know until
[3:37:35.080 --> 3:37:37.080]  Children were being born
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:41.080]  What the consequences were going to be
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:43.080]  There was another drug in the 50s
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:45.080]  Called DES
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:49.080]  Diethylstilbestrol
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:51.080]  DES
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:53.080]  Mothers took this drug
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:37:56.080]  And their daughters wound up sterile
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:37:58.080]  Couldn't have children
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:02.080]  They didn't know this for another 15 years
[3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:05.080]  In the early 60s they started wondering
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:09.080]  About these two drugs, phalidomide and DES
[3:38:09.080 --> 3:38:11.080]  But the damage was done
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:14.080]  A generation of children were ravaged
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:19.080]  Either left deformed or unable to have children
[3:38:19.080 --> 3:38:24.080]  How can they tell with a COVID vaccine
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:26.080]  An RNA vaccine
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:28.080]  Something unheard of
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:30.080]  A novel type of a vaccine
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:32.080]  That's into your DNA
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:35.080]  How can they promise us
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:37.080]  I'm not talking about side effects
[3:38:37.080 --> 3:38:39.080]  Like a flu vaccine
[3:38:39.080 --> 3:38:41.080]  I might as well have had the flu
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:43.080]  Because the flu vaccine gave me a
[3:38:43.080 --> 3:38:44.080]  I was sick with the flu vaccine
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:46.080]  I'm not talking about that
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:49.080]  I'm talking about what are we going to find out
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:52.080]  In 5 years or 15 years
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:58.080]  When the parents that take the vaccine
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:02.080]  Start having who knows what side effects
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:08.080]  Birth effects, sterilization, intelligence effects
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:11.080]  How are we going to know
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:14.080]  Who can promise us
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.080]  In a 10 month rushed vaccine development
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:21.080]  What the consequences are going to be
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:23.080]  How can they possibly have done tests
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:26.080]  On pregnant animals or mothers
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:30.080]  That human babies are going to be fine
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:33.080]  I've already read that they didn't do much
[3:39:33.080 --> 3:39:36.080]  Animal testing with this vaccine
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:39.080]  Because such bad inflammations
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:41.080]  The animals couldn't get through it
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:43.080]  But for some reason it was okay with humans
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:45.080]  But how do they know what's going to happen
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:47.080]  With human babies
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:49.080]  You take the vaccine
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:51.080]  Your DNA is altered
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:52.080]  You have babies
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:54.080]  What's going to happen
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:56.080]  And the same experts
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:39:59.080]  The same elite experts that told us
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:05.080]  We just had the most secure election in our history
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:08.080]  Are the same people that are telling us
[3:40:08.080 --> 3:40:13.080]  That this vaccine is going to be perfectly safe
[3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:16.080]  And so you've got 3 or 4 countries
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:18.080]  Or different companies
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:20.080]  Including I think Russian vaccines
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:22.080]  Supposed Russian vaccine
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:25.080]  These things have been rushed through
[3:40:25.080 --> 3:40:27.080]  And you cannot tell me
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:30.080]  That the effects, the long term effects
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:32.080]  And I'm not even talking necessarily
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:34.080]  About the person that gets it
[3:40:34.080 --> 3:40:36.080]  If you're over 60
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:39.080]  And you're well past your child bearing years
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:41.080]  That's one situation
[3:40:41.080 --> 3:40:43.080]  That's one situation
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:46.080]  But if you're talking about giving this vaccine
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:49.080]  To young adults in their child bearing years
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:52.080]  And they're saying that they're going to start with older people
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:54.080]  And work their way down
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:57.080]  You know, 20 million vaccines by the end of the year
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:40:58.080]  Supposedly
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:41:01.080]  Starting with the older people in old folks' homes
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:03.080]  And maybe that'll be good
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:05.080]  If they want it, they're not going to have children
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  You start giving this to fertile women in their 20s
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:12.080]  And you are playing with nitroglycerin
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  Just ask the people that took DES and thalidomide
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:19.080]  In the 50s what happened to their children
[3:41:19.080 --> 3:41:21.080]  And another factor is
[3:41:21.080 --> 3:41:24.080]  All of these vaccine companies
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:26.080]  In order to rush this thing through
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:28.080]  They're essentially
[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:31.080]  Being given immunity from prosecution
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:33.080]  It's like, well, we tried our best
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:36.080]  You know, if your children wind up sterile
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:39.080]  Or retarded or with flipper hands
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:41.080]  Don't sue us
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:44.080]  Because we were just doing what we were told to do
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:46.080]  We did our best
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:47.080]  I'm sorry
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:50.080]  This vaccine is going to have to be one of those
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:52.080]  Social watersheds
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:54.080]  Like banning guns
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:57.080]  This has to be a hill to fight on
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:00.080]  If people want to take it, that's fine
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.080]  But if they say, oh, the government's not forcing you to take the vaccine
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:05.080]  It's your employer
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:07.080]  It's the airline
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:11.080]  You know, you can't have your job and fly
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:14.080]  Unless you take the vaccine, that's got to be out
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.080]  That's got to be off the table
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:20.080]  If people are forced to take this vaccine
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:22.080]  Whether it's for economic reasons
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:26.080]  Or as a condition of getting a loan from the government
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:29.080]  Or anything else, it's coercion
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:31.080]  And what's going to happen when we find out
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:33.080]  In five or ten years
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:36.080]  That the children of these people that have taken the vaccine
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:39.080]  Are having terrible consequences
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:41.080]  What's the comeback going to be then?
[3:42:41.080 --> 3:42:44.080]  Are we going to go back in time and punish these people
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:47.080]  That rushed this thing through for a disease
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:51.080]  That is 99.99 survivable?
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:54.080]  I mean, this is ridiculous
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:57.080]  So obviously a control mechanism
[3:42:57.080 --> 3:43:01.080]  And it's the same insane arsonists
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:04.080]  That have been in charge of this election fraud
[3:43:04.080 --> 3:43:07.080]  Are the same insane arsonists
[3:43:07.080 --> 3:43:10.080]  That look at us sometimes with MD
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:13.080]  After their name saying, don't worry
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:16.080]  It's going to be safe, take the vaccine
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:19.080]  I feel like we are sheep
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:22.080]  Being led into a slaughterhouse
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:25.080]  By lying Judas goats
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:27.080]  You know how that goes
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:30.080]  You can't just herd sheep into the slaughterhouse
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:35.080]  They actually train and breed goats
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:38.080]  To befriend the sheep, mingle with the sheep
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:41.080]  And then they can lead the goat into the slaughterhouse
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:43.080]  And the sheep will follow it
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:46.080]  That's us, we are the sheep
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:48.080]  We're being asked to accept
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:52.080]  The most massive election fraud in our country
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:55.080]  To not believe our own lying eyes
[3:43:55.080 --> 3:43:58.080]  Trucks full of ballots missing
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:02.080]  Trucks full of ballots arriving in the middle of the night
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:05.080]  Hundreds of thousands of ballots
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:08.080]  At 3, 4, 5 in the morning in these states
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:11.080]  Suddenly just spiking their way into the count
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:15.080]  We go to bed, Trump is ahead by hundreds of thousands
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:17.080]  We wake up, he's behind
[3:44:17.080 --> 3:44:20.080]  And we're just expected to take it
[3:44:20.080 --> 3:44:22.080]  And the same people are now saying
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:25.080]  Don't worry, this vaccine is going to be safe
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:28.080]  An RNA vaccine, it's going to be safe
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:32.080]  Well, is it the A, B or C vaccine that I'm going to be given
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:35.080]  Who knows, don't question, don't ask
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:37.080]  Just line up and get your shot
[3:44:37.080 --> 3:44:39.080]  And then they're going to say in six months
[3:44:39.080 --> 3:44:42.080]  Well, it turns out you need a booster
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:44.080]  Then it's going to be, you need an annual
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:47.080]  And if you don't have it, you can't get on the airplane
[3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:50.080]  If you don't have it, you can't go to the bank
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:52.080]  You can't be around anybody
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:56.080]  Folks, we're really edging into Mark of the Beast territory here
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:59.080]  And if we don't put a stop to this
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:02.080]  It's like the Arbite-mocked fry
[3:45:02.080 --> 3:45:06.080]  The next gates you see are going to be the slaughterhouse
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:11.080]  And I, for one, do not care to follow a Judas Goat into a slaughterhouse
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:13.080]  I won't give up my guns
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:17.080]  And nobody is going to force me to take a vaccine
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:19.080]  You're not mad now
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:26.080]  I don't know what it'll take
