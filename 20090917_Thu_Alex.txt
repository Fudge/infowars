[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:42.880]  Texas Alex Jones well I'll tell you Charlie Sheen and I are really frustrated
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.720]  you have this Kanye West jumping up on stage at some mindless awards show
[00:48.720 --> 00:55.040]  taking over the microphone for 20 seconds and President Obama has weighed
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.000]  in the whole country is twittering about now Jimmy Carter who says if you
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.280]  criticize the president in any way you're a racist he's saying it's he's
[01:04.280 --> 01:11.280]  very concerned about Kanye West they know the diet of mindless fluff that the
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.840]  people are hungry for because we've been raised with it forced fed it to the
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.480]  point of loving it and that is why we are so enslaved the average American
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.200]  doesn't know the three branches of government but they know who Kanye West
[01:25.200 --> 01:33.000]  is and so Charlie Sheen puts out 20 hard bullet points to the president and
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.880]  says that the victims families of 9-11 would like to meet with him and discuss
[01:38.880 --> 01:43.120]  the fact that six of the 10 9-11 Commission members say that it is a
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.800]  criminal cover-up taking place concerning 9-11 and that it needs to be
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.360]  reinvestigated and nothing is said nothing is done I mean it's all over
[01:52.360 --> 02:02.800]  TV that on Monday night Charlie went to dinner with Buzz Aldrin it was over at
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.200]  Charlie's house a few weeks ago and we're talking about Buzz Aldrin's
[02:06.200 --> 02:13.720]  discussions of the monolith on the moon of Mars and Charlie said hey my stunt
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.880]  man my stunt double knows him ought to call him and sure enough they went and
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.320]  had a meeting and had dinner but that is interesting an astronaut top astronaut
[02:24.320 --> 02:30.120]  top Hollywood actor meeting and having dinner but still is it important as
[02:30.120 --> 02:37.240]  Charlie Sheen when you meet with the president no there is a media blackout
[02:37.240 --> 02:43.320]  surrounding Charlie Sheen they covered it some last week Fox News demonized him
[02:43.320 --> 02:49.760]  and then now he has challenged the president's White House press secretary
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.280]  to make a public statement about it he has challenged John McCain's daughter
[02:54.280 --> 03:00.760]  who's been demonizing Charlie to debate him live on TV he's challenged Limbaugh
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.240]  Hannity O'Reilly and you know these guys are aware of the challenge they've been
[03:05.240 --> 03:08.360]  called they've been emailed our listeners have been calling him they've
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.760]  filled up McCain's daughter's blog with comments challenging her and nothing has
[03:14.760 --> 03:21.480]  been done because they are scared they are scared they cannot debate Charlie
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.880]  Sheen all they can do is sit back and falsely claim that they represent the
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.200]  families and the families don't like what Charlie's doing with not one piece
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.400]  of evidence or one family member of a victim that they can trot out they are
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.720]  cowards they want 9-11 to go away they just want to use it to set up a police
[03:42.720 --> 03:50.480]  state in the United States they want to use it to destroy the Republic and
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.760]  bring in their tyranny in a bipartisan fashion and use it to attack other
[03:54.760 --> 04:00.200]  sovereign countries they do not want it discussed openly and they certainly
[04:00.200 --> 04:05.920]  don't want the fact that six of the 10 Commission members have gone public
[04:05.920 --> 04:10.280]  saying that the investigation was a cover-up a fraud a lie these are quotes
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.520]  that there should be a criminal investigation all they can do is name
[04:14.520 --> 04:20.440]  call but they will not present the facts they will not print Charlie Sheen's 20
[04:20.440 --> 04:23.720]  bullet points that they will not talk about it they will not discuss it now
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.040]  it was a major victory before they had to clamp down this week hundreds of
[04:28.040 --> 04:32.600]  papers linked to the 20 points that some papers like a telegraph published it in
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.920]  the print edition we've got some major magazines in the US have called us
[04:36.920 --> 04:41.520]  wanting to reprint it so it did put 9-11 truth back on the front burner but
[04:41.520 --> 04:48.040]  now the establishment kind of attacked it first realized that it was blowing up
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.600]  in their face and so they backed off really quick we'll tell you about the

[08:15.560 --> 08:23.640]  gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.480]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome i'll tell you about the guest that we
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.680]  have coming up a little bit later in the shower three very informative guest
[08:49.680 --> 09:00.200]  coming up today we're also going to have wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231
[09:00.200 --> 09:09.640]  yesterday i saw a youtube video by a purported off-duty soldier that dovetails
[09:09.640 --> 09:15.200]  with all of the data that i have from open source information or open source
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.920]  intelligence since in the video has gone viral we have a article a blurb on it at
[09:22.920 --> 09:28.480]  prisonplanet.com right now soldier claims authorities training to intern
[09:28.480 --> 09:36.800]  americans who refuse swine flu shot now that is in the executive order in fact
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.400]  we should have a more detailed story about this regardless of whether this
[09:41.400 --> 09:45.240]  is accurate or not and watching the body language listening to the information
[09:45.240 --> 09:49.800]  knowing what i know about north com training already i believe this person
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.200]  believes what they're saying is true and that they have indeed been given this
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.720]  training the issue is they tell them it's real but also training at the same
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.040]  time so that if they don't think the public will buy a total martial law
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.400]  lockdown they would have just further used it as a live-action drill to train
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.560]  the military and police to set up checkpoints and lockdown major cities
[10:12.560 --> 10:19.760]  but yes under but bush's executive order under his pandemic executive order and
[10:19.760 --> 10:26.160]  and obama has continued that and under this entire system they have prepared
[10:26.160 --> 10:33.760]  mass graves incinerators the coordinating of towns and cities checkpoints bracelets
[10:33.760 --> 10:37.440]  europe is saying they're going to have bracelets for people that have had shots
[10:37.440 --> 10:43.600]  that is in the news so yes we're only a week and a half away from the flu
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.880]  inoculations beginning but the public's running out taking last year's flu shot
[10:48.880 --> 10:52.480]  that even if you believe in the flu shot it has no connection
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.480]  to the mutations of the regular flu this year and no connection
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.280]  to the h1n1 absolutely nothing to do with it
[11:01.280 --> 11:04.640]  there's a lot of medical doctors virologist on record will go over some
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.480]  of those news reports saying they believe that this will kill a lot of
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.640]  people that the vaccine interactions are dangerous
[11:12.640 --> 11:16.000]  but we are going to play that video coming up later in the hour
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.600]  soldier claims authorities training to intern americans
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.240]  who refuse swine flu shot
[11:31.360 --> 11:38.320]  in the video below a soldier claims she has trained with california police
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.000]  to set up roadblocks and force vaccinations on the public
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.840]  those who refuse will be boarded on buses and taken to a concentration camp
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.640]  she includes a photo of an rfad device she claims will be used to track people
[11:52.640 --> 11:55.920]  and material she says the military and police will use
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.640]  electronic bracelets to track the vaccinated former kansas state trooper
[12:00.640 --> 12:06.000]  greg evansson underscored this claim last week
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.520]  have you been made aware of the massive roadblock plans to
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.240]  stop all travelers for a vaccine bracelet
[12:14.240 --> 12:19.280]  stainless steel band with a microchip on board
[12:19.280 --> 12:24.000]  this will force you to take the shot evansson wrote we're going to get him
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.200]  on the show back in july 29th refuse it you will be placed on a prison bus and
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.880]  taken to a quarantine camp what will you do when your
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.560]  children are not allowed into school without the shot what will you do when
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.520]  you are not allowed into the workplace without the vaccine
[12:39.520 --> 12:44.640]  paperwork buy groceries go to the bank shop anywhere
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.640]  get on a plane bus or train use the toilet in the mall
[12:48.640 --> 12:52.640]  police officers will become loathed feared despised and remembered
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.040]  for their official duties mr evansson made the following comment at an event
[12:59.040 --> 13:04.320]  in texas and we have a link to that video as well so
[13:04.320 --> 13:10.000]  ladies and gentlemen we had emergency managers on the show we had reporters on
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.720]  from indiana in a county bordering
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.240]  illinois and chicago and the
[13:21.920 --> 13:25.040]  feds came to them fema came to them and said get ready
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.080]  for riots a million dead to be buried in your town
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.640]  there's not even a million in the county get ready for dead from chicago to be
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.200]  buried then i got secret state documents out of
[13:37.200 --> 13:40.880]  upstate new york about preparations for mass graves and martial law
[13:40.880 --> 13:45.040]  but again ladies and gentlemen it came out that the color coded alert was
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.880]  created for fear and political control and every time they wanted to pass
[13:48.880 --> 13:53.200]  legislation or take people's liberties bush would order
[13:53.200 --> 13:58.080]  homeland security to issue fake alerts this is not some mystery just because
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.960]  you know governor ridge comes out admits it's true now harry fleischer admitted
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.120]  into press conference in 2004
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.640]  so that's what's going on now i want to be clear
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.520]  they are using this as a martial law takeover cover
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.080]  and it certainly is a danger they could release a real bioweapon and kill a
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.480]  bunch of people but if they almost locked the whole country down in
[14:30.480 --> 14:35.600]  april for a couple deaths what are they going to do when tens of thousands die
[14:35.600 --> 14:38.800]  from the regular flu that is a big question
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.840]  that everybody needs to be debating right now
[14:44.480 --> 14:48.480]  in fact i had a bunch of guests lined up today but i just think
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.880]  i'm going to cancel them because i think we should just talk about flu
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.400]  yeah i'm going to pull the plug on the guest today except
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.400]  for one guest shooter jennings son of waylon jennings i want to get his
[15:00.400 --> 15:03.120]  political views in the last hour of the show today
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.320]  but i'm going to go ahead and cancel the other guests and move them i'm going to
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.360]  go ahead and just make that decision right now
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.640]  i want to get judy mccloud writer for canadian free press
[15:14.640 --> 15:17.840]  award-winning journalist formerly with the toronto son
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.480]  she's worked uh working on a big story but we're just going to go ahead and
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.480]  cancel that now and uh michael shaw about the agenda
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.760]  21 water grabbing going on around the country
[15:29.760 --> 15:32.640]  part of the un takeover i'm just going to so we're we don't have to worry about
[15:32.640 --> 15:34.720]  that guest info now because those are just cancelled
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.680]  just have a demo remove those thank you because i want to be able to just spend
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.000]  my time uh today
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.000]  covering the flu because i you know i get so close to a
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.720]  problem so close to a problem that i then
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.240]  start losing focus on just how serious it is
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.480]  that happens to a lot of people that do dangerous jobs
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.040]  their problem is staying focused like deep water underwater industrial
[16:11.040 --> 16:14.400]  diving where they're working on oil rigs and inside
[16:14.400 --> 16:17.840]  ships and doing really dangerous stuff
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.680]  the danger is that they get too routine about it
[16:21.680 --> 16:24.960]  and forget how dangerous it is and i think all of us tend to do that i mean
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.560]  we have a psychopathic eugenics government
[16:28.560 --> 16:32.240]  that openly has engaged in tens of thousands of declassified chemical
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.360]  biological and radiological tests on the people killing the people routinely
[16:37.360 --> 16:41.520]  they're totally ruthless totally wicked totally out of control
[16:41.520 --> 16:44.960]  and they're openly writing in different documents
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.720]  that they are planning to use controlled bio weapons releases and
[16:50.720 --> 16:54.400]  staged terror attacks to bring in world government and dick cheney wrote in
[16:54.400 --> 16:59.040]  the september 20th 2000 document
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.920]  that he wants to use race specific bio weapons
[17:07.920 --> 17:11.520]  and legitimize their use and we know israel south africa the united states
[17:11.520 --> 17:14.080]  england france and others have developed these
[17:14.080 --> 17:17.920]  we know the human genome is run out of colesprings harbor eugenics facility
[17:17.920 --> 17:21.680]  for the express purposes of getting genetic cures for the elites
[17:21.680 --> 17:24.960]  and ways to soft kill the public with degenerative diseases
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.720]  that are hard to track and trace back to their black ops
[17:28.720 --> 17:31.440]  so i want to tell the police and military something i know a lot of you
[17:31.440 --> 17:34.320]  were starting to blow the whistle on this and that's good but we need more
[17:34.320 --> 17:38.000]  you just to go ahead and come out public about the mass graves the force
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.560]  inoculations and all of this because if we expose
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.600]  what they're planning the same thing will happen just like they tried to make
[17:45.600 --> 17:49.920]  police and firefighters and medical workers and other first responders 14
[17:49.920 --> 17:53.200]  million of them in 2002 2003 under the model states
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.120]  held emergency powers act they tried to order them with no law they just said
[17:57.120 --> 17:59.680]  oh you'll be fired if you don't take the shots
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.000]  and i did have mayors i did have fire chiefs i did have police chiefs on
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.280]  we'd see them in local papers in tennessee and arkansas and texas in
[18:07.280 --> 18:11.200]  new york saying i'm not doing this and there's no law and i'm telling my men
[18:11.200 --> 18:15.440]  and women my officer is not to do it or it's their choice
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.800]  but nobody's going to be fired for not taking this
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.160]  and the program stopped because see if they can't make the enforcers take it
[18:24.160 --> 18:26.480]  they're not going to be able to make you take it
[18:26.480 --> 18:33.120]  but they have been having drills the last 10 months
[18:33.120 --> 18:37.360]  in tennessee and california and texas all over
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.120]  where the army and the marines and the national guard and homeland security and
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.040]  dozens of other state and local agencies come out and just set up checkpoints
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.800]  and search people and they'll say oh we had hundreds of arrests for marijuana
[18:48.800 --> 18:52.000]  and alcohol and it's an anti-terror drill but they're
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.160]  arresting citizens for petty issues this is all federalization drills and
[18:56.160 --> 18:58.400]  remember three months ago the governor of
[18:58.400 --> 19:01.920]  tennessee said you don't have authorization army to be doing this and
[19:01.920 --> 19:05.360]  the army said we're going to do it okay buddy under north com
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.520]  under john warner defense authorization act they were in the news
[19:09.520 --> 19:12.320]  saying we don't care remember what happened in iowa
[19:12.320 --> 19:16.880]  eight months ago i had the colonel on door-to-door gun confiscation drills
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.000]  and they said well it's just a drill for gun confiscation
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.400]  and now the feds from boston to chicago to dalis are doing knock-and-talk drills
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.640]  where they come and say we want to look and see if you got any legal guns in
[19:26.640 --> 19:30.480]  your house they're doing this in dalis they're getting the cops ready for
[19:30.480 --> 19:34.720]  gun confiscation and they're using gun buyback program images of people turning
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.440]  guns into police to acclimate people psychologically to turn in their guns in
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.440]  the attorney general has said he wants your guns and he will use
[19:43.440 --> 19:47.040]  riots and shootouts and freakouts over the flu
[19:47.040 --> 19:51.200]  to get that done there's a good chance we're about to see a soviet style take

[24:41.440 --> 24:46.640]  and then the data builds up to a certain flashpoint and i pull back and i see it
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.160]  and all the sudden i get an adrenaline rush my heart almost jumps out of my

[25:15.040 --> 25:19.600]  loaded a whole bunch of key nexus points
[25:19.600 --> 25:25.920]  just came into focus clearly now remember back in january
[25:25.920 --> 25:29.360]  and i've never talked about the flu being used as the takeover
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.120]  that's never been our big issue but in january i began to see all the
[25:33.120 --> 25:36.800]  indicators the mass graves uh the new york state
[25:36.800 --> 25:39.280]  document i was sent by the department of cemeteries

[25:43.200 --> 25:47.440]  we had emergency managers on we played audio interviews with them
[25:47.440 --> 25:53.520]  about how the military was getting ready for marshal law under a flu release
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.840]  for checkpoints lockdowns of cities hardening police stations against
[25:57.840 --> 26:01.680]  revolution and they're training the police for ied
[26:01.680 --> 26:05.680]  these improvised explosive devices every city in the country said homeland
[26:05.680 --> 26:08.880]  security training they're telling the police that veterans are going to come
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.880]  back and start bombing them the homeland security report states veterans and
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.080]  gun owners are the main threat to homeland security
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.520]  so north com is set up for us it's set up for the people that will defend this
[26:21.520 --> 26:24.960]  country gun owners conservatives libertarians

[26:37.120 --> 26:41.280]  you you fools and you still are parading around
[26:41.280 --> 26:46.000]  cheerleading your own destruction the banking takeover is set for the fall
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  they want the banking regulatory reform
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.600]  they have the health care reform and dick army said it
[26:55.600 --> 26:59.520]  the former republican leader i'm not saying he's a greater trustworthy guy
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.600]  but i'm saying when he comes out in seconds what we're saying you better
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.320]  look out congressman broone congressman paul congressman
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.640]  brown a whole bunch of other congressmen
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.520]  are on record saying that obama may use the flu fear
[27:17.520 --> 27:20.800]  as a pretext for martial law or to pass health care
[27:20.800 --> 27:26.560]  or to pass financial reform armies in the dallas morning news
[27:26.560 --> 27:32.800]  broone is in the louisville journal paul has said it on this show
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.400]  ladies and gentlemen this is real
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.680]  it is the perfect cover for a president who is cratering
[27:41.680 --> 27:45.840]  for a country that's on the edge of peaceful revelation and revolution
[27:45.840 --> 27:51.280]  of waking up to the new world order and i don't see the establishment being able
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.480]  to pull out of this they've got all the assets in place
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.160]  past martial law drills did not have the assets in place
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.680]  and we're not doing live action drills at this magnitude
[28:01.680 --> 28:04.960]  basically a giant armada is off our coast now
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.960]  landing forces is the military analogy here
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.160]  this has every indicator of not being a drill
[28:12.160 --> 28:15.840]  and soon they're not going to be able to pull back from it so they're throwing
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.200]  the punch at the republic's face right now
[28:19.200 --> 28:21.920]  they got the sword coming down on us can we pull back
[28:21.920 --> 28:25.680]  can we get our neck out of the jumping block i don't know but we better get the

[28:40.160 --> 28:44.480]  how they built up all these assets and now we have police officers we have

[33:12.880 --> 33:20.400]  i want to be clear to listeners crystal clear
[33:20.400 --> 33:24.720]  the feds set up homeland security in the name of fighting al-qaeda from day one
[33:24.720 --> 33:28.480]  it was set up for the american people
[33:28.480 --> 33:33.440]  and what is the one thing that homeland security can launch that makes every
[33:33.440 --> 33:37.040]  american a suspect that makes everyone a terrorist
[33:37.040 --> 33:39.760]  that makes everyone a criminal and they're already on the news saying
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.760]  someone who has the h1n1 and refuses to take the shot or refuses to be
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.960]  quarantined why they're a terrorist they they could kill people
[33:48.960 --> 33:53.440]  it's a mild flu i've seen the statistics that it kills people
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.600]  a lower percent of the time than the regular seasonal flues
[33:57.600 --> 34:01.120]  a lot of times when they announce somebody's died it is a false positive
[34:01.120 --> 34:04.880]  with this flu and we're now entering the full
[34:04.880 --> 34:08.160]  swing and it starts in the middle of september we're now full swing into the
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.240]  flu season from now into january early february it
[34:12.240 --> 34:16.000]  starts to taper off and right as the vaccine is ready they
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.360]  start the fear mongering and yes ladies and gentlemen
[34:19.360 --> 34:23.600]  the youtube videos are pouring in from military in uniform from police
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.320]  i've got emails from police pouring in and i'm gonna
[34:28.320 --> 34:32.320]  i said i was gonna open the phones up and when i first started the show i
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.000]  didn't think of how important it was to get this intelligence
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.520]  so i want to tell brendan paula lisa kyle ronnie
[34:39.520 --> 34:43.680]  if you are not calling about the flu give me a favor and go ahead and hang up
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.000]  because i've went ahead and canceled the guest for today except for shooter
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.960]  jennings well and jennings son but he's coming on about political issues and his
[34:50.960 --> 34:53.520]  new album i don't want to cancel that one
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.440]  plus that's the last interview so i have time to cover this flu situation
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.120]  uh when i open the phones up and said cover any issue let's go ahead and just
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.920]  scrub the decks go ahead and release the lines
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.080]  i want to specifically i'm thinking on my feet here folks so much is happening
[35:08.080 --> 35:10.240]  and just it just really clicked for me earlier
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.800]  right at the start of the show all this intel i'm gonna go over here in a
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.400]  moment my head's spinning right now this i don't
[35:18.400 --> 35:21.600]  like what i'm seeing what's being confirmed here
[35:21.600 --> 35:25.520]  if you are in the military or you are a police officer
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.680]  or you are a medical worker and you've been told you've got to take the
[35:29.680 --> 35:32.880]  inoculation and you've been told they're going to be setting up checkpoints and
[35:32.880 --> 35:35.840]  having quarantine or you have any information
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.960]  about the flu almost everything that these police and military are saying
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.440]  in news articles and youtube videos is already confirmed in mainstream
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.480]  announcements and fits exactly the protocols
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.000]  that the pentagon and north com have been training with local police for
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.080]  that we've been covering since january the problem is that they're now going
[35:56.080 --> 36:00.640]  out to the lowest level of the military unit
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.280]  the smallest part the privates and telling them get ready
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.640]  they're now telling uh new police officers people that have only been on
[36:10.640 --> 36:13.120]  the force a year or so that are low level that are
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.920]  rookies that this is going to happen they're now
[36:15.920 --> 36:19.440]  giving the command orders it appears to almost
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.480]  everyone in every major department even small towns
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.040]  that's what i need to confirm i know they've got mass graves ready i know
[36:27.040 --> 36:30.240]  they've got mass quarantines ready i know they've got forced inoculations
[36:30.240 --> 36:33.440]  ready it's like obama the last month keeps saying don't
[36:33.440 --> 36:37.440]  worry we're not going to make you take the shot but you need to
[36:37.440 --> 36:43.040]  but then they order police and and nurses and doctors in major cities and
[36:43.040 --> 36:46.640]  statewide in new jersey and new york to take it same thing in france same thing
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.160]  in spain same thing in greece they're ordering compulsory
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.600]  injections for their enforcers and you better believe if they're going to make
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.320]  the enforcers and the first responders take it they're
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.640]  going to try to make you take it so we know that's the plan and we know under
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.280]  level six this is the key under level six we're under you in control
[37:05.280 --> 37:08.560]  and they have said they can have quarantine and forced inoculation
[37:08.560 --> 37:14.080]  anytime they want under level six so this is the big issue ladies and
[37:14.080 --> 37:17.440]  gentlemen we're under level six now remember back in april i told you that
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.400]  and people didn't believe the document i posted even though i had phone numbers
[37:20.400 --> 37:23.360]  and names of doctors and then three months later they came out and said
[37:23.360 --> 37:28.560]  yeah we went to level six uh in late april and didn't tell the public
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.080]  but i've got the interviews with the emergency managers about the mass graves
[37:32.080 --> 37:35.200]  and martial law we've got the interviews and the and the secret
[37:35.200 --> 37:43.680]  department of cemeteries uh and funeral homes out of
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.520]  new york in fact guys it was erin dyke's article that he has the document in it
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.160]  was titled mass graves confirmed erin dyke's info wars print that off for me
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.000]  again i know the flu is serious i know it's coming up i know we've been
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  exposing it making the establishment back off to a certain extent
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.760]  cut back from hundreds of millions of dosages down to 50 million
[38:03.760 --> 38:06.880]  then they said okay we're at 50 million then now they say oh no we do have 200
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.680]  million now so so they're playing possum you know they're playing dead
[38:11.680 --> 38:14.960]  but their whole operation is still rolling forward so i want to believe
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.040]  we've backed this off but every indicator is they're at least using it as a
[38:19.040 --> 38:24.240]  federalization internationalization drill to test local police and military
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.520]  to see if they'll go along with checkpoints and force inoculations
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.760]  which is a perfect cover for future martial law scenarios and we've got
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.040]  three congressmen on record saying that they may use this for
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.600]  martial law and to get their health care bill passed their amnesty bill passed
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.560]  israel's openly in the london telegraph on fox news saying they may go ahead and
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.600]  hit iran if we don't hit them i mean it it's all coming together right now and
[38:51.600 --> 38:54.640]  i've just got chills going up my back so i'm gonna break it all down i wanted to
[38:54.640 --> 39:01.280]  get paul watson online with me to somehow try to crystallize all this data
[39:01.280 --> 39:04.640]  this big picture paul i guess with a headline like
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.120]  uh police and military being prepared for forced inoculations and martial law
[39:09.120 --> 39:12.080]  and then kind of boil it down and give people the big picture
[39:12.080 --> 39:15.840]  paul watson how do you think we ought to attack this because it's not just me
[39:15.840 --> 39:19.360]  getting you up here you know to stand before the man
[39:19.360 --> 39:22.800]  and i give you your marching orders because you're one of my best writers
[39:22.800 --> 39:25.600]  and somebody i know that can get the job done properly and understands the
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.600]  full spectrum that we're dealing with what is your analysis what's your take
[39:29.600 --> 39:32.400]  on what i'm saying because i'm about to get into roiders
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.000]  and boston globe with two pieces of data that hit me this morning
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.960]  and i i actually staggered for a moment paul
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.720]  well what's interesting from what i've seen is
[39:44.720 --> 39:48.720]  at the beginning of july the british government
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.080]  health authorities came out and said that by the end of august
[39:54.080 --> 40:01.120]  this is in the uk there would be one 100 000 new cases of swine flu every day
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.520]  and that 40 people in the uk every day would die
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.680]  now they came out and said that in the first few days of july
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.360]  now we're already past the middle of september
[40:13.360 --> 40:17.920]  and it's proven to be completely hyped way beyond all
[40:17.920 --> 40:24.560]  recognition and i believe that's because as soon as
[40:24.560 --> 40:31.440]  the potential was mooted that this swine flu vaccination
[40:31.440 --> 40:39.440]  would be mandatory 90 plus of nurses and health workers
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.880]  as well as the general public came out and said there's no way that we're
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.560]  going to take a swine flu shot and then that was prompted by the fact
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.680]  that the information about it containing
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.520]  squaly in which is linked to gulf war syndrome
[40:57.520 --> 41:01.840]  as well as mercury that's right triggers it triggers the hyper auto
[41:01.840 --> 41:07.040]  immune response denver post has kernels in it
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.520]  admitting that it killed and maimed large numbers of the troops that took it
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.000]  and they're putting reportedly four times the squalene
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.120]  in this flu shot that has ever been put in any shot including the anthrax shot
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.320]  and it is guaranteed the squalene alone to devastate people's brains are going
[41:26.320 --> 41:28.800]  to swell up their pancreas is going to swell up
[41:28.800 --> 41:31.520]  doesn't matter how hard you're working out folks you're going to be getting
[41:31.520 --> 41:35.120]  diabetes they're going to go from one in three having it to everybody having it
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.320]  and i guess who takes this shot i don't mean to interrupt you paul but this
[41:38.320 --> 41:42.800]  nexus is in with what you're saying flu experts gear up for pandemic vaccine
[41:42.800 --> 41:45.840]  worry roiders and they are getting ahead of the
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.080]  story now with this september 16th article yesterday
[41:50.080 --> 41:54.960]  one million heart attacks 700 000 strokes and 900 000 miscarriages
[41:54.960 --> 41:59.200]  us public health officials want americans to know these will happen every single
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.880]  year with or without swine flu vaccine campaign so they're saying
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.080]  get ready for people having strokes having miscarriages
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.240]  getting gillian um i always mispronounce it it's not gillian
[42:10.240 --> 42:16.480]  bernay's it's gillian beret all of this happening
[42:16.480 --> 42:20.640]  and they have internal cdc documents admitting it's going to do it to people
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.080]  and give them the autoimmune response where your body
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.160]  eats your brainstem and i guess as everybody starts going into
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.520]  wheelchairs and convulsing getting paralyzed just like with garter cell
[42:31.520 --> 42:33.840]  killing people will just dance around and laugh about it
[42:33.840 --> 42:40.720]  the sons of bitches paul well don't forget that both the cdc
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.880]  and the british health authorities sent out that advisory
[42:44.880 --> 42:48.400]  before the vaccines were completed telling them to watch out for nerve
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.880]  diseases um from trial guinea pigs taking the
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.240]  shot so they're aware that this is going to happen and
[42:56.240 --> 42:59.360]  now they're getting out ahead of the story and saying that
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.000]  yeah hundreds of thousands if not millions of people are going to die
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.440]  and they're just trying to lay that groundwork so and they're saying oh it
[43:07.440 --> 43:10.880]  has nothing to do with it you were happy and 18 years old and took the shot
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.400]  now you're in a wheelchair with your brainstem rotted off with your body
[43:14.400 --> 43:19.920]  attacking it it's totally normal the thing about it is when all that came
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.480]  out about it being linked to um guine bear and nerve disorders and autism
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.080]  that's the point when the vast majority of people said there's no way we're
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.600]  taking it which is also when government
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.240]  the french government the british government said that
[43:38.240 --> 43:42.000]  they backed off from the rhetoric that it was going to be mandatory
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.720]  and started saying making noises that it would be voluntary but see that's it
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.960]  they test the water then we say no then they're going to create fear
[43:50.960 --> 43:56.240]  and they're going to have women mainly on tv demanding everybody take the shot
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.400]  saying my daughter died you didn't take the shot you you killed her
[44:00.400 --> 44:03.920]  demanding it poll
[44:03.920 --> 44:07.520]  yeah that if they ramp it up that much and that's going to happen but if you
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.200]  look at i mean i wrote an article a few weeks ago about
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.200]  these internal french government documents that say that it is going to
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.200]  be mandatory so it and if the testimony of this
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.680]  military person who i mean she really needs to come out and be completely
[44:23.680 --> 44:27.120]  public she's already all over youtube so we need to know a name and a
[44:27.120 --> 44:30.560]  position exactly so we can get the story out and so
[44:30.560 --> 44:35.360]  it can't be dismissed by people as just someone ranting on youtube because
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.800]  from every perspective this is what we're hearing that they're gearing up for
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.840]  checkpoints and mandatory inoculations you remember the
[44:43.840 --> 44:49.840]  story again we had about um healthcare bill will fund state vaccine teams to
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.280]  conduct interventions in private homes and that's
[44:53.280 --> 44:56.960]  the bill in america out of the um
[44:56.960 --> 44:59.920]  then a health education labor and pension committee
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.480]  it was approved by them the allow the feds have bills
[45:04.480 --> 45:07.680]  massachusetts passed a bill other states are passing bills
[45:07.680 --> 45:11.120]  to forcibly come in your house without warrants they're openly
[45:11.120 --> 45:14.800]  circling us like sharks like we're out here on a life draft
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.360]  in the south pacific and we've got giant tiger sharks circling around us
[45:19.360 --> 45:22.720]  wanting to have dinner and they're denying that we're seeing huge shark
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.840]  fins but but meanwhile this is testing soft kill weapons
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.440]  and that's what i've pointed out they knew Gardasil in the trials was killing
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.000]  and maiming and paralyzing people with autoimmune uh diseases in the nerves
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.920]  they knew it so they got parry to say it was recommended by the state
[45:39.920 --> 45:45.120]  so that vaccine federal uh damage fund would kick in
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.800]  knowing it was going to kill and main people they knowingly put it out
[45:48.800 --> 45:52.720]  admitted it didn't protect you from uh human papillomavirus
[45:52.720 --> 45:57.840]  don't care the women run out enjoy getting sterilized enjoy dying
[45:57.840 --> 46:01.520]  bring their daughters in to be soft killed with pleasure
[46:01.520 --> 46:04.800]  and then now the mothers are bringing their daughters and sons in for the new
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.640]  weapon and they come out and say yeah it's going to hurt a lot of you but it
[46:08.640 --> 46:10.960]  you know people are going to be dying all around you but
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.120]  it's not the flu vaccine it's quite normal to take a shot to suddenly have
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.360]  your brain uh swell up uh i mean paul they're just
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.320]  in the background turning up the ambient soft killed
[46:24.320 --> 46:28.880]  system like the frog in the pot it goes on to say yet this year they know a
[46:28.880 --> 46:31.920]  significant number will be blamed on h1n1 vaccine
[46:31.920 --> 46:34.960]  which will roll out within weeks and they are struggling to be ready
[46:34.960 --> 46:38.800]  so they're telling the doctors you don't diagnose this somebody takes this they
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.280]  have a convulsion internal cdc says it's going to do this to them
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.360]  but when they have a degenerative neurological disorder
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.280]  it was not the shot do you understand that doctor the doctor's like yes i
[46:51.280 --> 46:54.560]  understand i don't want liability and they're going to pay a bounty to british
[46:54.560 --> 46:59.440]  doctors for every shot they give people go ahead
[46:59.440 --> 47:05.600]  well they're now running uh commercial on british television
[47:05.600 --> 47:09.680]  which encouraged girls to get this hpv vaccine even though it's being linked
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.760]  with hundreds of deaths both in this country in the u.s so
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.240]  you know they're getting desperate i mean this happened with m m r
[47:18.240 --> 47:23.200]  in britain these old months rubella vaccine when
[47:23.200 --> 47:27.680]  about 90 percent of british parents rejected it and stopped getting their
[47:27.680 --> 47:30.880]  children immunized with it and then that prompted the government to start a
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.040]  propaganda campaign to get them back on board and threatening to take their
[47:35.040 --> 47:38.960]  children yeah but from all the response that i've
[47:38.960 --> 47:43.920]  seen the vast majority of people will not take this swine flu vaccine
[47:43.920 --> 47:48.000]  and anyone who's in any kind of position of authority has got to
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.760]  recognize that so if they make it mandatory then
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.080]  all hell's gonna break loose basically but that's what they want paul
[47:56.080 --> 47:59.680]  and while all hell's breaking loose they can pass all their legislation
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.360]  and set up the new world government the new financial reform
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.120]  well that's the possibility but i mean take france for example
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.840]  whenever the french government tries to do anything that's mildly unpopular
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.800]  the country just shuts down for a week they don't have florida water there
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.400]  no i mean that wouldn't happen in america it wouldn't happen in the uk
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.120]  because everybody's docile but still from the reaction whether people are
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.000]  willing to back up their words with the actual action
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.880]  or cave into the fear-mongering remains to be seen well let's say 10 of people
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.280]  refuse a quarantine and fight back uh that will be
[48:41.280 --> 48:43.520]  30
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.520]  well i mean what's what's uh 10 of 300 million that's 30 million
[48:49.520 --> 48:54.880]  30 million in the u.s and about six million people in the uk
[48:54.880 --> 48:58.320]  well look that's why the feds are training police to take blood without
[48:58.320 --> 49:01.120]  warrants and now we've confirmed in austin
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.760]  in just regular crime cases you'll come in as a witness for somebody and they'll
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.720]  just grab you and say we can take your blood now
[49:08.720 --> 49:11.920]  and they're just taking i mean this whole this country is completely gone i
[49:11.920 --> 49:15.840]  mean it is just i mean the government is completely
[49:15.840 --> 49:20.320]  psychopathic out of control they've always got these sick rationalizations
[49:20.320 --> 49:23.680]  for everything they're doing paul and you know the key here is
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.760]  this is being used as a worldwide police state grid for the un
[49:27.760 --> 49:31.360]  to implement and exercise its global federal control
[49:31.360 --> 49:35.920]  over the nation states and they are definitely getting police and military
[49:35.920 --> 49:40.160]  ready for checkpoints and transponders and they may not get away with it this
[49:40.160 --> 49:43.360]  time but it's all part of the process and we need a big
[49:43.360 --> 49:47.200]  article to point out to people this is happening
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.440]  i believe they are going to attempt it paul they've moved too many assets into
[49:51.440 --> 49:54.320]  place so we need to get an article out exposing that but
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.160]  also an article that has all the facts so people can make their own decision
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.080]  an article that tells the listeners and the readers that you need to get out
[50:02.080 --> 50:05.200]  and spread the word about how dangerous these vaccines are
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.960]  and uh just how ridiculous all this is because if we have a mass awakening to
[50:10.960 --> 50:16.320]  this we can derail this system well if we go ahead full board
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.640]  alex what they'll do is just say you know you don't want the vaccine that's
[50:20.640 --> 50:25.120]  fine but you don't travel you can't get an airport
[50:25.120 --> 50:28.320]  they'll take people's privileges away and that's the only way they're going to
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.160]  get people who previously refused to take well exactly no no they're saying
[50:32.160 --> 50:34.720]  you they're saying they're going to grab you off the road
[50:34.720 --> 50:37.840]  and then they'll have checkpoints everywhere and it is even meant to stop
[50:37.840 --> 50:40.960]  people traveling it's just meant to set the precedent that's what they've been
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.200]  training cops to drive buses for decades for martial law
[50:45.200 --> 50:51.520]  and uh paul anything else no i think okay get the big report out because
[50:51.520 --> 50:53.680]  boston's saying they're going to track what neighborhoods have been
[50:53.680 --> 50:56.960]  inoculated and what neighborhoods haven't so it's really happening good job paul

[55:13.120 --> 55:16.800]  like being a leader i don't like
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.200]  wanting to work 20 hours a day and not having a life ladies and gentlemen
[55:23.200 --> 55:26.720]  i'm not complaining about the burden i just wish it would stop it's like a
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.080]  it's like a roller coaster ride you can't get off of and it just it just goes
[55:30.080 --> 55:36.720]  on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.880]  but i'm gonna try to get focused go over the evidence
[55:40.880 --> 55:44.800]  and i want to hear from police military nurses people are being told that to take
[55:44.800 --> 55:47.520]  the shots see obama is up there saying you don't
[55:47.520 --> 55:52.240]  have to take the shot don't worry but then he has his surrogates come out and
[55:52.240 --> 55:54.880]  say oh we might have to force the shots on you
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.200]  so they play good cop bad cop and then they're telling nurses and police all
[55:59.200 --> 56:02.160]  over the country in different departments it's in the associated press
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.600]  it's in roiders it's in the boston globe it's been in the news for the last
[56:05.600 --> 56:08.400]  month they're telling nurses they've got to take it
[56:08.400 --> 56:11.520]  they're trying to broach the subject of police but they're saying no
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.920]  so the good news is people are saying no praise god for that
[56:15.920 --> 56:22.640]  but i want to take your calls i want to talk to the military and police
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.280]  because we've already talked to emergency managers and others back in
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.600]  january about them planning this and i just know that our enemies are capable
[56:29.600 --> 56:33.200]  of anything to get their world government and they need a global crisis
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.040]  and the flu is tailor made they set up the police state grid
[56:37.040 --> 56:40.240]  they tell you it's for men in caves and then they tell you oh it's for the flu
[56:40.240 --> 56:42.800]  oh it's for gun owners oh it's for conservatives
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.640]  brendan in california you got the intel for us
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.600]  oh yeah hi alex just some of my thoughts on this particular topic
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.080]  um sir sir sir sir hold on i'm not trying to be mean brendan but i'm gonna go
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.840]  i'm gonna give you one minute but after this i can't do i have to keep the
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.360]  lines open for police and military and medical workers
[57:03.360 --> 57:07.280]  we need the information but go ahead and give us your point
[57:07.280 --> 57:10.560]  i was gonna say they can't do terrorist-style attacks because that would
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.000]  turn american people away from domestic changes that obama want to
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.520]  accomplish and would refocus people on external threats
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.160]  but the domestic bio-emergency will will support domestic federal takeover
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.200]  which conveniently plays into the health reform agenda
[57:25.200 --> 57:29.840]  now on the table and at the same time also the only way that local and state
[57:29.840 --> 57:32.240]  authorities will get in line with federal direction
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.640]  it also succeeds in removing focus from continued military build-up abroad
[57:36.640 --> 57:39.760]  which is a weak point for obama yes and
[57:39.760 --> 57:43.840]  in addition vaccine reactions will require additional health care
[57:43.840 --> 57:46.640]  if government is blamed and they'll have to make good
[57:46.640 --> 57:49.760]  and if they're not blamed then it simply plays into the general agenda
[57:49.760 --> 57:53.280]  genius i'm glad you did call in and broke the rule because
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.360]  you just crystallized it all that's what dick army said he said the former
[57:57.360 --> 57:59.520]  leader of the republicans in the in the house
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.040]  he said they're going to use this to weigh down health care and say see we've
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.000]  got to have government health care because it bankrupts the states
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.760]  and that is exactly what they're starting to say now so you're absolutely
[58:09.760 --> 58:11.840]  right you should write that up and send it to
[58:11.840 --> 58:15.440]  writersandinfowars.com and give us your perspective on it
[58:15.440 --> 58:18.960]  anything else uh brendan that's it god bless you
[58:18.960 --> 58:22.480]  now look i'm not trying to be mean i'm sure lisa kyle ronnie brian i'm sure
[58:22.480 --> 58:26.000]  everybody's got great points but after i take these calls
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.920]  only police military first responders medical workers
[58:29.920 --> 58:33.920]  and then we've got video and audio clips coming up in the next hour of police
[58:33.920 --> 58:37.920]  and military confirming the plans for quarantines and checkpoints

[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:36.480]  Reuters and the government are preparing the public for
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:41.680]  deaths and neurological disorders their own internal documents admit
[1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:45.600]  that the flu shot is linked to this the flu vaccine
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:49.680]  so they're spinning it saying get ready for millions of deaths but it's not

[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.240]  and the gcn radio network
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:20.320]  all right i'm going to try to not put in my two cents
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.920]  i'm just going to ask questions and then i'm going to recap coming up later in
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:26.800]  the hour the big picture of what's happening with this flu
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:30.640]  how it's being used as the cover for a complete takeover
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:34.720]  now things are not going good for the globalist people are not receptive to
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:38.160]  their force inoculation their quarantines their lockdowns of cities
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:42.800]  their mass grave preparations but that is confirmed to be going on
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:46.080]  and it's now being confirmed in the mainstream media and they're beginning
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.880]  to spin it and acclimate it and try to sell it in a
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:52.320]  non-threatening way and so i'm going to spend the whole show
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:56.400]  today on this going back to william and then i'm
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.360]  going to open the phones up to police military first responders people that
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:03.440]  have been to flu conferences specifically on plans for
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:06.240]  martial law that i'm going to play several interviews one with a police
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.480]  officer at a public event in texas and another
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.920]  with a member of the military who's working with local police in california
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:17.280]  and we know the army and marines are working with chips
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.920]  for checkpoints claiming it was for dwis which is totally illegal
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:25.440]  so we know they're using that as a cover story so see i have all this other
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:29.440]  backstory intel and then we have the boston globes
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:33.120]  saying they're getting ready to have certain areas and keep maps of who's
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.640]  been vaccinated where and what house so this doesn't look good
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:40.560]  william in a nutshell why did you go to the big flu conference
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.160]  why are you doing this and what do you think's really behind all this
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:47.920]  well let me tell you alex i know these globes are you jenesis you're the one
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:51.600]  who woke me up i went off on my own and did my own research
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:54.320]  and everything you say i was able to back up through
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:59.600]  you know government-based websites and whatnot i've got two little girls here
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.360]  you know and i just am scared to death for their future
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:07.280]  um i what i'm trying to do is put a team together here in delaware
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.520]  that we can go down to washington on a regular basis with hidden cameras
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:16.240]  uh open cameras and get these our so-called
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.920]  representatives on video on tape trying to get them to explain to us what it is
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:25.280]  they're doing what it is they're planning we know what they're doing
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:29.200]  we just need to get it on tape and um if anybody in delaware of the
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:32.480]  surrounding area go to facebook uh we are changed
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:37.120]  delaware and and dropped me a line let's and i i suggest this all across the
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:40.880]  country you've got to get together you've got to pick up your cameras
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:44.640]  because right now it is the information war and
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:49.440]  the cameras are the only way to pierce their veil
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:52.720]  brendan we've got your number we're going to stay in contact
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:55.520]  we've got your documents we're going to get them up in paul watson's article
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.280]  thank you so much hey thank you alex
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:03.120]  now for years people have asked me what is the solution to fight the new world
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:08.400]  order states rights being informed saying no to tyranny
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.880]  demanding national sovereignty be restored not eroded
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:16.880]  but i've also said go to city meetings go to state meetings
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:19.760]  go to committee meetings go to city council meetings
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:23.440]  go to county commissioner meetings go to school board meetings
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:28.240]  government is so corrupt and different city organizations
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.680]  and poverty pimp organizations are so corrupt
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:37.600]  that you walk into almost any meeting and you say i've got drugs i've got
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:41.360]  hookers they will most of them will instantly say great i've
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:44.160]  got cocaine to sell you and pull it out of their desk

[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.720]  you scratch the skin anywhere puss will just spew out
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:31.360]  and we will just continue to discredit these criminals
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:34.480]  and expose these criminals
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:38.480]  i'm telling you you got corrupt cops doing illegal things in your town
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:41.600]  you start following them around when they're off duty they're going to be
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:44.400]  doing illegal stuff and you just put it on youtube
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.760]  and their life is over politically you use the truth you use the
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.800]  law to burn them down politically we're not playing games
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:57.840]  we don't have long they're going to shut the web down the next two years
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:01.200]  on their current timeline we're going to fight that as well but
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:05.520]  look we got time to smash these bastards right now if you'll simply engage them
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:10.880]  like william did we don't have time to play games ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:13.360]  we've got a blueprint to bring these people down
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:16.880]  they're criminals anytime you investigate them you're going to find

[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:01.440]  i'm told he's just about to get out but the point is it went higher than him
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:04.560]  but they wanted to stop it because it was tied in with local businesses in the
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:10.480]  city still ladies and gentlemen

[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:55.360]  um my children are on the state health insurance fund because we didn't have we
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.640]  could afford to buy health insurance and i realized that
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:03.520]  they maintain the insurance company you know which is has a state contract
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:07.360]  maintains data on when they have their checkups
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:10.480]  if they're late if they don't have their checkups on time which is when they
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:15.120]  get their shots you get mailing about it you might even get phone calls about it
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:19.440]  i have gotten phone calls about it no no the new system is
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:22.720]  the new free health care is you come get the cancer shots
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:25.840]  you go get the poison shots or cps comes and takes your kids
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.200]  it's already started in england so what's our answer to
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:33.360]  to try and fund your own health care yeah that's their plan is they're gonna
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:37.440]  bankrupt the economy and the society where we're all
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:41.120]  forced onto their system and then they can just have their way with us
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:45.680]  that's what's so diabolical about this i don't know i mean i don't know what
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:49.840]  you do uh try to eat healthy try to live outside
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:54.320]  the city uh try to uh
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:57.200]  you know the illegal aliens get free health care and they don't get harassed
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:02.080]  it's because we're compliant that this is happening to us
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:05.520]  now i just want to say off the government database i don't like them knowing
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:08.560]  you know whether or not they've been to the doctor or what they've done and what
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:12.080]  that they even know um i have a chronic illness and they already know what the
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.520]  preventive recommendations are and if i didn't get my eye exam if i didn't get
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:19.600]  my feet examined they let me know they write me a letter saying gee our
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:22.560]  records indicate that you didn't you know you didn't get your eyes checked this
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:26.080]  year i want to get off that database somehow
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:29.440]  and i guess everybody's going on and everyone is going to be listed as a
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:33.280]  terrorist it was two million one hundred thousand in january
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:36.400]  twenty five thousand new names a month it's since been secret so it's probably
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.080]  up in a million and a half or close to it right now
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:44.240]  and no judge no jury you just go on it uh if you have bad credit you're going
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:48.480]  to go on the terror list uh they're just creating secret lists secret police
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:51.040]  and just doing it ma'am i wish it wasn't happening

[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:40.400]  hey alex um i was in a major pharmacy chain yesterday
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:46.160]  i don't know if i can say the name or not go ahead it was a walgreens
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:52.000]  and inside this this chain there was a take care clinic now i'm getting a
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.240]  prescription filled and at this take clear clinic there are um
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.960]  getting out flu shots i didn't go up to the lady i didn't say anything
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:06.240]  she comes to me saying you need to get a flu shot if you don't get a flu shot
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:09.440]  you know on and on and on so i went along with it
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:12.560]  and i said well what is in the flu shot and she said
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:16.000]  oh you know just the normal stuff i said let me see the the little insert in the
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.400]  box and i highlighted for her the formaldehyde
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:25.600]  the squaring all the bad stuff in there i said are you telling people that
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:27.760]  they're injecting themselves with these toxic
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:31.200]  poisons and she said well they're inactive
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.520]  ingredients i said yes but they are still ingredients
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:39.840]  furthermore when you get the flu shot you have to put your name
[1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:44.320]  your address all your information into a database
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:48.480]  i said where does this information go no that's it they are preparing
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.200]  uh Massachusetts admits and the feds admit that they are creating a database
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:56.000]  for forced inoculation so even if they don't go
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  to full martial law with this they are testing the infrastructure
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.960]  for national databases of who and hasn't had the shot
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:08.640]  well it's it's i'm an ems worker and my fiance
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:12.880]  is a registered nurse and i said i read the the um
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:15.840]  warning that are on it and i said well there's nothing on here
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.240]  about autoimmune you know problems there's nothing on here about nervous
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:24.000]  disorders the most it says on the warning paper that they give you
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.160]  is that you might feel sick for a couple days and at the most an adverse
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:32.000]  reaction you might have to be hospitalized for 48 hours
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:36.240]  until they can get some kind of you know uh antigen or something i said that
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:39.600]  that's that's a complete lie that's a complete falsity
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:44.240]  and well it also has the marisol in it well that yeah that the mercury exactly
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.680]  i said what what is um and they said there's another shot that doesn't
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:51.760]  have those in it and i said let me see that paper and i highlighted all the
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.840]  negative stuff to her now there's about five people around me
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:59.840]  and the pharmacies right across the way i see the lady

[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:34.240]  we have military people going on video saying yes they're getting ready to set
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:38.080]  up checkpoints we're training for it now and that's in the level six pandemic
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:40.880]  training manuals that's confirmed that that they're
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:44.400]  preparing for that but the new information is they're saying they're
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:48.560]  going to do it that's the issue so this is already
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:51.680]  confirmed we're just double triple quadruple
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:56.400]  confirming getting more intel so we're going to go to alan bill dan ronnie
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:00.720]  brian and others one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.240]  we're only taking calls from people that have direct intel
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.160]  medical workers or husbands or wives of medical workers military people police
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:11.760]  officers law enforcement people who are being told they've
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:14.480]  got to take the shots that's now in the news
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:17.040]  again obama says that you don't have to take it but they're trying to make the
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:19.920]  police and medical workers take it that's confirmed
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:22.240]  and then i've got all this other intel i'm going to break down in the next
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:24.240]  hour but i wanted to bring jaren in here
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:27.840]  briefly jaren what are you seeing with the walgreens ads actually heard on the
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:30.720]  radio for the past couple of weeks they've had ads saying that their
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:34.640]  pharmacists are rigorously trained to provide
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:37.760]  flu vaccinations that you need to come in and get one
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.080]  but i've also read what that caller said confirming they put you in a database
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.000]  and and and so that's part of the forced inoculation later to see who's had the
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:50.480]  shot and who hasn't wow i mean this so they're definitely beta testing
[1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:54.000]  forced inoculations for the future and they may drop the hammer now because
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.480]  look at how everything's coming to a head right now
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.080]  and also i wanted to tell you uh while i'm on the air programming note
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:04.400]  wane madson at one o'clock wane madson at one o'clock on the flu yeah
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:07.920]  okay we're gonna go to alan bill dan ronnie brine and others with breaking
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:11.920]  intel on what's happening and we're gonna shift into a war room mode at info
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.560]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com uh with a flu section we've
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:19.120]  already had posted we're going to put it back on the main page
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.360]  and start updating it with the latest intel because now it's begun
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:26.560]  but i wanted to go to a sponsor for the next five six minutes who makes this
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:30.640]  show possible and who i really believe in and it's a cola blue the atmospheric
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:34.640]  water generator talk about preparedness you can get a solar panel for it
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:39.040]  and they've got the little uh adapter for the power system it uses a cola blue
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:42.560]  has that available they have links to the type of solar
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:46.160]  panels that are good for running it i know jessie ventura's got a cola blue
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.320]  now that he's going to use when he's down in mexico
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.760]  with all of this preparedness going on now is the time
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.440]  to get off the grid or at least get somewhat self-sufficient before they do
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:58.160]  completely drop the hammer now we're not saying that's going to happen
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:01.680]  we're seeing they're lined up and preparing and may do it and congressmen
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:04.160]  are saying that uh but i really do believe in the
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:09.920]  a cola blue atmospheric water generator uh it cuts out the drugs that are in the
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:12.320]  tap water the chemicals in the water table
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:16.240]  pesticides the chemicals they add to the water fluoride chlorine
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:19.360]  uh a bunch of other chemicals viruses bacteria
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:24.960]  uh dead pathogens dead bacteria lead pipes fixtures new and old new brass

[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:22.800]  uh in a nutshell tell us about the a cola blue atmospheric water generator
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:27.280]  well you know the a cola blue 28 will produce up to seven gallons of pure water
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:33.680]  per day and it is a fundamental necessity that we have good clean pure water
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:40.320]  because we can't for ourselves and our family count on anybody else to provide it
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:46.080]  absolutely and uh explain to people some people go water out of the air it
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:48.880]  looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:52.800]  well it does but what it does is it pulls out the humidity of out of the air it
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:55.680]  filters it sends it through a multi-stage
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:00.800]  filtration process and then it provides either cold or hot
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:05.600]  water for your your use but it also reminializes it so
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:08.640]  you know you're good to go you don't have to worry about
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:13.520]  um fluoride chlorine chloramines you don't have to worry about pesticides
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:16.960]  it's just one last thing that we have to worry about
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:22.240]  in battling the troubles we're seeing today
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:26.080]  well i know i've got a cola blue at my house and in my office and i know
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.720]  people just give us rave reviews that get them

[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.720]  alan in texas medical worker what's your intel on what's really happening is it
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:25.040]  true or have you heard they're getting ready for force
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:28.720]  quarantines lockdowns checkpoints bracelets
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:32.320]  proving you've had the shot if you remove the bracelet or don't take the shot
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:36.400]  they put you on a bus and take you to a fema camp
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:39.840]  oh yeah i have not heard any of that stuff alex
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:43.040]  uh... i do work with vaccination programs
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:47.360]  uh... in the county level and uh...
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:51.440]  if i had any kind of secret info to share with you it would be that i've been
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:54.160]  told by a number of people that they don't even expect to
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:58.880]  receive delivery of this vaccine in time for it to do
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:02.560]  you know in my opinion any good i think in your opinion you would say that it's
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:06.640]  you know poisoning people and stuff i don't think they have the capacity to
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:08.640]  produce it i don't think we're going to be able to take
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.360]  delivery of it i think that the bulk of the flu season
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:17.680]  will have come and gone by the time we have the h1n1 vaccine
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:20.720]  how long have you been listening to the show
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:24.800]  well i do just want to say alex i listen to your shows since you were on that
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:29.040]  fm station in austin in the late 90s and i agree
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.760]  wholeheartedly with so much you do and will your take on the command and
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:37.440]  control government that's that's going on but i
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.960]  just this stuff about the vaccinations alex i just i'm not on board with it
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:46.480]  and sir did you hear me three years ago talk about garter cell killing people
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.880]  in the trials i've been involved in garter cell
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:54.400]  vaccination and until that stuff was politicized by
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.360]  governor good hair wanting to give that company millions of dollars
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:04.160]  i'm you know you have a trial system to identify
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:07.600]  problems with vaccines and and things and there are side effects to
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.800]  vaccinations you know i bet you're going to have about one
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:15.040]  one per million that get any vaccination probably do have
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:20.720]  dire physical effect from it i would not dispute that for a minute
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.040]  but what about gillian you know gillian beret
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.880]  i mean the cdc's own documents saying they're worried about neurological
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:32.880]  problems i believe that what they were trying to do with those
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:36.720]  with those documents is is that it is a rare disorder
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:40.080]  and i and again i don't think that this is going to happen
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:43.280]  i think that they were concerned there was going to be
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:47.680]  so much more of an uptick in in these flu vaccinations
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:51.120]  because of the concern and frankly and i'm with you the hype
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:56.320]  about this h1n1 that you were going to have so many more
[1:43:56.320 --> 1:43:58.880]  vaccinations in a normal year and you would have
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:03.600]  so much more of a chance of of this gillian bar which is very treatable
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:08.480]  disease but it's a rare disease and it mimics the symptoms of things that
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:11.840]  doctors don't typically worry about i think there was an effort
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:16.320]  to communicate out to first responders and to people in the medical community
[1:44:16.320 --> 1:44:19.760]  of what the symptoms of that was so that they could avoid
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.440]  death and and and you know crippling people
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.400]  you know people they could be paralyzed for the rest of their lives well you
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:29.680]  know why they stopped giving a smallpox shot it was causing some type
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:32.640]  according to medical doctors we've had on and the defense department's own
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:36.160]  documents is why they quit it was causing some type of autoimmune
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.040]  inflammation in the heart valves and people were having heart attacks
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:44.000]  yeah i will i will i know nothing of this i don't know anything about the
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.040]  smallpox okay well listen alan i understand that you
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:49.920]  disagree with some of it disagree with other points
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:53.520]  i don't know what's going on all i know is
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:57.040]  that they're preparing mass graves and quarantines and checkpoints and i have
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:01.680]  that confirmed mainstream news now will they implement that i pray to god not
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:06.720]  i got three children i live right in the epicenter of this in the u.s texas
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:11.200]  that's where it first popped up here i'm not pleased
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:15.200]  i want to try to turn this around but we've got some video and audio clips
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:18.800]  coming up um that fit into all the other intel i have
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:22.320]  that'll curl your hair bill in new hampshire dod worker you're on the
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.920]  air bill thanks for calling what's happening
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:29.920]  worldwide transmission what's your uh info sir uh sir
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:35.280]  i am a dod worker and my boss we come around with safety grams every week or
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:39.440]  so and they were saying that um they want to give us
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:42.880]  blue shots or they're going to set us up to give us blue shots and i'm sitting
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:47.520]  every listening to this going i'm not falling for this i'm not
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:51.600]  going for that and they're like well somebody's like well you don't have to
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:54.720]  take it if you don't want but i'm like well i'm not going to take it
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:58.320]  and another point where they're setting up for the police state is
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:02.080]  all the security around where i work i'm all in
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:07.840]  um digital urban camo uniforms now all this all the police that are on the yard
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:12.560]  everybody they all care and have 16 and they're all in digital camo they're not
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:16.960]  in police uniforms anymore i'm like what the hell is this about
[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:21.920]  are you saying dod police are in the gray uniforms are you saying regular
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:26.160]  police uh the regular yard police that they have
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.080]  that patrol the yard are in the urban digital camo
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.600]  yeah see first they put everybody in the same black top
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:37.280]  to unify the commands and then now they have the police starting to dress like
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.120]  that and we've confirmed they've got army and marine court checkpoints all over
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.760]  the country acclimating the state police to accept this
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:48.880]  i hope this is just more acclimation i hope they're not getting ready to drop
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:52.880]  the hammer it's scary at work it's like what is
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:55.680]  going on in the last few months it's like what is going on around in this
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:59.040]  place and i got brought in because i wore an obama

[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:15.200]  because i've done a lot of research on this and it seems to be very credible
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:18.960]  and for the like the last gentleman who just called in i mean if if you were to
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:23.040]  expose him to some of the research that she's done what's going on in austria

[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:32.480]  and she's a fine lady before she went public we were covering back in january
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:36.960]  and february and march the bird flu that was in bloomberg
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:41.040]  that was in uh the london telegraph it was in the news

[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:52.160]  with some of the vaccine material at in 14 different countries in the check
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:55.680]  republic found it so so we have reported that

[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:09.520]  then that was kind of taken not in a positive way so i just backed off
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:12.560]  because you know when i'm setting guests up and
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:18.640]  uh i'm just going to leave it at that so her info is fine we're glad she's over

[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:55.360]  capitol hill he's been snooping around at the press club and trying to get into
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:59.120]  flu conferences to find out what the game plan really is
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:03.440]  he's going to be coming on the show i got a bunch of video and audio clips when
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:07.200]  we go live next hour at prisonplanet.tv at eight after
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:11.760]  of military people police officers saying yes they're going to have checkpoints
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:15.200]  bracelets that's in the level six plan so they're
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:20.800]  clearly training some police and military and the mps to get ready for this
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:23.840]  but is that just training or are they really going to do it well they're
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:26.560]  going to do it if they can get away with it but the bigger issue is they're
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:31.200]  using the flu as a cover story for all their other political actions
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:35.360]  bob and san diego a medical worker bob they're telling medical workers in new
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:37.920]  york and new jersey they're going to be forced to take the shot are they
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:41.360]  telling you that in uh... california
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:44.000]  uh... i can't really say much here but what i'm going to say is i work for a
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.760]  large hospital in san diego and in the corporate capacity
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:51.200]  um there's no interface between myself and uh
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:55.920]  anyone who's sick i mean but uh... what what the deal is basically uh... we
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:54:58.640]  gotta notice this morning saying that if we don't
[1:54:58.640 --> 1:55:02.160]  take the shot what happens is we have to go to a special class
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:05.440]  that'll show us how to wear uh... these respirators and we have to wear them
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:10.720]  daily to work so uh... you know
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:15.040]  so you have to wear respirators for a flu that's a light flu
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:18.560]  it's it's just all part of fear mongering creating this hypochondriac
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.720]  society but don't worry homeland security will save us
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:26.240]  yeah well i mean i'm a preacher of the choir here i mean i'm not taking it
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.040]  you know i have to wear a mask i have to wear a mask because i just you know i
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:33.840]  don't see it being a good thing what are the other medical workers saying
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:37.200]  uh... there's a few of us you know they're better you know
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.400]  pretty outspoken about it at this point but i mean i just kind of wanted to
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:45.520]  say i mean it's uh... it's like ucsd medical center in san diego it's uh
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.120]  i mean if if you guys want to call up i mean just i think so many of the house
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:50.960]  of these people because it's uh...
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:53.840]  it's a big issue if anyone's called the number six one nine five four three
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:58.160]  six two two two six one nine five four three six two two two
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:03.440]  well it's over fifty five percent of nurses in new york said napole they're
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:06.240]  not going to take it it's higher than that in england
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:09.680]  i mean what what are your co-workers saying they're just going to submit
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.080]  to whatever shots the government says or i'd say ninety five percent yeah i mean
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.440]  i've been 98 percent
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:20.880]  there's a few of us that they're talking about and i i mean i don't think i wonder
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:25.120]  why americans are different i wonder why the brits say no but we say yes
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:30.640]  what happened to us it's been a long road you know i mean it's just
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:35.040]  it's just slowly uh incrementalism like you always say you know that's how it
[1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:38.320]  that's how to pull this off no one even
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:42.080]  no one really even knows what's going on at this point you know it's
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:45.440]  i think you're going to find it's it's more than five percent that are against
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:48.720]  it uh because in new york we're talking over half are saying they're not going
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:51.360]  to take it or who knows there's some type of special
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:56.640]  spell they got over people in california uh it's like another planet but uh
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:01.280]  my god what are your other co-workers saying that don't like it
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:05.680]  well they're pretty much hip to the whole program i mean i mean i mean if you
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:08.960]  learn about one thing you know everything else sort of falls into place
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:12.720]  uh i mean other people listen to your show
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:19.360]  yeah so well god bless you anything anything else you want to add bob
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:22.080]  well they're making the alternative i mean i mean i just i just want to point
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:24.880]  out the alternative is that you have to wear a mask
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:29.920]  to work every day and it's going to be uh i mean that's no fun you know and and
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:32.800]  there's a special class that you have to go to what how to use the mask and
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:37.440]  everything i mean it's yeah next he'll try to make you wear yellow stars
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:45.120]  it's all part of the medical dictatorship just like nazi germany

[1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:01.040]  the flu hysteria that's being generated i want to recap all the top stories on
[2:00:01.040 --> 2:00:05.200]  this front they are clearly attempting to test
[2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:09.360]  the waters to send up a trial balloon for forced inoculations
[2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:15.440]  for checkpoints for mass roundups for arrest
[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:20.160]  and so i'm going to be news blitzing over all of that coming up at the bottom
[2:00:20.160 --> 2:00:24.080]  of the next hour after wane madson and continuing with your phone calls in
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:27.360]  fact right now we're talking to medical workers police
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:31.840]  officers military people defense contractors
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:35.920]  are they getting the same reports that we're getting that police and military
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:38.800]  and select areas are being told to prepare for checkpoints
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:42.000]  and the people haven't had their flu vaccine if they're not wearing their
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:45.680]  special rfid bracelet they are arrested put in
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:48.720]  buses and taken to medical fema camps which has been built all over the
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:52.000]  country let's talk to david in california a
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.600]  firefighter david welcome morning alex how are you
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:00:59.840]  good hey um there are a couple things about this
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:05.760]  uh i just have my firefighter annual physical and stress test done i got to
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:09.600]  talk to some of the industrial health nurses at the local hospital where they
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:12.320]  do this well being too obvious i just brought it up in
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.600]  conversation with a few of me on what have you heard about this that type
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:18.400]  thing because i've heard nothing through the department
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:22.800]  um and most of my fellow firefighters have said that they won't take it that
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:28.320]  they'll take a walk before they do so the ones that are asleep
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:31.840]  say no if i can use that term the ones that
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:34.480]  are pretty much awake and know what's going on
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:38.880]  they uh i'm sorry the ones that are asleep will take it
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:42.160]  the ones that are awake say they see through the plan
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:47.040]  but i'm in a small rural area so maybe it hasn't gotten here yet
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:50.640]  and i had a physical with my doctor that said the other day and he said he
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:54.320]  wouldn't take it so getting kind of mixed signals don't
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:56.960]  really can't tell at this point what's going on
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:00.240]  like you said it looks like they're testing the water is what they're doing
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:02.880]  to see gauging reaction or how that you know
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:06.400]  people are going to react in the end well i agree with you this is the way
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:10.960]  they can grandstand be the saviors sell tens of billions of dollars in vaccine
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:14.480]  target the helpless people in government that have trouble saying no
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:18.000]  target the children get all these mothers who want to save their kids
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:22.960]  running out to get the shots and then also gauge the cover-up of all the
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:27.120]  damage the vaccine and deaths that undoubtedly is going to cause
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:31.360]  uh i think that's what this is a giant beta test towards something bigger in
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:34.720]  the future but they've lined up so many assets
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:37.520]  that we have to take this very very serious
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:41.200]  clearly i'm not i'm not downplaying at all oh no i'm not either i'm just saying
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:46.080]  we don't know yeah neither do i i i know a lot of local police
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:49.600]  officers and the ones that i'm close with i asked them you know have you
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:52.640]  heard anything about you know roadblocks or house to house searches
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:56.880]  the ones i know personally say well they're really not saying too much or
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:00.560]  kind of keeping us in the dark the ones that i know that i'm not close with
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:04.640]  just kind of shut up and say nothing so you can read into that what you want
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:08.240]  i think that's not a good sign you know some people know something and some
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:11.360]  people don't some just don't want to talk about it so
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:14.320]  so the local cops can't even talk to a fireman
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:18.800]  because you might be al-qaeda that's what america's turned into it's so pathetic
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:22.400]  you know but we trust these foreign banks to run all our money and control us
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:26.000]  but oh my gosh we can't trust the local fireman he's evil
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:29.040]  yeah well they don't yeah we don't know you that well so you're not in our
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:32.480]  inner circle so just be mom about it
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:37.520]  i won't take the shot i know most of my my fellow firefighters want so that's
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:40.400]  where we're at
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:43.520]  all right sir god bless you thanks for the info

[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:06.320]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:09.600]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate

[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:17.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:20.960]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:24.160]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:27.520]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:31.120]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.360]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again

[2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:45.920]  visual not just on the radio thank you so much
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:50.320]  for joining us so for this segment we've got wane madson of wane madson report
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:52.640]  on with us he's been trying to get into the flu
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:56.640]  conferences he's been beating the pavement in dc in maryland
[2:07:56.640 --> 2:08:00.080]  with intel about what they're planning with the flu
[2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:03.120]  now they're announcing body bags in the us
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:07.840]  in canada with the flu shipments under level six flu pandemic they admit they
[2:08:07.840 --> 2:08:11.120]  can set up checkpoints have martial law under un treaty
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:15.440]  that's in the news we are getting reports from military and police
[2:08:15.440 --> 2:08:20.000]  in one case at an event the joist rally was that with a police officer
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:23.760]  saying they'll set up checkpoints arrest people take them on buses to fema camp
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:28.160]  so they won't take the shots that is in the executive order to arrest you if
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:32.080]  you refuse they're doing weird amber alerts on the
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:36.560]  billboard systems at different pharmacies here in austin
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  running reports about kidnap kids and all-cymer patients they're not just on
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:44.240]  the big government billboards now so they're testing that takeover grid
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:48.240]  is this just a cover to get the health care bill passed to get the
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:52.400]  the quote financial reform bill passed giving the banks more power
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:56.160]  is it a political cover is it a federalization drill we've confirmed
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:08:59.120]  people getting the flu shot are being put in a database that they've had it
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:02.480]  that's the beginning of in this case or in the future
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:05.280]  are creating a database of who's had it and who
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:09.360]  has for quarantines police in major states
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:13.280]  are lobbying and states are passing laws to go along with the feds
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:17.200]  for force inoculation arresting people going in homes
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:21.200]  that's the basic intel on that wane madson uh... what are you hearing along
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:22.720]  those lines
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:27.360]  well i'll tell you that the the the fact is that uh... i've been looking at
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:31.040]  where this flu came from and i can report
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:33.760]  uh... on your show for the first time
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:37.600]  that while the united states government won't look into this uh...
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:42.000]  uh... the the part of the funding for this research into this
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.720]  swine flu h1n1 came from the government of japan now with a new
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:50.160]  government there uh... a prime minister happy yama
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:54.320]  uh... hopefully they might as one of their first steps
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:58.240]  uh... uh... but uh... investigate the funding
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:02.400]  of this research where they got the cna out of this
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:05.840]  a woman who died in nineteen eighteen four in alaska
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:09.680]  and how this was uh... uh... that they could basically constructed in a
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:13.040]  laboratory the word i get from the research community
[2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:16.640]  definitely this did not happen naturally this was
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:21.600]  uh... manufactured in a laboratory environment
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:24.800]  wane specifically we talked to you a few weeks ago you were going to try to get
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:30.000]  into that secretive uh... flu symposium we got the cover
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.880]  sheet for its saying mass graves fatalities quarantine
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:38.160]  uh... one of our people got in we've now got the documents that printing them
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:41.920]  off for me the the details of the meeting but he was kicked out
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:44.080]  were you able to get into that flu conference
[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:47.760]  i i was able to get into the flu conference there was one
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:51.920]  uh... anomaly there was an individual who was there uh... from the city of
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:55.200]  new york the uh... medical examiner's office
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:59.680]  we had a lot of some sort of special uh... investigation unit for nine
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:03.840]  eleven believe it or not and when he found out that the press was
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:09.200]  uh... invited to the conference he basically picked up that you said
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:14.720]  you know i i i don't want i i don't mind uh... comment uh... recorded
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:17.280]  he had his uh... presentation on uh...
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:19.600]  come drive his power point he
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:22.880]  plug it in he took it out there were no handouts
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:23.920]  nothing
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:27.680]  uh... nothing uh... from his uh... presentation
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:29.520]  so this guy's
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:33.520]  subject was mass fatality management and uh...
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:36.080]  apparently he's been going around the country
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:40.880]  uh... giving uh... various uh... the talks at various seminars but
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:45.520]  uh... it was quite clear that in that particular case that particular subject
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:52.320]  was considered some sort of uh... you know top secret
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:56.560]  wayne what's the big picture here what do you think's really going on
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:01.200]  well but you know it we've been i have to say we've been through this before
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:06.480]  but we have the anthrax uh... a case of course anthrax is is a
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:11.520]  uh... is a bacteria uh... it uh... it's not
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:16.080]  uh... spread from person to person but that we never had a full investigation
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:20.640]  of that now with it and we know that the the strain came out of for detrick
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:26.080]  now we know what this particular h1n1 uh... that it was uh... recombinant
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:30.720]  it was a recombinant uh... of uh... the two forms of human
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:35.280]  flu two forms of swine flu and one form of avian flu
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:39.280]  and that it was constructed in a laboratory
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:43.680]  uh... there's obvious involvement by the armed forces pathology institute in
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:50.640]  rothill maryland uh... very likely uh... also uh... for detrick and
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:54.400]  uh... two particular research centers were heavily involved the university
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.040]  wisconsin at madison and the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:03.520]  manitoba so uh... this is this is uh... there's a much
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:06.880]  information out there from the research community
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:10.960]  that this was a man-made violence the question is
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:16.240]  to what uh... intent and uh... with the way to enrich these four
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:20.240]  uh... vaccine manufacturers because the vaccine was recently approved by the
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:24.640]  food and drug administration uh... and if that's what it is this is a
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:29.840]  this is a this is a potential major criminal case
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:33.760]  incredible now dick army and i'm
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:37.680]  no fan of dick army of the bush years but he's come out the dallas morning news
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:41.360]  and said this may be used as a cover to get government health care
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:44.560]  and to get other legislation passed during the hysteria
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:48.080]  if they almost brought the country to its knees for a few dozen deaths
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:53.360]  in uh... april from the h1n1 what is going to happen is normal deaths
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:57.440]  happen by the tens of thousands this flu season that's now kicked off
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:00.480]  uh... do you see this being used as a political cover
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:04.400]  uh... actually it's going to take so long to implement any sort of health care
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:09.280]  program that this is this is going to have this is very similar to the 1918
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:13.200]  virus the 1918 virus actually uh... like this one
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:18.800]  um... it started there were k there was a bit of a surge in the spring of 1918
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:21.840]  then in the end of at the end of september in
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:24.800]  october it peaked in a very big way
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:28.480]  uh... killing millions of people around the world uh... it uh...
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:32.320]  it spread uh... uh... there was one individual at the swine flu conference
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:36.400]  here who was a director of emergency services for oklahoma it was very
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:40.640]  interesting what he had to say he went back to the city archive in oklahoma
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:41.600]  city
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:42.320]  and look
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:45.200]  uh... at at how this was spread back then it was
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:48.800]  uh... that uh... it first there were reports and without a philadelphia
[2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:53.440]  boston and new york troops were coming back from world war one from the front
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:57.680]  they were heading back to the west coast by train going through oklahoma city
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:01.520]  and that's how it spread and it killed a thousand of people in oklahoma city
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:05.680]  when uh... they first had people get the flu the city fathers of oklahoma city
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:13.360]  said i was just a big case of hay fever until they realized how bad this was
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:14.400]  so
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:19.280]  is it just to make money for the vaccine makers is it a federalization drill
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:22.720]  uh... we've got reports and they say under level six they can run checkpoints
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:26.160]  force quarantine they are keeping records of who gets the shot
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:29.440]  to create that database for who's complied and who hasn't
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:33.680]  bottom line what do you see happening well there were two things at the swine flu
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:37.760]  conference one thing from them from the medical professionals that their big
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:41.600]  thing was educate the public let them know what the deal is
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:45.600]  then there were these femur types in the military types in the
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:49.520]  uh... the emergency services people and there was
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:53.840]  you know we have to be prepared for riots at the at the vaccination stations
[2:15:53.840 --> 2:15:58.080]  uh... force quarantine they did talk about checkpoints for
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:01.920]  at various travel hubs uh... so there are two things
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:04.960]  um... with the the medical professionals certainly
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:08.400]  uh... didn't seem like they were buying off on all that business
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:11.760]  but the uh... you know the female types the homelands security types are all
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:14.880]  present by the way and they're always wanting to expand their control in
[2:16:14.880 --> 2:16:18.000]  their mandate and then the flu is perfect to make the american people the
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.640]  enemy and that was in the cover sheet about
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:23.120]  quarantines we're now getting the internal documents
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:25.840]  here in just a moment we're gonna put some of them on screen as well
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:28.960]  you're saying that they're trying to use it for police state
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:32.960]  but the people aren't buying yeah they were excited to hear i have to say
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:35.280]  we're jumping at the good but you know saying
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:39.760]  well you know if we have rioting at the uh... vaccination stations uh...
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:43.040]  uh... you know in all this business uh... they they were talking about
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:46.960]  invoking their quote unquote protocols for this type of
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:50.960]  uh... development whereas the public health people the people from the
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:54.000]  medical community i got to this thing compression
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:57.680]  uh... they're not they're not sitting off of the same song sheet they're saying
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:00.080]  what we have to educate the public about this
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:05.520]  particular flu and don't hold anything back full transparency and that you what
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:07.840]  was certainly we weren't getting that from the
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:11.520]  emergency services the plane went to carry people were you able to get out of
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:14.800]  the conference with this the internal
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:20.160]  uh... report from the swine flu secretive conference
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.240]  i i i said in several of the presentations and uh... took notes the
[2:17:24.240 --> 2:17:27.200]  only the only one as i said where there was a
[2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:32.560]  there was an opposition to the press being there with this guy from new york
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:35.600]  city who was discussing mass pickality management
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:40.000]  who apparently uh... dealt with the nine eleven our guy william said that said
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:43.600]  that he saw him there was thrown out we now have the youtube video of our
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:46.960]  reporter or a fellow there doing reporting for us getting thrown out
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:50.720]  did you see that happen i didn't do it but i i did talk to the kind of the
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:54.800]  conference organizers by the way that the the play of the uh... company that
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:17:59.120]  organizes conferences is uh... is an hour bone company they're based
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:02.240]  apparently out of dubai in the united arab Emirates so
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:06.400]  uh... but uh... uh... uh... uh... is that is the reaction the reaction even by
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:09.280]  the organizers to this guy from new york city was
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:14.000]  uh... you know they said that they did that was very peculiar

[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:21.760]  uh... we're going to be going over all of this

[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:36.160]  uh... well i i i i i we were expecting this to pick up as it did in 1918 in
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:38.400]  october probably the first week
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:42.320]  it'll pick but we're always being surges in places like minnesota
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:46.720]  washington state college and you're saying the intel is this is man made and
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:48.320]  being done by design
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:53.120]  this was man made absolutely this is coming from a top birologist who spent
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:57.760]  the last since he first showed up in mexico has been spending
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:03.120]  just stay there stay there okay stay there
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:06.400]  how many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or

[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:16.640]  a bother to carry that was then this is now

[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:14.800]  coming up in the next segment we're gonna go to dr conrad in utah dr darin in
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:18.640]  kansas bill in los angeles matt in the uk ronnie
[2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:21.680]  in texas we're needing your intel what you're hearing
[2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:25.120]  about force inoculations quarantines it's all in the executive order
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:28.960]  the government says they may implement it we're looking for signs that they
[2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:33.600]  are going to or are they not going to
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:37.280]  this whole thing is staged that much is clear the question is what is the full
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:41.040]  extent of that and i have two video clips we're going to play before we go to
[2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:43.760]  those calls but everybody stay there because i want to talk to you
[2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:48.160]  but i've got to get to these clips now and that's a video clip
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:51.840]  after we talked to wane madson of a lady who says she's in the military training
[2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:55.360]  with the chips in california for quarantines and checkpoints
[2:23:55.360 --> 2:23:58.080]  we checked out all her info we're trying to get her on
[2:23:58.080 --> 2:24:03.200]  but the transponder tracker she talks about that have those have been issued
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:06.960]  the army and marine corps working with chips in checkpoints we confirmed that
[2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:11.840]  four months ago we didn't know why very illegal
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:15.520]  uh and so that's what's so scary then we have a texas peace officer saying the
[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:20.160]  same thing from a month and a half ago in a video so those are coming up
[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:23.680]  first her clip then the calls then to the other clip
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:28.800]  uh let's go ahead and go back to wane madson wane
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:31.920]  you went to the conference you got there you saw this you confirmed a lot of
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:35.600]  what our other reporter was saying who was there and then got kicked out
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:38.720]  and saying that the guy from 9 11 was getting very agitated over reporters
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:42.080]  being there and one of them gone that's why he said he was kicked out
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:45.840]  you are saying though and you said this first here and then it came out in the
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:49.760]  bbc scientists say they believe h1n1 has been manufactured
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:53.040]  but you're saying manufactured and released deliberately
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:56.480]  to just make money on vaccines or is this something bigger
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:01.120]  well for what i understand from a person in the research community
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:06.320]  is spending all the time looking at where this came from
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:10.160]  they may have used a human guinea pig to actually use
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:14.240]  what's called they call it the mixing vessel they couldn't use a pig because
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.400]  it didn't come from pigs to humans it didn't come from birds to humans
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:23.360]  it came human to human that a human may have been the mixing vessel for this
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:28.960]  particular uh pandemic and uh if that is possibly that
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:32.560]  was an individual in mexico because they were the first cases
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:36.960]  we saw out of mexico in the spring and uh but
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:40.640]  all focus should be on the little inuit village of fort brevick alaska
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:44.640]  because that's where the courts of a woman a young woman who died
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.960]  in 1918 she was quite obese so there was usable tissue because she was
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:54.400]  basically frozen in a permafrost that those tissue samples were taken to the
[2:25:54.400 --> 2:25:57.600]  armed forces pathology institute in rockville maryland
[2:25:57.600 --> 2:26:02.080]  and i mean this is this is the ground zero is a is that little
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:05.600]  inuit village uh it's apparently the village elders
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:09.600]  at first when they went up there to get samples
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:13.760]  uh they they also went to spitsburg and in norway but they didn't find anything
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:18.000]  there so they were actually looking for samples of the 1918 flu
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:21.600]  they brought this dead virus back to life and we've been talking about that
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:25.360]  for a decade a lot of people have have really been concerned about that and
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:28.720]  and the virologist as you said the genetic engineers are saying it looks
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:33.360]  like it was engineered from that what's the goal then do they want to release
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:36.960]  something that kills a billion people so that they can reduce population what's
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:40.640]  the point of this well i mean if you look at this from a purely
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:44.480]  uh but you know criminal investigation standpoint you've got
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:47.440]  uh the company spending to make a bundle of money
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.040]  on the vaccines uh you obviously you know you've got
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:54.800]  uh but rather that uh the you know issues here
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:27:00.480]  uh being that this is man-made so where where the investigation and and
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:04.000]  now that i found out that part of the research was funded by the japanese
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.440]  government hopefully the new prime minister who's not
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:11.360]  believe me if this is the first non oligarch party
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:15.200]  government in japan since the end of world war two except for one brief time
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:18.880]  uh the new party over there is is full of a lot of reformists
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:23.920]  uh prime minister hana yama and his government is is in a better position
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:27.840]  investigate this i think than than our administration yeah the number three
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:30.560]  guy in the japanese government's been on this show now
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:35.280]  and he believes nine elevens an inside job that's right the jet is a democratic
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:37.840]  party of japan it's a lot of center government
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:40.880]  uh they don't buy into the keyless propaganda
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:44.400]  and uh being that there is a japanese went to this
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:47.680]  i think uh they're they stand a much better chance to
[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:51.600]  uh look at this from their end because there was money that went into this
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:56.560]  research from the japanese government but it appears this flu is not that
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:28:00.400]  deadly so that's connected to the old super flu
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:05.680]  uh again something's weird here a lot better for some and not for others i mean
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:08.960]  what was it last week a 11 year old girl came home from
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.800]  uh school on a thursday six she was bed on sunday
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.320]  on their pre-existing conditions that's another protocol i think they're putting
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:20.560]  in place saying yeah no no that the flu of 1918 as you know killed young healthy
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:25.120]  people with the hemorrhagic autoimmune response uh in the lungs wow well

[2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:08.400]  hey everybody i want to say hello to all my subscribers and my friends
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:12.000]  i finally got myself situated in our new home
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:15.920]  and i'm back online now and everything's a okay
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:19.200]  hey um there's something i need to put out this morning and i've been praying
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:23.200]  about it now for a couple days because i wasn't sure if the lord wanted me to
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:26.720]  put it out and if he did and i didn't know if i should send it to someone
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:31.280]  else and have them put it out and um i've contacted a few of you
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:35.360]  and gave you this kind of stuff hoping that you would put this stuff out
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:40.400]  but um i haven't seen it so i don't think that i can wait
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:45.200]  any longer i was reading from proverbs 15 today
[2:32:45.200 --> 2:32:50.720]  and it happened to mention in there about um putting some sort of knowledge out
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:53.280]  i can't quote it right now my bible's in the other room
[2:32:53.280 --> 2:33:03.840]  so well let's go i'm just gonna tell you
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:09.280]  so here's the thing guys am i nervous about putting this
[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:14.960]  information out yes do i think that it might call some
[2:33:14.960 --> 2:33:18.080]  harm to me yes
[2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:24.080]  these are one of those situations where you must ask god
[2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:28.480]  and pray read it really hard should i do this or should i not
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:34.400]  but if i don't do it some lives could be lost and i i really
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:37.760]  don't want to see that happen you can't see my heart right now but it's beating
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:42.960]  a thousand times a minute okay um
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:50.560]  i went away this weekend for a drill and found out some interesting information
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:54.000]  okay um some of the guys that drilled with me
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:34:00.480]  happen to be chp officers uh la county sheriffs and
[2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:07.040]  and uh la pd and some of the stuff that they were putting out to us
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:12.240]  or at least to my friend he was putting out some things that about
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:19.280]  how they're training right now on um running roadblocks
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:22.000]  quarantine
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:29.120]  and there's a video that was out recently that talked about shackles
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:33.600]  that uh it's actually a bracelet that gets put on your right hand
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:37.360]  and somehow pinned into your hand and it's meant to stay there
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:44.640]  forever and it tells them that you've taken the swine flu vaccine
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:48.960]  and if you don't have a bracelet you'll be given the opportunity at the
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:52.320]  checkpoint to take the swine flu vaccine
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:56.880]  and if you don't take it you'll be boarded onto a bus
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:00.000]  to a concentration camp
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:05.600]  what bothers me is a good number of the people
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:10.880]  are unaware of this and the people that
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:14.480]  some of the people that i spoke to isn't really concerned
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:18.480]  they'll just go ahead and take the swine flu vaccine
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:21.520]  um
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:26.160]  i don't know why the information is not getting out to everybody
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.400]  somehow they think that by taking the swine flu vaccine they could avoid
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:37.200]  um going to this these camps they could avoid
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:42.080]  any harsh penalties but i'm telling you now you take the swine flu vaccine
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:48.000]  then you have already condemned yourself all right
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:52.320]  we're gonna play the rest of it next hour it's up on info wars.com
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:55.360]  but i'm not just going off what this lady's saying
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:36:00.000]  with the military training with police it's separately in all these other
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:03.760]  news articles that they are training for quarantines checkpoints
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:08.880]  lockdowns bracelets i don't know about this thing about it being attached to you
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:12.000]  i think the point is if you don't have that you go to the prison camp
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.800]  look at this this is out of the scotsman the big paper in scotland
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:19.520]  scottish government prepares thousands of cardboard coffins for pandemic mass
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:24.960]  graves national post out of canada yesterday
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:32.000]  body bags with flu vaccine shipments there's the national post right there
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:39.040]  cbs has this propaganda piece where the talking head gets her toxic vaccination
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:43.120]  live on tv i'm going to play this four minute clip
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:50.320]  of a texas police officer at a public event tois riley's there
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.840]  greg uh evenson talking about it then we're going to go to the next
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:58.480]  clip after that let's go play these back to back and we're
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:02.640]  going to go to the callers uh with cbs little two minute clip
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:07.040]  where they're doing the stunt of the anchor getting the shot live on tv
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:10.800]  so they're really gearing up and if we don't gear up and speak out against
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:14.640]  this they may go ahead and go forward with martial law and congressman are
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:18.880]  talking about this happening as well so let's go ahead and go to the next clip
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:22.640]  behind you this last january and i thank god i did
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:27.600]  you wrote an article this last july 29th i will never forget it
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.960]  and there was an excerpt in the article that alarmed me and not much surprises me
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:37.760]  anymore regarding the swine flu and the military
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:42.080]  implementing the military to help out and in the article
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:46.000]  i know you don't reveal your sources but i'd like you to elaborate
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:49.840]  about the metal shackles they're going to put on the wrists
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:53.760]  with the computer chip and maybe Catherine Albrecht you can
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:38:00.560]  add to that comment unfortunately i believe one of them
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:04.480]  several plans to ensure that the government's
[2:38:04.480 --> 2:38:10.160]  edict of mandated vaccinations and by the way the state of Oklahoma
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:14.880]  last week passed through its house just such a law
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:17.920]  state of Oklahoma and its residents said everyone
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:21.920]  will be vaccinated in the state of Oklahoma
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:26.080]  now having said that there are also plans that will
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:31.840]  ensure that you do not freely travel nor will you be able to
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:37.520]  really go anywhere without proof that you have had the vaccination at the
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:42.160]  point that the government mandates that certain levels of the population
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:46.560]  take the inoculation when that happens
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:50.480]  i have been told by state troopers across the country
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.000]  that there are plans ready to be implemented
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:57.760]  that would include roadblocks at choke points as we call them
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:02.000]  major interstate junctions around major cities and so forth where the
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:07.200]  greatest number of people can be held until they are
[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:13.920]  either they either prove their vaccination by papers or
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:18.080]  in the case of a medical specialist in milwaukee wisconsin who told me
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:23.840]  that they had observed a semi-tractor trailer being unloaded at the hospital
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:29.360]  loading dock pallets and pallets scores of cases
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:35.680]  of metal bracelets and once put on wouldn't slip into a place and be
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:39.040]  either uh picked in there with some kind of
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:43.360]  device to hold it in place but the band was meant to be
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:49.360]  permanent on top is a chip that chip will include all kinds of
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:54.400]  information about you and the fact that you have been inoculated
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:59.520]  now this is one of several plans it has not yet seen the light of day but it is
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:04.080]  there it's in readiness you choose the poison
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:07.680]  it's either slow homicide or slow suicide
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:10.880]  they're either going to kill you with the injection or if you go up and say
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:13.360]  sure i just want to be able to go wherever i want to go
[2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:17.120]  and you take it to me that's virtual suicide
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:21.680]  just slow motion suicide so we've all talked about
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:26.320]  not getting the vaccination that's clear but you may not have a choice
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:31.440]  i am told that the plans include buses that will be standing by for people in
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:35.440]  roadblocks and refuse to take the inoculation
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.200]  the people will then be escorted to the buses and taken as i was told
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:42.640]  in the state i was in at that time when i was speaking to the troopers
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:47.680]  you're going to get a free ride to an ice warm buck at fort riley
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:53.760]  well it it's one of several plans we can't know until they're implemented
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:59.840]  but i assure you that those plans are in place and law enforcement is going to
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:03.360]  be pulled in and one of the articles i wrote i said the law enforcement
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.120]  community will enforce the new world order
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:10.960]  there will be many that will not and that's good news for us
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:15.920]  but i believe it's still a majority that will be standing in line saying
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:21.920]  get your shot or get on the bus that's what's coming
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:25.760]  in this morning's flu watch it seems like everyone's talking about the h1n1
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:30.720]  virus lately but the regular flu season fast approaching and our dr jennifer
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:35.360]  ashton is about to get her annual vaccination right here
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.280]  good morning good morning harry all right we're still waiting for the h1n1
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.560]  vaccine to become available mid to late october correct
[2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:46.560]  this is not that this is the regular flu vaccine regular flu vaccine which
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:49.920]  started to come out a couple of weeks ago it will be gradually being made
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:52.880]  available pharmacies hospitals doctors offices
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:57.840]  very important for us to remember the seasonal flu kills about 36 000 americans
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:00.880]  every year 90 percent of those are so are older
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:03.440]  people are those with chronic medical conditions
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:07.200]  and now because of this flu season being so important
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:10.960]  certain states including our state new york state are actually making it
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:15.360]  mandatory for health care workers right to get vaccinated against both seasonal
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:20.160]  flu and h1n1 so enna olivera is here she's my
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:23.600]  medical assistant in my office and she's going to give me the flu shot and
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:26.480]  a couple of things that are important for people to know first of all it does
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.520]  not contain live virus so you cannot get the flu from getting the flu shot
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:35.920]  it does take for this flu shot to be effective about two weeks
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:41.040]  until you get the antibody protection she's very good
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:45.200]  and it is very very important especially for health care workers because
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:48.240]  traditionally only about 40 percent of health care workers
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:53.680]  get vaccinated and we are excellent we are the vectors of spread for this
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:56.160]  virus right in addition you don't want your doctor
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:00.080]  himself or herself to be sick so very important for health care workers we
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:03.840]  should strive for close to 100 percent compliance there you go and it just gets
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:07.920]  your shot yet yes that's okay you guys are covered you
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:11.840]  guys are covered very impressed way to go and this is the regular flu shot
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:15.440]  regular flu shot you can get your pharmacy your doctor's office hospital
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:18.800]  there you go and we'll talk more about h1n1 when it becomes available
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:22.960]  next month Jennifer action thanks so much up now that's next Tuesday
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:27.280]  September 22nd here on the show that is the brainwashing
[2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:32.160]  that is going on out there as people run out and get last year's flu shot
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:36.160]  getting ready to get the new flu shot and Reuters is putting out propaganda
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:38.560]  saying oh there'll be a bunch of deaths every year
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:43.280]  one million heart attacks 700,000 strokes 900,000 miscarriages
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:47.840]  yet this year they know a significant number will be blamed on h1n1 vaccine
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:51.120]  which will roll out within weeks and they're struggling to be ready
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:54.400]  they expect an avalanche of so-called adverse event reports
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:57.040]  which are report of deaths illnesses or other
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:00.960]  health trauma that occur within weeks of receiving treatment in one case
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:05.840]  in this case the swine flu vaccine so they're preemptively saying
[2:44:05.840 --> 2:44:08.240]  if you have a bad reaction we're just going to say it's
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:14.320]  didn't cause by the vaccine this is amazing level of mind control
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:20.080]  let's go to dr Conrad in Utah you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:26.880]  hello Alex can you hear me yes sir the one of the reasons why we were in such
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:30.880]  a dire situation right now is even if the powers that be
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:33.840]  get a kind of a feel that there might be too much of a public backlash against
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:37.120]  some of these extreme measures such as martial law or
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:40.560]  involuntary incarceration the fact of the matter is that
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:45.840]  so many of the people are just are propagandized to the extent that they
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.560]  believe that vaccines are the intelligent thing to do and they're just
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:51.680]  going to roll up their sleeve and and it's going to be devastating
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:56.480]  for so very very many people i i'm not sure if
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:44:59.920]  rob got some information through to you yet today he said he was going to be
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:02.480]  actually emailed me and asked me to call into the show i've been working with
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:07.600]  rob for a while on a tool to help viralize the truth
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:12.000]  about vaccinations and you know the problem is
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:16.160]  i think that a good portion of your listeners alex probably know the truth
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:18.800]  about vaccinations just from listening to your show
[2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:22.720]  but the problem is is that it is so difficult and i know from 20 plus years
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:24.880]  of experience i've known for 20 plus years that
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:28.640]  that vaccinations are a fraud that they don't work and that they're dangerous
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:32.960]  but i also know how difficult it is for the average person to be able to
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:36.960]  quickly convince their friend about that because they are so indoctrinated
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:40.880]  so i came up with a simple tool that is very powerful and effective
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:44.560]  that can quickly convince someone of the okay what is it tell us
[2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:48.640]  it's uh... it's an article that was published on info wars dot com
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:52.640]  august 18th called they want to inject my kid with what
[2:45:52.640 --> 2:45:56.240]  and if people want to go to youtube and do a search
[2:45:56.240 --> 2:46:00.720]  for interview dot no we actually posted it it's it's it's on
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:04.160]  prisonplanet.com it's dozens of links i guess you put this
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:08.000]  together it's great they want to inject my kids with what here it is we'll zoom
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:11.600]  in on that and it says uh... video presentation by barbara
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:16.080]  low fisher president in v i c national vaccine information center
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:20.480]  and it just has clip after clip of all the admissions about how deadly they are
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:23.920]  uh... and all the different cancer cells that are in it how it's made from
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:27.200]  dead baby parts yes this is amazing data page
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:30.720]  did you put this together or did one of our guys do this so i know i did it
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:34.160]  and uh... it was published august 18th but then it kind of got buried in the
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:37.920]  archive section at what my idea was was for there to be a little link to it on
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:40.240]  the info wars dot com and the prisonplanet
[2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:44.560]  i guess would be good for your listeners to be directed to because that way
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:47.840]  with a click of a mouse they can send it to all their contacts and within 20
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:50.480]  minutes each of their contacts if they have a brain in their head or any
[2:46:50.480 --> 2:46:53.040]  goodness in them whatsoever are absolutely convinced
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:56.320]  that vaccines don't work anyway in their day we have millions of listeners and
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:46:59.360]  hundreds of thousands of people on the site every day
[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:02.960]  and yes i was marveling over how good this was
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:06.640]  how well put together they want to inject my kids with what four pages of
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:10.560]  links and documents from the cdc all the admissions
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.080]  the mercury the squalene what it does
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:18.400]  they want to inject my kids with what just a search engine that
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:21.840]  and it's up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet dot com
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:25.680]  and thank you for putting this page together yeah the thing about it is
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:28.800]  alexis if most if people just go to a general
[2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:32.400]  website they're so overwhelmed with information they just get bogged down
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:35.440]  and it's tedious and they kind of give up i hear you we got to work on getting
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:39.200]  you on again later it's a great idea i do want to move on because i want to get
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:42.960]  medical workers police military that's why we open the phones up at one eight
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:46.400]  hundred two five at nine ninety two thirty one
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:50.160]  uh i want them to call in and are you getting ready for checkpoints are you
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:53.200]  getting ready for quarantines we know the feds say they have that option on the
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:55.760]  table but are you being told it's going to happen
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:58.960]  like this woman in the army training with the chips
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:03.520]  because we know that's going on how widespread is this dr darin calling from
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:07.680]  kansas go ahead dr darin hey alex i'd like to first thank you for
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:12.160]  waking me up a few months ago i've been in the health care for about 20 years now
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:17.120]  i want to share a personal experience i had in the military in 1990 when they
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:20.880]  came out with these some of these crazy shots containing squalene
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.800]  and i had a reaction to one and it will definitely cause you problems later on
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:31.680]  not a separate from a a rash for a man i had to go to the hospital and everything
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:34.880]  you know by the way i mean as you know the military admits
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:38.240]  the squalene and the anthrax shots caused horrible problems that
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:42.720]  that's not debated definitely definitely and you know now i have a lupus type
[2:48:42.720 --> 2:48:46.160]  rash when i go out in the sun it's real strange and made of american had kind
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:49.200]  of a brown skin but yeah i get this really a
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:52.080]  real rash on my body my arms everywhere even one
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:56.080]  even the heat from the shower causes it now you know it's been 20 years ago so
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:58.960]  this stuff will stay in your body you can't wash it out
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:03.760]  there's no way um i haven't suffered any neurological effects from or anything
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:07.280]  like that but my point was the day i was calling them
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:11.600]  i was getting some passport photos a few days ago called walgreens to see you
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.120]  know what they could do of course they give them and the first thing they
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:18.160]  will ask is you know this is walgreens can we set
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:20.880]  you up for your flu shot today and i was like

[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:29.440]  on the phone says well no i don't so i begin to tell them about

[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:37.200]  and this young kid was like blown away so he had to transfer me to somebody else

[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:56.000]  preservatives and i said it's simply the marisol and then you know she finally
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.720]  admitted stay there i want to hear more about this on the other side and we're

[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:07.440]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[2:52:07.440 --> 2:52:10.800]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:14.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:17.360]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[2:52:17.360 --> 2:52:20.640]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:23.520]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:26.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[2:52:26.640 --> 2:52:30.160]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:37.120]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:40.160]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[2:52:40.160 --> 2:52:44.720]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[2:52:58.080 --> 2:53:01.760]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for
[2:53:01.760 --> 2:53:05.040]  survivalseedbank.com
[2:53:31.920 --> 2:53:37.200]  I had three guests set up today that weren't flu-related and I
[2:53:37.200 --> 2:53:39.840]  realized this is just coming down on us right now
[2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:44.160]  and I want to open the phones up specifically for military
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:48.640]  specifically for police specifically for medical workers with any intel on
[2:53:48.640 --> 2:53:52.560]  preparations for possible quarantines checkpoints
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:55.520]  lockdowns now Wayland Jennings son who's a great
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:54:00.640]  musician in his own right uh is a fan of the show a patriot
[2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:04.080]  he's on the road to just pop in about 20 30 minutes the next hour but the last
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:07.840]  20 30 minutes of the show I'm just taking calls not just for
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:10.800]  medical doctors or people who are against the flu shot
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:15.760]  specifically for whistleblowers on that issue so be ready for that
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:21.040]  1-800-259-9231 all right Dr. Darren in Kansas finish up the
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:24.160]  point you call Walgreens you're trying to explain to the person on the other
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:27.760]  line what's in the shots go ahead well they seem you know literally
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:32.080]  based on the first like I said before um a little bit receptive to it when I
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:35.760]  just asked them point blank I said you know mercury is a poison heavy metal
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:39.040]  that can kill you you know you touch it it can absorb whatever
[2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:43.120]  um you would inject that in your body us would you let your child drink that
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:47.600]  no but you'd inject this in your body and the thing is uh Walgreens
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:51.280]  has pushed this for a couple weeks now they've already vaccinated over a
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:55.440]  million folks already and you know they only did 1.2
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:55:02.480]  million according you know uh sir is s u r c h u r is a website I found
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:05.840]  and it just gives some statistics over that but they've already done almost
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:08.560]  what they've done in the whole entire season last year
[2:55:08.560 --> 2:55:11.840]  so what are they getting out of this and why are they pushing it you know this
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:15.120]  is this is something that's not right and this was just an out of a booty
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:18.640]  thing that you know raised this red flag with me and yes they do put your
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:21.360]  information in a database I asked them what blank
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:25.520]  they do that and that's the first step towards having and that's crazy
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:28.720]  that's the first step towards quarantines knowing who and
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:32.080]  who and who has and who hasn't had the shot
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:34.960]  and what is it what's their business you know what's it the government's
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:38.000]  business whether what you do with your health period you know this is a
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:41.280]  private thing between you and your doctor they're trying to federalize
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:43.920]  the micro manager every bit of our lives from
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:48.000]  you know from child support to vaccinations and it gets crazy
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.160]  we need to stop this somehow we need to let them know you know we have to
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:56.720]  you know go absolutely but we're under Darren continue to call in
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:55:59.440]  as things develop god bless you i'm gonna try to hurry now
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:02.640]  through some more calls we got a short segment coming up before shooter
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:07.280]  Jennings joins us specifically and then after he leaves
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:12.000]  this for people that have any info on the quarantines of the mass arrest
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.800]  we know they're putting it in databases we know the government's admitting they
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:19.280]  may do quarantines and checkpoints the question is police are they telling you
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:22.560]  that they think they're going to do this or are they training you right now
[2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:29.840]  give us the information this all our lives depends on this so 1-800-259-9231
[2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:33.600]  want to put one plug in here before we end this hour
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:37.280]  we have an online video bookstore that's how we support this operation very

[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:04.480]  electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:08.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:12.160]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:16.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:19.920]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:23.520]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again

[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:24.800]  okay let's go to bill in los angeles he may have some info
[2:59:24.800 --> 2:59:30.080]  on what's happening with the flu bill what's going on today
[2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:33.840]  bill okay john you're giving me a new list then who specifically is first up
[2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:39.920]  in this new call list shawna california you're on the air go ahead
[2:59:39.920 --> 2:59:43.920]  how you doing alex can you hear me good sir yeah i have a i have a question um
[2:59:43.920 --> 2:59:49.680]  i you know i was in the military from 1992 from uh to 1996 uh united states navy
[2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:54.160]  and my concern is is that when we were in boot camp when you first get there the
[2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:57.680]  first week anybody that's been in the military knows what i'm talking about
[2:59:57.680 --> 3:00:01.360]  when you first get there and you go to medical they line you up
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:05.440]  and they shoot you up with a bunch of different shots with the air guns
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:09.440]  and nobody knows what these things are so i'm wondering i'm really concerned i
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:13.520]  got a nephew going in well let me tell you they have put troops in chambers
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:16.240]  murdered them with nerve gas project shad and others
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:20.080]  they have injected you with cancer viruses other experimental vaccines
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:25.360]  they use you like white lab rats and uh so you're concerned about it yes
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:29.520]  that's the main reason you can't join the military uh because they test eugenics
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:32.800]  soft-kill weapons on you
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:36.000]  does that answer your question yeah i mean is there any way to maybe the
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:39.360]  pentagon we can find out what are in these shots that they're injecting us
[3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:42.640]  with i mean so you know so so that you know the
[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:46.720]  we're aware of what we're getting ourselves into or not me myself i already
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:49.840]  well the pentagon is not supposed to give you experimental shots unless you
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:53.040]  consent even if you're in the military you have the right to refuse
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:56.240]  experimental shots that's illegal it's also a violation of the geneva
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:00:58.400]  convention but they don't care they still give you
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:01.760]  experimental shots illegally and won't tell you what you're being given
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:04.800]  but it always leaks because then they order the base
[3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:08.560]  physicians the mds to take it and they're the ones that always
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:11.200]  lead the revolts against the anthrax the smallpox
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:15.520]  they admit the smallpox and anthrax were killing and maiming the troops
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:18.960]  but no if you're not a medical doctor they just ignore you
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:22.240]  one more question i had alex um just saying you know
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:26.480]  the the president signs executive orders to force us to get the swine flu
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:29.600]  vaccination or any flu flu vaccination i mean
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:32.560]  those of us that have families of a lot of us what are we actually supposed to
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:36.240]  do i mean if we say no they're gonna they're gonna
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:39.200]  you know they're i guess we have the option to say no but then sir they've
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:43.440]  already signed the executive order and implemented it under level six four
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:46.480]  forced inoculation quarantine that is in effect
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:49.120]  the question is like taking a safety off on a gun
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:52.720]  the question is they're already saying they can do this
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:56.320]  of course it's illegitimate they say they'll put you in prison for two years
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:00.160]  and give you a big fine it's illegitimate and the majority of people
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:04.800]  i know are going to say no unless they release some real deadly bio weapon
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:08.480]  and scare everybody into taking it that's why it's such
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:13.280]  such so important because we don't know exactly what's being planned
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:16.480]  so i mean basically i mean we we say no
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:21.680]  period point blank we're going to jail i mean well you notice they try to come
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:24.640]  up say oh don't you want to take it you need to take it because they know what
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:28.160]  they're doing is unconstitutional look i appreciate your call we're going to
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:32.800]  discuss it more i'm not taking any more calls
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:38.080]  unless people specifically have info about the police being trained with the
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:43.120]  military for checkpoints and quarantines and lockdowns
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:46.000]  i i want to hear from everybody your take on the flu we'll cover that the
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:49.760]  next few days but i want to leave the phones open
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:54.080]  so that specific military and police environment and nurses and medical
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:58.800]  workers who are being told they've got to take it we know that's going on
[3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:02.560]  okay all color of law the executive orders there but they say under the
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:06.080]  executive order they can force you but they say they're not forcing you now
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:10.160]  but they're still ordering medical workers to take it that's in the news
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:13.120]  so i want to hear specifically from police about whether you're going to
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:17.520]  take it firemen whether you're going to take it or if you have intel on drills
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:21.600]  i've confirmed with emergency managers in january before this stuff even started
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:24.480]  they were getting ready for quarantines lockdowns checkpoints
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:27.680]  we just played a lady from the army saying she was training with the local
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:31.840]  state police in california the chips i've confirmed the army and marines
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:36.800]  are doing secret training but they won't say for what
[3:03:36.800 --> 3:03:40.960]  and they are putting liaison officers in oregon in texas and california and
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:44.560]  other states regular army in the police department so

[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:13.360]  of yours and when i was doing this new album
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:16.160]  that i've done i'm going to play this song off of it here
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:19.840]  me when i was doing this record i did a lot of research into your world and
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:24.240]  what you do and and people like david ike and all these different writers and
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:28.800]  did the whole everything going on and one thing that i we me and my girl drae
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:32.880]  that we have my fiancee we're like big fans we've gone through all the stuff
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:36.080]  and we have we watched dark secrets inside the alien grove
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:40.640]  because that was a big part of the uh... my kind of research and what i was
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:43.520]  going to write into this album and i'm looking at that
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:47.360]  and that must have been that i was a trip man and i have to say
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:51.200]  i have to get your approval because i actually used the sound clip of some of
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:54.160]  the sounds with the crickets and everything that were going on in the
[3:09:54.160 --> 3:09:56.160]  background and used them on the song on the record
[3:09:56.160 --> 3:10:00.640]  which i'm honored i'm honored shitter well it's you know it's just one of
[3:10:00.640 --> 3:10:04.480]  those things that with that funeral fire and that whole things going on it
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:09.280]  it was a trip and i mean i literally watched it probably ten times
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:12.720]  it was so freaky you must have been freaked out in there well i mean at
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:16.240]  first i wasn't freaked out till i saw the old men getting really upset and
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:18.560]  excited and they were taken a very serious
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:20.960]  and i realized my god i'm really in the middle of a
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:24.880]  eyes wide shut type meeting so i'm honored that you did that
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:27.840]  of course shooter was born wailin albright jennings
[3:10:27.840 --> 3:10:31.520]  was born roland the only child of wailin jennings and jesse culture he lived his
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:35.120]  first few years in the crib on his parents turbo us he said i thought
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:40.160]  everybody's family was like mine he remembers uh again it's great to have
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:43.600]  you here when did you start waking up to this whole global system
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:46.800]  and what would your dad think of the world today
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:50.240]  well you know it's interesting you have that because my dad was that he was a
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:53.680]  very individual uh he had a very individual
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:57.680]  political view because he wasn't he didn't really ever support anybody
[3:10:57.680 --> 3:11:01.360]  that was in office but if he could recognize when things were done
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:04.800]  right and wrong but i think if he were to see what's going on now
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:07.520]  he would agree with us 100 percent i mean what
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:10.960]  there's a a farce going on and the world is changing and it's
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:14.960]  and it's getting closer and closer to being in the grip the united nations
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:19.120]  and everything that's going on it's scary well you know we know we've got
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:21.920]  willy nelson against the new world order he comes on the show
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:26.080]  and uh so it's it's it's great to be here from wailin jennings son that
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:29.600]  that uh wailin would have been on board against this but i mean
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:33.280]  what else would he do he was a great guy and a great patriot uh
[3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:37.440]  so so so getting back to you shooter when did you start to
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:42.080]  figure out there was a bigger picture really i was my kind of awakening to
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:45.120]  all of this was in the last three years i really
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:48.160]  didn't pay as much attention to what was going on and
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:51.920]  i was i'm a real big fan of coast to coast am and i've been listening to that
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:56.000]  for about 15 years since i was in high school and i have to attribute part of
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:00.480]  it to david ike because even though his philosophy is pretty not to the end of it
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:05.920]  you know his message is is ideally the true message when i when i heard him on
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:09.200]  the air it completely made me start digging and i'd
[3:12:09.200 --> 3:12:12.800]  know about you but then i started watching all your episodes i mean i
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:16.160]  watched all your stuff in the swine flu and that first broke and your interview
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:19.840]  with ike and then i you know bohemian grove and really dug into that world
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:23.440]  and then kind of absorbed as much of this as i possibly
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:27.840]  could and sure when i i mean ike is a visionary and
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:30.160]  is certainly woken up tens of millions of people and
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:35.120]  his idea of the mind revolution breaking free of the control paradigms is
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:39.120]  uh... just absolutely powerful so we're blessed to have david go ahead
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:43.440]  yeah i know i i agree and and you know but for me
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:47.280]  after i absorbed all of it you know i kind of it made me look at the world
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:50.880]  differently and i'd already started the reason i started caring is because
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:54.480]  you know i've i just had a daughter and uh she's going to be tuned
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:58.480]  in november and and that there was something that my woman had been telling
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:01.760]  me to do for years but i didn't figure it out until
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:05.520]  i had this little girl who was living with meaning and really digging in
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:09.040]  in the representation of truth and the importance of truth and being a true
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:13.920]  person and it really changed the way i motivated my life so when i found out
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:17.520]  about these things i felt you know that it was
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:21.680]  i had to dig and i had to find all the answers myself and i studied you know
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:25.440]  the masons and went deep into all these different sex and i have all these
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:28.640]  books everything from the occult to the other thing i just familiarized myself
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:32.400]  with what it was going on and the terminology and everything and it
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:36.000]  really brought me to this completely i feel like a completely
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:38.560]  different person when i see the world and i see
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.400]  how how much of it is just right there in front of our faces
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:46.720]  with the television and with in school and things they do the way they set you
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:49.760]  up you know for life you think that your whole
[3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:53.200]  job is is is to make money and die but you can make a difference
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:57.840]  you know absolutely and that's what's so exciting about the awakening that's
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:00.960]  happening across the board that's why the controllers
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:04.400]  are trying to bring all these different control mechanisms in your website is
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:08.880]  shooterjennings.com and we'll put that up on screen

[3:14:42.160 --> 3:14:46.000]  such a it's rooted in exactly what we're talking about and waking up the

[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:38.480]  deals with um the coming police state to some degree and and you which you're
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:42.080]  no stranger to i mean that's that you got all those movies you made about it
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:45.440]  and it's like kind of dealing with you know it actually deals with them
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:48.560]  building the mass graves in the states and things like that i mean there's
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:52.480]  that you know it's it's pretty heavy song but the whole album it doesn't all
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:56.320]  deal with this it's like there's moments that touch on this but it touches
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:17:00.080]  a lot on the truth and love in your heart and the importance of that and the
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:04.880]  importance of two people being that like two people in a you know
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:08.480]  two points connecting is like the most important thing on the planet so it
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:12.320]  it deals with basically all these things you know
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:16.000]  well it's like that don henley song inside job
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:19.040]  yeah we're going to change the world individually

[3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:26.160]  with each other when we start really getting centered and not being as
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:30.480]  materialistic that's when we can actually see the wider universe and not be
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:35.440]  completely controlled by madison avenue absolutely better than that you couldn't
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:38.960]  have said it better than that's the truth

[3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:46.400]  we've worked over a year on this record and it's like i feel like it's going to
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:51.600]  be something that if anything will express the importance of truth you know
