[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  They were taking children out of Boys Town orphanages and foster homes and driving them
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.080]  to Susie, Iowa, 184 miles away, placing them in private jets flying to Washington, D.C.
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.880]  for sex orgies with Congress and senators and dignitaries.
[00:27.880 --> 00:30.720]  I've covered that in my intelligence report, by the way.
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.960]  I remembered Ted Gunderson, and I was reading the things he said, quotes in the 80s about
[00:35.960 --> 00:41.440]  there's a shadow government using pedophilia to control and blackmail the population, and
[00:41.440 --> 00:46.040]  it's setting up networks internationally to bring down the United States.
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.440]  And I mean, I'm reading this from the FBI's own website, and it all was true.
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.080]  There's code words for some of these various operations.
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.720]  The code word that I'm going to tell you about right now, and this is in my sources own handwriting.
[00:59.720 --> 01:03.760]  You don't write too well, so I may make some mistakes.
[01:03.760 --> 01:06.760]  The black rose is a code word for this.
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.560]  It's a clandestine group of U.S. government operatives, primarily the CIA, which has for
[01:12.560 --> 01:19.600]  many years run illegal drugs and arms operations in both Southeast Asia, via the Golden Triangle,
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.040]  and the Middle East, via the Golden Crescent, funded by the British socialist-based Russell
[01:25.040 --> 01:27.920]  Trust Drug Cartel.
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.040]  The black rose, as current chairman and co-founder, is an individual known as the White Rose,
[01:33.040 --> 01:43.120]  or GHWB, a known bisexual pedophile, and CFR, Council on Foreign Relations Conspirator.
[01:43.120 --> 01:50.400]  This man, as a top member of the Skull and Bone Society, developed the heroin ring while
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.560]  servicing as ambassador along with his CIA activities.
[01:55.560 --> 02:03.200]  The black rose also runs cocaine through Panama from Columbia to the offshore oil rigs in
[02:03.200 --> 02:05.600]  the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:05.600 --> 02:10.520]  But what's broken in the last week is so huge.
[02:10.520 --> 02:18.160]  It's really hard, but don't worry, unlike POP, that's one of the names for Joe Biden,
[02:18.160 --> 02:21.280]  current candidate for the United States presidency.
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.760]  I won't make you give me half your salary.
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.360]  Okay, left-wing press, what are you going to do with that?
[02:30.360 --> 02:36.560]  Yesterday, we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.960]  for showing real bravery.
[02:42.960 --> 02:48.960]  That Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son's corrupt business
[02:48.960 --> 02:50.960]  dealings.
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.080]  Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and he has been corrupt for many years, and everybody
[02:57.080 --> 03:01.360]  in Washington knew it.
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.480]  And just now, a little while ago, a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy
[03:07.480 --> 03:14.000]  Chinese business magnate for $10 million a year for introductions only.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.240]  You could do it first was, oh, here they are with the emails, with Barisma saying, we're
[03:18.240 --> 03:21.720]  going to pay you in these criminal investigations, tell your dad to do it.
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.400]  I mean, that was open and shut, and I was like, oh, so what if he's got a cracked bite
[03:25.400 --> 03:26.640]  and hookers?
[03:26.640 --> 03:28.480]  The media is diverting off onto that.
[03:28.480 --> 03:32.640]  I wasn't defending cracked pipes and hookers or meth pipes and hookers, but that was what
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.480]  the media chose to focus on, and I kind of took the bait.
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.840]  And then I began to go back and do research, and I'm like, wait a minute, there was a major
[03:38.840 --> 03:45.840]  Chinese dissident group from inside the Communist Party back in September three weeks ago that
[03:45.840 --> 03:52.160]  said this laptop's there, it's coming out, Giuliani's got it, turns out the dissident
[03:52.160 --> 03:59.800]  that put this out is working with Giuliani, we confirmed all that, and it's not just taking
[03:59.800 --> 04:01.520]  Chinese Communist money.
[04:01.520 --> 04:11.160]  It is actual videos, reportedly, of Hunter Biden having sex with very young Chinese girls
[04:11.160 --> 04:39.760]  and reportedly beating the living hell out of them.
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.320]  He got caught, read his laptop, and you know who's a criminal, you're a criminal for not
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.320]  reporting it.
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.320]  You are a criminal for not reporting it.
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.320]  Let me tell you something.
[04:49.320 --> 04:54.400]  Joe Biden is a criminal, and he's been a criminal for a long time, and you're a criminal and
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.400]  the media for not reporting it.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.400]  Good luck, everybody.
[04:57.400 --> 04:59.400]  Have a good time.
[04:59.400 --> 05:05.360]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understand, what
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.960]  our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[05:08.960 --> 05:15.520]  Here in a digital civil war, there are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication
[05:15.520 --> 05:21.560]  going on on every major tech platform, and now they're doing it to the private apps,
[05:21.560 --> 05:24.720]  they're doing it to text messages, they're doing it to email.
[05:24.720 --> 05:30.720]  This is mafia-organized crime election meddling, but finally, when they blocked the Hunter
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.760]  Biden and the Burisma information and the Chinese information and the photos and the
[05:35.760 --> 05:40.080]  crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.080]  it.
[05:41.080 --> 05:44.600]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control, you've got to stop it
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.600]  now, we're taking action.
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.520]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, it's a mistake, it's an accident, it's an accident, but they
[05:49.520 --> 05:52.880]  keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff.
[05:52.880 --> 05:56.520]  Well, info wars is calling their bluff, and I want to thank you all for keeping us on
[05:56.520 --> 06:11.640]  the air.
[06:11.640 --> 06:17.800]  It's October 20th on this Tuesday edition, 13 days out from the election, 82 from the
[06:17.800 --> 06:24.240]  inauguration, and the forces of globalism, the literal armies of evil are attempting
[06:24.240 --> 06:27.400]  to take down the United States and the rest of the world.
[06:27.400 --> 06:32.440]  Using COVID-19 as their martial law cover, it has already triggered a worldwide financial
[06:32.440 --> 06:36.280]  collapse that's already killed more than 2 million people, not from COVID, but from
[06:36.280 --> 06:37.280]  the lockdown.
[06:37.280 --> 06:42.000]  That is only the first dominoes to fall, it will accelerate according to UN's own numbers.
[06:42.000 --> 06:49.280]  The next three years, 8 million people could be dying per month by next year as the chain
[06:49.280 --> 06:55.120]  reaction unfolds, they're talking about close to 300 million people dying.
[06:55.120 --> 07:01.320]  We are 13 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 12 seconds out, I am your host Alex Jones, and I cannot
[07:01.320 --> 07:06.920]  state enough to you right now how epic the crossroads are that we're at right now, and
[07:06.920 --> 07:12.280]  that everything you do to override big tech censorship and to override the globalist is
[07:12.280 --> 07:17.280]  going to shake the foundations for decades to come and is going to have such a massive
[07:17.280 --> 07:18.280]  effect.
[07:18.280 --> 07:23.160]  There are times like these that the political action you take has thousands of times the
[07:23.160 --> 07:29.560]  effect and power would have had, say, 20 years ago, we're at a crossroads, we're at a change
[07:29.560 --> 07:34.240]  point right now, and we all knew that this fall and winter they'd shut the world economy
[07:34.240 --> 07:38.440]  down and bring in total martial law, each year getting stricter than the last prison
[07:38.440 --> 07:45.880]  time, $15,000 fines in New York, curfews, checkpoints, all of it consolidating the economy.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.880]  That's all coming up.
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.720]  And then we've got some good news, but it's still very, very weak, a Justice Department
[07:52.720 --> 08:01.400]  lawsuit filed for antitrust monopolistic behavior and for censorship for core data manipulation
[08:01.400 --> 08:04.600]  by the Justice Department against Google, that will be battled for years.
[08:04.600 --> 08:09.480]  They've now done that 13 days out, they should have done it three years ago.
[08:09.480 --> 08:15.960]  At the same time, now Congress may not even call Jack Dorsey and others for their perjury
[08:15.960 --> 08:21.840]  to an emergency hearing because they've got so much big tech money to flood into the candidates
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.080]  and so many of the Republicans are really double agents of these people and bought off,
[08:26.080 --> 08:28.840]  we've got a serious situation, we've got all that.
[08:28.840 --> 08:34.680]  Then you've got the ongoing rigging happening, Democrats are spending five to one what Trump
[08:34.680 --> 08:38.200]  has because they've got all the big money, all the big billionaires, all the big foreign
[08:38.200 --> 08:45.680]  banks, EMT battleground states like Iowa, Michigan, Florida and other areas, five to
[08:45.680 --> 08:52.640]  one spending in local news on local radio stations with incredible lies.
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.440]  That's why you've got to get the word out yourself and there's nothing more effective
[08:57.440 --> 09:02.040]  than when you personally share Donald Trump campaign ads on your email list and your text
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.840]  message or sit your employees down and show it to them or sit your neighbors down and
[09:05.840 --> 09:08.240]  show it to them and then show them the facts.
[09:08.240 --> 09:10.000]  The Trump ads are very effective.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.760]  Info wars is as effective as well with the truth.
[09:12.760 --> 09:16.960]  I suggest you go pick the most effective, most truthful videos, most evident videos
[09:16.960 --> 09:19.360]  to you from your own research.
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.160]  They're all very truthful but certain videos will hit you stronger than others and you
[09:23.160 --> 09:26.360]  make the decision what videos at band.video you want to share.
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.520]  Then you realize they're blocking band.video so you can share it from 2020electioncenter.com,
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.680]  the exact same website, just different URLs, very same videos and just realize this is
[09:37.680 --> 09:38.680]  up to you now.
[09:38.680 --> 09:40.880]  They're counting on you being scared of COVID.
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.520]  They're counting on you following their illegal regulations and laws and staying home.
[09:44.520 --> 09:45.720]  They now admit that it's come out.
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.960]  They've been caught on hot mics saying it's political theater to keep Republicans from
[09:48.960 --> 09:53.880]  coming out and for the last eight months it worked but now people are figuring out the
[09:53.880 --> 09:54.880]  truth.
[09:54.880 --> 09:57.960]  They're finding out that any virus will kill you if you don't have vitamin D, vitamin C
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.640]  and vitamin B12, if you don't have all the essentials iodine, if you don't have zinc
[10:04.640 --> 10:12.880]  you're dead and so as people load up on that suddenly the morbidity rate is 0.000000 something
[10:12.880 --> 10:16.160]  and the establishment is so pissed that you figured out you were dying because you did
[10:16.160 --> 10:19.960]  not have the right vitamins and minerals which anyone will die if you don't have.
[10:19.960 --> 10:23.240]  If you don't have vitamin C on average you're dead within four months.
[10:23.240 --> 10:25.080]  Zero vitamin C, dead four months.
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.240]  Don't have water, average dead in seven days.
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.440]  Don't have food, average dead in about 45 days and I just keep saying that because it's
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.560]  a public service emergency announcement that can save lives.
[10:36.560 --> 10:43.600]  Tell everyone you know they need organic vitamin D, organic C and organic zinc.
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.440]  These synthetics do nothing and that's what they sell at the store where it's like $10
[10:48.440 --> 10:51.760]  for a multivitamin and it's got all these supposed vitamins in it.
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.960]  You look at it, they're synthetic, they do nothing except maybe hurt your liver but let
[10:54.960 --> 10:57.880]  me stop right there.
[10:57.880 --> 10:58.880]  I'm digressing.
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.720]  Let me tell you what else is coming up.
[11:01.720 --> 11:09.360]  Giuliani is a former top federal prosecutor and they got this laptop over a month ago,
[11:09.360 --> 11:14.240]  now five weeks ago and they went through the emails and they called people in the emails
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.640]  and they emailed them and they even confirmed it from other congressional testimony and
[11:19.640 --> 11:26.560]  hearings that yes indeed the emails of Hunter Biden's laptop were real.
[11:26.560 --> 11:34.600]  So the idea that the 25,000 videos, I mean only a super pervert would do something like
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.920]  that have that on their computer and the tens of thousands of emails to Ukrainian officials,
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.040]  Chinese officials, the payoffs, all of it's there and all of it matches the dates the
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.000]  stuff happened and they've already had an army of investigators, private investigators
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.640]  which means the cream of the crop, former federal agents, I'm told it's more than 50
[11:52.640 --> 12:00.200]  former FBI agents, Scotland yard people, you name it, that are on this tracking the emails.
[12:00.200 --> 12:03.760]  I mean they knew within days it was a real laptop, they knew it was a real laptop shop,
[12:03.760 --> 12:07.840]  they have Hunter Biden's signature, Hunter Biden was kicked out of the Navy for cocaine,
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.560]  they authenticated all the photos, they knew within days it was real.
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.200]  Then they started reaching out and going through this massive trove with hundreds of people
[12:16.200 --> 12:20.440]  in total working on it, calling and getting witnesses and then finding out what happened
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.680]  at the meetings, Hunter was setting up the State Department illegally for paper play
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.200]  inside the State Department.
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.320]  So this is so open and shut and the FBI has now confirmed that indeed they were in receipt
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.760]  of the laptop.
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.000]  The media tries to spend that though and guess like you and they've had quote 50 public
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.400]  officials, former intelligence operatives, Brennan and Clapper at the top with their
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.200]  John Hancocks come out and say, well they have no proof, I have their quote right over
[12:48.200 --> 12:50.920]  here, I'll show it to you in a moment, they say, well we don't have any proof, we just
[12:50.920 --> 12:57.120]  know it's Russians, wow so the Russians got him kicked out of the Navy for cocaine and
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.760]  the Russians had, there were Russians involved, the mayor of Moscow giving him millions of
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.640]  dollars, oh the Ukrainians giving him tens of millions of dollars and an overall billions
[13:06.640 --> 13:13.560]  total that was diverted by the communist Chinese, I mean Biden's on tape saying China's good,
[13:13.560 --> 13:20.440]  they need to run every aspect of our lives, you've got Pelosi saying China needs to run
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.240]  things, China wants Biden, I mean we all know they sold us out and the laptop's real and
[13:27.240 --> 13:34.280]  Biden's lawyer is in the emails and has said yes, that's me, but it gets worse, now Biden
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.960]  campaign officials and we'll show you these quotes, well there's videos of this have come
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.760]  out and be asked about it and they say, well no one's denying that these are real emails,
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.640]  we're just saying the Russians got them and so you can't use it because the Russians got
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.440]  them, which is not even true, there's no evidence of that, no connection, though there was other
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.920]  laptops and other material discovered by the new government in Ukraine about all the payoffs
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.800]  of the corruption and how they were ordered by Biden to fire the prosecutor or they wouldn't
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.760]  get the billion dollars, how do we know about that, oh the Russian disinfo person, Joe Biden
[14:07.760 --> 14:13.720]  to hide it in plain view, that wasn't Russian disinfo, that was Joe Biden at the CFR saying
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.440]  they were investigating us, I ordered him to fire the prosecutor and an hour later son
[14:17.440 --> 14:23.600]  of a bitch, he was gone, so there's nothing they can do and the Communist Chinese state
[14:23.600 --> 14:30.640]  media has said in their top newspaper that the views of Biden and his goals as they gloat
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.720]  are parallel to Beijing's, his worldview runs parallel to Beijing's, this is all on record
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.760]  and now they're sitting there telling you that that's not happening and it's Clapper
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.760]  and Brennan who ran the illegal attempted coups against Trump, all three of them, who
[14:46.760 --> 14:50.000]  have been caught red handed illegally spying on the American people and President Trump,
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.720]  who have been caught on the payroll of foreign powers, who now tell you that with no evidence
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.560]  that it's Russia, they say we have no evidence but we know it's Russia because we're experts
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.120]  and magically know this, that list of 50 people is soon needs to be arrested for the crimes
[15:04.120 --> 15:10.080]  they've already committed, what a perfect list of the ongoing conspirators, former Obama
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.000]  and former Clinton operatives, to a man and woman who literally think they own this country,
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.560]  they think they own you to sell you off to the communist chicoms and the UN and the New
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.720]  World Order and big tech and now they're so scared because the world's awakening to them
[15:25.720 --> 15:30.400]  and even if they assassinate Trump or steal this election, we have won because now everyone
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.120]  knows it's a foreign UN agenda 21 takeover, they know about all the censorship, they know
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.120]  about the coup, they know about the plan to wreck America and the sleeping giant ain't
[15:40.120 --> 15:46.560]  sleeping now, New World Order, the sleeping giant is awake and it's now not just rubbing
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.400]  the sleep out of its eyes but it's now learning the information and energizing and realizing
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.520]  how much threat it's under and realizing how many wounds it already has and it's pissed,
[15:55.520 --> 16:02.360]  pick it up a big club, 2020ElectionCenter.com, just type it in one time, you've got to save
[16:02.360 --> 16:07.840]  right there in your browser and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple
[16:07.840 --> 16:14.240]  platforms and most importantly via text message, email or by word of mouth because they have
[16:14.240 --> 16:23.000]  banned the links to banned.video, 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the same links, the exact
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.440]  same videos, we can comment and share them everything, the system is censoring because
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.600]  the power of the people overrode them four years ago, Trump has finally figured this
[16:33.600 --> 16:37.840]  out and since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, I mean he's modern
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.840]  the situation, well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit
[16:40.840 --> 16:45.360]  here and cry because he has to take an action, we the people are taking action now and you
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.400]  can do it very very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the
[16:50.400 --> 16:57.320]  new redesigned infowars.com and sharing that link, hope that really accepts them, oh yeah.
[16:57.320 --> 17:03.040]  It was 30 months ago that Infowars and of course yours truly Alec Jones was banned on
[17:03.040 --> 17:09.080]  more than 60 major platforms in one day led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook who helps China
[17:09.080 --> 17:13.680]  run giant death camps, always just let that be in the back of your mind, we talk about
[17:13.680 --> 17:19.280]  these monsters and where they're taking us, they have no bottom and people said Jones
[17:19.280 --> 17:22.440]  how are you taking it and I said I'm taking it just fine, they're coming for you next,
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.360]  this is a technocracy, they're merging with Big Pharma, they're taking over the media,
[17:26.360 --> 17:32.440]  this is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words, this is a planetary takeover,
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.160]  they're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats, that's
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.520]  so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover,
[17:42.520 --> 17:44.080]  how do I know all this would happen?
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.640]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it, you see it's not that I'm psychic,
[17:48.640 --> 17:52.960]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying, see I've to understand, as crazy as
[17:52.960 --> 18:00.800]  all this sounds it doesn't come from me, it comes from them, you're listening to the
[18:00.800 --> 18:18.320]  Alec Jones show, Tuesday October 20th, the year is 2020,
[18:18.320 --> 18:26.480]  the year of insanity, the year of war, the year of awakening, the year America chooses
[18:26.480 --> 18:35.440]  its fate, 13 days out from the election, 92 into the inauguration, a referendum on freedom
[18:35.440 --> 18:43.200]  versus slavery, no amount of powerful operatic music can even set the stage for what could
[18:43.200 --> 18:52.360]  truly become the triggering event for the Guter Damorong, the twilight of the gods, Armageddon,
[18:52.360 --> 19:01.200]  mass death, the Antichrist and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, world government, dawning,
[19:01.200 --> 19:11.200]  the mark of the beast, all of it real, all of it now unfolding, but we choose our adventure,
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.920]  we will decide the course and the final outcome, for we are not slaves, we have free will and
[19:17.920 --> 19:25.280]  can decide how we will live and how we will die, now is the time for that choice.
[19:25.280 --> 19:32.200]  And to give you an example of this, I remember being on air 20 years ago and seeing proposals
[19:32.200 --> 19:37.760]  for Common Core out of UNESCO in the UN, we go hey these are UN guidelines to end classical
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.480]  education and make people dumb, they even said to UN that's why they were doing it, to make
[19:41.480 --> 19:47.080]  us more manageable, and now all over the United States and college and in high school and
[19:47.080 --> 19:53.120]  middle school and elementary school, they're getting rid of reading, writing and arithmetic
[19:53.120 --> 19:58.080]  and they're getting rid of two plus two equals four, literally, fuzzy math, fuzzy grammar,
[19:58.080 --> 20:05.360]  and well here it is, this is San Francisco News, San Francisco newspaper, San Diego Unified,
[20:05.360 --> 20:12.760]  we're just grading practices to be equitable, less punitive, gets rid of the grading system,
[20:12.760 --> 20:16.760]  and now it will all be political and cultural what you're taught, not about the world and
[20:16.760 --> 20:22.960]  how it really works and how you can become successful and empowered, but it's racist,
[20:22.960 --> 20:26.000]  you see and now Forbes asked, is it a good idea?
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.720]  I don't know, is jumping off a cliff a good idea?
[20:31.720 --> 20:36.480]  Now, let's talk reality, humanity is waking up that we're being domesticated by ultra
[20:36.480 --> 20:40.080]  rich that took over through fraud, who don't want us part of the game, that don't want
[20:40.080 --> 20:48.440]  us part of the competition, who want to wall us off in a slave master slave feudal surf
[20:48.440 --> 20:53.920]  system, and that's what the UN says, and that's what's in my film Endgame, I show the quotes
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.600]  from the UN saying we're going to reintroduce feudalism, we're going to have rich ultra
[20:58.600 --> 21:03.560]  powerful city-states, no more countries, and a huge world government that will then depopulate
[21:03.560 --> 21:08.840]  people, and we'll make folks sign on for social credits to be able to even have a job because
[21:08.840 --> 21:15.120]  the robots are going to be making everything, and so now they're getting ready to take the
[21:15.120 --> 21:21.560]  economy out from under us and make us dependent to then dictate the terms of our surrender,
[21:21.560 --> 21:26.720]  and it's like they ask that famous James Bond movie, he says, do you expect me to talk?
[21:26.720 --> 21:32.960]  And they say no, Mr. Bond, we expect you to die, oh, I'll just roll over to these people,
[21:32.960 --> 21:36.120]  oh yeah, okay, we'll kill yourself then, because that's what they want, they want you off the
[21:36.120 --> 21:40.040]  planet, they stole the planet through fraud, you won't stand up for yourself, so they're
[21:40.040 --> 21:52.560]  coming after you, the Jorge, the champion UFC fighter has come out and literally destroyed
[21:52.560 --> 21:58.680]  the globalists, mans Vidal, and this is more of what we need to see as people understanding
[21:58.680 --> 22:01.760]  that, it doesn't matter what color you are, even where you came from, if you don't see
[22:01.760 --> 22:06.480]  that America is under crisis and that powerful corrupt forces are trying to take it over,
[22:06.480 --> 22:11.040]  you're crazy, and if you don't see that all the big powerful banks and the communist Chinese
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.040]  and all the authoritarian scammers are offering all these idiots free stuff, never work again,
[22:16.040 --> 22:24.120]  free home, free car, free guaranteed income, free education, free everything, if you don't
[22:24.120 --> 22:31.920]  understand that, and if people don't understand that, then they don't have a hope in hell
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.160]  ladies and gentlemen, and that's what this comes down to, here it is, I'm going to let
[22:38.160 --> 22:42.520]  you in on something, the Democrats just think that they're entitled to the Latino vote, they
[22:42.520 --> 22:48.200]  think that we just have to hand it over to them, that's right, we sure as hell don't,
[22:48.200 --> 22:54.200]  así mismo, así mismo, they got to show us what they can do for us, what they can do
[22:54.200 --> 22:59.600]  for our communities, we're not going to buy the same wolf tickets and false promises that
[22:59.600 --> 23:05.120]  destroy great countries like Venezuela and Cuba, it's not going to happen, you know what
[23:05.120 --> 23:13.240]  else is not going to work for them, plain despacito on your cell phone, it's a panda
[23:13.240 --> 23:19.960]  to us, hell no, you got to give us some credit for having heads on our shoulders, I'm going
[23:19.960 --> 23:27.440]  to wrap this up, some words of Barack Obama, he said elections have consequences, that
[23:27.440 --> 23:33.040]  is true, and those words have never been more true than they are today, we the rear leg
[23:33.040 --> 23:46.080]  President Trump in Keep America Great, amen, or we let Joe Biden destroy the greatest country
[23:46.080 --> 23:53.640]  the world has ever seen, now I'm a professional athlete and I've been one for most of my life
[23:53.640 --> 23:59.040]  so I've always seen things through a sports lens, that makes Donald Trump our head coach
[23:59.040 --> 24:03.560]  and before the global pandemic we were winning Super Bowls, and when you're winning Super
[24:03.560 --> 24:09.760]  Bowls you don't fire the coach, it doesn't matter if you don't like the plays he runs,
[24:09.760 --> 24:14.560]  the players you put on the field or what he says on Twitter, you sure as hell don't replace
[24:14.560 --> 24:19.920]  him for another coach that's been in the business for 47 years at every level and never won
[24:19.920 --> 24:29.200]  a f***ing game, all right Jorge Mazvedal knocked it out of the park, Rush Limbaugh is fighting
[24:29.200 --> 24:33.480]  for his life, stage 4 cancer, he's a trooper, we love him, he's grown a lot over the years,
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.000]  he's a patriot, he loves America, we don't want to lose Rush, we want to be here for
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.320]  years and he's fighting for his life, I'm going to play a clip of him here in a moment,
[24:41.320 --> 24:44.840]  but I want to say something about Jorge, do you imagine if I went to a white group,
[24:44.840 --> 24:47.680]  black group, mixed group, Hispanic group, imagine if I went to a Hispanic group, it's
[24:47.680 --> 24:52.120]  sort of playing Mariachi when I came up on the, it's insulting, you came to some farmers
[24:52.120 --> 24:58.080]  deal, you started playing Hank Williams, it's pandering, it's a joke because it's Biden's
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.200]  fake so he thinks doing something fake makes him real even though all the real people see
[25:02.200 --> 25:06.920]  right through it, see how they operate, it's like Hillary goes I like Mexicans, I like
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.200]  hot sauce, what the hell does that mean, here's Rush Limbaugh fighting for his life, he now
[25:11.200 --> 25:14.880]  says he's got a death sentence.
[25:14.880 --> 25:24.400]  Mine are no better and mine are no different, mine are no more special than anybody else's.
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.800]  But it can feel like a roller coaster, from the moment you get the diagnosis, there's
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.360]  a part of you every day, okay that's it, life's over, you just don't want to win, but when
[25:35.360 --> 25:43.520]  you get that diagnosis, I mean that's, so during the period of time after the diagnosis
[25:43.520 --> 25:52.320]  you do what you can to prolong life, you do what you can to prolong a happy life, you
[25:52.320 --> 25:59.520]  measure a happy life against whatever medication it takes and at some point you decide, you
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.200]  know this medication may be working but I hate the way I feel every day, I'm not there
[26:05.200 --> 26:18.120]  yet but it is part and parcel of this, it's tough to realize that the days where I do
[26:18.120 --> 26:25.200]  not think I'm under a death sentence are over, now we all are, is the point, we all know
[26:25.200 --> 26:32.400]  that we're going to die at some point but when you have a terminal disease diagnosis
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.560]  that has a time frame to it, brings it into focus and that puts a difference, all right
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.600]  we'll pray for Rush Lumball, pray for America but it's so archetypal that one of the main
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.560]  resistance figures against the left's takeover is fighting for his life but that's what always
[26:45.560 --> 26:50.400]  happens in epic parts of history, it's just amazing how to be alive ladies and gentlemen
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.760]  and we're, America's fighting a death sentence but we can stop it if we pray to God for a
[26:54.760 --> 26:56.400]  mass awakening.
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.200]  Human mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months,
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.080]  they're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins
[27:06.080 --> 27:11.400]  minerals to specially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[27:11.400 --> 27:17.520]  immune system, well both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com just two weeks
[27:17.520 --> 27:23.320]  after the election and we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple

[27:27.760 --> 27:32.240]  10% off that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders, now we have had a big
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.000]  clearance sale going so a lot of stuff sold out, a lot of other stuff is close to selling
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.040]  out, some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back into
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.680]  stock and because of your support we've had the money to reorder and get the other things
[27:44.680 --> 27:48.360]  that have actually sold out so those should be back in stock as well soon, thank you so
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.480]  much for keeping info wars on the year, obviously we're critical of the fight and you've helped
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.840]  win the war against the global so far.
[27:55.840 --> 28:02.320]  A major life lesson just took place last night, the top story in the country was that Hunter
[28:02.320 --> 28:09.360]  Biden's laptop information had come out, him with hookers and shooting porno movies
[28:09.360 --> 28:15.520]  and crack pipes but the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma and
[28:15.520 --> 28:20.440]  had done so at the behest of his father who was getting large parts of the money but you
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.280]  see Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored the info and even censored major
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.560]  news publications and even censored the president but when the president and congress said they
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.800]  were going to take action suddenly Jack of Twitter said he didn't know what had happened
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.760]  and it was wrong and that's the big life lesson here, standing up and saying no to organized
[28:39.760 --> 28:45.520]  crime, rapid caring is the way to stop it, groveling to it and letting big tech lie to
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.360]  us and run over us is the way to make these tyrants continue to go absolutely crazy.
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.400]  Remember, they support communist China and its death camps, what will they do to us will
[28:54.400 --> 28:55.400]  we now know.
[28:55.400 --> 29:01.800]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince congress and the
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.840]  rest of the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for coordinated
[29:06.840 --> 29:11.920]  big tech censorship, now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and
[29:11.920 --> 29:15.840]  a half years for the learning curve to take place this time.
[29:15.840 --> 29:21.480]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent, it is a plan to
[29:21.480 --> 29:27.720]  lower carbon footprint, it is a plan to make the world population poor, it is a diabolical
[29:27.720 --> 29:33.120]  power grab, it is a revolution against the industrial revolution, they call it the post-industrial
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.160]  world and it's the excuse for them to take control of every facet of our lives and implement
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.960]  absolute authoritarianism.
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.800]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, my daughter that just woke up
[29:43.800 --> 29:48.360]  her, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake, you need to
[29:48.360 --> 29:59.320]  understand this information, you need to warn others, okay, it's a life and death situation.
[29:59.320 --> 30:23.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.080]  We knew this was coming, we knew the enemy plan, we knew that people would make fun of
[30:27.080 --> 30:32.440]  us and laugh at us and persecute us, the general public would think we're fools, the enemy
[30:32.440 --> 30:39.880]  would know we were onto them, but in the end, in the end, we knew that we would then have
[30:39.880 --> 30:45.320]  a stop gap measure and enough people aware of what was going on that we would have more
[30:45.320 --> 30:54.320]  than a fighting chance and now the globalists are confused, they're upset and they're angry
[30:54.320 --> 31:02.000]  because we have been quietly working across the planet in every nation and every continent
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.920]  to warn the people about the planetary government operation and it's in game, it's goal of
[31:08.920 --> 31:18.480]  forced depopulation and the hallmark of that will be forced inoculation with cancer viruses,
[31:18.480 --> 31:26.040]  sterilants and now the mRNA vaccine that reprograms your very body.
[31:26.040 --> 31:32.160]  That's the real stakes.
[31:32.160 --> 31:34.320]  That's what the real world really holds for all of us.
[31:34.320 --> 31:41.840]  I want to open the phones up on Biden, on the rig debate, I've got evidence of that,
[31:41.840 --> 31:44.960]  it's ridiculous how rigged it is, I think Trump probably should cancel this one too,
[31:44.960 --> 31:51.280]  it's just ridiculous, it's preposterous, then have his own big event and just give a speech
[31:51.280 --> 31:55.240]  and just say it's fake and he should go to the list of why it's fake.
[31:55.240 --> 32:00.480]  He says it's rigged but he's still going to go into their rigged system.
[32:00.480 --> 32:05.680]  We're going to be here, the town hall and the next night, the debates with live coverage
[32:05.680 --> 32:11.400]  with Owen Schreuer, myself, Keanu and others, again, I'm Alex Schoen, your host, we just
[32:11.400 --> 32:12.400]  joined us.
[32:12.400 --> 32:16.880]  We've got the big DOJ filing landmark anti-trust case against Google for abusing its online
[32:16.880 --> 32:19.560]  dominance and stifling viewpoints.
[32:19.560 --> 32:23.640]  We have the new UN Directive worldwide lockdown which they're having their surrogates launch
[32:23.640 --> 32:29.320]  at the national level under their directives but now the UN is saying it's too cruel, playing
[32:29.320 --> 32:31.440]  good cop, bad cop.
[32:31.440 --> 32:36.400]  We have so much to lay out but I want to give the number out now so we can start taking
[32:36.400 --> 32:40.040]  calls next segment right into the next hour and then I had Patrick Howley on who's been
[32:40.040 --> 32:44.440]  all over national news with his findings of election fraud but I got into other issues
[32:44.440 --> 32:49.640]  with him when he was on so I've got him coming back on at the bottom of the next hour and
[32:49.640 --> 32:54.960]  then of course we also have Leo Zagami popping in, Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the
[32:54.960 --> 33:01.360]  fourth hour of the next two days and so much more.
[33:01.360 --> 33:05.520]  I just want to commend all of you for how you've been promoting Band-Aid video.
[33:05.520 --> 33:11.280]  I looked it up as of Monday.
[33:11.280 --> 33:19.880]  The site had had from Friday to Monday morning 12 million views.
[33:19.880 --> 33:20.880]  That's just beautiful.
[33:20.880 --> 33:24.400]  By the way, we don't even sell advertising on there.
[33:24.400 --> 33:25.400]  We pay for the bandwidth.
[33:25.400 --> 33:30.440]  I just see that as a sign of victory that you're sharing on email, sharing it on text message.
[33:30.440 --> 33:34.640]  The enemy is outraged because they've shut everything else down but you're able to see
[33:34.640 --> 33:35.640]  the Hunter Biden stuff.
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.360]  You're able to see all these top medical doctors and scientists press conferences about COVID
[33:39.360 --> 33:45.160]  being an overblown hoax and how to protect yourself with vitamins and minerals.
[33:45.160 --> 33:49.120]  It's all coming out and humanity's fighting back because we knew this was coming and we
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.640]  made preparation for it.
[33:51.640 --> 33:53.600]  Like Noah built his ark.
[33:53.600 --> 33:54.760]  We built info wars.
[33:54.760 --> 33:58.920]  You've built it so that we're here and have a platform but the only way it's magnified,
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.880]  the only way it's amplified, the only way the dog gets out of its cage and into the
[34:02.880 --> 34:07.280]  field is you open the door and you share the articles and videos.
[34:07.280 --> 34:12.200]  It's not critical, it's essential.
[34:12.200 --> 34:16.480]  Critical means very important and central and you really need it.
[34:16.480 --> 34:19.760]  Essential means you've got to have it.
[34:19.760 --> 34:21.320]  So let's get this straight.
[34:21.320 --> 34:23.080]  You're not the horse pulling the wagon.
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.520]  You're not the person driving the horse.
[34:24.520 --> 34:25.680]  You're not the carriage.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.760]  You're not the whip.
[34:26.760 --> 34:28.120]  You're not the spurs.
[34:28.120 --> 34:30.400]  You're not the grain the horse got fed.
[34:30.400 --> 34:31.400]  The water it had.
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.000]  No, you're the whole thing and so am I.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.240]  So get that in your head real good because this fight is up to you now.
[34:42.240 --> 34:43.960]  These reports are so powerful that we've been putting out.
[34:43.960 --> 34:45.960]  I'm going to air one even though I've got plenty to cover.
[34:45.960 --> 34:56.240]  I'm going to come back and take calls 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, first time callers
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.120]  again, 877-789-2539 or if you haven't gotten it in a year, we'll count that as a first
[35:01.120 --> 35:02.120]  time caller.
[35:02.120 --> 35:04.720]  But let's go to this special report.
[35:04.720 --> 35:05.720]  Here it is.
[35:05.720 --> 35:11.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Betray America, go to hell.
[35:11.240 --> 35:14.080]  America is faced with a liberal legion of doom.
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.960]  Recently, two of its top villains expressed their utter contempt for the intelligence
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.000]  and the basic facts regarding their dangerous power wielding hypocrisy.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.040]  Michigan Governor Whitmer got a reality check when President Trump recently visited her
[35:29.040 --> 35:30.880]  state on a campaign stop.
[35:30.880 --> 35:36.400]  The alleged plot to kidnap or kill Governor Whitmer broke just days ago.
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.680]  She immediately blamed President Trump for inspiring the plot.
[35:40.680 --> 35:44.600]  Now the president on Governor Whitmer's home turf here in Muskegon.
[35:44.600 --> 35:46.600]  Get your schools open.
[35:46.600 --> 35:49.920]  The schools have to be open, right?
[35:49.920 --> 35:56.880]  President Trump in Muskegon late Saturday.
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.960]  He reacted by playing the victim card for a kidnapping plot where the smoke hasn't even
[36:01.960 --> 36:02.960]  cleared yet.
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.560]  Ten days after a plot to kidnap, put me on trial and execute me.
[36:08.560 --> 36:10.640]  Ten days after that was uncovered.
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.840]  The president is at it again and inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind
[36:17.840 --> 36:19.640]  of domestic terrorism.
[36:19.640 --> 36:20.800]  It is wrong.
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.480]  And does she have a rational explanation for the 86-45 numbers placed indiscriminately
[36:26.480 --> 36:27.480]  behind her?
[36:27.480 --> 36:34.040]  Everybody knows 86 is the slang term to murder someone, while President Trump is our 45th
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.040]  president.
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.560]  After Whitmer's draconian emergency pandemic lockdown orders were ruled unconstitutional
[36:40.560 --> 36:46.440]  by the Michigan Supreme Court, Whitmer, no stranger to toying with the upcoming election,
[36:46.440 --> 36:50.840]  vetoed legislation that would stem the tide of voter fraud.
[36:50.840 --> 36:56.440]  As Breitbart reported, Whitmer vetoed legislation that would have made it a felony to attempt
[36:56.440 --> 37:02.600]  to apply for multiple absentee ballots or fill out an application for other individuals
[37:02.600 --> 37:04.440]  without their consent.
[37:04.440 --> 37:09.920]  Any suggestion that the filing of a second absentee ballot application as criminal behavior
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.920]  creates needless confusion and fear-mongering around the absentee voting process, wrote
[37:14.920 --> 37:18.920]  Whitmer, it is bad for voters and bad for our elections.
[37:18.920 --> 37:24.760]  State Representative Ann Boland, a Republican who sponsored the legislation, criticized Whitmer
[37:24.760 --> 37:30.800]  over the veto, arguing both bills were designed to deter fraud while enhancing confidence as
[37:30.800 --> 37:33.920]  voters battle noise regarding mail-in voting.
[37:33.920 --> 37:39.680]  Boland said this legislation would have created a felony penalty for someone who fills out
[37:39.680 --> 37:44.440]  an application for another person in an attempt to commit fraud.
[37:44.440 --> 37:47.760]  That's not voter intimidation, it's voter protection.
[37:47.760 --> 37:53.200]  Meanwhile, New York Governor Cuomo is blatantly denying that he had anything to do with the
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.640]  thousands of nursing home deaths his overhanded policies caused.
[37:57.640 --> 38:01.160]  Governor Andrew Cuomo, appearing to take a victory lap as he promotes the launch of his
[38:01.160 --> 38:07.080]  new book, quote, leadership lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.880]  Can you see why a lot of people think, if you say we're in the halftime of this, that
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.000]  writing a book, a retrospective in the middle of it, sort of celebrating the things that
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.720]  you did right feels often strange?
[38:17.720 --> 38:22.240]  No, Willie, it's not a celebration at all.
[38:22.240 --> 38:23.920]  The game isn't over.
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.880]  The part that's so insulting is that as people were still dying, as people were still getting
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.400]  sick, as the uncertainty continued and businesses were closing, this was a guy who used that
[38:34.400 --> 38:40.000]  moment not only to take contemporaneous notes for a future book, but he was actually glad
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.640]  handing publishers, shopping for agents, writing this book and doing the work.
[38:44.640 --> 38:49.240]  This is in the thick of this pandemic when we lost more people, again, more than any
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.120]  other state easily, but more than places like France and Spain.
[38:53.120 --> 39:00.040]  Cuomo has defensively pointed to an internal report conducted by his own state health department,
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.840]  which is widely criticized by medical experts, politicians and family members who lost loved
[39:05.840 --> 39:08.800]  ones in the facilities to the virus.
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.400]  Experts like Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist with the University of Texas Health Science
[39:14.400 --> 39:21.400]  Center at Houston, ripped the DOH issued report released in July, arguing the analysis lacked
[39:21.400 --> 39:26.760]  sufficient information, including data on nursing homes that were free of the deadly
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.920]  disease before being forced to admit infected patients.
[39:30.920 --> 39:34.760]  Troisi added, would this get published in an academic journal?
[39:34.760 --> 39:35.760]  No.
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.920]  How many more Whitmers and Cuomos will it take for America to come to terms with the potential
[39:40.920 --> 39:48.720]  danger their votes pose when cast for psychotic megalomaniacs posing as their saviors?
[39:48.720 --> 40:18.680]  John Bown, reporting.
[40:19.720 --> 40:24.240]  Once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to
[40:24.240 --> 40:27.000]  prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.400]  This is what all the old Clintinesas are saying, it's what the Obama bots are saying, it's
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.480]  what Keith Overman is saying, it's what Nancy Pelosi is saying.
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.160]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent, and they intend to keep the lockdowns
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.320]  going forever and force denoculations.
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.840]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.320]  Donald Trump or die, you've got to get Trump in, everybody get out there and vote, tell
[40:53.320 --> 40:54.680]  your family to vote now.
[40:54.680 --> 41:00.120]  Black Friday in October, last year that was one of our most popular sales that we ran
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.440]  in the last couple weeks of October, it was popular for a reason, some of the biggest
[41:04.440 --> 41:11.120]  sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October, and that means 30% to 60% off store
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.040]  wide free shipping, triple patriot points at 15% off your next order, and everybody
[41:16.040 --> 41:20.280]  that signs up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these items lost
[41:20.280 --> 41:21.280]  leaders now.
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.280]  A lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there, but some good news,
[41:25.280 --> 41:28.760]  vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.360]  and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses, it is
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.600]  back in stock, back on sale today with just two weeks of the election, and more good news.

[41:49.440 --> 41:56.960]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, Black Friday comes in October.
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.360]  History is now, history is taking place in front of us, we are at the crossroads, we
[42:02.360 --> 42:07.360]  are now only two weeks out for the most historic and important election in world history, I
[42:07.360 --> 42:11.200]  have been saying that for over a year, but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating,
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.640]  this is so critical, the new world order wants to repudiate the nation state, they will repudiate
[42:15.640 --> 42:19.920]  the idea of America, they want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.760]  and bring in their technocracy, so they are throwing everything they've got, not just
[42:25.760 --> 42:30.120]  the American people, but the people of the world, that's why your word of mouth is beyond
[42:30.120 --> 42:35.440]  king, it is paramount, when you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when
[42:35.440 --> 42:38.600]  you shoot your own video, or write your own article, or knock on your neighbor's door
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.080]  and talk to them, or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump, when
[42:42.080 --> 42:46.480]  you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it adds
[42:46.480 --> 42:51.560]  up into giant things, many hands make life work, history is happening now, take action
[42:51.560 --> 43:16.320]  right now, while you still can, please, for all of our
[43:16.320 --> 43:34.080]  lessons, for all of our lessons, for all of our lessons, for all of our lessons, for
[43:34.080 --> 44:01.280]  all of our lessons.
[44:04.080 --> 44:29.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back and I decided to play really powerful operatic Lord of
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.120]  the Rings music here, which I would not even normally play, because it's so powerful. But
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.200]  these are the times we're in. And I knew building up this election, we get to this point, I've
[44:38.200 --> 44:49.240]  been waiting a year to play this. And now, we have 13 days out. Now I gave the number
[44:49.240 --> 44:53.840]  out earlier and I forgot to say one thing, I see you can call it about anything you want.
[44:53.840 --> 45:02.520]  But I said, that I wanted to get into the election meddling, the rig debates, Hunter
[45:02.520 --> 45:07.080]  Biden, all of it. But I really wanted to ask you, because I really want to focus on what
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.080]  you think is what are the crimes of the globalist? What are the things they've done? Because
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.480]  I was watching Trump's rallies last night, and he would take two hours to list a lot
[45:17.480 --> 45:22.240]  of the crimes they've committed. And I'd forgotten about a lot of stuff he was saying. And I'd
[45:22.240 --> 45:28.520]  forgotten about a lot of the things that Trump's done that's good. I mean, it's unreal what
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.120]  a good job he's done on so many fronts. He's not done some good things. But I mean, compared
[45:33.120 --> 45:37.520]  to what I could do or what you could do, come on, folks. This is not an instant gratification
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.640]  situation. This is a godsend. There's no doubt the enemy hates Trump. There's no doubt he's
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.080]  really president. There's no doubt he's really calling the shots. There's no doubt he's going
[45:46.080 --> 45:49.560]  to win in a landslide. And they're going to say he didn't win, because they have nothing
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.320]  to lose, because they never get in trouble for the crimes they've committed. And so it's
[45:54.320 --> 46:01.640]  the immovable object comes into the unstoppable force. That's where we are right now. So I'm
[46:01.640 --> 46:08.320]  going to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to cover the news. But I want to direct viewers
[46:08.320 --> 46:16.040]  for TV to that wall over there in just a moment. And it's the Hoover Dam. And behind it, you've
[46:16.040 --> 46:20.160]  got billions of gallons of water. That dam broke, it would flood and kill thousands below.
[46:20.160 --> 46:26.880]  It provides power to most of several states, like Nevada and other areas, Arizona. But
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.800]  socialism is up there trying to crush, and the wall holding it back is Trump, is you,
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.120]  is Info Wars. But you know, I'd point out here that we are the wall, but we're also
[46:38.120 --> 46:44.480]  down below with our children, that the system is targeting. And so that's why what you're
[46:44.480 --> 46:48.440]  doing is so incredibly precious, and why I salute you, and why I thank you, and why
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.880]  I want you to count the cost again and realize that now is the time to be super active, super
[46:52.880 --> 46:59.080]  on the streets with the energy you've got that overrides the enemy and shows that mainstream
[46:59.080 --> 47:04.840]  media is a fraud, and it works as a mouthpiece for the globalist. So I'm going to hit some
[47:04.840 --> 47:09.680]  news, and I'm going to go to your calls here. But I just wanted to point out for TV viewers
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.840]  and radio listeners something right now. You see these four products, I was thinking last
[47:13.840 --> 47:19.400]  night and this morning, with all these dozens of products on sale right now with free shipping
[47:19.400 --> 47:23.440]  and triple Patriot points to your next order and an auto ship, biggest deals of the year
[47:23.440 --> 47:28.200]  so far. And so many products that have already sold out, so many closest selling out. What's
[47:28.200 --> 47:33.080]  going on? What are the most important products we've got right now? DNA forces, and up there,
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.880]  I don't have a bottle of it in here because I took it out of my office, I'm taking it,
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.760]  but it should be there as well. But it's VitaMemeralFusion, Ultra12, Cabochill, and
[47:40.760 --> 47:46.600]  X2, purest, cleanest iodine in a spray bottle, so it aerosolizes into your throat and into
[47:46.600 --> 47:54.080]  your lungs. Everything here is so amazing. The Cabochill, to relax you and give you a
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.280]  focus relaxation when you get home from work and you're tired or you're at work and you're

[48:04.720 --> 48:08.800]  of years as the most powerful plant that the quote Supreme Being gave them to give them
[48:08.800 --> 48:14.320]  euphoria, focus, and connection to God. That's what they say about it. And what I'm wanting
[48:14.320 --> 48:17.200]  to tear people's heads off at 7, 8, and 9 because I'm really been stressed out and working
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.080]  too much, can't wind down, taking too much caffeine, too much turbo force, boom, it's
[48:21.080 --> 48:27.080]  Cabochill. And two different strengths. It's 50% off right now. You get the extra strength

[48:42.280 --> 48:46.400]  we can't get more until next year. We should have put in a bigger order. It took them longer
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.520]  to get it to us because supply chain issues, highest quality amino acids, the vitamins,
[48:50.520 --> 48:55.480]  the minerals, the D3, the zinc, the C, with the minerals, everything you need. Because
[48:55.480 --> 49:01.480]  if you're not having one of the essentials you need, you're wide open. But if you've

[49:24.400 --> 49:30.400]  And then of course, Ultra 12, which people don't get is so essential as well. It's the
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.160]  highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue. That's the one that I personally think should
[49:34.160 --> 49:38.520]  be selling out. It's not. A lot of folks are ordering it. It's 50% off as well. Triple
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.160]  page red points, free shipping, all of it. Get this now and it funds the operations.
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.000]  Remember, I don't have George Soros. I don't have the global stuff. I didn't make $30
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.760]  billion off the stimulus package like Jeff Bezos did. Okay. I'm a regular guy, so I
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.760]  pay the regular tax rate at 40%. And I was doing accounting this morning and just it's
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.520]  always the same. Like we're right there, on empty, funding, moving forward, doing everything
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.280]  we can and don't have the extra funds I could sell, everything I've got and have us run
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.920]  extra two months. Okay. So I got a funds to run three, four months right now. That's
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.720]  not acceptable. I'm not bitching at you. I'm not bitching at myself. I hate coming up here
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.200]  and saying, please support us, but these are great products you already need. So take action
[50:18.200 --> 50:24.320]  now. Keep InfoWars on the air. Just doing that alone is a great feat in the face of
[50:24.320 --> 50:31.360]  the new world order. InfoWarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139 and get the DNA Force Plus with
[50:31.360 --> 50:37.920]  the PQQ, the CoQ10 and so much more that actually clean up the mitochondria. They make telomeres
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.000]  not shrink as fast. They don't make the telomeres grow, but they don't make them shrink as fast,
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.360]  which is the same thing. And that's when your telomeres get short, you die. I mean, as close
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.680]  as the fountain, the youth are going to get DNA Force Plus, InfoWarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[50:52.680 --> 50:56.720]  But the globalists are coming in, folks. They now admit this is a fight between good and
[50:56.720 --> 50:59.800]  evil. They admit they're going to persecute everybody if they're able to get in. They
[50:59.800 --> 51:03.800]  are going to want to try to take all the independent media off the air, not just censor everybody
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.320]  off the internet, but take us off the air, period. Rush Limbaugh is dying. I mean, this
[51:08.320 --> 51:15.440]  is the battle of the gods here. This is just so epic as everything comes to a head. And
[51:15.440 --> 51:19.320]  there's the communism up there behind the Hoover Dam. It's InfoWars. It's Trump. It's
[51:19.320 --> 51:23.800]  your action. And there, at the same time, we're all down there together, your children,
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.000]  your family, all of us together, hoping that us, the men, and the women that are involved
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.880]  and active can hold back the enemy. I want to get Trump back in and then turn the tide
[51:32.880 --> 51:37.080]  and move against the enemy and move over the wall and start pushing back against these
[51:37.080 --> 51:41.240]  people and go on the offense. The enemies never face any offense, whether it's Antifa
[51:41.240 --> 51:45.120]  Thugs on the street attacking innocent men, women and children and killing people and
[51:45.120 --> 51:48.040]  knocking their teeth out and shooting cops in the head for no reason, or whether it's
[51:48.040 --> 51:53.360]  the Clapper and Brennan and the Clintons and Obama and Skelter and all these perverts and
[51:53.360 --> 51:59.040]  globalists and murderers and pedophiles. That's why they think they're invincible because
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.440]  the system, the trillions of dollars, the mega rich have tried to make their minions think
[52:04.440 --> 52:10.760]  they're invincible, but they're not. You look at who they can't even get good looking people
[52:10.760 --> 52:13.880]  to serve them. They can't even get smart looking people to serve them. They can't even get
[52:13.880 --> 52:20.000]  strong people to serve them. You look at CNN or MSNBC at the empty husk, the soulless crap
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.840]  that the enemy has actually been able to find. It's a joke. You look at the CEOs, these corporations
[52:24.840 --> 52:32.920]  and who they are. They're disgusting, ladies and gentlemen, because they're all about selfishness
[52:32.920 --> 52:39.680]  and all about themselves and all about their power. So coming up, your phone calls, and
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.240]  we'll look at this incredible commission funded by foreign banks, foreign monies, the debate
[52:44.240 --> 52:48.200]  commission, the woman that hates Trump. So it's going to be Trump against Biden and this
[52:48.200 --> 52:52.080]  woman. They're going to be muting Trump's mic. Always the last debate is mainly on foreign
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.200]  policy. No foreign policy allowed because Biden is all these wars and death instruction
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.840]  and Trump is all this peace and ending wars. I mean, this is incredible. The rigging, the
[53:01.840 --> 53:05.520]  scamming, the fraud and then all the election fraud that's coming out. All the Democrats,
[53:05.520 --> 53:10.920]  they're busting, hiding ballots and voting the names of dead people and ballad harvesting
[53:10.920 --> 53:16.200]  and scamming and new project Veritas videos coming out about big tech whistleblowers admitting
[53:16.200 --> 53:20.160]  that they're all rigging it for Democrats as if we needed them to tell us the sky's
[53:20.160 --> 53:27.240]  blue. The quickening is here. The acceleration, the singularity, it's all here. It's all now.
[53:27.240 --> 53:35.480]  It's all real. The universe, God, the devil, your soul in eternity, all of us real folks.
[53:35.480 --> 53:38.880]  Think of the wonder and the beauty and the incredibleness of this universe and then ask
[53:38.880 --> 53:43.360]  yourself, what are you doing to protect yourself and your family? Are you defending freedom?
[53:43.360 --> 53:46.840]  Are you praying to God? Are you supporting those that are the tip of the spear? And many
[53:46.840 --> 53:50.920]  of you are. I commend you, but I ask those of you that haven't. All of you need a good
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.280]  vitamin mineral amino acid system to defend your immune system. Period. Every winter and
[53:55.280 --> 54:00.760]  fall, regardless, we always promote it like winter sun or like vitamin refusion. All of
[54:00.760 --> 54:06.320]  you need the essential iodine, the X2 spray. All of you need ultra-twelve. All of you should
[54:06.320 --> 54:09.640]  have Cavachill, and you should take it, and you should use it, and you should see how
[54:09.640 --> 54:14.880]  great it is. Infowarstore.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[54:14.880 --> 54:19.280]  We're selling out of the X2 spray. We're almost sold out of the regular X2. We're selling
[54:19.280 --> 54:25.800]  out a vitamin refusion. People are going crazy. It'll be gone. And like I said, my goodness,
[54:25.800 --> 54:29.120]  I get two or three weeks at this rate, and that's a bummer. I wish I would have ordered
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.480]  more of it. I didn't know if I had the money. I didn't know if you'd buy it, so I bought
[54:32.480 --> 54:36.280]  a smaller amount, and I'm not bitching. It's just that's the problem. I'm not a businessman.
[54:36.280 --> 54:39.640]  I don't want to spend all my time studying business and trying to find money to stay
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.320]  on there, which I do, and I'm not complaining. I want to be in the fight. Have we just ever
[54:43.320 --> 54:45.040]  got...
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.320]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.920]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[54:55.920 --> 55:02.160]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[55:02.160 --> 55:08.120]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[55:08.120 --> 55:13.720]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[55:13.720 --> 55:20.200]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[55:20.200 --> 55:27.240]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[55:27.240 --> 55:33.400]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[55:33.400 --> 55:39.800]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[55:39.800 --> 55:45.560]  a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.520]  With two weeks left until the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[55:50.520 --> 55:56.680]  the top some already amazing sales. It's Black Friday, comes in October special, something
[55:56.680 --> 56:00.520]  we did last year that was very, very popular. We did it for the whole month last year. We
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.240]  can only do it for 11 days until the end of the month because stocks are low and a lot
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.480]  of our best selling products. But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing
[56:09.480 --> 56:15.680]  at 50% off with free shipping is Ultra 12, incredible high quality B12, take it under

[56:24.480 --> 56:30.040]  that are essential and amino acids to make sure your body uploads it better. It's back

[56:37.000 --> 56:48.800]  of Black Friday, comes in October sale at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[56:48.800 --> 56:55.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name
[56:55.480 --> 57:07.720]  of the hotel you stayed in last night? No. Just remember who Big Tech is, an army of
[57:07.720 --> 57:15.800]  scum, an army of Satanist, an army of pedophiles, an army of trash. Now telling Congress go
[57:15.800 --> 57:21.000]  to hell, we'll censor the president, we'll censor his campaign, you will not even show
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.720]  C-SPAN clips of Joe Biden saying, I ordered them to fire this prosecutor who was investigating
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.840]  my son or I'll take a billion dollars away and son of a bitch, within one hour it was
[57:31.840 --> 57:34.440]  done. I said, you're not getting the billion, I'm
[57:34.440 --> 57:37.520]  going to be leaving here and I think it was what, six hours? I looked, I said, I'm leaving
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.320]  it's six hours. If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money. Oh, son of
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.560]  a bitch. Got fired. Oh, but the Republicans are going to have
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.920]  an emergency hearing 17 days out and talk about Section 230.
[57:52.920 --> 57:58.520]  To protect the growing Internet economy, Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications
[57:58.520 --> 58:05.240]  Decency Act in 1996. It ensured that companies can moderate their network without assuming
[58:05.240 --> 58:11.240]  responsibility for the acts of all users. Under Section 230, bad actors who use the
[58:11.240 --> 58:17.640]  Internet are responsible for their own actions, not the intermediaries they happen to use,
[58:17.640 --> 58:19.920]  because Congress said, don't shoot the messenger.
[58:19.920 --> 58:24.600]  These companies, these tech platforms control the big ones. I mean, they control the channels
[58:24.600 --> 58:28.400]  of social communication, they control the news that people get and receive.
[58:28.400 --> 58:31.320]  Exactly. They have enormous power, enormous power,
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.120]  and they insist, Tucker, that they don't discriminate. They say, oh no, we don't discriminate.
[58:35.120 --> 58:41.400]  So fine, all my bill says is, submit to an audit, an outside independent audit, prove
[58:41.400 --> 58:45.840]  that you're not discriminating on the basis of speech, and you can keep your special
[58:45.840 --> 58:49.280]  immunities. This isn't Section 230. This isn't them violating.
[58:49.280 --> 58:52.880]  The fact that they said they're not a publisher, then they go in and censor, violating their
[58:52.880 --> 58:58.400]  utility status. It's racketeering when they all get together and they admit they have
[58:58.400 --> 59:02.640]  meetings and get together, and they decide what they're going to do and how they're
[59:02.640 --> 59:07.840]  going to control your life and how they're going to surveil you. They're watching you
[59:07.840 --> 59:11.440]  to then be able to come in and walk what you do.
[59:11.440 --> 59:17.000]  We're here to contribute to a healthy public square, not compete to have the only one.
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.520]  We know that's the only way our business thrives and helps us all defend against these new
[59:21.520 --> 59:22.520]  threats.
[59:22.520 --> 59:28.440]  The allegation that we make, the Republicans, is that you're discriminatory against us, against
[59:28.440 --> 59:34.680]  the Republicans. Your post says, well, there were some Democrat politicians, too, so out
[59:34.680 --> 59:42.880]  of 600,000, if there were 1,000 Republicans and 10 Democrats, it still seems somewhat
[59:42.880 --> 59:46.640]  biased. If it's 50-50, then that's a whole different ball game.
[59:46.640 --> 59:53.240]  Well, we agree that the result was not impartial, and that is why we corrected and we fixed
[59:53.240 --> 59:54.240]  it.
[59:54.240 --> 59:59.960]  Now people are going, whoa, it's not just Alex Jones, it's everybody. You don't turn
[59:59.960 --> 1:00:04.480]  a light switch off instantly with tearing. That would get people's attention if some
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:09.640]  of the lights go off. That might wake the cattle up. But if the light slowly turned
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:15.120]  down over three months, starting about three years ago, four years ago when Hillary lost,
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:20.200]  they started really shadow banning, controlling, testing out their systems. But see, in the
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:26.320]  last four years, about 50% of the net was closed. Now in the last couple of months, 90%
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:31.440]  is now been closed. It's accelerating. Until I told you, members of Congress, the judiciary
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:37.400]  committees, the courts, police departments, the president, intelligence agencies, they
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:44.600]  all have to bow to the technocrats that now decide what can be seen on the platforms and
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:51.200]  what can't. Ahead of, I would say, within three days of the election, for 14 days from
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:01:00.440]  now, you will have 99.9% total freezing of 100 billion people's accounts in America.
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.200]  All of you, you won't be able to private message anybody on Facebook. You won't be able, you'll
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:08.800]  post something, but no one will see it. You won't be able to go anywhere. You won't be
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:14.320]  able to send people emails. They're testing this ahead of activating their terrorist quads
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:20.040]  that Auntie was just a cover for, and burning down buildings and blowing up police departments,
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:26.360]  plunging the dollar, plunging the stock market, and saying President Trump must be removed
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:33.000]  or you're not going to remove the pain. If you think things cannot possibly get worse,
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:39.920]  trust me, they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election. And of course,
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:44.760]  when you give in to them, they only hurt you worse. It's what psychotic criminals do. And
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:51.240]  as soon as you recognize that these are willful, hardcore, selfish, drug addict, devil-worshipping
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:58.560]  monsters. If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying, and more importantly
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:04.800]  what they're actually doing, when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story, that was
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:10.360]  a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information, because they've
[1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:15.160]  also been on record saying coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to let
[1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:20.120]  anyone but quote authoritative sources. That means CNN, New York Times, what a joke, come
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:24.680]  out and say who the real winner is. That way they can contest the election, even though
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:28.880]  Trump's declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:34.280]  crisis, call for secession, and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden.
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:37.800]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying. And so when you see them in
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:42.200]  concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story, that is a drill, that
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:46.960]  is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition the public that Big
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:52.360]  Tech works in unison to suppress speech and information. This is Election Meddling 101,
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:03:05.360]  this is illegal.
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:31.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this live October 20th, Tuesday
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:04:00.520]  edition.
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:10.760]  That said, though, on the COVID worldwide tyranny front, there have been the biggest
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:18.480]  developments yet. I mean, they're following exactly what we knew they were going to do.
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:22.640]  Just as draconian, just as horrible as we can predict, this is an unlimited permanent
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:29.640]  power grab that collapses the economy, and that's the real weapon. So let me just read
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:32.960]  you these headlines and then I'll go to your calls. And then I'm asking listeners, it's
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:37.840]  important to chronicle this. I've been watching Trump's speeches the last few days, and he's
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:42.160]  been rattling off all the different horrible things the globalists have done, and then
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:47.240]  all the good things he's done, which is good, it's true, it needs to happen. But when I
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:51.440]  look at how bad they are, it's like hard to believe, but it's true. I mean, they really
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:55.000]  backed China that's killed over 100 million of their own people and has a million Christians,
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.760]  million Buddhists, 3 million Muslims in death camps, they sell their organs, they brag they
[1:04:58.760 --> 1:05:02.520]  did, and Apple and all the big companies are over there making money off of it publicly,
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.640]  and LeBron James loves it. I mean, it's just, it's one thing if you took the money from
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.040]  the Chi Cosmos to tell us we're bad because we're America. I don't hate him because he's
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:13.400]  a black guy. I hate him because he's a piece of crap and an arrogant piece of filth worth
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:18.200]  hundreds of millions of dollars. Tell me how much I suck all day while he helps evil.
[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:21.920]  And that damn G.G. Ping and just all of them, it just makes me want to throw up, man. I
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.800]  hate the white new world order people, the black ones, the brown ones, the yellow ones.
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:30.760]  I hate their dirty guts. And the Chi comms trying to fund a race war in this country,
[1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:34.600]  they make me sick because America is so much better than those other countries and the
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:42.080]  globalists know it. But look at these headlines on one of your calls. Ireland forced to have
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:46.560]  second lockdown. Even as more UN officials say lockdowns are killing the third world
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:50.120]  and shouldn't happen, but they directed it when they do it. They say it's because the
[1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:56.600]  UN, now the UN is playing good cop because they know the backlash. Rockland, New York
[1:05:56.600 --> 1:06:03.320]  officials or its tyrants will begin patrolling streets and handing out fines of $15,000 for
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:09.040]  violating COVID restrictions, not staying six feet apart or wearing a mask. What a cult.
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:13.560]  Oh, you're not six feet apart. Let me inspect you. Let me arrest you. Let me beat your brains
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:18.640]  in. Despite being responsible for thousands of COVID deaths like 10,000 in New York nursing
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:26.520]  homes, crazy killer Como released book claiming his efforts were mostly successful. Chinese
[1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:30.920]  billionaires boost their fortunes at record pace during coronavirus crisis, just like
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:36.000]  the globalist billionaires, Zuckerberg and Bezos and all of them did here. It's designed
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:44.480]  to consolidate the Davos group admits it. They should all be indicted. Manhattan emptied
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:49.520]  out during the pandemic, but big tech is moving in New York Times consolidating power because
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:53.920]  they'll turn us back on in a while, turn us off when they want. They know what they're
[1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:58.880]  doing. This is total martial law. Big tech moving into Manhattan to spike coronavirus
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:03.600]  fears. Oh, because they know when it's going to be turned off. PA Bank reclaims cookie sales
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:08.480]  that predicted the past presidential elections are selling overwhelmingly Trump cookies. That's
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:13.480]  some good news on that front that that got stuck in the stack. For many Californians,
[1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:18.760]  the pandemic marks the end of barely making it. San Jose Mercury News. Oh, COVID made
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:25.120]  them go bankrupt. COVID made them commit suicide. COVID made them be poured. COVID made them
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.280]  close their business. No, the government using it as a cover to wage war against small businesses,
[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:35.080]  telling you you're non essential and you buying that made you go bankrupt or commit suicide.
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.600]  Because instead of overcoming their attack and saying, I'm going to fight this, you said,
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:46.560]  I'm a victim. It's all over and blew your head off. Don't be a victim. Get into being
[1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:54.840]  victorious and setting your will against the enemy and you're only going to get stronger.
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:08:01.480]  That which does not kill us only makes it stronger. Frederick Nietzsche coronavirus was really
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:13.520]  a rip off of a Roman saying work and struggle and conflict and defeat and victory only makes
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:19.880]  us stronger. You quote it from the Latin that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:25.600]  Look at this coronavirus Ireland may return to full national lockdown for six weeks and
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:31.280]  surprise moves. Sky News. So the British over 300 years couldn't keep Ireland occupied over
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:37.520]  500 years couldn't occupy Scotland. Both are shut down like North Korea. Wake up Scotland.
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:42.360]  Wake up Ireland. Throw off the global exchange. You threw the bricks off. Can you throw the
[1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:51.080]  New World Order off and Brussels in the UN? Damn it. Mass Virtue Signaler Gary Linker
[1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:54.280]  caught not wearing masks. None of them do. They don't know it's a fraud. They're on tape
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:59.360]  saying it's a fraud. Day both Braggs the world reset saving us from the carbon footprint.
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:04.640]  And it gets into how the bankers are consolidating power. Let's let's start going to your calls.
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:11.040]  Kevin David Tyler Darrell Joseph Paul Gordon Todd James. We're going to everybody. Let's
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:16.440]  go to David in Iceland. You calling in from Racky of Echo. Were you calling in from David?
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:25.600]  I'm calling from Eskijers. Well welcome. Well thanks for having me. I got two points. One
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:33.600]  is I love the product. We use the X3 every day. And the bodies. But we can't get much
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:40.120]  in Europe. You know. That's right. Europe has a daily allowance way below ours and really
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:45.800]  tries to suppress nutrients over there, don't they? Yeah. We don't get the we don't get
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:52.960]  the male vitality. We don't get the what do you call it? The knockout can't get that.
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:55.880]  We can't get a lot of stuff. That's right. A lot of stuff. I'm not even allowed to ship
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:10:05.560]  over there. That's right. But second point. You Americans have a responsibility, you know,
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:12.280]  because you're not just voting for yourself, but for the whole world, really. If if America
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:17.840]  can end the lockdown, if America can end all the bullshit, you know, we'll be forced to
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:24.160]  follow like good little pets. You know, and I agree with you because the UN is close to
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:28.200]  the breaking point. They're now acting like they're not behind the lockdowns and all the
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:31.600]  tyranny when the UN is the one directing it for Bill Gates. So the fact that they're even
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:34.920]  having the back office thing. Oh, it's the nation's doing it shows that we're starting
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:44.520]  to win. I hope you're right. I hope you're right. It's a little tough to handle. And
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:52.920]  you know, we just we pray for the American people, not to make the right decision. What's
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:56.480]  your business over in Iceland? What do you do? Are you a fisherman? Are you a carpenter?
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:01.680]  Are you an engineer? I work for an American company. I work for the aluminum company of
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:07.360]  America. Cool. They've outsourced their labor here. And that's good for us. Where should
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:14.360]  I visit if I ever come to Iceland? Where should I visit? You ever come to Iceland? You should
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:19.200]  visit just the hot springs. It's over at the pool. That's what I've heard. The hot springs
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:22.400]  are amazing. God bless you, David. We love you. Keep spreading the word, sir. Thanks
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:27.440]  for the support. Thank you. Darryl in Texas, you're on the year. Welcome. We're taking
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:35.120]  my call, Alex. I just have two quick questions and I'll get all one is William Barr compromised
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:41.160]  and to when can we hope to see indictments on these traders? I mean, if the things happening
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:48.080]  now happen 100 years ago, I don't think there'd be enough rope to hang them all. I think Barr
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:51.760]  definitely has been compromised since he was in the CIA. I think he represents a group
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:55.160]  that wants to stabilize things and doesn't want to totally screw the country, but he
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:01.360]  still knows the Democrat deep state has dirt on a bunch of Republicans. So they're blackmailed
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:04.960]  not for as bad a stuff as Hunter and things, but still they're all a bunch of wimps. They've
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:13.280]  had generations of put in a wimps and lawyers up there that'll do whatever they're told.
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:19.240]  What do you think, sir? I'm mad. I'm mad in the morning and I'm mad at night when I go
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:25.040]  to bed. I get up in the morning and the first thing on TV is nothing but lies and none
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:29.960]  of the real news and it just, you know, impuriates. I just stay mad all the time. You had another
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.360]  question, Darryl. You want to hold over or you want to shoot the question out real quick?
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:38.960]  Do what now? You had one more question. What was it? Oh, the other question is, do you
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:44.840]  think the incident with the senator in Michigan was a false flag because I do? Are you talking
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:48.680]  about the governor? Yeah, the governor. Oh, absolutely. They now admit it was a false
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  flag, sir. It was staged by the FBI. God bless you. Introducing in full war's life, pure
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:02.120]  turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very

[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.480]  got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months. Some of our staff
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:31.240]  like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing for
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:35.040]  their anti-inflammatory action and so much more. And they fund the info war. So get

[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:58.080]  and quite frankly, bad news for you. We've confirmed from high level sources in our
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:01.240]  own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election and they're going to really
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:05.960]  try to do it through that crazy, they intend to not just shut down info wars but have yours
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:10.800]  truly Alex Jones arrested. And here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:15.120]  and they're coming after the economy and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:19.440]  for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash. But here's the
[1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:25.080]  really good news. The really good news. Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:30.160]  asleep and we understand that the globalist are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:35.040]  understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:40.880]  roots forever. That's why we must come together now as Americans of erase color and creed and
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:46.480]  repudiate the new world order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump. But also the information
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:55.040]  war support independent media that tells the truth like info wars.com. Thank you. You're
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:19.040]  listening to the Alex Jones show. I came here looking for something. I couldn't find anywhere
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:32.560]  else. I don't want to be nobody. Just want a chance to be myself. I've done a thousand
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.200]  miles of farming. We got some big breaking election fraud news and a big development
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:42.920]  that just came in. It's going live on info wars.com the next 10 minutes concerning Hunter
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.080]  Biden's laptop. That's next segment. Special guest joins us. We'll continue with your calls.
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:54.320]  We're taking calls right now. Let's go ahead and talk to Todd in North Carolina. Todd,
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:16:03.120]  thanks for calling. Hey, Alex, just wanted to mention your living defense product. That's
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:10.760]  an amazing product. Anytime I travel or go out to eat, especially around Thanksgiving,
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:16.000]  you just never know how the turkey is going to settle on the stomach. And I pop a couple
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:24.480]  of living defenses and the stomach's totally settled. I feel balanced. It's a lifesaver
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:30.560]  because nothing is worse than getting a bad meal. And especially if you pay good money
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:34.720]  for it and everything and then you regret it. Well, let's just call me and remind me
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:37.760]  of the supplements. I should be taking them all. And I'm not a big supplement guy so I'm
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:41.080]  always having to remember to take them. Remember to take the X2. Remember to take the DNA force.
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:45.560]  But yeah, living defense gets out all the unwanted visitors. It's a next level really
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:53.680]  herbal probiotic. And folks have heard the reviews of people that were on death's doorstep
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:59.120]  and it totally changed their gut flora. So all these known compounds like the black walnut
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.600]  and other things do is amazing. So thanks for your testimony, old brother. What's your
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:07.640]  advice for Trump on the debates with Biden and muting his mic?
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:14.080]  Well, I thought if he hadn't already thought of this, Trump has just got to be Trump. So
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:21.440]  I thought it would be amazing if he had some little cue cards up his sleeve that said Joe
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:28.120]  Biden is a Chinese puppet. Joe Biden is a criminal. You know, he could have a whole
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:33.080]  of sundry of them. You know, so when they mute his mic, he just pulls out the signs
[1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:38.760]  and he steals the conversation right back. Those people, they would blow a gasket.
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:43.800]  That's beautiful if he pulled out like oversized cue cards he's got saying Biden's a Chinese
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:52.360]  agent or or or or or or Hunter Biden's laptop or barisma. Oh, that's a great idea.
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:57.560]  I mean, can you imagine, you know, the headlines would be all about the signs. That's that's
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:01.800]  what the debate would be all about. And here's the deal. They say Trump cheated.
[1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:06.280]  No, they're the ones with the debate commission on the cover next segment, literally funded
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:11.480]  by shadowy multinational groups and sorrows. All the debate moderators hate Trump. So he's
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:15.200]  doubled up on they're going to be muting his mic. They're not allowing him to talk about
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:20.240]  foreign policy, even though the final debate's always about that. I mean, this is so rigged.
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:24.560]  It's ridiculous. So I don't even know if Trump should show up to this. What if he just has
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:30.240]  his own press conference? Yeah, I mean, he could he could certainly do that. But if he
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:37.200]  does decide to go, he's got to find a way to pardon the pun. But Trump, you know, what's
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:41.640]  going on? Oh, he says he's going. Listen, he says he's going. He says he knows it's a red
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:46.680]  game, but he's still going to be part of it. Great points. Todd, thanks for the call.
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:51.520]  All right. Let's go ahead and take a call from Kevin in New York, red zones in New York,
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:57.320]  no early voting, walk in voting canceled. What's happening, Kevin? Alex, how are you, brother?
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:03.080]  Good man. Welcome from New York. Sir, listen, I've been only listening to you for two years,
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:08.040]  but you've blown my mind and you said everything I was thinking for a long time. So thank you.
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:13.280]  Also, I want to say your gear is fantastic. Keep selling that stuff. In New York City,
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:18.120]  I'm in Forest Hills, which is in the Queens area. And I'm I'm Irish Catholic, but we're
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:23.120]  surrounded by Hasidic, the Buharians, which is a Jewish sect. And if you look at the red
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:29.640]  zone map where I do real estate and I can't do business in the areas where I have listings,
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:32.400]  because they've shut down those neighbors, they're going to shut that they've shutting
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:37.920]  down the in-person voting before the election. And they're also going to shut it down during
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:41.480]  the election. I hear that the block is going to be shutting that down. And another thing
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:46.240]  I want to point out, too, is like all these pop up testing centers have shown up everywhere.
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:49.360]  And my son and I, we go around and we do what you do. We just bullhorn them and we tell
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:53.920]  them the hoax, some of the numbers are going to shut people further down.
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:59.200]  Well, what you're doing is beautiful, Kevin, because they admit most of the tests are false
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:04.440]  positive. They keep ramping them up. It's not about death. It's always about, oh, the numbers
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:09.440]  are up. And why do you think DeBlasio sends in Black Lives Matter to beat up people at
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:15.920]  Baptist churches? They try to shut down Catholic churches and they've totally bullied the Orthodox
[1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:21.840]  and Hasidic Jews and arrest them and beat them up. And I've seen the maps where they
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.840]  particularly shut down those Jewish neighborhoods. Why are they doing that?
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:29.600]  Um, you know, you probably know better than I would. I just, I just, I don't know why
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:34.880]  all over Democrats chose Jews to pick on. It's weird. It's insane. And when you go to
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:39.280]  those areas where the testing sites are in Q Garden, Northern Forest Hills, which are
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:44.200]  predominantly Jewish neighborhoods, you look at the line and they're not the Jews, the
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:49.360]  Jews, the Hasidics, they're not getting tested. So these numbers are just fabricated. I bullhorn
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:53.560]  these people. Like, what are you guys doing? COVID? The numbers are hoax. A lot of it is
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:58.120]  the main Hasidic doctors were the first ones to say vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and that
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:02.080]  no one dies when you take it preemptively. I mean, and which has now been confirmed.
[1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:05.640]  But I mean, remember, remember all those Hasidic doctors were the first ones in New York?
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:06.640]  Yeah.
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:11.640]  I'm something weird going on, man, with the Communists and Hasidic Jews. Because, you
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:17.040]  know, the communists targeted them in different parts of the world. It's really bizarre, weird
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:22.400]  inner leftist politics. I think they just know that those groups, I guess, are so insular
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.480]  that maybe they think they can pick on them because they're not going to complain because
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:27.720]  they expect to be persecuted. I don't know. What do you think?
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:31.320]  Well, I think they're a pocket of Trump supporters. I do a lot of business with them.
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:34.200]  Oh, that's what it is. Exactly. They're almost all Trump supporters. That's why they're
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:36.120]  being bullied. You just answered it.
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.800]  Yeah. They're all Trump supporters. The Buharians are from, you know, Kansas, and in those areas
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:44.360]  and they come over here, very conservative, a lot of money, you know, and they want to
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:45.360]  keep their money.
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:48.960]  No, you just answered the question. It's why we take calls. I'm like, why are they picking
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:53.680]  on the Hasidic Jews? Because they're like 99% vote for Republicans and Trump, just like
[1:21:53.680 --> 1:22:01.080]  the Muslims are 99% voting for Democrats. And they say may win Michigan and Minnesota.
[1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:05.060]  The Democrats. Thank you, Kevin. Great points. Kevin's asking me questions. He's got the
[1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:10.040]  answer. See right there. That's that's the answer. They support Trump. James in FEMA
[1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:12.120]  region one, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:16.480]  Hey, God bless you, brother. How you doing, man? I just you can cut the suspense with
[1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:17.480]  a knife, brother.
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:23.520]  Right on, man. Hey, first of all, product plug. Vitamin mineral fusion basically turned
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.440]  my life around. And I've never felt better in my life. I'm 50. I feel 30. So kudos to
[1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:30.040]  you. I hope to keep cranking that product out.
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:33.480]  Well, I'm going to hold you over so you can finish your calls. We're up against the the
[1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.240]  breaker. But since you're here, spend a minute with your testimony, you know, and we'll run
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:40.560]  it as an ad. Tell us what bottom mineral fusion did for you, James.
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:44.960]  Well, you know, like I said, I'm 50 years old. I'm a single day out of two teen boys
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:49.440]  and just life just drags you down. No energy, you know, just feeling lethargic all the time.
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:55.000]  And I tried over the counter or, you know, CVS type of vitamins. I didn't do anything.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:01.360]  I, you know, was a started watching your show and decided I'd try it out. And man, I tell
[1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:07.000]  you what, I just feel so invigorated, you know, just lots of energy. I'm sleeping well.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:11.440]  I don't get sick ever. Just an amazing, amazing product. I truly love it.
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:16.120]  Well, just so you know, we go to top nutrition as top doctors, top scientists, top firms
[1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:20.960]  that are the best known. And we say, what is the best vitamin mineral amino acid thing
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:26.120]  for us to take and for us to sell to our audience? And it has a big cost and product for us.
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:28.680]  So again, the synthetic vitamins, the other stuff, they do nothing. That's what gives
[1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:33.080]  them a bad name. Good ones that do incredible things. Vitamin mineral fusion is back in
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:36.800]  stock, but it's selling out very, very quickly. It's got the zinc, the vitamin D three, it's

[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:52.520]  helped win the war against the global so far. Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:25:01.000]  life? Are you sleeping too well at night? Is your city too safe? Well, not anymore.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  We're introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:13.520]  with violence, looting, rampant violence and even homelessness. The secret is a special
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:20.480]  blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity. No more pesky lawn order when Democrats
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:26.960]  are in charge. Nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:33.800]  burn to the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:41.320]  fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:56.880]  door. COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out and is being
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:59.880]  incrementally orchestrated. First, it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty. That's
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:04.080]  all I've done. It's two months and it's six months and it's a year. Now Bill Gates has
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:11.800]  10 years and people are not saying I like my mask. I like my face diaper. I like my
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:15.600]  being key. And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:23.640]  death numbers. This is our new neurotic control freak society, overseen by robots, overseen
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:30.440]  by AI and all of it is designed to make humans not essential. That's why out of the gates
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:38.520]  they tell us, you are not essential. You are not essential. Your company, your restaurant,
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:45.000]  your job, your profession is not essential. This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:27:03.680]  and Bill Gates sits on top of it. Come on folks. Let's reject this. You're listening
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:28.080]  up. She's a razor shot. She'll get away. She'll get away. We are back live. We are broadcasting
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:33.480]  worldwide. We're going to finish up with James, hit this breaking news and then go right to
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:39.240]  our guest. When he's gone in 30 minutes, we will go back to Gregory, Jake, Tyler, Marshall,
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:46.840]  Joseph, Paul and Gordon and then Leo Zagami. Really insider. He was in the real Illuminati,
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:51.920]  the real actual Italian Illuminati P2 Lodge as close as you get to the real deal. I mean
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:55.280]  it's the real deal and people go, oh, you can't trust him. No, he was inside and got
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:58.560]  out of it and exposed it. He's going to be looking at the election and all the big developments
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:03.400]  and looking how the Vatican ties into it and the black pope. That old civil war inside
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:07.800]  the Catholic churches. There's a civil war happening everywhere in our own bodies, in
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:13.200]  our own minds, our own souls and in the Protestant church, the Catholic church and the Republican
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:17.680]  party, the Democratic party inside the FBI, inside the NSA. It's insane. But finishing
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:22.120]  up a James, we're going to talk about Dems, the election, Trump, Roger Stone from FEMA
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:27.480]  region one. Go ahead, sir. Right on brother. Hey, so I think it was yesterday or the day
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.840]  before at Trump's rally when he essentially called out bar. He said, you know, it's a
[1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:36.640]  good thing that Dems don't have, it's a good thing that Dems have a bar as the attorney
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.920]  general because he's such a nice guy. He doesn't want to destroy families. He doesn't want
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:46.560]  to destroy reputation. That rubbed me so the wrong way. And I'm wondering, and I had
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:52.320]  to call you to talk to you, was Trump basically putting a warning flag on bar and saying you
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:56.440]  need to wake up and do something? Do we have criminal evidence that buyer is just sitting
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:57.440]  on and doing not?
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:03.360]  Trump's criticized bar. He's criticized Pompeo. He's criticized all of them as it's not doing
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.600]  their damn jobs. Trump's saying, lock these people up. Listen, the Hunter Biden emails,
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:14.200]  they're real. They admit them. The lawyers admit it. They're open and shut. Giuliani
[1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:18.120]  has the thousands of emails. They've called the people up and confirmed the meetings that
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:22.880]  are in the emails and they've gotten the email from the other side. So they're just waiting
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:26.920]  for Biden to say it's not real, but notice he'll never say it's not real. They go, oh,
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:30.360]  the Russians, they got them. The Russians have nothing to do with it. It was a computer
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:35.360]  shop and they have the signature at the computer shop of Hunter Biden and they have his lawyer
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.640]  and his emails. So everybody trying to gas like it. Oh, this is fake. We have Democrats
[1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:46.920]  on video Biden campaigners, operative saying, no, no, it's real. It's just misrepresented
[1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:51.040]  by the Russians. Yeah, right. Where's your homework? The Russians ate it. You know, why
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:55.280]  didn't you clean up your room? The Russians, why didn't you eat your vegetables? The Russians
[1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:02.240]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. Anything on Roger Stone. You want to comment on him?
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:07.360]  There goes James. Now, Patrick Halley writes for national file.com epic times. You name
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:11.800]  it. Great guy. And he was coming on yesterday about election fraud and something he broke
[1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:15.880]  big in Texas. But I went off on other subjects with him. I want to get back into that a bunch
[1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:20.840]  of new big breaking developments of the rigging of the debate. You thought the last two were
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:26.080]  rigged. Well, this is just ridiculous from every angle. But this is the big one I want
[1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:33.160]  to go to. Boom. Rudy Giuliani announces new documents to be released Wednesday. That's
[1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:40.040]  tomorrow will show financial crimes and personal crimes by the Biden families. We were wondering
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:43.840]  he said there's going to be five data dumps. So this will be the this will be the third
[1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:50.680]  data dump here of the Biden laptop that they were waiting for Biden to deny it was real.
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:55.080]  He won't do that. So they're going to keep moving forward with the information. Here's
[1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:01.400]  a clip of Giuliani talking about it. Next 24 48 hours, are you going to bring forward
[1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:07.080]  a potential other information related to non-financial criminal activity? We're going to do both.
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:13.400]  There'll be more financial criminal activity, more truth on the stuff that we already have
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:20.320]  and some even bigger deals that are eye popping and some personal conduct that has to be brought
[1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:24.960]  to the attention of the public for it, you know, to make sure people are safe.
[1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:33.240]  So in someone's shot video off of Steve Bannon show, I have no idea why they wouldn't just
[1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:37.120]  download the original. But there he is saying at the full video, the transcript is now on
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:42.160]  info wars.com and news wars.com. And Patrick Howley is joining us so much to hit. I mean,
[1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:45.760]  where do you want to start with this first, then the election fraud coming out everywhere,
[1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:53.520]  some of which you've broken in Texas, the rig debate, just the insanity 13 days out Patrick
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:58.280]  Howley? Yes, I think that the Democrats are engaged
[1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:01.720]  not only in trying to steal this election, but in trying to steal our country away from
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:10.880]  us. And the Hunter Biden situation shows that Joe Biden is completely and utterly corrupted.
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:14.920]  He's completely and utterly blackmailed. He is not capable of being the commander in chief
[1:32:14.920 --> 1:32:19.720]  of the United States military. The military would be terrified of having to take orders
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:24.120]  from this guy not only because of his mental decline, but because of the massive amount
[1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:29.280]  of blackmail that other people around the world have Rudy Giuliani is basically our
[1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:34.360]  American James Bond. He got this laptop and the personal crimes is going to be very, very
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:38.760]  interesting. We know about some of the personal crimes that Hillary Clinton and her people
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:44.800]  have been doing. And these are scumbags. These are scumbag people. And, you know, everybody
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:51.120]  around Joe Biden's a scumbag. You got Joe Cotchett, who was naked in front of his daughters.
[1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:54.960]  You've got Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philly, who is fundraising for Biden. I
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:33:00.120]  can exclusively reveal on this show that he had sex with a prostitute and told her that
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:04.360]  he was going to help her get her kids back from child protective services and then never
[1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:09.480]  did. These are these are disgusting people. These are scumbags. And we don't want disgusting
[1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:13.200]  scumbags running this country anymore. For once, we'd like to have ethical people in
[1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:20.760]  charge. And that's what President Donald Trump represents. He was at a washing machine factory
[1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:24.840]  two months ago and he said, I've discovered China isn't even the one ripping us off most
[1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:28.640]  of the time. It's the middlemen. They get more money than China. We're cutting them
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.240]  out. And we're going to bring all the drug manufacturing back here anyways, because that's
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:35.680]  fair. We can do a better job. But he said, we're cutting the middlemen out. They're
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:39.160]  about to get really pissed. He's literally cutting out all these middlemen, thousands
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:42.840]  of them, some of which make billions a year. The others make hundreds of millions, millions
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:47.880]  a year, literally middlemaning the sellout of America. And as Trump said, our economic
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:51.800]  surrender is over, over, over.
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:55.680]  The masters of the universe have been the people who have sold our economy to China.
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:02.640]  And that's David Rockefeller and his people and all of these folks from the love generation
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:07.360]  and the John Lennon one world generation, I guess they interpreted that to mean that
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:12.240]  one world means selling out American manufacturing and leaching off of this country and getting
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:18.760]  money for themselves. It's despicable. And, you know, the Chinese, you know, look, they
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:23.440]  exploited the situation. They were a developing country. And now they're a superpower because
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:29.440]  our people sold sold us out and sold out the promise of America. And then, you know, in
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:34.160]  the fifties, the houses that didn't even benefit the Chinese people on average. They literally
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.320]  a corrupt cabal here with the corrupt Communist Party, China literally did the biggest heist
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:42.600]  in the world, stealing roughly 80% of our wealth.
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:48.040]  Yes, every country in the world now is governed by oligarchs. And that includes Russia and
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.520]  includes China includes certainly the United States. The United States probably worse than
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:57.400]  anywhere else because the oligarchs have totally consolidated their power and wealth
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:02.280]  in every single industry, crush small business and allowed these mega corporations, these
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:05.400]  globalist corporations. And now they're censoring and now their thugs are beating people up
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:09.400]  for free speech everywhere and knocking black men's teeth out and calling them racist while
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:10.400]  they do it.
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:15.160]  A white person knocking black people's teeth out is now now fighting the Nazi. But but
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.080]  they're being revealed. I mean, my God, look at this debate. We'll talk about when we come
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:21.880]  back, but get into this. I mean, the woman hates Trump. She's on record. The debate
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:25.760]  commission is funded by Soros and foreign banks. They won't let they're going to turn
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:28.840]  Trump's mic off. I mean, this is crazy.
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:34.680]  Yes. Well, I know the debate moderator, that lady from my years in DC journalism. She's
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:41.400]  exactly what you would imagine a nasty, disgusting, despicable, globalist, aporetic, stupid,
[1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:44.600]  stupid as the day is. Wilker.
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:50.680]  Yeah, totally dumb and nasty and awful and just a little aporetic, a little, you know,
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:56.160]  house of cards, glamour, you know, this town, you know, thinking she can go to, you know,
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:01.240]  black tie events. It's it's despicable. She's she's one of them. I cannot stand these people.
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:05.760]  I'm sick and tired of listening to these people. They don't represent us. They're the mouthpieces
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:11.360]  of despicable, globalist oligarchs who are literally exterminating us. And I the the
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:14.120]  idea that these people that there are people out there who still think these people are
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:20.280]  journalists is beyond horrifying. And it needs to stop. It needs to go away after this election.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:25.760]  Well, Kristen Wilker is a joke and a literal anti-American piranha. So we'll play some
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:30.520]  clips of her and talk about what's happening when you come back. But again, the the tone
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:35.600]  deafness of the establishment to rig the debates like they've done it so far is just incredible.
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:39.720]  I think Trump last minute should just announce he's given a speech somewhere else and not
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:44.080]  go to it and then lay out his indictment of the Bidens and all the rest of them in a
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:52.280]  wide wide take part in fraud. As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:57.440]  from the election and the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:02.280]  them and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:08.440]  openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:13.840]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.560]  once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:24.440]  prosecute us and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying.
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.600]  It's what the Obama bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman saying. It's what Nancy
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:35.720]  Pelosi saying. This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:40.320]  the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and to
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:46.480]  say vaccines will be voluntary. Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:51.520]  get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now. Black Friday in October. Last

[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:01.240]  organic resistance against tyranny. You built info wars. You spread the word. You prayed
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:06.720]  for us. You bought the products. You called in. You made recommendations. Info Wars is
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:12.160]  as much yours as it is mine. And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the D platforming
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.120]  under all the D and C lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:22.360]  with band.video, redesigned info wars with all of our great crew with documentary films
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:29.000]  and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day. We are the resistance. You are the resistance.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:34.360]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:39.160]  it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together. It's
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:43.280]  not just a national treasure. It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.200]  it and they can't stand it. And it's everything we talked about comes true. Our credibility
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:53.920]  only goes up together. So I salute you all 2020 election center.com. Just type it in

[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:18.000]  is a clone of the site. The exact same links, the exact same videos, we can comment, share
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:24.320]  them everything. The system is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:28.360]  years ago. Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going to take action once
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:32.720]  reelected against big tech, he's modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:36.720]  right now. So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:41.320]  are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:46.280]  2020electioncenter.com and checking out the new redesign info wars.com and sharing that
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:53.600]  with you. Oh, that really accepts them. Oh, yeah.
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I am a shotgun rider. I am a shotgun rider
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:20.000]  for the San Jacinto line. The desert is my brother. My skin is cracked and dry. I was
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:27.920]  riding on the coast and everything was fine till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:36.320]  The globalists only fired once. They shot me in the chest. They may have wounded me,
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:48.360]  but they'll never get the best of better men. All right, again, when they attack you, they
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:52.800]  think that you're going to take on the victim status and give up because someone did something
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:59.840]  to you. Instead of taking that attack and those scars is beautiful and making it part
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:05.800]  of your signature. We're under attack because America is special and because we are the
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:10.200]  new Atlantis. We are what our forebears want to set up for the new enlightenment, a true
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:15.680]  Christianity, a true pro human future to overthrow Satan and God's plan. And that's why we're
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:19.360]  under attack and that's why there's so much evil here is because good and evil have gathered
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:24.520]  here for the big battle. I want to hit a bunch of issues with Patrick Howley. I appreciate
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:29.160]  coming on on a short notice. I keep hitting other issues with him before I get to the
[1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:34.120]  big one where he was on Newsmax TV and a bunch of other reports last night that I saw and
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.520]  he went over the election. I thought that a great job, but you, you, you were telling
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:41.600]  me about this a month ago, but now you've proven it. You've helped get some investigations
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:44.920]  going. I know it led to some arrest. Tell us about the particular election fraud in
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:47.600]  Texas you discovered.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:52.760]  There are now a number of sworn statements, including from a poll watcher busting the
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:58.760]  fact that there is a massive, massive Democrat voter fraud ring. I knew that this was happening.
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.600]  I honed in on it. We proved it. We showed the world and we continue to show the world.
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:08.160]  There's going to be more developments over the next 24 hours. The FBI is now investigating
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:13.160]  this. Not sure yet if it's going to be good or bad that the FBI is interceding. You never
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:17.920]  know because of these feds. But what we found is that there's a Democrat voter fraud ring
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:22.440]  in Houston. It's being run by Dallas Jones, the Texas political director for the Joe Biden
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:27.960]  campaign who has now been interrogated by the FBI, according to sources within the FBI.
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.000]  What they're doing is drive through voting, mail in voting, all the nonsense that they've,
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.920]  they've put through because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ooh, the dreaded China virus. They
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:39.680]  just fill out what they want. They just substitute it.
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:43.440]  So now, now you're voting as though you're going to Taco Bell and you're going through
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:47.520]  the drive through and they have stacks of driver's licenses. They're pairing up the
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:51.480]  driver's licenses with the people who don't have IDs who are coming through doing drive
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:58.240]  through voting. We know that the Chinese are sending massive amounts of fake IDs, fake
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:00.080]  driver's licenses into this country.
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:06.880]  They've been having bust with 45,000, 200,000. I mean, that's just what the feds are catching
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:12.200]  is just 18 wheelers full of driver's license with names already printed on them. So the
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:17.000]  Democrats put the order in and then the Chinese forged them and ship them.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:21.440]  These are real people who put your personal information out on the internet and then the
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:25.360]  Chinese intercept the personal information, make up a fake driver's license for you. A
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:32.280]  lot of them are college kids. So we know what the scam is here and the, you know, you could
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:36.200]  vote for in this election for Joe Biden and not even know it. And that's how sophisticated
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:38.000]  the Chinese spying is on the internet.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.480]  And it's like dead people. They're also getting dead people's names that keep voting. And so
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:46.160]  the Democrats who are already engaged in fraud everywhere, they're just committed. What do
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:51.280]  you expect to see in the election? We know there's a tsunami for Trump, but can the seawall
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:52.880]  of fraud block it?
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:59.440]  Yes, the seawall of fraud can block it. We just lost a case at the Supreme Court. Shameful
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:04.800]  travesty that the Supreme Court would allow Pennsylvania to count ballots three days after
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:09.640]  election day. This is terrible. The Michigan has already announced that they're not going
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:13.640]  to announce on election night. They're going to steal this thing. Pennsylvania, Michigan,
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:15.200]  Wisconsin, that was our popular.
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:19.200]  Let me just add this. They're following orders from the Democrats. Hillary and others who
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:23.000]  two months ago said, we will not concede. We're going to hold it up. 20th Amendment. Here
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:27.240]  it is. John Roberts, totally blackmailed sides with liberal justice. It allows Pennsylvania
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:32.160]  court non postmarked ballots three days after election. You're right. So what does Trump
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:35.880]  do about this? What do we do about this? I mean, this is criminal.
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:39.320]  The Supreme Court is part of the fix. John Roberts is compromised. We all know that there
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:43.520]  was some thing about how he illegally adopted his kids. It's very possible that he was the
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:48.040]  one on the Epstein flight logs. John Roberts and he's compromised. Everybody knows he's
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:53.080]  compromised. Brendan and Clapper have them in their pocket. So Supreme Court is worthless.
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.200]  They're against us. They're not going to vote with us in a contested election. I think it's
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:02.880]  pretty clear. So here's here's the because the Bushes are against us. Roberts is a bushy.
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:06.560]  The Bushes are on the side of the deep state. Republican and Democrat doesn't matter anymore.
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:11.160]  It's the deep state against the people. So what are we going to do? Well, there are constitutional
[1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:15.760]  ways we can activate state legislatures in the overtime period. The fact of the matter
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:19.480]  is that Joe Biden might not get a security clearance if he's the president elected the
[1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:23.680]  United States. I mean, the Chinese could destroy this country if Joe Biden becomes president.
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:27.120]  No, you're totally right. That's a great way to put it. The Democrats are putting us into
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:31.840]  fake overtime, literal sudden death overtime. They're going to activate riots. They're going
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:36.280]  to activate race war. They've said they are. It just why do we sit here? Again, the Justice
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:41.560]  Department lets them engage in organized crime, election meddling. It's just insane.
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:48.560]  No, we we need to have serious conversations about our county is going to secede are the
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.000]  red counties in this in this country going to secede. I'm not going to live under the
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:56.360]  tyranny of these people. They're going to put a mask on me and, you know, throw rocks
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:01.640]  at me in the street and, you know, mock me if Trump loses the election. Give me a break.
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:08.240]  Oh, yeah, I forgot that part. The actual Maoist or South African reconciliation brainwashing
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:12.480]  the left is announcing that we're going to all be made to go to these courts for supporting
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:16.320]  Trump and have to say we're bad or our bank accounts are taken. I mean, they're they're
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:20.640]  making their move, man. Yep, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:24.240]  they're going to do that after the election for all Trump supporters. It's it's it's the
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:28.040]  most despicable thing I've ever seen in my entire life. This Trump movement has always
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.440]  been pure. You're showing Tucker Carlson there. He's a great guy. I worked for him. I worked
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:37.960]  for Bannon. We figured out that the forgotten Americans in the Midwest needed a hero needed
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:42.040]  a champion. Donald Trump has always been that guy bringing the jobs back and everything
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:46.440]  else. The globalists freaked out and declared World War three as soon as he got into office.
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:50.480]  And so, you know, we're not we're not just going to we're not just going to surrender.
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:55.520]  Oh, well, they took America. Get out of here. This is our country. All right. So we're
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:59.240]  going to get the fact because all the Democrats say they're going to persecute us, not just
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:02.240]  Keith Overman, Robert Reich, all of them. They're going to put us in camps. They're
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  going to imprison us. They're going to enslave us. Little Connie dreams. Are you because
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:10.720]  obviously Trump is going to win in the Lancelot, but you're saying because of fraud and because
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:15.360]  of the blue states and the media and the Supreme Court, they still control pretty much. I mean,
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:19.240]  it looks like, you know, they may actually throw Trump out and then come after us. We
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:23.560]  have to start getting ready for that. No, that's their plan. That's their plan. And
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:28.280]  they will constantly beat it into people's heads that because of these ballot harvesting
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:32.760]  costs of the mail-in ballots, the Trump has somehow lost the election. He's not accepting
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:37.200]  the results. They're already there already. He's not allowed to contest when they're
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:42.160]  the contestors. Yes, they're they're literally the rebels. They're the Confederates. They're
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:46.320]  the ones who are declaring war on the stability of this country. And so, you know, we need
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.160]  to have a real conversation about, are there counties out there that are willing to seed
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:53.880]  from the country if that happens? No, I agree. I was talking to Steve Pacenek. He's overthrown
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:57.880]  like eight governments the other day, and he said, look, we have to be serious here.
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:03.240]  We have to start actually talking about resistance. Okay. And Trump should be having meetings
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:07.520]  about this because he's facing an organized crime syndicate. Hillary and Podesta said
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.480]  we're going to have states to see fraudulently break the country up. Well, he should just
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:17.240]  play clips of that and say we're not standing for that and explain that. We've got to get
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:22.320]  out of front of this now. It's starting to happen. I'm not going to spend the rest of
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:27.160]  my life in a FEMA camp getting jabbed in the face with the butt of a rifle by these idiots
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:32.400]  because of these criminal loser idiot, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Weinstein, Robert Reich,
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.880]  you know, whatever the Anthony Fauci, Anthony Wiener. These people are terrible. Literally
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:42.880]  all a bunch of pervert pedophile midgets that have dreams of them whipping our ass in a
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.760]  FEMA camp ain't going to happen scumbag. Yes, I can. I can reveal on the show Nancy Pelosi
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:55.840]  rented office space to a group that was led by a pedophile named Dr. William Ayers who
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:00.400]  was terrorizing children. Everybody knew it in San Mateo, California, and it was a child
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.360]  welfare group and they helped rig the family courts and the whole CPS system in California
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:08.840]  to take kids away to do collectivist trail rearing. That's the next thing that they want
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:13.160]  after they put everybody in a mask, collectivist trail rearing by the state. This has all been
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:18.440]  laid out in their totalitarian dystopian fantasies. So we need to be serious right now. We can't
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:23.640]  just sit around and watch Fox and think that these idiots like Ben Shapiro, these subversives
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:27.680]  are going to save us or these idiots who have been saying, you know, for four years that
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:32.480]  Obama is going to go to jail on Fox and whipping people. Oh, it's all going to work out. It's
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:37.200]  not going to work out unless we come together. This is the new Continental Congress. We're
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:38.200]  the new founding fathers.
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:41.680]  People have to get aggressive right now and recognize this as an alien outside attack
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:45.120]  that wants to enslave us. Take Ben Shapiro. I wish he was a good guy. But oh, he's got
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.440]  such courage. He endorsed Trump. Finally, I see that as a bellwether that he is hedging
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.320]  his bed and he thinks Trump's going to win that the landslide is so big.
[1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:58.720]  Yeah, well, I mean, he's not he's not on our side. You know, he has his own agenda and
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:02.480]  I don't know if people can understand what the globalist agenda is, but it's in both
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:10.160]  parties. So he's a despicable, despicable and yeah, of course. And look, the you know,
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:15.160]  the I don't need to be ashamed of anything. Our people, the American people built this
[1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:18.680]  country, the American middle class and working class built this country and we're not going
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:19.680]  to give it up.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:23.520]  Well, exactly what you're saying is, hey, we got Trump in and you couldn't do anything
[1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:27.200]  about a globalist. You kill him or whatever. We don't give up. And then you want to start
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:31.160]  pushing and getting violent. Well, you just start the fight. I'll be your Huckleberry.
[1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:34.520]  Five more minutes with you than a bunch of calls. All these callers are straight ahead.
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:37.720]  Tyler Marshall tells the ball. Stay with us.
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:53.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[1:37:20.580 --> 1:54:32.920]  I'm 46 and I'm not putting up with the takeover of this country. I'm scared
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:37.000]  of you brothers. I'm just scared that I'm not going to measure up to as much damage
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:48.840]  as I can. Sweet talking people don't run me out of town. Turn the battleship around.
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:55:11.520]  All right, Patrick, I think this song says it all in closing histories here. It's epic.
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:15.360]  We need to pray for Trump. He's so damn real. It's an incredible time to be alive, brother.
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.000]  What else you want to add to folks out there? In recent decades, we have been under the
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:25.880]  rule of criminal morons, the Harvey Weinstein's of the world, the Gillian Maxwell's of the
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:32.320]  world, the Mossad blackmail operation, these disgusting pedophiles, Joe Biden's friends,
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:36.360]  the credit card companies, everybody selling out America to China and to the rest of the
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:41.600]  world. They molest little kids. They do satanic rituals. They think that Alistair Crowley's
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:47.000]  magic rituals are, you know, they, you know, they worship Lucifer and want to have a one-world
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:53.240]  satanic government. It's, it's disgusting. Oh, that makes that gasoline Maxwell, the
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:58.600]  real pimp that ran Epstein. Oh, she doesn't get to suppress her customer list. Ha, ha,
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:01.440]  burning hell, witch. Tell us about that. I know you've been at the tip of the spear
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:04.840]  on that, Patrick. Yeah, that was a good win. And look, we got
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:11.840]  Keith Rene from next year. I'm coming up sentencing on October 27th. So the satanic pedophilic
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:16.840]  elites are getting desperate. We, thanks to the great Rudy Giuliani have the Hunter Biden
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:22.240]  laptop. These, these are just despicable people. And we've all had enough of them. I think
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:26.680]  everybody from all walks of life has had enough of them. This is not natural. They're not
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.640]  the establishment calling them the establishment gives them too much credit.
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:34.000]  They want to quote me, the elite, and they could have been the elite by being good people.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.080]  They're a counterfeit elite. Real elites sacrifice themselves. Real elites build civilizations.
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:43.440]  Real elites are good. They lead by example. These people lead by evil and corruption and
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:49.040]  pedophilia and satanism. Yes, good people built America and then it has been broken
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:55.080]  and destroyed by parasitic globalist elites, disgusting satanists who think that they're
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:57:00.280]  descended from some kind of pyramid culture dating back to the Nephilim fallen angels
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:04.480]  bloodline. They're insane. They're sickos. They're, they're not smart. Harry Potter is
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:08.400]  about the extent of the education of most of the young leftists nowadays.
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.560]  And they really think at that level and it's only because we're asleep. They think they're
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.920]  winning the battle. When we wake up, they realize, Oh, they were never in the fight.
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:20.560]  We were asleep. None of these people are actually winning. They're going to be exterminated
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:25.200]  as useful idiots as soon as the communists take power. And it's all just mental insanity.
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:29.200]  It's a collective nervous breakdown. Leave the left scum that brings them into power.
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:34.000]  First people they kill is them. Exactly. The useful idiots will be the first to go.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.720]  So listen, if we're responsible people here as we are, and we're going to uphold Western
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:43.000]  civilization, we need to defeat these people. There's no coexisting with these people. We
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:48.040]  are going to win this election. We're going to save stable civil society peacefully. And
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:52.680]  if not, if they do manage to steal this, then, you know, we need to have serious conversations
[1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:56.640]  about having a different country. We're talking about real civil disobedience at this point.
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:03.520]  We better start getting serious and no overt violence, no targeting people. But we're talking
[1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:09.280]  about serious civil disobedience. Peaceful, a peaceful idea of, listen, we're not going
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:16.560]  to live under your laws. We need to have a real conversation about not coexisting with
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:20.400]  these people anymore. And we have to wake up as many of the normie conservatives and the
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:25.160]  Fox viewers as possible in the next couple of weeks. And I think this Hunter Biden laptop
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:29.000]  and a lot of other things that we're going to see about the pedophilic elites, I think
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:32.840]  they'll wake people up. You know what? Do one more minute with us. We're going to calls
[1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:35.920]  because I don't know about what's on that laptop from sources and what you've heard.
[1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:40.040]  I know you have a lot of connections. Back in 60 seconds, Patrick Howley, nationalfile.com,
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:44.680]  amazing site, nationalfile.com. We're at infowars.com. Whatever you do, share those
[1:58:44.680 --> 1:58:48.840]  links.
[1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:55.240]  In fiction, super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic, huge,
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:00.320]  global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex. And the body told
[1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:06.120]  you a year ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire who controls the U.M.
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:10.800]  would roll out a global hysteria and lock down the planet, start millions of people
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:15.360]  and would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that
[1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:18.960]  this same billionaire would say we're all going to work from home now and that this
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:24.720]  was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human population. You tell me that's crazy.
[1:59:24.720 --> 1:59:28.800]  You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:34.160]  book. But in reality, it really did happen. His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of
[1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:39.840]  a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[1:59:39.840 --> 1:59:44.240]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built. Until we start saying no, we are
[1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:47.000]  Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:56.560]  All right, Patrick Kelly at Ankle Falls with us for a few minutes. I'm going to write
[1:59:56.560 --> 2:00:02.680]  your calls. Patrick and Alex Jones here have joined us stations make me say my name. Every
[2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:05.920]  intro, we're on a bunch of radio stations, so I hate to say my name constantly, but that's
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:09.360]  part of the rules for ratings. We do it, so we do it. But listeners know why I say Alex
[2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:13.040]  Jones at the start of every segment. It's not a parrot, but I understand why the stations
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:16.440]  want it. We do it. And they get top ratings. So we stay on the stations and get expanded
[2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:21.520]  in the face of censorship. It's beautiful. But Patrick Hunter Biden got kicked out of
[2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:28.400]  the Navy for cocaine. These emails are real. Giuliani's had him for over a month. They called
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:31.680]  up the people in the emails. They got copies from the other side. He's always explained
[2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:35.720]  that they haven't denied it's real. Giuliani's trying to get him to deny it. So he's caught
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:39.680]  red handed. They won't do that. They just have surrogates, you know, clapper and Brennan
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:45.000]  with the 48 of their other 47 of their other minions come out and say it's all fake with
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.480]  no proof. They admit the articles. Oh, we have no proof. We're just saying it is. This
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:53.680]  is real that according to the Chinese dissidents that broke this almost a month ago before
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:59.400]  it even came out and others and Giuliani said, yes, it shows what looks like underage girls
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:04.960]  being brutalized and tortured. And this is him being compromised in China. He's got this
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:10.040]  on his laptop. He leaves it there. He won't pick it up. His lawyers have confirmed it.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:14.680]  This is so huge. I mean, I don't see how even with the censorship and the cover up how they
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:18.720]  cover this up from your intel, because I know you've got a lot of sources. You've been right
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:21.800]  at the tip of the spear, just like we have. And in some cases ahead of it, as you know,
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:25.560]  I cover a lot of subjects. I mean, you've been really kicking ass. What's really on
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:29.280]  this damn laptop? And what else do you think Giuliani's about to bring up?
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:34.320]  Well, I know Rudy Giuliani. I know people who have seen the contents of the laptop.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:39.640]  They believe that it is one of the most disturbing things that they've ever seen in their entire
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:48.240]  lives. Rudy Giuliani is a man of his word. And the people need to know about the disgusting,
[2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:52.920]  disgusting things that the elites do. I have been covering Hunter Biden for the last five
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:58.120]  years ever since I broke his Ashley Madison account and he tried to blame it on the Russians.
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:03.320]  These people are just they're they're total frauds. There's total charlatans. And the
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:08.120]  people need to know about this. And so, you know, I have been urging all of the information
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:13.560]  to be released, and it needs to be released. And the people will finally see it and they
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:17.880]  will see what they say disturbing. Are those reports accurate? There's Giuliani with the
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:22.400]  Chinese dissident that broke this almost a month ago, like one day shot a month ago
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:27.560]  before three weeks before it came out. I mean, he says it's torturing Chinese children, brutal
[2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:30.760]  pedophilia and torture. Is that what you've heard?
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:35.800]  That is my understanding. Yes. And, you know, obviously, the Chinese are willing to sacrifice
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:40.600]  their own little kids in their country in order to blackmail Americans. Joe Biden cannot be
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:44.200]  the president of the United States. There's there's no way that it can happen.
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:49.160]  They had the flesh parties, the flesh dinners. What was the term in China that the New York
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:54.240]  Times reports until the 80s, they would cook children up the big pots at Communist Party
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:59.920]  meetings as part of getting their people to do anything. I mean, the Chinese Communist
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:06.280]  cook children in pots as part of a ritual. Yeah, I mean, look, Joe Biden has this guy's
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:11.360]  Google Chinese Communist flesh backwards. You can't make this up. Sorry. Go ahead.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:16.400]  Joe Biden is a disgusting human being his group that he raises money for the DC volunteer
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:21.120]  lawyers project, which hunters involved with is run by hunters ex-wife Kathleen and they
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:25.680]  just they hang around the bathrooms. I busted them and they're what they do is they try
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:32.080]  to get boys in divorce cases. They insert themselves court appointed lawyers in child
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:37.960]  custody cases and try to get boys into prostitution and, you know, that that kind of life. So
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:43.800]  it's it's disgusting. It's human trafficking all over the place. We know with the Clintons
[2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:48.360]  now they managed to keep Anthony Wiener's laptop, the full contents of that from coming
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.240]  out and threw Wiener under the bus. This time there's nobody to throw under the bus. Hunter
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:57.040]  Biden can't be thrown under the bus because he's inextricably linked with Joe Biden himself.
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:01.120]  And so the Democrats have a real big problem on their hands, but all the information needs
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:05.800]  to come out now. If the information all comes out now, we can save this country. And I was
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.720]  able to find it. Here's business insider. Flesh bank was of China's cultural revolution
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:14.160]  remain unspoken 50 years. They said ritualistic they would kill small children and cook them
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:21.760]  in bowls to test in the party members as young as 10 would follow orders. French news agency
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.400]  Breitbart, all of it cooking children in bowls. And so Hunter has gone over there and literally
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:32.000]  reportedly rape little kids and beaten them and done horrible things to show to the commies.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:38.760]  He's a good demon. Well, you know, cannibalism is a big part of the rituals that these people
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:44.880]  do. Cannibalism is part of the whole satanic awful, ridiculous thing that they do. It's
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:50.280]  the best that aren't into that. We want a six pack of more dello and a steak to us. It's
[2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:55.760]  like who doesn't sound real because we're not into it. But there's a lot of people in
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:05:00.120]  the establishment that are into this is about their selfishness and how it's about them.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  And they feel good ruining a child's life and killing them. That makes them feel big
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:08.760]  to kill a kid. Yep, that's the energy that they feed off of. That's the demonic energy
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:13.280]  that they feed off. Three year old's whole life. I just we raped them. We tortured them.
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:17.680]  We drank their blood. We had sex in their blood in a black Sabbath. That's what those
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:23.200]  are, folks. And to them, that's victory. That's, that's, that's, boy, they're really strong.
[2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:27.480]  They're willing to go against their own conscience. And a lot of these satanists admit they don't
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:31.520]  want to kill kids. They don't even want to do it, but they do it to have power. This
[2:05:31.520 --> 2:05:38.000]  is sick. Yes, I mean, look, Fauci is putting an entire generation of kids in masks. They
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.680]  will remember the rest of their life, the fear, the horror of having to wear a mask over
[2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:45.720]  this scandemic. And, you know, meanwhile, Fauci is taking off his mask and smirking at
[2:05:45.720 --> 2:05:50.000]  the reporters. They are getting pleasure and joy out of torturing us. They really do.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:54.720]  And they're getting pleasure out of millions getting maimed from the vaccines. Look, these,
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:59.280]  these idiots should never have been mainstreamed. You know, we have this split screen culture,
[2:05:59.280 --> 2:06:02.640]  though, is the left good, right? Or is the right, the left should never have been invited
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:06.280]  into the correct conversation because there's subversives and they're, they're, they're
[2:06:06.280 --> 2:06:11.400]  sick people. And this should never have been allowed to exactly liberals were Thomas Jefferson.
[2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:17.640]  The left is a satanic Jacob and Illuminati cult on record that did the French Revolution.
[2:06:17.640 --> 2:06:22.600]  How did they become the liberals? We literally have the most vile, vampiric Satan murder
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:27.680]  cult now runs the Democrats and is like legitimized because they're the other wing. No, they're
[2:06:27.680 --> 2:06:31.960]  not the other wing. They're not two parties disagreeing on policy in our republic. They
[2:06:31.960 --> 2:06:38.600]  are a group of murderous control freaks. Yeah. And the Republicans are going down as the
[2:06:38.600 --> 2:06:42.400]  right tendency from Stalin and Russia. They're controlled opposition. They're totally surrendering
[2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:46.200]  their clueless. They don't know what's going on with the exception of Donald Trump. Donald
[2:06:46.200 --> 2:06:50.600]  Trump's the only one who is putting up any kind of resistance to these people. So, you
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:54.720]  know, this needs to end. We all know that Joe gropes kids. He gropes kids in public.
[2:06:54.720 --> 2:07:00.520]  That's how above the game. These people think they are that Joe Biden can hit on little
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:04.040]  kids and say, I want to see them dance in four years and all the disgusting things that
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:08.840]  he does groping the senator, Chris Coons, his daughter in public and Chris Coons denies
[2:07:08.840 --> 2:07:15.640]  that he didn't grow up by daughter. Everyone saw it. Everyone in the world saw it. Oh, people
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:19.640]  say that it's Russians. They don't deny it's real hunter Biden. They go, well, if the Russians
[2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:23.520]  got it, which there's no evidence, then it's okay. What if Hunter was what if Hunter like
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:27.600]  blew up a sports stadium with a hundred pound bomb? Well, the Russians videotaped it. Would
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:31.520]  it be their fault? I mean, it's ridiculous. All right, Patrick Howley, what a time to
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:35.640]  be alive. Thank you so much and God bless. Thank you, Alex. The next two nights, we're
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:39.520]  going to cover the town hall and we're going to cover the debate here at night with election
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:43.240]  countdown. I'll be here. All right, let's get in a call now. Take calls next segment
[2:07:43.240 --> 2:07:48.120]  then Leo Zagami joins us. I appreciate I'm getting pushed back because I'm behind today.
[2:07:48.120 --> 2:07:52.480]  Let's go ahead and who's been holding the longest. Let's go to Tiffany in North Carolina.
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:58.840]  Tiffany, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes. Hi. Hi, Alex. I just wanted to say that we
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:04.120]  love you. We watch you every day. We listen. We follow you in every way and God bless himself
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:10.000]  for sure. We love you too. I appreciate you. Thank you. Sorry, I was talking a lot. Anyway,
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:15.080]  I just wanted to get to kind of just the point and you know, going back to the criminal activity
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:19.680]  and everything that we've witnessed almost on a daily basis now. You know, my fiancee
[2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:23.880]  at Cody called yesterday and spoke with Owen, you know, a little bit about this. But you
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:30.640]  know, my thoughts are, you know, once Biden, you know, loses and all this and we do defeat
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:35.640]  Trump in every way, you know, I'm all about, you know, equality and making sure, you know,
[2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:40.240]  people do get the justice and the punishment they deserve. So I mean, do you see it, you
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:45.440]  know, like Biden and son and the people that are, you know, you know, doing the, you know,
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:50.840]  election, you know, you know, criminal activity, they're going to fight even harder, but their
[2:08:50.840 --> 2:08:54.200]  power is going to be diminished. And there are people that have been hanging on a government
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:58.440]  for four years or another losing. So I think spectacularly good things are going to happen
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:03.320]  if Trump's reelected. The problem is the global depression, but the lockdown of COVID is already
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:07.280]  killing the world economy. And so until that's repudiated, they have a chance of bringing
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.080]  down the world economy and the US economy. So that's got to be ended if Trump can end
[2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:16.200]  the COVID lockdown and in the COVID hysteria and the chicken little syndrome, then we can
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:21.920]  actually turn things around. If he can't world depression, what do you think? Awesome. Um,
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:25.640]  I definitely agree. But, um, do you actually see Biden's son actually get prosecuted for
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:29.400]  the crimes he's being committed that we're witnessing as well? I think it must be. The
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:32.880]  problem is they've got blackmail material in the republic. It's not on Trump. And so
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:37.000]  that's, that's the conundrum, but they keep using their criminal power to keep launching
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.600]  attacks. So it's got to be done. They've got to prosecute them, let them release their
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:46.280]  dirt, but the chips fall where they may. It's time to bang heads here, folks. It's taken
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:52.400]  me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the rest of
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:57.680]  the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for coordinated big tech
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:03.400]  censorship. Now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and a half years
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:07.800]  for the learning curve to take place this time. Bill Gates and the UN are on record
[2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:14.320]  saying the lockdown is permanent. It is a plan to lower carbon footprint. It is a plan
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:20.160]  to make the world population poor. It is a diabolical power grab. It is a revolution
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:24.680]  against the industrial revolution. They call it the post industrial world. And it's the
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:30.160]  excuse for them to take control every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:33.840]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, my daughter that just woke
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:38.600]  up here, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake, you
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  need to understand this information, you just warn others, okay? It's a life and death situation.
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:03.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.960]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:13.440]  menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:19.760]  I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:23.360]  Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:28.120]  bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:32.640]  they can get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share
[2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:37.480]  buttons below. On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want,
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:12:03.480]  be sure and share band.video.
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:18.800]  Let's go to Gordon in Hawaii, still under martial law lockdown, even though the flu
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:24.640]  kills hundreds of times what COVID does. Gordon in Hawaii on Joe Biden, Crime Bill, Hunter,
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:28.200]  and the Deep State. Thanks for holding. Thanks for calling, brother. And I just want to say
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:31.760]  I wish I was there with you in Hawaii. What a great place, despite the martial law.
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:38.720]  I wish you were here too, Alex. You know, I kind of want to make a funny observation
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:43.640]  that I don't think anybody's talking about Joe Biden, you know, they put together this
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:50.400]  crime bill targeting blacks that smoke crack cocaine, then his son turns around and smokes
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:57.200]  crack, becomes a crack head and takes down the entire deep state. This is all karma.
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:04.000]  It's karma. Yep. But it's a new definition of irony. It's totally ironic. And that's
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:07.120]  how God works. You know, God's in control of all this.
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:12.600]  Well, let's explain. Blacks work. If you smoke crack, you get three times more time
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:17.000]  in prison than having the same amount of powder cocaine, which whites use. And Joe Biden
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.920]  called blacks predators and said they deserved it. Then they put blacks that did cocaine
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:26.240]  in prison to turn them into predators. See how that works? You can put a white guy in
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:32.960]  prison. Most of them are in predators. Totally racist. You know, and that's a great point.
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:37.320]  The Bidens and the Clintons put the blacks on crack with the CIA and Bush senior, and
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:43.040]  then they get brought down by crack. Exactly right. That's exactly right. And
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:48.720]  you know, the funny thing about that is that people aren't looking at how ironic that is,
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:55.120]  that that is going to destroy all these elites. The information that's going to come out is
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:59.640]  going to be just incredible. Well, that's why they say the Lord works
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:02.960]  in mysterious ways. Like I'm not afraid to die. I don't want to die because I know I
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:06.960]  have a spirit and I'll be with God. Hopefully I'm a good enough. You know, I'm true enough.
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:11.440]  But I just like the longer I live, the more I learn how stuff works. And I go, man, you
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:15.720]  really have to start seeing how God works. You're like, whoa, Satan doesn't have any
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:20.640]  power compared to God. Exactly. Exactly. And this is what happens
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:27.240]  to these Democrats. Every time they pull something, God turns around and it comes right back
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.760]  on him. And so many of them are going to go to jail. I hope if Bill Barr gets off his
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:36.800]  butt or does something. Well, they're already totally discredited. They're already cut off.
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:41.860]  And what you're saying is so central, though, is here's the thing. God is going to give
[2:14:41.860 --> 2:14:46.240]  us victory if we're there to receive the enlightenment and the spiritual electricity
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:50.760]  is the way I describe it, the energy. But he needs us believing and ready to receive it
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:54.520]  for it to complete the circuit. Does that make sense? If God doesn't have faithful though
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:59.040]  out there, God can't deliver the lightning bolts. Does that make sense?
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:05.560]  Well, people are so ready to accept God now. They see what's going on. And you know, they've
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:11.120]  been to church a lot of them and they've heard all of these revelations, seminars, and it's
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:15.440]  all happening right now, right in front of them. I agree. I'm seeing the biggest enlightenment,
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:19.360]  the biggest coming back to God I've ever seen. It's massive.
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:24.520]  It is. And it's huge. And it's and you know, the Democrats are not going to get away with
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:30.640]  this. They're going to try to cheat and they're they're doing a good job of it. But it's not
[2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:33.840]  going to work. Let me say this. When I was younger, I could connect to God, but there
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:39.680]  was a force trying to block it. And I'd have to like get through it. Now it's just instant.
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:44.200]  And people are even looking for the Holy Spirit just now feel it. I mean, it's strong right
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:49.040]  now. That's scaring the hell out of these devils, man. They feel it too. Don't you know, they're
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:50.040]  scared?
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:55.360]  Well, look at the division now. I mean, as soon as Trump got elected, the evil got so
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:02.160]  much more evil and the good got so much more good. I have I have a problem with communication.
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:06.480]  I live on this farm out here and I literally don't talk to people for weeks at a time.
[2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:07.480]  That sounds great.
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:13.000]  But um, no, it's it is great. I'm talking about coffee. What are you saying?
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:18.400]  Well, no, I'm I'm on the wet side. I'm growing every fruit you can imagine anything you can
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:24.000]  possibly eat. And then I sell it or give it away at the farmer's market.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:31.160]  I'm a farmer. That's what I my mind sells literally beg to just live on a farm and plant
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:35.960]  things and work outside. I get high when I cut trees and plant things. I just get high.
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:42.120]  I'm like, oh, yeah, that's supposed to do this for tree or a bush or a flower and you
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:46.560]  stick it in the ground and it grows. And I'm doing it for you. I'm doing it for you.
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:51.800]  You feel that way. Like, don't you after like the just the bugs and the and the livelihoods?
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:56.960]  Oh, yeah, that's what you're supposed to be. Funny thing is funny thing is I'm way out
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:17:00.680]  in the middle of the jungle, but I've got fiber optic running on the telephone lines
[2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:05.240]  around here. So I run around the property working in my garden and I've got my headphones
[2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:07.120]  on and I'm listening to you every day.
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:10.560]  Well, we love you, brother. We appreciate you, Gordon. I got to get these calls to nobody,
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:16.480]  but you guys are awesome. Excuse me. Let's go ahead and talk to Tyler and Iowa. Thanks
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:17.480]  for holding Tyler.
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:23.200]  Hey, thanks for having me, Mr. Jones. I got two simple things I want to talk to you about.
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:24.200]  Go ahead, brother. Hear me?
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:25.200]  Yeah, I do.
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:30.800]  All right. I want to talk about why is everyone going to a doctor, Mr. Fauci, who hasn't
[2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:32.800]  practiced medicine in 37 plus years?
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:33.800]  Why are people-
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:37.280]  And why is Bill Gates not a doctor running everything? A good question.
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:41.480]  Exactly. I don't get it. I came to sleep at night. Why are these people going to them
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:47.040]  instead of going to the Lord during this pandemic, this pandemic that we're in that's just killing
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:52.520]  everyone apparently? I don't understand it. And then why? Why? I love Trump to death. Don't
[2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:58.440]  get me wrong. But why is Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and Hillary not locked up yet? Do I
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:17:59.440]  need to make a personal citizen?
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:04.160]  Well, that's the call. That's what Trump calls for. It's what you want. Every caller is like,
[2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:09.000]  lock them up. Why aren't, because evil, Satan is in control of the planet and he is protecting
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:16.560]  his people. But we have to publicly and spiritually and culturally and economically reject them
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:18.280]  and stop coexisting with them.
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:23.040]  Notice they don't want to, they need us to exist. So they want to make us enslaved till
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:28.040]  we submit to them. Well, no, we cut them off. We don't support them. We break with them.
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:32.680]  We're not nice to them. We don't make them the moral authority anymore. We rebuke them.
[2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:34.480]  That's what needs to happen.
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:41.160]  Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't see people lodged behind why they want a representative
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:48.240]  like Dr. Falkier or Bill Gates to go for advice. And he's the Lord Almighty himself.
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:50.400]  What, where is our lodging behind this?
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:54.360]  It's not. It's upside down world. And that's what cults want you to do is accept stuff.
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:59.360]  It doesn't make sense. Tyler, thank you. Marshall in Arizona attended Trump rally last night.
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:04.080]  What was your view on that, my friend?
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:09.280]  Down I took my whole family down to the Trump rally. I got a beautiful interracial family.
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:13.720]  I decked my kids and family out and all of the info wears gear. You know, we wore our
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:18.640]  Trump swag and that was the thing that kind of upset me was when I went there, I saw there
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:23.680]  were other info warriors, but I noticed that they were hiding their info wars gear. They
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:27.160]  were a little shy about it. And I think it's time for us info warriors to come out of the
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:32.600]  closet and really expose ourselves. Yeah, 30 of the folks in 2016 were wearing it. Now
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:36.440]  because of the Sandy Hook, the demonization, they're scared to do it. They kind of wear
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:40.640]  it, but that's okay. It's all right. That was the enemy plan. But I think there's a coming
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:44.040]  out now for info wars. It's really beautiful we're seeing.
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:48.920]  Yeah. And we need to do that more because we just had a man who got his teeth punched
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:54.800]  out trying to save an info warriors in full gear. And you know, we just really need to
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:19:58.640]  stand up for ourselves and not let ourselves be bullied and terrorized.
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:02.160]  Well, that's why I always warn listeners. I say, Hey, you might get your lunch spot
[2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:05.440]  for you wearing info wars. Or if you're in a leprosy, you might get hit in the head with
[2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:10.520]  a lead pipe. I mean, this is war, folks. This is serious.
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:15.200]  Absolutely. And as for your other color, Gordon, the Lord does work in mysterious ways. How
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:20.560]  about this one? The globalists go around and give thousands of children autism. And what
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:25.840]  does God do? He weaponized that autism against them. You know, I've noticed how many of the
[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:29.680]  autistic Asperger's children are actually fighting the globalist. Like they spiritually
[2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:32.920]  know the globalist did it. And you're right. They're almost all on our team. Have you noticed
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:38.920]  that? Yes, I have. They know which side their bread is buttered on and that's the side of
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:45.560]  the Lord. They know good from evil. Beautiful. I bless you.
[2:20:45.560 --> 2:20:51.360]  Human mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock. It's being sold out for months.
[2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:55.240]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B 12 and a good mix of vitamins,
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:21:00.560]  minerals, especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:06.680]  immune system. Well, both products are back in stock at info wars store.com's two weeks
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:12.520]  off the election. And we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:16.880]  patriot points to your next order. Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:21.440]  10% off that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders. Now we have had a big
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:25.200]  clearance sale going. So a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is close to selling
[2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:29.240]  out. Some of our best sellers are still there. And some of them have actually come back into
[2:21:29.240 --> 2:21:33.560]  stock. And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:37.280]  things that have actually sold out. So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank
[2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:41.440]  you so much for keeping info wars on the year. Obviously, we're critical to fight and you've
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:49.080]  helped win the war against the global so far. Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment
[2:21:49.080 --> 2:21:53.600]  understands what info wars understands what our listeners understand what Donald Trump
[2:21:53.600 --> 2:22:00.960]  understands. We're in a digital civil war. There are giant filters filtering out 99%
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:06.880]  of communication going on on every major tech platform. And now they're doing it to the
[2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:12.320]  private apps. They're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email. This is mafia organized
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:18.080]  crime election meddling. But finally, when they blocked the Hunter Biden and the barisma
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:22.840]  information and the Chinese information and the photos of the crack pipes and all the
[2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:27.520]  rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied it. Finally, Congress
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:31.560]  got pissed and said, this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're taking action.
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:35.560]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, Oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident. But they
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:40.480]  keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff. Well, info wars is calling
[2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:45.000]  their bluff. And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:51.480]  The future isn't coming. It's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:56.800]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset. In
[2:22:56.800 --> 2:23:03.000]  fact, it's going to be your only asset, the world being built by the technocrats and the
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:09.720]  trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process
[2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:17.400]  of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization. Human life will
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:24.760]  be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050. This is their
[2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:31.200]  stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:37.320]  the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy. We turn this around. You must
[2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:42.440]  study their own writings. You must face the facts and you must come to grips with it.
[2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:48.000]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  All right. I got a hundred questions for Leo Sugami. And he is a bestselling author, researcher,
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:43.400]  predicted the current pup five years before he was put into power, particularly they talk
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:50.000]  about having rotating pups, a new council predicted that they would push world government
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.440]  and all the rest of this garbage. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here we are. So Leo
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:00.160]  Sugami, let me ask you here as a guy that's actually been in the P2 log, actually in the
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:04.520]  real Illuminati, who got out of it and exposed it, the current state of the world where we
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.400]  are and who the players are, what the biggest stories are right now.
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:15.400]  Hello, Alex. Hello, everybody. I would say that the biggest story at the moment is this
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:22.560]  preparation behind the scenes for this war, this invasion of Taiwan, which will automatically
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:30.840]  unleash a third world war. And at the same time, we know that China might unleash this
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:38.520]  invasion right in the moment of struggle here in American politics that we will witness
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:45.840]  in November, because as we all know, there will be no winner. There will be probably
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:51.680]  on both sides, people claiming they have won and there will be chaos. And this case will
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:59.280]  facilitate then China. We have seen China even behind the civil unrest that we have witnessed
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:03.880]  in the last few months here in the United States of America. So China wants to really
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:10.440]  play this card. And then at the same time, we have other big things happening in Europe.
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:16.440]  In Europe, we have the Vatican, which just saw the arrest of Cecilia Maronia, which was
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:24.880]  a collaborator of a cardinal, Cardinal Betjo, who is now a former cardinal, because basically
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:31.200]  Cardinal Pell is back in the Vatican. Yes, as we have prophesied a long time ago, Cardinal
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:36.840]  Pell might go back to the Vatican to save the day because they are involved in these
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:44.200]  scandals, this big economic scandal. And now we discovered that basically Cecilia Maronia
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:50.240]  was connected with an Intel group called the Hinckerman group, which is a front. So the
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:56.880]  Vatican could actually finance Giadi groups with the money coming from Peter's pants.
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:03.920]  So that's another important news of the day, as well as earlier this month, the Pope coming
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:11.920]  out with his ferdincy, which basically criticizes capitalism. And it's a Marxist manifesto
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:21.440]  for this upcoming One World Religion. They just had in the Emirates another gathering
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:28.760]  for organizing this One World Religion, which is putting together already Islam, Sunni Islam
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:35.080]  and Catholicism. So there is a lot going on. But the most important thing is, of course,
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:41.680]  the discovery of the material on Hunter's Biden computer, which has shown America that
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:47.800]  there is no democracy and that basically the media is completely rigged. And they will
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:54.440]  not listen to anything we have to say regarding what has been discovered in this computer,
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:28:02.360]  in which we see that the son of Joe Biden has to even give a percentage of his salary to
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:12.480]  his father in a mail to his daughter. Hunter Biden writes, Well, I will not ask from you
[2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:17.360]  the same kind of money my father asked from me, you know, he has to give a cut. And we
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:24.160]  have seen that in some of the males, actually, the percentage for his father is well defined.
[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:28.680]  And then there is a connection with Taiwan. There is a connection with Taiwan and with
[2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:35.640]  somebody who is also connected with the skull and bones. This 57 year old businessman who
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:42.360]  for 10 years has functioned as a public relation for the Biden family is called Michael Lynn.
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:48.440]  He was he graduated in a Chinese university in Taiwan, but then he went for a master degree
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:54.080]  at the Yale University in Connecticut, where we have, of course, the legendary skull and
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:59.040]  bones are connected to. And that's where the sitcoms go to Yale and Harvard. G.G.
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.640]  Ping has his daughter secretly right now at Harvard. We're revealing that to become globalist
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:08.000]  double agents. The Chinese are marrying the New World Order, the takeover of the US. It's
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:14.720]  not like they run us. It's like we run them. It's the criminal globalists are merging us.
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:21.920]  Absolutely Alex. And Michael Lynn actually worked not only for Joe Biden, but for a serious
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:27.400]  of politicians here in the United States. So America connected to the skull and bones
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:34.720]  worked to put them in contact with the Chinese Communist Party and with all the shady businesses.
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:39.360]  Cheryl, quantify this for me. Who are the major global players? How is it going for
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:48.600]  the New World Order? How is Trump doing? Trump is doing well. But if he loses, he will
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:54.640]  be a re-candidate himself in 2024. But this means that we will have four years of literally
[2:29:54.640 --> 2:30:01.680]  of hell in which the Joe Biden and his and his Kamala will dismantle everything that
[2:30:01.680 --> 2:30:06.680]  Trump has ever done. And then people will really see how true it is and want Trump back
[2:30:06.680 --> 2:30:12.480]  and he'll become a perpetual candidate. I agree with you. I agree with Steve Bannon.
[2:30:12.480 --> 2:30:16.640]  That's what Trump is. I know planning to launch his own TV network and totally counter and
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:24.360]  come back in. He's not giving up. Absolutely. But at the same time, we have the danger of
[2:30:24.360 --> 2:30:30.760]  civil unrest on a large scale that might become a civil war here in the United States of America.
[2:30:30.760 --> 2:30:37.080]  Like we said already last year that this might happen. We have George Soros, of course, that
[2:30:37.080 --> 2:30:44.720]  has financed all these groups. We have China also behind Black Lives Matter. But of course,
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:50.640]  the mainstream media doesn't say anything about all this. So if Trump gets re-elected,
[2:30:50.640 --> 2:30:56.480]  hopefully with a landslide, and so it's impossible at that point to contest it. Well, I will
[2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:04.320]  suggest Trump starts to arrest a few people starting with the Bidens and then we have,
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:10.560]  of course, the Clintons. We have to investigate Barack Obama. All these people have endangered
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:12.720]  the national security of the United States of America.
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:15.800]  You raise that point because even if they're able to kill Trump, even if they're able to
[2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:19.480]  steal this election, as they say they're trying to do, they're going to contest it and try
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:24.380]  to cause a civil war and succession of states. This is insane. The public's awake to the
[2:31:24.380 --> 2:31:30.360]  new world order. Bolsonaro and you've got the Brexit. I mean, clearly now all these
[2:31:30.360 --> 2:31:33.640]  big topics are out in the open. So even if they try to launch everything they've got
[2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:37.760]  to stop Trump, it looks like they're going to lose in the long term because of the awakening
[2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:38.760]  we're seeing.
[2:31:38.760 --> 2:31:46.000]  Yes, we have a big awakening. We have seen it in the almost weekly protests in London,
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:51.360]  but they're making it really difficult for Brexit to happen. Even if it's already in
[2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:59.360]  process, I just heard that there is still some problems for going for this Brexit because
[2:31:59.360 --> 2:32:04.760]  they are trying to sabotage Boris Johnson in every way possible. And of course, they
[2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:12.280]  use once again this virus as an excuse for all of the wrongdoings. And then we had in
[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:19.120]  France just the other day, a professor beheaded because he simply showed the comic strips
[2:32:19.120 --> 2:32:31.040]  from Charlie Hebdo regarding Mohammed. This teacher was beheaded. And at that point, France
[2:32:31.040 --> 2:32:37.040]  that has been tolerating a lot from the Muslim community is finally going on the offensive.
[2:32:37.040 --> 2:32:46.920]  So even Macron had to move, sorry, as Monday List asked to do something about it. So things
[2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:52.720]  might change now in France because it's a crack. They're really cracking down on this
[2:32:52.720 --> 2:32:55.600]  terrorist cells that are all over.
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:33:03.200]  All right, Leo Zagami. Leo Zagami.com Zagami Z-A-G-A-M-I Leo Zagami.com. I've got questions
[2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:08.200]  about the world economy, about the COVID shutdown, about your view on that, about where that's
[2:33:08.200 --> 2:33:15.120]  going when we come back. Don't forget listeners, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video. They
[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:19.400]  banned the term band.video, as many have pointed out. The head of Twitter says, oh, we don't
[2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:22.320]  ban URLs. We're going to stop that. People said, well, what about band.video? But we
[2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:28.080]  have a URL that gets around that, 2020electioncenter.com. 2020electioncenter.com. That's the same
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:32.040]  site, same videos. That's how you bypass it. So keep sharing. You're doing a great job.
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:35.520]  We'll be right back with the finals in a couple of seconds with Leo Zagami. And then Paul
[2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:44.160]  Joseph Watson from London, England is ready to roar. He's taken over. Stay with us.
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:49.440]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:55.040]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:34:01.320]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com. Studies have
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:07.280]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:12.840]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:19.320]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:26.360]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:32.520]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:38.920]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:43.640]  a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.

[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:44.760]  Black Friday comes in October.
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:51.260]  A major life lesson just took place last night. The top story in the country was that Hunter
[2:35:51.260 --> 2:35:58.240]  Biden's laptop information had come out. Him with hookers and shooting porno movies
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:04.440]  and crack pipes, but the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma and
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:10.320]  had done so at the behest of his father who was getting large parts of the money. But
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:14.160]  you see Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored the info and even censored major
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:18.440]  news publications and even censored the president. But when the president and Congress said they
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:23.680]  were going to take action, suddenly Jack of Twitter said he didn't know what had happened
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:28.640]  and it was wrong. And that's the big life lesson here. Standing up and saying no to organized
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:34.440]  crime, rapid caring is the way to stop it. Grobbling to it and letting big tech lie to
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:39.840]  us and run over us is the way to make these tyrants continue to go absolutely crazy. Remember,
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.600]  they support Communist China and its death camps. What will they do to us? We'll we now
[2:36:43.600 --> 2:36:45.280]  know.
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:50.400]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right there in your
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:57.240]  browser. And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. Most importantly,
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:04.160]  via text message, email or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned
[2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:10.520]  a video. But 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the side of the exact same links, the exact
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:16.880]  same videos. We can comment, we can share them everything. The system is censoring because
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:21.080]  the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:25.120]  out. And since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, I mean, he's
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:28.000]  in a modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now. So we're
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:32.560]  going to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We, the people are taking action
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:37.320]  now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:42.520]  and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com and sharing that link. Oh, that really upsets
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:58.560]  some old, yeah, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:19.880]  All right, we are back and we have Leo Zagami with us and Owen Shroyer and Owen Shroyer
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:24.160]  will be hosting coming up about an hour from now, three hours of the war room ahead of
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:29.480]  election countdown with himself, John Lorraine, Harrison Smith and others. And we have the
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:34.640]  coverage of the town hall and the rig debate the next two nights, live coverage of that.
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:38.560]  Remember big tech, the globalist, the oligarchs, the Chinese slave camps. Hope you don't share
[2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:41.640]  those links. They hope you don't realize how important you are. And we're going to talk
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:45.880]  to Owen about what he's got coming up in a moment. But Leo Zagami and Owen, I'm going
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:50.720]  to play this for you. And if you members conduct a cult ritual in Boston streets, eat
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:56.280]  bloody heart, symbolic of Trump, this is like a weird Navajo ghost dance or something. I'm
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:00.720]  not comparing the Navajo to these scumbags. But I mean, it's literally they're like, we
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:06.240]  hate Jesus, we hate America, we love to kill babies. And they're doing all these rituals.
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:10.520]  And then we see all these powerful organizations admitting their into rituals. And now they're
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:15.200]  into Satanism. And now they're operating system of good versus evils really coming out in
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:19.440]  the open. Here's the video, then we'll get former Illuminati insider Leo Zagami's take
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:21.440]  on it. Here it is.
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:36.440]  No, these people have a job calling some type of foggy thing out of India, a lot of, you
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:42.120]  know, Temple of Man Raiders lost our all a bunch of drama students that couldn't get
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:47.720]  jobs. And then this is what they do all day, run around bitching about America or communist
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:52.360]  China that you put the death camp, which I don't support. So Leo Zagami, what what the
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.160]  hell's wrong with these people and studying the occult being involved in before he got
[2:39:56.160 --> 2:39:59.400]  out of it? What is the draw to these people?
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:07.120]  Well, the occult has been taken over by the left for a long time in this country. And
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:15.480]  so we have now satan is satan is openly supporting the Democratic Party. And we have terrible
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:21.120]  things that are happening. Aside from what you have shown a couple weeks ago, we had
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:29.880]  this priest in Louisiana, who with a couple of lip-tarded sluts perform the ritual on
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:36.680]  the altar that then had to be burnt, because they actually perform sex on an altar in Pearl
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:43.600]  River. So I mean, this is happening in 2020. And it's pretty, pretty shocking.
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:48.320]  I agree. It's not just these idiots doing theater. Churches are being burned in Brazil.
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:52.840]  They're being burned in England. They're being attacked here. And the leftist preachers
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:57.280]  saying, Oh, good, burn us. It's liberal burn us. They're tearing down crosses. They're
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:01.040]  going, Oh, it's mental illness. They're burning down Notre Dame, trying to cover it up. But
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:05.720]  Islam takes credit. I mean, what is this attack on churches? If this isn't an open demonic
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:13.120]  attack is anti Christianity manifesting itself openly and publicly, they are the party of
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:19.480]  Satan nowadays. I'm sorry to say that there is no way a Christian can support in the right
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:25.400]  mind, the Democratic Party at these elections, everything that they promote, everything they
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:31.200]  represent is anti Christian in essence. Let's remember that while Notre Dame was going on
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:37.600]  fire, there was Michelle Obama sipping a champagne on the river next to it.
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:42.720]  That's right. That's on record that while Notre Dame burns, she drank champagne to it.
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:47.160]  What about the big card on the US that says it's a war against good and evil between Satan
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:51.000]  and God and the Trumps on the side of God? What about that card? No, is he good? Well,
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:56.760]  I should be sure vegano is a bit of a maverick today. Actually, he's a living under protection
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:02.040]  hidden somewhere because the Vatican wants to kill him. I mean, they can't kick him out
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:10.320]  because he was the diplomat for the Vatican for many years here in the US. But now, the
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:16.480]  vegano is a minority in a church which is taken over by progressive forces. You have
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:24.280]  to understand that the Chinese Communist Party gives two billion dollars a year to the Vatican.
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:30.440]  And that's why the Pope recently didn't even receive Mike Pompeo. And that's why the Vatican
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:37.480]  renewed their deal with the Communist China. Even after some Catholic priests were actually
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:42.400]  tortured and crosses were removed. Folks don't know that going back to the Portuguese and
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:48.160]  Spanish rudders 500, 600 years ago, it was the Jesuits, not the Catholic church that
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:53.680]  got control of China. So to a great extent, the Jesuits put Mao Zedong in power. People
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:43:00.960]  don't know that. Yeah, in 1540, when they founded the Jesuits, the actual founder, Inazula
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:08.480]  Yola sent his disciples to Asia and Matteo Ricci was sent to China. And he became actually
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:13.760]  involved with the emperor over there. And from that moment onwards, the Jesuits really
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:19.560]  built up their trust with the Chinese. And they're part of Chinese history. I mean, there
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:25.600]  is a shrine to Matteo Ricci in Beijing, which is unheard of in a communist country. But there
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:30.560]  is a Jesuit saint who actually has a shrine in communist China. And now we have the Jesuit
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:36.080]  pope saying, doesn't want to hear about Christian roots in Europe, capitalism is bad, one world
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:40.360]  religion. But I think most Catholics, I know, Owen Schreuer, but both you guys, Owen, what
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:43.640]  is your view and your take on this? And what do you got coming up today on your three hour
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:50.720]  transmission? Well, I think it's just the average, you know, leftist in the street, just
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:57.200]  getting more deranged, more dark sinister cries for attention, just just wanting there's
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:02.560]  a desire to be further from God, further from righteousness, further from wholesomeness.
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:06.200]  So I think that's what you're seeing with these just strange things that we see in the
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:09.880]  street. I mean, they happened in Austin over this weekend, too. They weren't quite, I guess
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:14.000]  that was burning hearts or eating hearts, apparently. And I guess of some ritual, whatever
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:18.920]  that craziness was, it was just, you know, liberal women show up half naked with kids
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:24.680]  around them and chant how they want to, you know, I won't say it. We have videos, we can't
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.440]  show pro livers with photos of dead babies. And the liberal women come up and start humping
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:35.880]  the dead baby. It's very, it's very odd behavior. I mean, you just have to almost be in awe of
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:40.200]  it and it's in its insanity. But Alex, coming up today on the war room, we're going to be
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:46.600]  looking at this new claim that the Department of Justice has filed anti-trust lawsuit against
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:51.160]  Google saying it's long overdue. The Republicans are behind it. We'll see if there's any seriousness
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:55.360]  behind that. But you know, Alex, I think, you know, something kind of just hit me last
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:45:00.080]  night and it's really just incredible that this is the case. I mean, we're guilty of
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:05.640]  it, too. But the media in this country is ignoring perhaps the biggest bombshell in
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:13.280]  news history. I mean, we literally have a 50 year congressional vice president involved
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:17.280]  in our government 50 years, five decades, this man, Joe Biden, running for president.
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:22.280]  And we literally have him compromised by at least five to 10 different countries, including
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:25.960]  the number one enemy of the United States, communist China. I mean, literally, we're
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:30.560]  talking about a compromised and it's on record that these are real emails. They've called
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:35.040]  and copied the emails from those that received them. It's all on record. Payoffs from Ukraine,
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:39.720]  Ukraine saying in the investigation for the money, quid pro quo, open and shut cases,
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:44.800]  China buying them off, him raping little girls and the whole media works in unison to cover
[2:45:44.800 --> 2:45:50.120]  it up. I mean, that is unbelievable. It's, it's really stunning. I don't know how else
[2:45:50.120 --> 2:45:54.440]  to really phrase it. I don't even think it needs much of a complex framing here. It's
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:59.480]  pretty simple. This is the biggest news story ever. And the media is not even covering it
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:04.960]  a triple quadruple, quintuple. Forget about it. I don't see this working. Oh, and I want
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:09.880]  to ask you that in a moment, but Leo Zagami, I see this level of censorship blowing up in
[2:46:09.880 --> 2:46:13.560]  their face. A lot of behind the scenes stuff's happened. I'm leaving it at that. But I can
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:17.920]  tell you, this has gone too far for a lot of people. A lot of people that are establishment
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:22.240]  who aren't evil, but they kind of play along. They've decided not to play along now, Leo.
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:30.400]  Well, I've just exposed a few days ago on my website in an article, the role of a sovereign
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:37.240]  grand commander of the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree in Romania, who is basically
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:44.520]  working with another guy called Luciana Despoio, who is also a Freemason entrepreneur in sabotaging
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:54.080]  the election of Donald J. Trump using hackers that pretend to be Russian hackers, because
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:47:01.600]  they want to work once again on the whole Russian collusion, which they instigated also
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:08.520]  originally. So Romania also plays a very shady role, a bit like Ukraine. And there should
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:16.080]  be more investigation in what is going on with this whole affair, which has not been
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:22.520]  mentioned at all here in the US by anybody, but it's very illegal to do it here, but they
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:26.520]  can hire foreign groups and foreign countries to do it. And then they stage attacks claiming
[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:31.160]  it's Russians. They didn't claim all this ridiculousness. And there is actually the involvement
[2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:36.920]  of a Russian colonel Boris Golovin in all this, who is also a Freemason. So the Russians
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:45.120]  actually play a double game, a play a very tricky kind of way of doing things. So then
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:50.640]  people will accuse Trump of colluding with Russia when it's actually Russia who is working
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:56.840]  behind the scenes with the Bidens. For example, we have the mayor of Moscow, the wife who
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:06.280]  got a lot of money to to Hunter Biden. So we have a link with Russia, China and stay
[2:48:06.280 --> 2:48:10.360]  there five more minutes and Paul Joseph Watson takes over. Please don't forget we're literally
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:14.960]  supported. We've got this big Black Friday comes in October sale triple Patriot points,

[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:36.440]  selling out info or store dot com. As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:42.280]  out from the election on the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:47.120]  them and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:53.280]  openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:58.680]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:03.400]  once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to
[2:49:03.400 --> 2:49:09.280]  prosecute us and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintons are saying. It's
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:13.760]  what the Obama bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:21.320]  saying. This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:25.440]  going forever and force denoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:31.360]  vaccines will be voluntary. Donald Trump or die. You've got to get Trump in. Everybody
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:36.160]  get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now. With two weeks left until the

[2:50:38.500 --> 2:50:50.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, final segment for Paul Joseph
[2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:57.640]  Watson from England takes over. I'm your host Alex Jones. Oh, Troyer. Other points,
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:01.400]  other questions you've got for Leo Zagami, a frequent guest on the war room, weekdays
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:07.360]  three to six PM in defiance of tyranny. You're coming up in one hour live points you'd like
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:13.280]  to ask the points you'd like to make. Leo, how you doing, friend? I'm curious if over
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:19.500]  there at Leo Zagami.com, if you guys are going to be tracking the Giselaen Maxwell Jeffrey
[2:51:19.500 --> 2:51:22.680]  Epstein testimony, they're saying they're going to unseal that Leo, what do you expect
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:29.080]  to come out of that? Well, I've been talking about also these latest
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:37.400]  connections that the Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates had with the European Council. And it's
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:42.760]  a big story, really, because it connects also with the United Nations. And as we know, Gilliam
[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:50.160]  Maxwell was often guested at the United Nations, an organization which is actually in the hands
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:56.040]  of the globalist, as we know, and of the new world order. But before we terminate the segment,
[2:51:56.040 --> 2:52:00.800]  we should talk about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that these, these Democrats are
[2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:01.800]  trying to.
[2:52:01.800 --> 2:52:04.440]  Oh, I'm glad you brought that up, because I meant to start the show with that. Literally
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:08.240]  a communist Maoist program. Leo, tell folks about that.
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:13.440]  Well, I mean, the original Truth and Reconciliation Commission was in Africa. It was something
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:19.640]  to do with the Congo. Yeah, now in Congo. And then it was actually the meetings were
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:24.840]  in South Africa. But they are calling for this commission because they will use this
[2:52:24.840 --> 2:52:30.760]  Truth and Reconciliation Commission to persecute us. That's the actual entity they will use
[2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:37.720]  to persecute all of us. So I really hope that Biden doesn't get elected. But if he gets
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:43.080]  elected, it will be key, become increasingly like communist China. And the Truth and Reconciliation
[2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:50.880]  Commission will become a really a big reality and a dangerous one for us.
[2:52:50.880 --> 2:52:54.840]  You know what? This is so important. I'm going to come in tonight and co-host with Yama
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:59.680]  Lorraine on election countdown. Leo, if you can come on for 30 minutes, we should focus
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:03.680]  on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is where they have these big televised
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:08.040]  deals and demonized people that have folks come burn your house down. Because this is
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:11.160]  a big deal. Can you come on and say eight o'clock central tonight?
[2:53:11.160 --> 2:53:17.120]  Sure, sure. No problem. I'll be here. I'm co-hosting with Yama Lorraine tonight, seven
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:21.000]  to nine. I'll be here tomorrow night. They're going to have what the town hall, the night
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:26.160]  after that, they're going to be having the actual debates. Leo Zagami, what do you make
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:29.760]  of how they're rigging the debate, how the commission's far and run, how they're not
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:36.160]  going to follow foreign affairs, how the lady that runs the debates, anti-Trump, how this
[2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:38.200]  is crazy.
[2:53:38.200 --> 2:53:42.560]  Having the control of the mute button, like we said the other day with Owen on his show,
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:47.040]  it's going to be a nightmare for both the candidates, but especially for Trump, because
[2:53:47.040 --> 2:53:52.560]  I think if they moved Biden even for the whole time, he will not probably will not even notice.
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:59.640]  But it will be definitely controversial. And I would like to see what comes out of it the
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:04.200]  day after because let's just say this, we're not living in boring times right now. So I'll
[2:54:04.200 --> 2:54:09.600]  see Leo Zagami tonight, hour two of the election countdown. I'll be here with Yama Lorraine.
[2:54:09.600 --> 2:54:13.960]  Thank you so much. Owen Schroyer comes up in one hour. Owen, tell us what you got coming
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:14.960]  up.
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:20.480]  Well, again, we'll be monitoring the situation with Google being sued by the Department of
[2:54:20.480 --> 2:54:27.600]  Justice, the Maxwell Epstein testimony to be unsealed. I interviewed Renee Kruger, who
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:32.920]  is from South Africa today about the latest string of attacks against the white farmers
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:37.640]  out there. It's just getting worse. But again, you know, Alex, I'm just, I really want to
[2:54:37.640 --> 2:54:44.000]  emphasize to people because the news is completely ignoring the biggest bombshell news story of
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:50.320]  the year, maybe of our time, a compromised politician by at least five at minimum five
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:54.080]  different countries, a man who is running his son around the world. And you know, the
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:58.240]  more you look into this, you wonder how much Hunter was even willingly doing this versus
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:02.760]  his dad was telling him to do it, taking 50% of the cut. I mean, that's basically a pimp.
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:07.840]  And he's pimping his son out there like, like he's some sort of political, you know, hooker
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:11.280]  or something for favors. I mean, it's really just sick. And the media's ignoring it. A totally
[2:55:11.280 --> 2:55:16.440]  compromised candidate. I mean, literally, a Chinese agent, Romania's got deals, Moscow.
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:19.960]  I mean, it's, it's unbelievable. The media won't even cover it. So it's been selling
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:23.880]  America out. They've been pimping us, but America's awakening the world's awakening.
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:27.720]  Now America's captured by the global square in deep trouble. Everybody around the world
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:33.560]  tell folks about Bandai video about 2020. Elections Center dot com dot informers dot com and about
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:37.640]  all these shows we're doing. Thank you. Leo's agami. Leo's agami.com. Thank you to everybody.
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:44.200]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over straight ahead.
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.840]  History is now history is taking place in front of us. We are at the crossroads. We are now
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:54.920]  only two weeks out from the most historic and important election in world history. I've
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:58.400]  been saying that for over a year, but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:02.840]  This is so critical. The new world order wants to repudiate the nation state that will repudiate
[2:56:02.840 --> 2:56:07.120]  the idea of America. They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:12.920]  and bring in their technology. So they are throwing everything they've got and not just
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:17.360]  the American people, but the people of the world. That's why your word of mouth is beyond
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:22.640]  king. It is paramount. When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:25.840]  you shoot your own video or write your own article or knock on your neighbor's door
[2:56:25.840 --> 2:56:29.280]  and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump. When
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:33.680]  you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it adds
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:38.760]  up into giant things. Many hands make life work. History is happening now. Take action
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:45.920]  now while you still can. Please for all of our futures.
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:53.560]  Transmitting worldwide. From the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:55.440]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:07.240]  And there's 28 over 2020. You don't need to be a tinfoil hat-wearing. It's Percy Theorists
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:14.800]  and everything. It's rigged. The media narrative is rigged. The debates are rigged. Social media
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:20.120]  is rigged. The election is, oh, you can't say that because social media is rigged and
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:25.120]  they'll ban you if you say that. But what have we witnessed over the past week? We've
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:31.560]  witnessed the most intensive acceleration of social media censorship and media narrative
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:38.080]  censorship than perhaps ever before in recorded history. The quickening of how fast this has
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:45.000]  moved has been absolutely incredible. Of course, first they came for Alex Jones. People said
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:49.320]  it's going to stop at Alex Jones and they came for hate speech and they came for other
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:57.120]  people. Now they're coming for major newspapers. Last time I checked, this may have changed
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:58:01.960]  in the past few hours or so, but the New York Post was still locked out of its own Twitter
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:08.240]  account. Okay. This is not in full wars. This is not some far-right extremist organization
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:14.640]  as they always claim we are. This is the New York Post. We have White House officials
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:20.760]  censored, locked out of their accounts for questioning the efficacy of masks, despite
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:26.800]  the fact that numerous epidemiologists, scientific experts in numerous different countries have
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:32.760]  said basically the same thing. Everything's rigged. Everything's censored. We warned you
[2:58:32.760 --> 2:58:38.680]  about it two plus years ago. We told you exactly how it would unfold and where it would go
[2:58:38.680 --> 2:58:46.840]  and that is precisely what has happened. Once again, we were right. So we know what's being
[2:58:46.840 --> 2:58:52.240]  censored. What's not being censored? That's an interesting question to ask. What is still
[2:58:52.240 --> 2:59:00.040]  allowed on these social media platforms in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of expression?
[2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:05.040]  Well, we have another example of that today in this article, which I literally posted
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:12.560]  about 20 minutes ago, headline, Instagram refuses to remove black art image showing
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:18.480]  severed heads of white people and their explanation as to why they don't remove this, despite
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:24.760]  removing, of course, vast quantities of other content on a routine basis. Well, it's just
[2:59:24.760 --> 2:59:32.000]  people's right to express themselves differently. Now, can you imagine if a white supremacist
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:37.240]  far right extremist Instagram account, if they were able to get on there in the first
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:43.960]  place, had posted an image of two white people holding the heads, the severed heads, the
[2:59:43.960 --> 2:59:50.520]  decapitated, blood dripping, gut dripping, gory heads of two black people, would Instagram
[2:59:50.520 --> 2:59:57.080]  respond by saying, oh, that's just their freedom of expression? No, they ban it in an instant
[2:59:57.080 --> 3:00:02.200]  and they ban the people behind posting it. Now, we can talk about hypocrisy until we're
[3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:08.840]  blue in the face. But of course, until Republicans take actual action, rather than sending strongly
[3:00:08.840 --> 3:00:14.480]  worded letters to these social media companies, it's never going to change and their monopolies
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:19.000]  are going to grow ever bigger and bigger, maybe with the big antitrust thing today that's
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:25.440]  going to change. But we've been looking for it for the past two years, not much has happened.
[3:00:25.440 --> 3:00:31.320]  That needle hasn't moved very far on the dial. And now social media giant Instagram, which
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:36.120]  routinely removes offensive content, some of which I'm going to go on to specify, has
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:41.040]  refused to remove a black or image depicting the severed heads of white people, arguing
[3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:47.560]  that, quote, people may express themselves differently. The image was posted by an account
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:53.840]  called support black art, which from from what I can tell is an extension of some, you know,
[3:00:53.840 --> 3:00:59.120]  Black Lives Matter outfit, and features to obese black women, because of course, Instagram
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:04.600]  is big behind the promotion of obesity, because it's really healthy and doesn't cause debilitating
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:12.200]  deathly illnesses. To obese black women, carrying the severed heads of a white man and a white
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:16.560]  woman, and then people will come back and say, Oh, triggered snowflake, what, you don't
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:23.520]  want art, you want art censored. Now it's about the hypocrisy. It's about the two tier standard.
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:27.800]  I don't care. But for all I care, you could both gore or whatever you want on Instagram.
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:31.760]  But if they allow that, they have to allow everything. Of course, they don't, which I'm
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:38.560]  going to get onto. After the image was reported to the Facebook owned company, which refuses
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:44.160]  to respond to lawsuits for a year, because that's just how it operates and there's nothing
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:50.200]  you can do about it. The company responded by saying the sick artwork didn't violate
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:01:54.160]  their community guidelines. Well, of course, it didn't. And explaining its decision not
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:02:00.640]  to remove the image, Instagram stated, quote, because Instagram is a global community or
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:06.120]  a globalist community. We understand that people may express themselves differently.
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:12.280]  So this is obviously in these hyper tense, hyper driven, hyper volatile times, an image
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:19.560]  posted, which is flagrantly a form of racism. As you can tell, it's literally supporting
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:24.320]  black empowerment by showing these two fat women carrying the severed heads of white
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:30.360]  people, kind of a narrative going on there, not very well veiled, not very well hidden.
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:36.000]  But according to Instagram, people may just express themselves differently. Now, of course,
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:41.200]  as I said before, if it was reversed, if there was a picture of two severed heads of black
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:47.600]  people being carried by two white people, even in an artistic depiction, that will be
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:53.440]  removed within hours. And as we've highlighted numerous times in the past, Instagram's hypocrisy
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:59.640]  when it comes to censorship is rampant. So they allow the glorification, the celebration
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:05.360]  of decapitating white people, which is basically what this artwork represents, which is completely
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:10.380]  fine by me. I don't support censoring it. But again, if that's your policy to censor
[3:03:10.380 --> 3:03:16.440]  offensive content, kind of a two tier standard going on here. Interesting to know what Instagram
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:23.720]  does censor and has censored over recent times and over the course of the past year. Because
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:28.440]  earlier this month, we had another article pointing out how Instagram had announced that
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:35.280]  it would be banning all QAnon accounts due to their alleged promotion of real world harm.
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:39.760]  No actual evidence of that, but they all got banned, as they all got banned on Facebook,
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:45.480]  as they all got banned on YouTube. Again, this bedwetting over QA anon, which we've seen
[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:51.460]  amongst the left amongst the social media giants is very much that very much a hysterical
[3:03:51.460 --> 3:03:57.080]  moral panic. And even if you think it's a bunch of BS, which I do, it should be allowed
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:03.320]  on the platform. This is what we warned about. This is what Facebook did at what they moved
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:09.040]  towards after they banned Alex Jones. They moved towards banning ideas. They're not
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:13.760]  banning hate speech. They're not just banning people. They're banning ideas. And when those
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:19.880]  conglomerates, when those companies own the vast majority of global communication, that's
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:26.760]  a problem because then it gets into communist Chinese style social credit score controls.
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:32.520]  And that has actual real world harm, which I'm going to get on to. But we're asking
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:39.440]  the question, what does Instagram ban? What does Instagram allow? Well, just last month,
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:47.280]  they refused to ban ISIS accounts that were literally on their platform celebrating 9-11,
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:51.840]  celebrating videos of the plane slamming into the Twin Towers, arguing with the exact same
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:58.160]  justification that we saw in this case, that glorifying terrorist attacks was a form of
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:04.320]  alternative expression. Then again, if you had somebody on the right glorifying, for
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:10.320]  example, what Dylan Roof did when he massacred a bunch of black people, chances are that
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:16.200]  wouldn't be classified in the same bracket. Just saying, just suggesting. Last month,
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:21.200]  we also highlighted how Instagram was promoting images of obese people in the name of body
[3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:26.320]  positivity, despite the fact that it leads to horrific illnesses and early death. They
[3:05:26.320 --> 3:05:31.000]  really care about you, while refusing to accept healthy eating ads, which include photos that
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:38.600]  show people with well toned bodies. Yes, you can't post a dietary supplement ad on Facebook
[3:05:38.600 --> 3:05:44.240]  owned Instagram now, that shows people with well toned bodies, because as they said in
[3:05:44.240 --> 3:05:49.400]  their justification at the time, it may hurt people's feelings. So if it hurts people's
[3:05:49.400 --> 3:05:55.320]  feelings, it has to go, but you can literally post the severed heads of white people whose
[3:05:55.320 --> 3:06:02.560]  feelings are hurt, who cares? Last year, Instagram started fact checking memes and removing them,
[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:06.280]  including obvious satire such as a meme that said Hillary Clinton had killed Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:06:06.280 --> 3:06:11.040]  Obviously, the only memes affected by that policy were, quote, right wing memes. They
[3:06:11.040 --> 3:06:17.000]  removed photos of people doing the okay hand sign claiming it was a form of hate speech.
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:21.920]  They allowed Islamic jihadists to support terrorism, as we previously stated, but then
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:27.600]  removed photographs of people at gun ranges, saying that that was a violation of their
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:33.280]  dangerous organization guidelines. They also removed a photo of Caitlyn Bennett for basically
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:42.040]  wearing an informal speech. So that's all, and we're allowed to go on there.
[3:06:42.040 --> 3:07:00.040]  There's a lot of people who are saying, I like my mask, I like my face diaper, I like
[3:07:00.040 --> 3:07:06.680]  my beanky. And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:15.320]  death numbers. This is our new neurotic control freak society overseen by robots, overseen by AI,
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:21.720]  and all of it is designed to make humans non-essential. That's why out of the gates they
[3:07:21.720 --> 3:07:30.920]  tell us you are non-essential. You are non-essential. Your company, your restaurant, your job, your
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:37.240]  profession is non-essential. This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated, and Bill Gates sits
[3:07:37.240 --> 3:07:43.560]  on top of it. Come on folks, let's reject this. I've got some really important and quite frankly
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:48.920]  bad news for you. We've confirmed from high-level sources our own research that if Joe Biden's
[3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:51.720]  able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy,
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:56.840]  they intend to not just shut down info wars but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:00.680]  Now here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the
[3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:05.880]  economy and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:10.440]  and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash. But here's the really good news. The really good
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:17.000]  news. Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer asleep and we understand that the
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:21.240]  globals are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation
[3:08:21.240 --> 3:08:27.880]  and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever. That's why we must come together now as
[3:08:27.880 --> 3:08:33.000]  Americans, every race, color and creed and repudiate the New World Order and stand firm
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:37.640]  and vote for Donald Trump but also the information war support independent media that tells the
[3:08:37.640 --> 3:08:46.440]  truth like info wars.com. Thank you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:58.760]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:08.680]  Talk about how everything is rigged, particularly in the context of social
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:11.640]  media with Instagram refusing to remove the photo.
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:17.880]  So artwork, severed heads of white people, if you go to a gun range and you post a picture
[3:09:17.880 --> 3:09:22.360]  of yourself firing their gun legally and lawfully, they'll remove that because it
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:28.360]  promotes violence. Oh, but if you're a literal ISIS terrorist celebrating glorifying the
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:37.400]  attacks of 9-11, that's just free expression, dude. That's fine. Meanwhile, we have Wikipedia
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:43.080]  which apparently is this great authoritative source for all facts and news. No, it isn't.
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:48.920]  It's a left-wing blog. The same people who control Wikipedia, control Twitter, control
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:55.240]  Instagram, control Facebook, it's all the same mindset. And in the context of these Hunter
[3:09:55.240 --> 3:10:01.720]  Biden emails, we have this headline out of zero hedge, debunked Wikipedia editors back Biden's
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:07.320]  stifle dissent says after the New York Post published damning emails proving that Joe Biden was
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:12.280]  involved in Sun Hunter's business with barisma before he threatened the government of Ukraine.
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:16.760]  If they didn't fire their chief prosecutor during an active investigation of the energy giant,
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:24.280]  a war has broken out behind the scenes at Wikipedia where activist editors claim
[3:10:24.280 --> 3:10:31.240]  and that's what they all are. It's a closed group. It's a solid wall of far left activist editors
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:37.080]  that not only change the facts gloss over the facts, polish the facts, twist the facts in terms of
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:43.320]  current events, but also historical events. Now they're on there claiming with no evidence that
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:50.280]  the Ukraine scandal has been quote debunked. Now bear in mind, Wikipedia literally has a
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:57.880]  profile page of me. Last time I checked, which says that I'm a quote political extremist. I've
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:03.720]  never advocated any form of extremism, never advocated any form of violence, but it's up there
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:08.840]  and it looks like it's up there for good. It's been there and it still is there as we can see
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:15.560]  right now. It's been there since July. You see the funny thing about Wikipedia is when you try to
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:22.600]  contact Wikipedia to have them retract, amend and correct and obviously clearly libel a statement
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:29.640]  like that, which leads to real world harm consequences like bank accounts be platforming you
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:34.680]  if you're applying for a mortgage, if you're applying to rent a house, buy a house, whatever.
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:40.920]  These companies, these financial institutions, sometimes they do their background research,
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:45.640]  sometimes they do their credit checks. Now, as we've seen in the UK over the past few weeks,
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:49.800]  just as we saw in America for the past two years with Chase Bank and others,
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:55.240]  people are not only being de-platformed from social media, from YouTube, Twitter, whatever,
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:02.440]  they're being de-platformed from being able to transact in the real world. Oh, but cancel culture
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:09.640]  doesn't exist. The AC activists as we've shown this BuzzFeed news article literally tried to lobby
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:15.960]  MasterCard to cut off payments to the quote far right. Who's the far right? Anyone who disagrees
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:22.120]  with them? Oh, so how do you pay your bills? How do you pay your rent? How do you pay your mortgage?
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:27.560]  How do you buy things without a credit card in this cashless society? Well, you can't,
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:32.280]  you'll be homeless, you'll be out on the street. You'll be not just canceled on social media,
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:38.360]  your life will be canceled. Oh, but cancel culture doesn't exist. Doesn't exist.
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:48.040]  So Wikipedia, if you actually try to find out how to contact them legally, whether directly,
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:56.120]  individually or through lawyers, the Wikipedia organization doesn't exist. Apparently, there's
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:13:03.240]  no organization that controls Wikipedia. It's an entity that has no controlling force or
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:09.800]  organization behind it. The only people who control Wikipedia are the editors of Wikipedia.
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:16.760]  And then if you try to get in contact with the editors of Wikipedia, or if you try to take
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:22.280]  or threaten cease and desist legal action against the editors of Wikipedia,
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:31.080]  then Wikipedia, the organization, which also doesn't exist, apparently, comes in and defends
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:38.520]  the people who edit Wikipedia. And basically, they've never lost a case. So they could literally
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:44.520]  put up there that I was a child molester, and I could do absolutely nothing about it. Oh,
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:50.280]  but they've got sources, you see. They've got sources to say that I'm a political extremist.
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:57.640]  Who's their source? Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. Right. So that your source is people who work for
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:02.760]  a company with the exact same mindset as you. Your source is basically yourself.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:10.120]  It's really impressive how they bring this game, isn't it? So they can literally say anything they
[3:14:10.120 --> 3:14:16.520]  like about you and claim that they've got multiple sources to prove it. Also, who are the sources?
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:23.320]  Impartial independent organizations. No, it's basically themselves. Where the source, Mark
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:28.280]  Zuckerberg and Facebook of the source, we say you're a dangerous individual, then you're a dangerous
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:33.800]  individual for life. Then you're a political extremist, as we see here with the Board of
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:39.960]  Trustees, who sit on every single social media company, the ones that the Biden campaign has
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:46.040]  now hired in the final few weeks of the campaign, as we'll go on to. So their source is each other.
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:51.160]  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, world employees say that you're a dangerous individual,
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:56.360]  that you're a political extremist. That then goes on your Wikipedia page. That's then a
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:03.880]  stain on you for life. Then banks, corporations, financial institutions, landlords, whoever,
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:08.920]  credit card companies, they look at that and they say, well, we don't want to give a bank
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:15.160]  account to a political extremist. We don't want to rent a house to a political extremist. So
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:19.240]  we're just not going to do that. And you're going to be out on the street. That's happened to people
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:24.120]  in my country, and it's happened to several people in the United States. And what is that?
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:29.800]  It's the social credit score. It's the communist Chinese system, where if somebody gets on the
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:35.480]  internet, and in China criticizes the government, well, suddenly they're not allowed to buy a plane
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:40.360]  ticket. Suddenly they're not allowed to get on a train to visit their family, because they've
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:47.320]  violated the sacred norms of the social credit system. And it's even more chilling than that,
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:54.200]  of course, because in China, the people who you're affiliated with, your friends, their social credit
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:16:00.760]  score is negatively impacted by your behavior. So not only are you going to get deplatformed
[3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:05.400]  from having a bank account, from being able to rent a house, from being able to start a business,
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:11.400]  so your friends, so then your friends are going to disavow you, so then you're literally homeless
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:17.320]  on the street with no money, no bank account, no friends. A very impressive system that they've
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:23.880]  set up, isn't it? I mean, all well, this would have been a pipe dream for all well, or Aldous
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:31.080]  Huxley. But now, according to Wikipedia, the Hunter Biden scandal is debunked. Why? Because they
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:38.600]  say it is, and they cite Twitter, which also said it was. Of course, we had the Biden campaign
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:44.280]  official a few days ago said, well, this has proven to be debunked. Why? Well, because Twitter said
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:50.920]  so. All right, yeah, but the overwhelming vast majority of people employed with Twitter are
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:57.960]  far leftist Democrats, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It says any dissent challenging the debunked
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:03.800]  status has been repeatedly dismissed, this is on Wikipedia, and changes by editors writing that
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:09.800]  the Ukraine scandal is an open issue have been reverted to debunked, and the authors admonished.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:16.200]  I mean, I'm shocked that there are even some authors left on Wikipedia that get to dissent
[3:17:16.600 --> 3:17:23.800]  against that impenetrable wall of wokeism. So as RT notes, in recent days, Wikipedia editors
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:28.840]  have been engaged in regular spots about the inclusion of the word debunked. But the people
[3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:34.280]  who always win are the woke crowd. They always get their way because they have the majority
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:40.360]  of the power. Wait, some of that news will be right back. I've got some bad news for you.
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:45.880]  Then I got some really bad news. And then I've got some good news. The bad news is even if Trump
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:50.040]  is reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at martial law, medical lockdowns,
[3:17:50.040 --> 3:17:54.600]  race riots, and a depression. That's the globalists. They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:18:01.000]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:05.240]  try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control,
[3:18:05.240 --> 3:18:09.400]  and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:14.440]  what the left are doing. That's the really bad news. The good news is this has triggered people
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:18.840]  out of their sleep all over the world, and the resistance is mounting and the globalists are
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:24.760]  panicking. So bottom line, we're in the fight. We're starting to win, but it's serious. So pray to
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:29.960]  God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word, and buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:34.440]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now. Please
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:50.360]  visit InfoWarsTour and keep us on air. Thank you so much.
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:11.640]  50% off free shipping and triple patriot points in your next order. Also, if you sign up for

[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:20.280]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out while the other
[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:24.040]  step is close to selling out. Some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have
[3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:29.000]  actually come back in to stock. And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  get the other things that have actually sold out. So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:37.080]  Thank you so much for keeping InfoWars on the air. Obviously, we're critical of the fight
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:20:06.520]  that you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:11.560]  Come out and say who the real winner is. That way they can contest the election,
[3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:14.840]  even though Trump's declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots,
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:19.880]  then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession, and have the UN come in and declare
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:23.960]  the election for Biden. This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:28.280]  And so when you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[3:20:28.280 --> 3:20:33.720]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition the public
[3:20:33.720 --> 3:20:39.320]  that big tech works in unison to suppress speech and information. This is Election Meddling 101.
[3:20:39.320 --> 3:20:45.640]  This is illegal. It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track
[3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:51.800]  your GPS location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that
[3:20:51.800 --> 3:20:58.200]  was un-American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:04.360]  Androids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to,
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:09.480]  your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps
[3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:16.280]  as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do
[3:21:16.280 --> 3:21:21.560]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:25.960]  saved forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance
[3:21:25.960 --> 3:21:31.480]  scores based on information. This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your

[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:46.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:22:02.040]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dot News.
[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:10.200]  So we're going to switch gears now and start talking about coronavirus and the multitude
[3:22:10.200 --> 3:22:16.360]  of lockdowns that have expanded over the United Kingdom over the past week or so. Of course,
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:22.200]  now it's not a lockdown. It's it's a circuit breaker. Okay. It's just for a few weeks.
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:27.160]  Just you just be under house arrest for another few weeks. It's fine. Stop complaining about it.
[3:22:28.120 --> 3:22:32.920]  They've changed the language because they know the resistance against lockdown.
[3:22:32.920 --> 3:22:38.360]  This is especially evident in the polls is definitely growing a couple of months ago,
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:41.880]  three months ago. If you looked at the polls in the United Kingdom, for example,
[3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:47.960]  still the clear majority of people not only supported the existing lockdown measures but
[3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:55.720]  supported making them even more draconian that has started to shift over the past couple of weeks.
[3:22:56.680 --> 3:23:03.720]  So now instead of changing the actual policy and reacting to public opinion to public sympathies,
[3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:09.320]  they've just changed the name of the lockdown. It's not a lockdown. It's a circuit breaker.
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:15.000]  It's just going to be for a few weeks. Then again, maybe not. Maybe it's going to be for
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:21.240]  six weeks as it is in Ireland. Of course, back at the start of the pandemic lockdown in March,
[3:23:22.040 --> 3:23:27.000]  we were told here in the United Kingdom by our esteemed Prime Minister Boris Johnson
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:35.160]  that we just had to do this to protect the NHS. Of course, the vast majority of people supported it
[3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:41.240]  and thought maybe it would go until the end of April, maybe into May, and then it would be over.
[3:23:41.240 --> 3:23:47.240]  Then we'd all move on with our lives. No, there's no getting over it. It's here forever because it's
[3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:54.840]  such a bounty for mass surveillance and mass imposition and evisceration of our liberties.
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:24:01.480]  But again, at the start, they told us, just maybe four weeks, maybe five weeks to protect the NHS.
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:08.440]  Of course, the NHS was fine. All the NHS hospitals were empty. They closed down the Nightingale
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:14.680]  hospitals, the extra hospitals that they built to supposedly deal with this overflow of COVID patients.
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:20.120]  The end result, as you saw, was a bunch of nurses, and this was the same in the United States of
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:28.920]  America, wasting their time doing TikTok dancing videos. And yes, those TikTok dancing videos
[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:35.480]  have started to return because, of course, now people have once again been completely terrified
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:41.160]  into going back into the hospitals, into not getting their cancer screenings, their treatment
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:47.160]  for other serious diseases. A lot of those people are literally dying right now. A lot of people,
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:52.280]  a lot of esteemed experts like the German Health Minister have said repeatedly,
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:58.040]  the lockdown itself will kill more people than COVID. It doesn't matter. Oh, but the government
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:04.680]  really cares about you. No, they don't. No, they don't. And what's even more offensive about this?
[3:25:04.680 --> 3:25:10.360]  Oh, by the way, those TikTok nurse dancing videos, they kind of peaked. I think it was in
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:17.560]  maybe April, late April, May, earlier this year. They kind of peaked. They all got their social
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:22.280]  media clout because they were so busy dealing with all the COVID patients. They literally had the
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:27.640]  time to choreograph and arrange all these dances that do them over and over again for social media
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:35.240]  clout. It kind of ended when a bunch of friends, parents, sons, and daughters of actual cancer
[3:25:35.240 --> 3:25:42.520]  victims came out and said, our son, our daughter, our dad, our mother can't get cancer treatment
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:46.840]  because you've canceled their appointment because the hospitals are supposedly
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:53.400]  overflowing and in dire threat of becoming in an emergency situation where there's literally
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:25:59.960]  people dying in the corridors. Didn't happen. Didn't happen. And they were all doing TikTok
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:05.320]  dances. But then when the actual relatives, friends and relatives of cancer victims came out and
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:11.160]  said, what the hell are you doing? Then it kind of subsided. Well, now it's back. There was a big
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:17.400]  video, a big viral video yesterday of a doctor in India doing a similar dance. And now that we've
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:22.200]  been convinced, or many, a great portion of the population has been convinced that now we have
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:29.880]  a second wave, even though the hospitals for this time of year are at the exact same occupancy
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:36.200]  or even below they were in October last year. Now we've been convinced of that. Now we're going to
[3:26:36.200 --> 3:26:43.320]  get more TikTok dancing videos. Why? Because people aren't going to hospital because they're
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:48.600]  either afraid or their appointments have been canceled and they're all dying in vast numbers,
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:57.080]  but your government really cares about you. Meanwhile, mask virtue signal Gary Linnaker
[3:26:57.080 --> 3:27:02.440]  caught breaking mask rules. Now if you don't know who Gary Linnaker is, he's one of the most
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:09.880]  insufferable woke celebrity idiots who resides in the United Kingdom. This is the guy who repeatedly
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:15.320]  campaigned for refugees to be brought into the United Kingdom, despite the fact that
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:22.360]  when he claimed that he claimed they were child refugees, even though photographs of these refugees
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:27.560]  clearly made out that they were literally like 40 years old, doesn't matter. This is one of the
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:31.640]  guys who campaigned for that, bearing in mind, of course, which I'm going to get onto with the
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:38.600]  Manchester bombing, which is still going through court right now. The Manchester bomber was literally
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:45.240]  a refugee brought into the United Kingdom by the government and by the Royal Navy went on to blow
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:52.360]  himself up and eat, injure, maim or kill 800 people, most of them kids. Refugees welcome.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:59.800]  We have the Paris massacre attack. Basically all of the Paris massacre, jihadists came into Europe
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:06.840]  via that same refugee wave, supported by the likes of Lily Allen, by the likes of Gary Linnaker.
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:12.680]  But he stood up for his beliefs a few months ago by coming out and claiming that he will take in a
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:17.640]  refugee after he was challenged multiple times. He said, yes, I'm going to take in a refugee.
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:23.080]  I'm going to house a refugee because he loves diversity so much. He lives in what is
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:31.000]  the least diverse area of London. It's called bonds. It's 90 plus percent white.
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:36.360]  Now, London is very diverse. Let's put it that way. And even the quote, nice areas
[3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:42.520]  don't really get above 90 percent white. But Gary Linnaker chose to live in an area of London,
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:47.640]  which is probably one of, it's probably in the top three of the whitest areas in London.
[3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:53.560]  But he loves diversity so much that he's put his money where his mouth is and he's taken in a refugee.
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:59.080]  Of course, that was a few months ago and it hasn't happened yet. And I wonder if it will,
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:04.520]  and I doubt if it will. But to give you another example of his rampant hypocrisy, this came out
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:11.160]  just yesterday. So Gary Linnaker put out several tweets over the course of the lockdown period,
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:17.560]  including one in April, where he said, quote, how can there be any debate about whether we
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:23.640]  should be wearing a mask, even if it's only a 1% chance of making you safer, even if it's only
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:28.440]  a 1% chance of stopping you giving it to someone else, even if it only saves one life, if it just
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:35.080]  saves one life, yeah, don't get in your car, relinquish your rights and mobility, don't drive
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:39.320]  anywhere, don't get on a plane, if it just saves one life, because there are car crashes, let's ban
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:45.320]  driving. So he's a big proponent of mask wearing and has been since the very start of this pandemic.
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:52.120]  He tweeted again in July, this seems to be the most obvious thing in the world, can't understand
[3:29:52.120 --> 3:29:57.800]  why anyone would object to wearing a mask, painless gesture to ensure you don't spread the virus.
[3:29:57.800 --> 3:30:03.720]  He said, again, on July 14th, why would anyone object to wearing a mask in a shop?
[3:30:05.160 --> 3:30:12.520]  Not exactly a hardship, what a country of snowflakes we've become. Then he said again,
[3:30:12.520 --> 3:30:17.640]  in another tweet, late to whether everything wearing masks of all things is the most obvious
[3:30:17.640 --> 3:30:22.120]  thing we can do to help decrease the spread of the virus. So he's literally said four or five
[3:30:22.120 --> 3:30:28.440]  times on Twitter, probably elsewhere as well, how dare you not wear a mask? And specifically,
[3:30:28.440 --> 3:30:35.800]  how dare you not wear a mask in a shop? Well, guess what, Mr. Virtue Signaler in Chief, Gary
[3:30:35.800 --> 3:30:42.520]  Linnaker got caught doing just a few days ago, here in the United Kingdom, in Barnes, his very
[3:30:42.520 --> 3:30:49.880]  diverse, ethnically varying area where he lives, he got caught, wait for it, not wearing a mask.
[3:30:49.880 --> 3:30:57.880]  Well, imagine my shock. And this is after, which I forgot to mention here, he literally took a
[3:30:57.880 --> 3:31:06.600]  photograph of himself out in the same area outside the same shop back in April, I believe it was,
[3:31:06.600 --> 3:31:12.280]  yeah, 8th of April, this Marks and Spencer supermarket, where he's literally, and this,
[3:31:12.280 --> 3:31:17.640]  by the way, was before mask wearing was becoming commonplace. I mean, the vast majority of people
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:22.280]  don't wear masks outside in the UK, because it's not yet the law, it probably will be. But this
[3:31:22.280 --> 3:31:27.560]  was way before basically anyone was wearing a mask in the UK, at least outside. And he said,
[3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:33.400]  I'm taking no chances, he will the mask, Virtue Signaled. Now, months and months later, he's
[3:31:33.400 --> 3:31:38.600]  going into Marks and Spencer once again, and not wearing a mask, one rule for him, for the world's
[3:31:38.600 --> 3:31:39.080]  rules.
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:57.240]  Now, it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[3:31:57.240 --> 3:32:02.520]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu
[3:32:02.520 --> 3:32:08.360]  comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest
[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:14.360]  band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[3:32:14.360 --> 3:32:18.120]  tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action,
[3:32:18.120 --> 3:32:23.640]  you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[3:32:23.640 --> 3:32:28.200]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your
[3:32:28.200 --> 3:32:39.640]  email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.

[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:07.400]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good ol' fashion stupidity.
[3:34:08.200 --> 3:34:15.880]  No more pesky lawn order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats,
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:21.880]  sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now,
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:28.760]  and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:32.520]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:06.360]  The links to ban.video, by 2020ElectionCenter.com, is a clone of the side of the exact same links,
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:13.160]  the exact same videos we can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:17.720]  the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out,
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.720]  since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech, and that he's modern in the
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:25.560]  situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:29.720]  because he has to take an action. We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very,
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:34.680]  very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new
[3:35:34.680 --> 3:35:56.440]  redesign, infowars.com, and share that link. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:10.440]  We are back for the final section.
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:16.360]  We'll move on to talk about what's going on in the courts here in London in the weeks to be
[3:36:16.360 --> 3:36:24.120]  Manchester Arena bombing case. Of course, this happened back in May 2017, and Islamist extremist
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:31.640]  suicide bomber blew himself up after an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. More
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:39.400]  than 800 people were wounded, 23 people died, many of those victims were children, and what continues
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:46.440]  to be revealed with the inquest into this tragedy, into this horrific attack, is the fact that this
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:54.360]  bomber, Salman Abdi, who by the way is brought in by the Royal Navy as a refugee, hashtag refugees
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:37:00.760]  welcome, as a result of government policy, as a result of the disastrous intervention, military
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:07.080]  intervention by Barack Obama and David Cameron into Libya to overthrow a secular leader in
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:13.000]  Colonel Gaddafi and put into power Islamist radicals. What another great idea that was.
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:17.640]  What continues to come out in the aftermath and during the inquest is the fact that
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:24.600]  this suicide bomber could have been stopped. We have a headline here out of the Daily Mail.
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:31.320]  Could have been stopped by the way if political correctness didn't exist. Seems to be a common
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:37.480]  thread throughout this inquest. Headline. Police officer who received a bravery award after
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:44.760]  Manchester Arena attack took a two hour lunch break to buy a kebab, ironic, missed suicide bomber
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:50.760]  and admits she would probably have asked what was in his rucksack. So this suicide bomber,
[3:37:50.760 --> 3:37:57.080]  22 year old refugee Salman Abdi, hashtag refugees welcome, was walking through the Manchester Arena,
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:02.680]  walked from the train station, which is located near the arena with a massive bag,
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:10.200]  sweating profusely, nervous. At some point, reportedly praying to Allah, nobody thought
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:16.440]  to ask him what he was up to. Although actually they did and then they reported it to security
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:21.800]  in place, who did absolutely nothing. A police officer patrolling Manchester Arena,
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:28.280]  went on an unacceptable two hour break to buy a kebab. On the day of suicide bomber Salman Abdi's
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:34.920]  attack, an inquiry has heard. British transport police officer, Jessica Bullo, admitted to the
[3:38:34.920 --> 3:38:40.280]  inquiry that she would probably have asked Abdi what was in his rucksack had she seen him.
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:46.040]  She didn't see him because she decided to leave the area for two hours to go and get a kebab at
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:51.720]  the very important at the time. And then she was given a bravery award. She was off patrol for two
[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:55.880]  hours and nine minutes during which she drove half an hour to buy a kebab with a colleague.
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:00.760]  She broke down in tears as she spoke about how she had struggled to cope in the arena following
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:10.360]  the explosion. So again, many, many missed opportunities. Last week, the inquiry was told
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:16.600]  about 30 minutes before the explosion. Security worker Julie Merchant, checking for merchandise
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:22.360]  bootleggers, the briefly drawn PC Bullo's attention, this same woman who decided to go for a kebab
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:29.640]  for two hours, to a quote, praying crank on the upstairs level of the foyer. So this guy's got
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:34.760]  a huge backpack. He's anxious. He's nervous. He's sweating. He's praying to Allah. Oh, totally not
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:41.160]  out of place. An Ariana Grande concert. Miss Merchant said she did not think the man was a bomber.
[3:39:42.280 --> 3:39:48.040]  Okay, but thought it worth mentioning as he had secreted himself away in an area he should not
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:52.840]  have been. She told the inquiry, I just thought it was worth mentioning. So this guy's got a
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:58.440]  massive bomb in his backpack. He's praying to Allah. He's in an area of the building where he's not
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:05.080]  supposed to be. And this woman says that it was, you know, nothing, nothing worth mentioning. She
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:11.560]  says it, even though I was not suspicious of him, how on earth are you not suspicious of a Middle
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:18.280]  Eastern man with a huge backpack praying to Allah, trying to get into a massive arena filled with
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:26.120]  thousands of people. So the police officer who was told this, decided to go for a kebab.
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:32.360]  And then she was given a bravery award. Also related to this, Sky News reports Manchester
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:38.840]  Arena attack father confronted dodgy looking bomber minutes before blast. The father described
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:43.640]  how he confronted the Manchester Arena bomber as he hid behind a wall with his bomb waiting to
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:49.640]  launch his attack. Chris Wilde and his wife, Julie Whitley exchanged a look as they walked around
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:54.680]  Salman Abadi, who was sitting with his back against a raised platform outside of arena doors with
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:41:01.320]  his rucksack beside him. Ms. Whitley said she believed he looked dodgy. And Mr. Wilde went back
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:08.760]  to talk to him before reporting him to security while they waited in the foyer for their 14-year-old
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:15.400]  daughter and friend. What did he tell security? Well, he told them that Mr. Abadi, that he had his
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:20.760]  terrorist, had a big rucksack and it was full. Adding, I just thought it was strange. It's a
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:26.360]  kid's concert. And if that was a merchandiser, why wouldn't he be selling his things there?
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:35.720]  Now he reported this as the story continues and is buried in the depth of the story. He
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:44.600]  reported this to a security guard called Mohammed Agha. Interesting. Who shared the
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:49.720]  suspicions with colleague Kyle Lawler, but Mr. Lawler claims he could not get through to his
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:56.440]  control on the radio. He said there was nothing Mr. Mohammed Agha could have done, adding,
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:00.760]  in no way do I blame him because the guy was already in there. However, after the bombing,
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:08.040]  Mr. Wilde told police I felt I was being fobbed off, which means in British parlance ignored
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:14.760]  dismissed. So multiple people. And by the way, I highlighted this immediately after the attack
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:21.720]  happened three years ago in a video in which a woman was interviewed by Sky News and she also
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:27.400]  reported another woman. By the way, there were several individuals acting very suspiciously
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:32.920]  right before this bombing, not just the suicide bomber himself, potentially involved in a wider
[3:42:32.920 --> 3:42:38.280]  plot, but that hasn't come out yet. There was another woman who told Sky News that she saw a
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:45.080]  woman acting suspiciously, fidgeting with her bag. She told security and guess what?
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:50.760]  Guess what Mr. Mohammed security did? He did nothing. So she was looking in the right direction
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:42:57.480]  of where the explosion actually happened and smirking to herself all night, adding that the
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:04.040]  suspects spoke with a foreign accent. The eyewitness who reported this to Mr. Mohammed security
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:10.840]  said she was lectured by security for making the suspect feel uncomfortable. The suspect then
[3:43:10.840 --> 3:43:16.680]  disappeared minutes before the concert finished. Then the bomb went off and everybody died. But
[3:43:16.680 --> 3:43:23.880]  again, numerous instances of attendees at this concert trying to alert security to the fact
[3:43:23.880 --> 3:43:30.680]  that there's this shifty dodgy looking Middle Eastern guy with a huge backpack, sweating,
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:36.520]  nervous, anxious, praying to Allah. When they reported it, they were told basically to shut up.
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:45.400]  Probably some of them were told to stop being racist. 22 people died and we move on. Meanwhile,
[3:43:46.200 --> 3:43:52.440]  we had the beheading by another member of the religion of peace in Paris a few days ago.
[3:43:52.440 --> 3:43:58.360]  This is out of RT. Mosque says it regrets sharing video aimed at the beheaded teacher. French
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:04.840]  interior minister wants it to be closed. The French mosque has expressed regret for sharing a video
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:07.960]  that is believed to have provoked the gruesome murder of a history and geography teacher. The
[3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:12.360]  country's interior minister has demanded it to close down. If you don't know about this, basically
[3:44:12.360 --> 3:44:21.880]  what happened was a teacher in a French school in Paris showed his class images of the Prophet
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.360]  Muhammad, specifically cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad while he was giving a lesson on freedom
[3:44:28.360 --> 3:44:34.120]  of speech. Because we have the Charlie Hebdo attack back in 2015, which was based around the
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:41.640]  same premise. He was then outed amongst all these local mosques. Members of these mosques
[3:44:41.640 --> 3:44:47.480]  tried to incite a hate mob against him, minimally to get him fired. And ultimately, in the case of
[3:44:47.480 --> 3:44:54.760]  what happened to get him beheaded now. Hopefully, that wasn't their original intention. But one of
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:44:59.000]  the Islamic extremists who seemed to be quite plentiful in Paris, given that there's literally
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:06.680]  an attack there every other week, found this call to action and decided to behead the teacher for
[3:45:06.680 --> 3:45:13.320]  the sin of showing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad to his class in school. Now, if you remember
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:20.280]  back to 2015 with Charlie Hebdo, the reaction to that on one level was just sweet Charlie and the
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:26.040]  big marches in the streets and many world leaders gathering, supporting, endorsing freedom of speech.
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:30.840]  That would never happen now. That would totally not happen now. But the other reaction to it,
[3:45:30.840 --> 3:45:39.560]  specifically from the Pope, the Catholic Pope, supposed defender of faith, was, well, maybe
[3:45:39.560 --> 3:45:45.720]  they just deserved it. And this same explanation is coming out once again. Flashback article
[3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:52.360]  2015 BBC, Pope Francis, curse my mother expect to punch. Pope Francis has defended the right to
[3:45:52.360 --> 3:45:56.920]  freedom of expression. No, he didn't. He did the opposite. But said it was wrong to provoke others
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:02.120]  by insulting their religion. He said he told journalists on the papal plane his assistant
[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:07.480]  could expect to punch if he cursed his mother. But basically, the Pope came out said, well,
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:12.760]  if you insult a religion, surely you deserve to get massacred and cold blooded by a bunch of
[3:46:12.760 --> 3:46:19.240]  Islamists. That set the standard. It happened again in Paris. And it will continue to happen
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:24.680]  unless the stricter action is taken. I put up this hour. Coming up next,
[3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:38.600]  ballroom video insurer out back tomorrow at the summit.news.
