[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  You want answers?
[00:10.800 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:22.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.160 --> 00:27.320]  Well, I am living in the twilight zone, and I know you are as well.
[00:27.320 --> 00:33.160]  It is Thursday, the 20th day of October, 2011, we're going to get into the whole supposed
[00:33.160 --> 00:34.160]  Qaddafi killing.
[00:34.160 --> 00:41.480]  If you go to thedrudgereport.com, there is a news channel, Five Story, Tennessee becomes
[00:41.480 --> 00:44.080]  first state to fight terrorism statewide.
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.600]  The TSA rolls out checkpoints on the highways.
[00:47.600 --> 00:50.840]  Now, Homeland Security already did this two years ago.
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.440]  It's in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and TSA was involved in that.
[00:56.440 --> 01:02.440]  But I've always told you, we're going to have domestic checkpoints, just like the over
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.200]  a hundred they have inside the United States, under federal regulations up to a hundred
[01:08.200 --> 01:10.200]  miles inside.
[01:10.200 --> 01:14.120]  I went back through one of these again yesterday, and it was explosive.
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.000]  I'm going to be airing that tonight on the Nightly News.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  I just got into the office an hour or so ago, and they're getting that video off my camera.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.240]  I really got in their face this time, and I told them that the government are drug dealers
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.960]  and criminals, and that I don't respect their unconstitutional activity.
[01:33.960 --> 01:37.800]  And I just really can't take it anymore.
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.200]  I'm getting nowhere I can't handle anymore.
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.360]  I mean, the flying, the naked body scanners, the groping, the TSA at high school proms
[01:45.360 --> 01:52.920]  in New Mexico, and now this headline, I hadn't even seen this.
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.080]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55.080 --> 02:03.920]  Drudge also is linked to the report that we posted at Infowars.com that Paul Watson did
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.960]  with the headline that State Department sends in one of the leaders of the Arab Spring from
[02:08.960 --> 02:11.320]  Egypt to run Occupy Wall Street.
[02:11.320 --> 02:15.160]  It is CIA State Department, Obama run.
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.280]  That doesn't mean the people that showed up for it are bad.
[02:17.280 --> 02:19.440]  There's a lot of corruption on Wall Street.
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.240]  That is where most of the problems are emanating from, but not Wall Street itself generally,
[02:24.240 --> 02:26.400]  but the actual private Federal Reserve.
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.200]  That report is up at DrudgeReport.com as well.
[02:30.200 --> 02:34.840]  But it's just the nightmare just keeps coming more and more true here.
[02:34.840 --> 02:42.120]  The nightmare just continues to intensify, and we are going into an authoritarian nightmare.
[02:42.120 --> 02:50.040]  And I personally am beyond disgusted, beyond angry, beyond rage right now.
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.880]  It's in the news, what already came out last year, that Homeland Security arrestee legals
[02:53.880 --> 02:59.400]  in these fake stings and then releases them with green cards, that they've frozen old
[02:59.400 --> 03:07.080]  major deportations of Mexicans, not of other groups, including criminals.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.560]  And that's back in the news today.
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.520]  And then meanwhile, I pull up, and they're waving everybody through, but they want to
[03:12.520 --> 03:14.160]  search my car.
[03:14.160 --> 03:17.280]  And I've got to tell the Border Patrol, I'm going to have to sue you.
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.920]  This is 98 miles inside the US, and I'm not against the individual Border Patrol people.
[03:22.920 --> 03:28.080]  But I literally have to have this stand down, the standoff with them when I get in their
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.080]  face, and where my kids are sitting there watching this, and then they tell me to go.
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.480]  I mean, they had like six of them slime over, they said, pull over there, we're going to
[03:37.480 --> 03:38.480]  search you.
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.120]  And I said, I'm going to sue you, you come on here and violate my Fourth Amendment.
[03:43.120 --> 03:51.480]  And you know, the Supreme Court has ruled they can have these checkpoints a hundred
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.160]  miles in to check immigration status, and I believe that's unconstitutional.
[03:57.160 --> 03:59.320]  Besides the globalists don't want to check immigration status.
[03:59.320 --> 04:02.960]  I mean, the Homeland Security's been caught hiring legals to build part of the Texas border
[04:02.960 --> 04:04.400]  fence that's for show.
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.520]  That's on record, Associated Press Fox News.
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.400]  But they can't do it for drugs, and they were sticking, having people open their doors,
[04:15.400 --> 04:17.360]  stick the drug dog in.
[04:17.360 --> 04:22.600]  This is 98 miles inside the US, inside South Texas.
[04:22.600 --> 04:25.240]  And they said, pull over there, we're coming on board.
[04:25.240 --> 04:31.960]  And I said, look, we're US citizens, you can run the place of this vehicle.
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.480]  I said, if I was from Mexico, I'm the best actor in the world, basically.
[04:36.480 --> 04:39.920]  And I said, you're not going to search my vehicle with that drug dog.
[04:39.920 --> 04:42.840]  I said, besides, the government and the border patrol have been caught bringing drugs in
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.840]  here.
[04:43.840 --> 04:44.840]  They all smile.
[04:44.840 --> 04:47.200]  And then my wife got in their face.
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.040]  It was just not even emotionally draining.
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.640]  I have such clarity now that it's pure torture to have this level of understanding.
[04:56.640 --> 04:59.960]  We'll be right back.
[04:59.960 --> 05:05.360]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.120]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[05:08.120 --> 05:10.680]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[05:10.680 --> 05:14.360]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.880]  of your health and your own family.
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.080]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.440]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.640]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[05:25.640 --> 05:27.640]  small owner, General Growth Properties.
[05:27.640 --> 05:30.960]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.080]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.280]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.800]  I can't stress this enough.
[05:39.800 --> 05:42.440]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.040]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.040]  yourself.
[05:47.040 --> 05:51.360]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:51.360 --> 05:53.400]  That's End of America, the number three.
[05:53.400 --> 05:57.720]  Visit www.EndOfAmerica3.com, watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.200]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:59.200 --> 06:06.160]  And this is Communications Radio Network, proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's
[06:06.160 --> 06:10.160]  a war on for your mind.
[06:10.160 --> 06:19.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, 20th
[06:19.640 --> 06:26.720]  of October, 2011, transmission, Wayne Madsen, who's recently been inside Libya, investigative
[06:26.720 --> 06:32.240]  journalist, will be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes from now to break down the
[06:32.240 --> 06:38.560]  report that Muammar Gaddafi has been killed hiding in a spider-hole.
[06:38.560 --> 06:44.120]  John B. Wells, syndicated radio host for Coast to Coast AM, who covers a lot of the
[06:44.120 --> 06:49.360]  same issues that we get into with a great eloquence, will be joining us for 50 minutes
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.000]  of the second hour.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Webster Tarpley, who was on yesterday, will pop in, because he's recently been to Libya
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.200]  to give us his take on this latest Muammar Gaddafi report.
[06:59.200 --> 07:04.760]  And I'm also going to get a 10-minute pop in from Steve Pachennick, because, again,
[07:04.760 --> 07:08.200]  he called us up this morning and saying he thinks it's staged and has some sources.
[07:08.200 --> 07:14.640]  So we'll just get about a 10-minute pop in from him and Tarpley coming up here on the
[07:14.640 --> 07:18.320]  broadcast today.
[07:18.320 --> 07:24.600]  Now also, coming up, at least on nightly news tonight, I may air it if due has time
[07:24.600 --> 07:27.880]  to get it off my camera and loaded.
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.920]  I've got to blur out my children's faces and their names and things.
[07:32.920 --> 07:38.880]  I went to the South Texas beach a few weeks ago over the weekend, drove back 98 miles
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.000]  inside the U.S. and they're now building more of these.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  There's over 100 in the country.
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.800]  There's more than 15 in Texas, and they wanted to search our car with a drug dog, and I told
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.800]  them no.
[07:52.800 --> 07:56.520]  And I said, you guys let the illegal aliens through these checkpoints, and they're on
[07:56.520 --> 07:57.520]  record doing that.
[07:57.520 --> 08:06.840]  In fact, C&S News has a report out today where Janet Napolitano is giving illegals green
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.360]  cards when they do arrest them.
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.160]  Of course, that's come out for three years.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.600]  They're doing that.
[08:11.600 --> 08:16.600]  They've stopped basically all deportations of Mexicans because that's a political client
[08:16.600 --> 08:20.480]  state now, and I guess they're Democratic voters.
[08:20.480 --> 08:26.080]  Others, Salvadorans and others, are being shipped out of the country.
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.640]  In fact, they've got a big Bayview detention center down there by South Padre that's got
[08:30.640 --> 08:35.560]  5,000 Salvadorans, people from El Salvador in it.
[08:35.560 --> 08:39.880]  So it's also very discriminatory, but there's a globalist deal with Mexico to basically
[08:39.880 --> 08:41.640]  merge the two countries.
[08:41.640 --> 08:48.320]  It also came out in the McAllen newspaper after talk radio covered it after Glenn Beck
[08:48.320 --> 08:53.240]  did that the children are taught to pledge allegiance to Mexico and to salute the Mexican
[08:53.240 --> 08:54.240]  flag.
[08:54.240 --> 08:59.760]  This goes on all over the United States in any school that's 30 or 40% Hispanic, including
[08:59.760 --> 09:02.760]  Puerto Rican schools, schools that are predominantly Puerto Rican.
[09:02.760 --> 09:04.560]  Puerto Ricans have complained about it.
[09:04.560 --> 09:06.640]  This is not a new phenomenon.
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.720]  They say, well, we're not Mexican, nothing wrong with being Mexican, but the Ford Foundation
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.480]  has said, if you've got brown skin and are Latino, you are now a Mexican because that's
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.720]  the political decision.
[09:18.720 --> 09:21.800]  They want to play those groups off against each other.
[09:21.800 --> 09:27.520]  And so that's why I get so angry, 98 miles into the U.S. I've never left the country
[09:27.520 --> 09:35.000]  on the trip and I pull up with my family and everybody on board U.S. citizens and you
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.720]  got a bunch of people with blue eyes and blonde and brown hair speaking complete Texas accents
[09:41.720 --> 09:44.200]  going, yeah, we're U.S. citizens.
[09:44.200 --> 09:46.520]  They go, pull over, we're searching.
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.360]  And I'm like, listen, I'm going to sue you, okay?
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.040]  You come on here without a warrant and then they send over six goons, open the door up
[09:55.040 --> 09:56.040]  and I explain.
[09:56.040 --> 10:01.320]  I go, the government's been caught dealing drugs, including the Border Patrol.
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.840]  And I said, and he said, the Supreme Court's rule, we can do this.
[10:03.840 --> 10:09.120]  And I said, it's ruled 100 miles in, you can, and I believe it's a false ruling, but it's
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.480]  ruled that you can ask immigration status.
[10:13.480 --> 10:18.480]  You can ask if I'm a citizen or not, but I said, you're searching for drugs.
[10:18.480 --> 10:22.720]  He said, no, we're not, we're searching for narcotics.
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.440]  And I looked at the guy because they know they're outside the law.
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.360]  And I said, you come on here, I'm going to sue you, pal.
[10:32.360 --> 10:34.720]  I said, I do not give consent.
[10:34.720 --> 10:41.000]  The reason I got so mad yesterday, last time I had my camera going as we pulled up, and
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  they said, turn that off.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.160]  And I said, no, you're surveilling me, free speech, First Amendment.
[10:47.160 --> 10:56.920]  And then they came over and then they just opened the door of the RV.
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.840]  We were on the M4s mobile and I talked to the guy and he said, you can go ahead and go.
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.440]  This time six of them come over after they've ordered us to pull over and they all kind
[11:06.440 --> 11:13.560]  of swagger over to open the door and get in their face with righteous indignation.
[11:13.560 --> 11:16.120]  And this time I didn't hold the camera up.
[11:16.120 --> 11:21.000]  This time you don't see the camera until, I mean, I've got it down in my lap until they
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.760]  start saying, no, we're going to search your vehicle, we're coming aboard.
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.920]  And that's when I get the camera out, get in their face.
[11:30.920 --> 11:37.000]  And look, look, this is a planned takedown of America.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.360]  The globalists always use the crisis they create, 800 plus sanctuary cities, free tuition,
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.960]  free welfare, above the law, don't get arrested for DWI, don't get arrested for no insurance,
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.600]  get different banking rules, that's even been in the Associated Press, that the illegals
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.880]  get different banking rules than citizens.
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.600]  It's an incentive to bring them here, then turn them into a political group that will
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.120]  vote for gun control, open borders, basic globalism.
[12:06.120 --> 12:13.480]  And then as citizens of this country see what's happening and get upset by it, then the system
[12:13.480 --> 12:16.960]  comes in and says, that's okay.
[12:16.960 --> 12:24.080]  We will set up checkpoints everywhere in a police state and then have a few show arrests
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.840]  every year and then release the illegal aliens out the back door.
[12:28.840 --> 12:32.640]  I mean, this is all on record, and there's six and a half plus billion people that want
[12:32.640 --> 12:33.640]  to come here.
[12:33.640 --> 12:35.800]  I mean, could we take them all?
[12:35.800 --> 12:42.040]  Maybe if we didn't have welfare, but these groups do, on average, get on welfare.
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.720]  The dad goes out and works, but mama on two or three different identification cards gets
[12:46.720 --> 12:48.240]  on welfare.
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.560]  That's why around Texas, you can tell the illegal aliens when you see them, is they
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.200]  got a western-wear dress, don't speak English, got Larazza stickers all over their cars
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.320]  and they're driving vehicles nicer than citizens are, because they're not paying taxes on average.
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.520]  Mama's on three forms of welfare, and daddy's out there working hard all day.
[13:06.520 --> 13:10.840]  And the babies are free at the hospital, everything's free, and citizens, no matter
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.000]  what color you are, are subsidizing it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.160]  California's bankrupt, 48 states are bankrupt, the country's going down right now.
[13:19.160 --> 13:24.720]  We're in a stalled depression, Mexico has been imploded by the globalist, which is designed
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.200]  to then drive them all up here.
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.400]  This has all been designed, nobody's bad in this except the globalist.
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.040]  I don't blame Mexicans for wanting to come up here, especially now that it's a genocidal
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.720]  Mad Max world, literally down in Mexico, and that's how Mexican citizens were describing
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.200]  it to me the five days I was down at the coast doing an investigation.
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.320]  That's what Hispanic Texans told me, that's what white and black Texans all told me, and
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.200]  they were all scared to talk on the radio except one gentleman.
[13:55.200 --> 14:01.200]  And he completely concurred, a Hispanic gentleman who we had on a few days ago, and a veteran
[14:01.200 --> 14:02.200]  as well.
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.920]  And a lot of the stuff he told me off record, he didn't repeat on air, it's just because
[14:06.920 --> 14:11.360]  then they'd be able to tell who he was, and people are living in fear down there.
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.240]  I'm gonna get into the whole Gaddafi thing here in just a moment, we'll spend a lot
[14:15.240 --> 14:19.800]  of time on that today, but here's what I'm talking about.
[14:19.800 --> 14:24.040]  Every time this happens, you're always told it's the first time it's happened.
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.800]  This is not the first time it's happened, it is in Tennessee and a surrounding four
[14:29.800 --> 14:35.640]  state area, but this happened in 2009, it's in my film, police state four, the rise of
[14:35.640 --> 14:43.360]  FEMA, I had the state rep on, the governor put out a statement, they had 14 federal
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.220]  agencies, this was in the newspapers, 14 federal agencies setting up checkpoints on major
[14:49.220 --> 14:55.560]  highways, pulling families over two hour long waits shutting down entire highways.
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.480]  They're putting up the highway divider chains now, now to keep people from being able to
[15:00.480 --> 15:01.480]  flee.
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.960]  A total control grid is going into place for martial law, for continuity government.
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.840]  They have resettlement specialists hired by the hundreds of thousands, they've got
[15:10.840 --> 15:15.440]  the camps built, Houston Chronicle, this is all going on.
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.680]  Before the total depression they've engineered, the global has been gearing up for this for
[15:19.680 --> 15:23.160]  15 years, but they always say it's the first time.
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.280]  This is going on in California, Texas, it's going on in every state.
[15:28.280 --> 15:35.800]  They have TSA checkpoints going back at least eight years in Florida, nine years, ten years
[15:35.800 --> 16:01.040]  in D.C., Dallas about five years, Boston, Massachusetts, it's been going on everywhere.

[16:18.920 --> 16:23.280]  against foodborne contaminants like E. Coli and Salmonella?
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.440]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoods Direct.

[16:57.880 --> 17:02.560]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[17:06.320 --> 17:09.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[17:13.800 --> 17:14.800]  at home.
[17:14.800 --> 17:19.480]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[17:19.480 --> 17:20.480]  calling the shots.
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[17:25.760 --> 17:29.120]  The Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.960]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[17:34.960 --> 17:35.960]  world government.
[17:35.960 --> 17:38.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.320]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[17:42.320 --> 17:48.360]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[17:48.360 --> 17:49.680]  of the Republic.
[17:49.680 --> 17:55.760]  Bet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.680]  now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[17:59.680 --> 18:03.560]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.240]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized
[18:08.240 --> 18:09.240]  risk.
[18:09.240 --> 18:10.520]  Saving means to make money.
[18:10.520 --> 18:15.120]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[18:15.120 --> 18:20.280]  real soaps that are triple-concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[18:26.080 --> 18:27.680]  or antibacterials.
[18:27.680 --> 18:33.320]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[18:33.320 --> 18:35.600]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[18:35.600 --> 18:38.760]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you've
[18:38.760 --> 18:41.000]  had to do something you've never done before.

[18:57.000 --> 19:05.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[19:05.200 --> 19:09.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.200]  you to have.
[19:15.200 --> 19:20.880]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.240]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[19:29.240 --> 19:32.700]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[19:32.700 --> 19:36.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[19:36.400 --> 19:41.080]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[19:41.080 --> 19:44.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[19:44.960 --> 19:46.320]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.560]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[19:50.560 --> 19:52.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[19:52.240 --> 20:01.960]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[20:01.960 --> 20:09.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:09.440 --> 20:28.680]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, and today we're going to talk about the power
[20:28.680 --> 20:32.200]  grid.
[20:32.200 --> 20:36.560]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, if you want my view on the whole Muammar Gaddafi situation,
[20:36.560 --> 20:37.560]  it's this.
[20:37.560 --> 20:44.840]  With Ben Laden, we knew he had kidney failure 10 years ago or more.
[20:44.840 --> 20:52.760]  We know he was at the American hospital visited by the CIA, CBS News, LaFigaro of France.
[20:52.760 --> 20:59.080]  We know that his family was awarded giant contracts for U.S. military bases, the largest
[20:59.080 --> 21:03.080]  construction firm in the Middle East, Ben Laden Construction.
[21:03.080 --> 21:07.600]  To give you my view on this Gaddafi thing, I have to first give you some history.
[21:07.600 --> 21:11.800]  The Ben Laden thing was fake because we know Ben Laden was already dead from scores of
[21:11.800 --> 21:16.320]  credible sources, including Madeleine Albright, who came out and told Bush, don't roll him
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.320]  out dead.
[21:17.320 --> 21:20.400]  We know you've got him on ice, Walter Cronkite.
[21:20.400 --> 21:22.520]  You don't get more insider than that.
[21:22.520 --> 21:28.280]  He played footsie with the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, most elite encampment, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg,
[21:28.280 --> 21:29.280]  you name it.
[21:29.280 --> 21:32.360]  He came out right before the 2004 election and said, don't bring him out.
[21:32.360 --> 21:34.800]  I had Bush administration official sources.
[21:34.800 --> 21:39.520]  I had Steve Pachennick, Council on Foreign Relations, back at the time saying it was all
[21:39.520 --> 21:41.800]  staged in 2002.
[21:41.800 --> 21:48.720]  So, that we knew was fake and we said, fake situation room photo, not live video feeds,
[21:48.720 --> 21:53.080]  throwing the body in the water, the way they had the media all ready to go with it and
[21:53.080 --> 21:56.080]  Obama making the announcement.
[21:56.080 --> 21:58.440]  That's when you know something's fake.
[21:58.440 --> 21:59.440]  That was fake.
[21:59.440 --> 22:01.840]  I don't know about this.
[22:01.840 --> 22:07.840]  The video has the customary super shaky and then there's one video still that they cut
[22:07.840 --> 22:08.840]  to.
[22:08.840 --> 22:11.240]  We're rolling the video right now.
[22:11.240 --> 22:18.040]  This person's either the worst camera person in the known galaxy or this is a staged video.
[22:18.040 --> 22:22.880]  And we've seen staged videos out of Iran of the young woman shot and bleeding to death.
[22:22.880 --> 22:23.880]  That was fake.
[22:23.880 --> 22:25.200]  We've seen fake bin Laden videos.
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.720]  The point is, when you have a government and a NATO system that lies incessantly, you don't
[22:29.720 --> 22:31.480]  know what the truth is.
[22:31.480 --> 22:35.040]  It's like if you have a neighbor or somebody in business you've worked with who lies most
[22:35.040 --> 22:38.080]  of the time, you never know.
[22:38.080 --> 22:40.520]  So it's not bad to question this.
[22:40.520 --> 22:42.280]  In fact, you should.
[22:42.280 --> 22:47.440]  Knowing his psychology, knowing where he most likely would be in his own town, knowing
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.760]  about the month and a half long siege, they claim they killed him before or he ran to
[22:51.760 --> 22:52.760]  Venezuela.
[22:52.760 --> 22:54.600]  They claim they killed his sons over and over again.
[22:54.600 --> 22:56.720]  That wasn't true.
[22:56.720 --> 23:00.880]  They claim they killed his firstborn, the shield of Islam.
[23:00.880 --> 23:02.880]  That's how it translates and they hadn't.
[23:02.880 --> 23:05.280]  So I'd say 6040.
[23:05.280 --> 23:06.280]  My gut.
[23:06.280 --> 23:07.840]  My gut says that's probably Gaddafi.
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.400]  He's probably dead.
[23:10.400 --> 23:18.120]  Like knowing the MO, staying, fighting, seven months against the al-Qaeda rebels.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.880]  It's kind of like, you know, he's the ugly.
[23:19.880 --> 23:20.880]  They're the bad.
[23:20.880 --> 23:23.680]  I'm not saying Gaddafi's a good guy, but it's good, the bad and the ugly.
[23:23.680 --> 23:26.280]  And the people running our country certainly aren't the good.
[23:26.280 --> 23:29.280]  And al-Qaeda certainly isn't the good.
[23:29.280 --> 23:30.780]  Or the ugly.
[23:30.780 --> 23:31.780]  They're the bad.
[23:31.780 --> 23:32.960]  So is Saudi Arabia.
[23:32.960 --> 23:33.960]  There's no doubting.
[23:33.960 --> 23:39.200]  I'll take Gaddafi any day over Saudi Arabia and the unspeakable decadence and evil and
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.560]  British intelligence model they use.
[23:44.560 --> 23:46.160]  It's true that he was a dictator.
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.440]  It's true he bucked the system.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.800]  It's true he was building up all of Africa.
[23:49.800 --> 23:52.560]  It's true the guy lived in a little tent with plastic chairs.
[23:52.560 --> 23:56.480]  Well, everybody thought he was behind his armored compound.
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.840]  That's why they wanted to get rid of him.
[23:57.840 --> 24:00.360]  And now they're going to bring in the forced inoculations.
[24:00.360 --> 24:03.680]  They're going to cut off the water supply, the austerity.
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.880]  They have put al-Qaeda in control.
[24:05.880 --> 24:11.080]  They say thousands, upwards of 10,000 different types of missiles, several thousand shoulder
[24:11.080 --> 24:14.880]  launched, have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda.
[24:14.880 --> 24:15.880]  Think about this.
[24:15.880 --> 24:24.280]  Put al-Qaeda in charge of Libya, call them freedom fighters, have the Facebook guy that
[24:24.280 --> 24:29.360]  ran the Arab Spring in Egypt overthrowing the old dictator, Mubarak, bringing in something
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.880]  far worse now.
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.800]  And then he's now running with the CIA and State Department, the Occupy Wall Street situation.
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.400]  I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on that from WayneMadsenReport.com, but I wanted to
[24:39.400 --> 24:42.080]  give you my preface first.
[24:42.080 --> 24:43.800]  I don't know what's going on here.
[24:43.800 --> 24:44.800]  People say, tell us, Alex.
[24:44.800 --> 24:48.160]  I don't know.
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.160]  Learning to judge from videos, they can fake almost anything.
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.440]  The Mutala video was obviously fake with a hood over it.
[24:55.440 --> 24:57.760]  They just projected his head in and had him turn.
[24:57.760 --> 24:58.760]  That was clearly a fake.
[24:58.760 --> 25:01.240]  The bin Laden videos turned out to be fake.
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.320]  I could look at them and tell you they were fakes.
[25:03.320 --> 25:09.760]  Sodom was a standard computer-generated dummy model that you can get in even cheap programs.
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.560]  That was later confirmed with voice print and video analysis to be fake by major universities.
[25:14.560 --> 25:21.360]  This video, just looking at it with the eye, looks real, but their CG is getting better.
[25:21.360 --> 25:24.440]  They could have already killed him somewhere else and just want to release this.
[25:24.440 --> 25:25.440]  We don't know.
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.000]  He could have run to Uganda, and that's why Special Forces went in there.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.200]  Then they drug his body back.
[25:31.200 --> 25:33.400]  We got Pechenik popping in later for 10 minutes on this.
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.160]  We got Tarpley popping in for 15, 20 minutes or so.
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.480]  We have an article up at prisonplanet.com right now, killing Gaddafi, spares international
[25:42.480 --> 25:45.440]  criminal court embarrassment for U.S. and Britain.
[25:45.440 --> 25:51.040]  Like Milajevic, Gaddafi would have thrust Western support for al-Qaeda fighters under
[25:51.040 --> 25:52.720]  the spotlight.
[25:52.720 --> 25:58.960]  Now, one reason into this whole intelligence mix that I think it could be staged, but my
[25:58.960 --> 26:04.160]  gut says probably not, is that you notice Europe didn't go along with the total private
[26:04.160 --> 26:09.000]  banker takeover and the end of all sovereignty being held hostage by the banksters.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.520]  They didn't do that today.
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.080]  So all Hades is breaking loose there.
[26:13.080 --> 26:16.280]  Major states are banning cash sales, like Louisiana.
[26:16.280 --> 26:19.960]  There's a lot of big police state developments, checkpoints are popping up nationwide right
[26:19.960 --> 26:20.960]  now.
[26:20.960 --> 26:23.160]  We're going into another degree of martial law.
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.160]  So while all this is happening, and that's coming up, we're busy looking at Gaddafi.
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.240]  Now, a man who's been brave enough this year to be there, Tarpleys also was there just
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.800]  a few months ago, Hunter Bombardment, is Wayne Mattson of waymattsonreport.com, and he joins
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.400]  us to give us his first look analysis of this Gaddafi situation.
[26:41.400 --> 26:43.360]  I haven't gotten your view yet, Wayne.
[26:43.360 --> 26:51.720]  You just heard my first look analysis, what's your take as a former NSA analyst, Navy submarine
[26:51.720 --> 26:56.360]  warfare expert, top journalist reporting for some of the biggest publications in the world
[26:56.360 --> 27:02.520]  on Capitol Hill, is somebody that tracks what these disinfo people do?
[27:02.520 --> 27:05.280]  What's your gut level first look analysis, Wayne Mattson?
[27:05.280 --> 27:07.800]  Well, I also agree with you, Alex.
[27:07.800 --> 27:13.200]  I think, although it's too soon to tell, and because we've been inundated with all this
[27:13.200 --> 27:20.080]  disinformation before, Kerbal, Yellow Cake uranium, all these other fakes, you know, the
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.000]  riots in Syria that were actually riots in Bahrain.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.720]  The fact that Al Jazeera was the first to report this, we know about their ties to the
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.680]  government of Qatar and what they've done with the CIA in the past.
[27:33.680 --> 27:39.240]  My gut feeling says he's dead, but I also would point out the initial reports were
[27:39.240 --> 27:41.440]  that he was shot in the legs.
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.080]  There was one photo I saw clearly of a head wound.
[27:45.080 --> 27:50.240]  It could be that he did try to maybe surrender, maybe they executed him, doesn't say a whole
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.920]  lot for Obama's wall, the jungle, foreign policy, because that's what it is.
[27:54.920 --> 28:01.440]  It's no different than Bush's when we killed Saddam Hussein's two sons, and in a very
[28:01.440 --> 28:07.960]  macabre scene, we saw them laid out on some slabs.
[28:07.960 --> 28:13.600]  Later we saw the photo, purportedly, of Saddam Hussein after he was executed.
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.520]  He still maintained he was president of Iraq, Gaddafi still maintained that he was the leader
[28:18.520 --> 28:19.600]  of Libya.
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.800]  I would say that as with Saddam Hussein, the situation with Gaddafi, President Obama has
[28:25.800 --> 28:33.440]  violated executive order 12333, which was initiated by President Ford, signed off by
[28:33.440 --> 28:40.000]  Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and even the first President Bush, George H.W. Bush, he's
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  violated that.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.360]  He has assisted in the assassination of a foreign head of state, and Mr. Obama should
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.440]  be basically indicted by the House Judiciary Committee that's called impeachment, he should
[28:52.440 --> 29:01.520]  go before the Senate, and he should be tried.
[29:01.520 --> 29:08.240]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.400]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[29:13.400 --> 29:22.720]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[29:22.720 --> 29:32.040]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the
[29:32.040 --> 29:40.160]  crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[29:40.160 --> 29:46.960]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality,
[29:46.960 --> 29:51.520]  our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could
[29:51.520 --> 29:58.720]  ride all day with confidence, order yours at gusset.com, diamond gusset jeans got it,
[29:58.720 --> 29:59.720]  others don't.
[29:59.720 --> 30:04.880]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[30:04.880 --> 30:12.520]  The film, it really says that the state is God.
[30:12.520 --> 30:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.320]  on earth.
[30:18.320 --> 30:23.140]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cams, now being
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.960]  expanded nationwide.
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.240]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[30:29.240 --> 30:31.040]  powerful shadow state.
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.640]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen, prepare
[30:35.640 --> 30:41.240]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[30:41.240 --> 30:45.360]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:45.360 --> 30:48.840]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[30:48.840 --> 30:51.840]  The police state isn't coming, it's here.

[32:00.000 --> 32:05.800]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.520]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[32:08.520 --> 32:11.080]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[32:11.080 --> 32:14.880]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[32:14.880 --> 32:16.480]  your health and your own family.
[32:16.480 --> 32:19.520]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[32:19.520 --> 32:21.840]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[32:21.840 --> 32:24.160]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM.
[32:24.160 --> 32:28.080]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[32:28.080 --> 32:31.400]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[32:31.400 --> 32:35.520]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[32:35.520 --> 32:38.720]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[32:38.720 --> 32:40.200]  I can't stress this enough.
[32:40.200 --> 32:42.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[32:42.840 --> 32:47.080]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[32:47.080 --> 32:53.760]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com that's End of America, the number three dot
[32:53.760 --> 32:54.760]  com.
[32:54.760 --> 33:24.000]  Free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[33:24.000 --> 33:31.680]  This is October 2011 and while the world is busy, questioning whether Muammar Gaddafi
[33:31.680 --> 33:40.280]  is dead or not, like other fabled individuals or some have been lauding, big developments
[33:40.280 --> 33:42.040]  are taking place in the economy.
[33:42.040 --> 33:46.440]  We'll talk more about this coming up later in the hour with our guests after we cover
[33:46.440 --> 33:47.800]  some other issues.
[33:47.800 --> 33:55.080]  And here's CNBC, a long, steep drop for Americans' standard of living and it breaks down that
[33:55.080 --> 34:00.240]  you've got to basically have higher taxes and no future under globalism to pay off the
[34:00.240 --> 34:07.000]  tens of trillions, well it's actually the thousand plus trillion in Ponzi scheme derivatives
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.760]  to the central banks.
[34:09.760 --> 34:10.760]  Isn't that interesting?
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.760]  Here's another one, a city group to pay millions to close fraud complaint.
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.680]  So the Associated Press is reporting 70 plus trillion dollars in Bank of America derivatives
[34:23.680 --> 34:30.720]  secretly bailed out and backstopped, we're talking about 70 plus trillion for Bank of
[34:30.720 --> 34:32.400]  America and derivatives.
[34:32.400 --> 34:35.680]  The entire deficit isn't even 15 trillion, okay?
[34:35.680 --> 34:43.840]  We'll get an idea of how they're inducing us through traders they control in government.
[34:43.840 --> 34:47.640]  Getting us signed on to their mega debt, it's incredible, I'll talk about that on the nightly
[34:47.640 --> 34:49.720]  news this evening.
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.920]  This is the most incredible article of the day.
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.960]  It's even bigger than checkpoints all over the country with TSA jerking families out
[34:55.960 --> 34:56.960]  of their cars.
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.160]  We covered in the last hour, it's up on infowars.com, androidsreport.com.
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.440]  No, this is from KLFY with a straight face they say, bans on cash.
[35:08.440 --> 35:12.480]  You're only allowed to use cash with major retailers.
[35:12.480 --> 35:17.680]  You cannot use cash for a secondhand sale.
[35:17.680 --> 35:21.360]  That includes all garage sales, swap meets, you know, you name it.
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.120]  This is directly out of the most horrific dictatorships ever seen.
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.720]  Cold hard cash, it's good everywhere you go, right?
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.320]  You can use it to pay for anything, but that's not the case here in Louisiana now.
[35:33.320 --> 35:36.880]  It's a law that passed during this year's busy legislative session.
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.160]  House Bill 195 basically says those who buy and sell secondhand goods cannot use cash
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.120]  to make those transactions, so they want to kill the underground economy.
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.920]  That's why they're arresting people selling lemonade all over the country.
[35:47.920 --> 35:54.400]  Or tomatoes, or pumpkins, and swat-teaming Amish, just selling milk to their neighbor.
[35:54.400 --> 35:56.320]  You are guilty until pre-venison.
[35:56.320 --> 35:58.640]  You can't be trusted in a cash economy.
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.360]  That's part of the 999 sales tax plan.
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.080]  That's where they now have a federal sales tax, and the Federal Reserve gets its way,
[36:07.080 --> 36:12.160]  and a VAT, where every transaction is tracked, and you swipe a card, even when you use cash,
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.280]  is just going to be a graduated sales tax.
[36:17.280 --> 36:19.040]  And they go on to say that's the way it is.
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.320]  Swat teams are standing by, and the checkpoints are being set up as well.
[36:23.320 --> 36:27.960]  And they're now saying citizens will now be on these Homeland Security pickup lists, not
[36:27.960 --> 36:29.000]  a rest list.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  You don't get a judge.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  You don't get a jury.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.920]  They can kill you in secret under new federal edicts, not laws.
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.920]  They can kill you as citizens.
[36:35.920 --> 36:36.920]  That's been announced.
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.600]  And they just say, under the enemy combatant act, you'll pull up to a checkpoint.
[36:40.600 --> 36:41.720]  You're on the list.
[36:41.720 --> 36:42.720]  You disappear.
[36:42.720 --> 36:44.220]  You're never seen again.
[36:44.220 --> 36:46.760]  And by the way, you never thought you'd get Socialist healthcare.
[36:46.760 --> 36:48.400]  You never thought they'd ban cash.
[36:48.400 --> 36:50.960]  Never thought they'd have federal checkpoints on the highways.
[36:50.960 --> 36:51.960]  It's here.
[36:51.960 --> 36:52.960]  It's all coming.
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.240]  It's the new world order.
[36:56.240 --> 36:59.520]  Never thought you'd see Mexican troops operating inside the U.S.
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.000]  It's the new world order.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.880]  Now, I'm really honored for the rest of the hour, the next 15 minutes, to be joined by
[37:05.880 --> 37:12.400]  John B. Wells, who is an accomplished composer, musician, writer, actor, martial arts instructor,
[37:12.400 --> 37:13.400]  and aviator.
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.160]  John B. Wells can be best described as a well-rounded Renaissance man who sabers the pursuit of
[37:18.160 --> 37:26.160]  knowledge and discovery from the arcane to the – and it continues – heard on radio
[37:26.160 --> 37:31.680]  and TV stations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, South Africa, Australia, and
[37:31.680 --> 37:32.680]  South America.
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.760]  He's one of the world's most recognized voice artists from network television programs
[37:36.760 --> 37:42.800]  to Lockheed Martin, Aeronautical Company, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 Raptor Projects,
[37:42.800 --> 37:49.760]  museum exhibits such as The Soviet Space, and Ramsey's The Great, to movie trailers
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.640]  for Columbia TriStar, Sony Pictures, and Disney.
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.040]  His ability to communicate has been acknowledged with numerous Emmy, Clio, and Marconi awards,
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.880]  and the website is the initialsjbwells.com.
[38:02.880 --> 38:05.320]  That's jbwells.com.
[38:05.320 --> 38:06.720]  We're honored to have you here today, sir.
[38:06.720 --> 38:07.720]  Thanks for joining us.
[38:07.720 --> 38:08.720]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[38:08.720 --> 38:11.640]  I'll tell you, I think that's the closest I'll ever come to an Academy Award.
[38:11.640 --> 38:12.640]  Thank you.
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.640]  And I should add, you're a host on Coast to Coast AM as well.
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.200]  That's the most fun job a guy could possibly have other than being on your show.
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.120]  Well, you know I'm a loudmouth who will take up all the time, so let's get rolling here.
[38:25.120 --> 38:30.920]  What do you think of laws and moves around the U.S. to ban cash if you're not a big
[38:30.920 --> 38:33.240]  box globalist store?
[38:33.240 --> 38:35.800]  You know, Alex, I've spent so much time.
[38:35.800 --> 38:38.560]  People might wonder why would you want to talk to a voiceover guy, but I'll tell you
[38:38.560 --> 38:44.120]  very quickly over the course of my career, I've been privileged to, I mean, it's a blessing
[38:44.120 --> 38:49.400]  and a curse, so if you subscribe to the theory that ignorance is bliss, I think maybe that's
[38:49.400 --> 38:55.960]  a correct statement because I've read many, many things about various projects that I
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.600]  had to sign the paper on, many, many projects for what Dwight Eisenhower referred to as
[39:01.600 --> 39:03.160]  the military industrial complex.
[39:03.160 --> 39:09.840]  And the fact is, is that this, in my opinion, is the first move toward the cashless society.
[39:09.840 --> 39:15.800]  And I suspect it'll only accelerate from here with all of this facial recognition being
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.800]  rolled out and iris scans and all this craziness with the TSA, and now, of course, what more
[39:21.800 --> 39:28.200]  innocuous place to kick this off than in Louisiana under the auspices of being able to track the
[39:28.200 --> 39:29.200]  drug traffickers.
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.440]  I've spent most of my life being under threat of some sort of a war.
[39:33.440 --> 39:38.080]  I was born around the time the Korean War ended, and then immediately after that we
[39:38.080 --> 39:41.360]  went into the Vietnam War, and then there was the war on poverty, and then there was
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.680]  the war on drugs, and now there's the war on terror, and so I guess we're all war
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.960]  babies if we were born any time after World War II, and I don't see this getting better.
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.720]  I see it getting much worse, and I think between, I don't know, maybe the Mayans have something
[39:57.720 --> 39:58.720]  made by Dwight.
[39:58.720 --> 40:03.640]  There's no telling how much damage can be caused in the next year and a couple of months,
[40:03.640 --> 40:06.080]  and I'm gravely concerned about it.
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.360]  Well, the government is acting like it's the end of the world.
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.240]  I mean, rolling out checkpoints, sticking their hands down our pants.
[40:13.240 --> 40:17.120]  They want to set the precedent for forced inoculations.
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.960]  They've openly promoted that with the Emergency Health Powers Act.
[40:21.960 --> 40:28.120]  This is really frightening what this country is turning into, and then you look at the
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.480]  fact that globalism has deindustrialized our country.
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.320]  What's your view on this whole New World Order system and where it wants to take us?
[40:37.320 --> 40:39.440]  Well, a friend.
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.440]  I may know him, a fellow named Mr. Vando Gonzales wrote a very interesting book.
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.000]  This is not my book, so I'm not hawking it, but it's called Psychological Warfare in the
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  New World Order.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.640]  This is a really intensive book, and it's obvious, just like this idiot, it's obvious
[40:55.640 --> 41:03.080]  that to quote a fictitious home secretary from one of my favorite shows, as I ease into
[41:03.080 --> 41:08.680]  my dotage, I find that timing is everything from love making to the golf swing, and this
[41:08.680 --> 41:14.000]  taking down, this alleged, taking down of Bin Laden, followed by Anwar al-Alaqi, and
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.400]  now finally with Gaddafi.
[41:16.400 --> 41:21.680]  It just seems that all of these things, of course, al-Alaqi was a relatively recent
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.600]  player, but it appears that all of these little, like some sort of an infernal machine where
[41:28.600 --> 41:34.440]  you just were, or a tumbler on a safe, you get one click and you go back to the left.
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.520]  You can take that as the political left.
[41:36.520 --> 41:37.520]  You get another click.
[41:37.520 --> 41:38.520]  You go back to the right.
[41:38.520 --> 41:41.520]  You get another click, and then boom, the door opens, and the door, unfortunately, is
[41:41.520 --> 41:44.360]  the one that opens Pandora's box.
[41:44.360 --> 41:45.360]  It's escalating rapidly.
[41:45.360 --> 41:48.040]  In fact, I saw on your site today this Tyrell Corp.
[41:48.040 --> 41:51.840]  There's one super corporation run the global economy.
[41:51.840 --> 41:56.720]  Once upon a time, we read the great books, and we learned from those great books.
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.240]  Now I think it's the great screenwriters that produce a lot of information that if we'll
[42:02.240 --> 42:04.280]  just allow ourselves to hear it.
[42:04.280 --> 42:11.320]  I mean, from little goofy things like this Operation Endgame, just a juvenile script,
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.960]  but if you look deeply into it, you'll see that there's a really much more serious thread
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.600]  of truth running through there, almost like, and I'll just whack silly for a minute.
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.400]  As Bill was a great fan of comic books, in that movie, I killed Bill, too.
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.800]  I have been a fan of the three Stooges, and in one of them, they have the Axis powers
[42:31.800 --> 42:35.080]  all gathered together, and one of them says, this is not right.
[42:35.080 --> 42:38.720]  Your minorities are infiltrating our majorities until you've made our majorities minorities.
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.040]  And of course, you know, Moe, who's playing Hitler, tells him to shut up and hit some
[42:42.040 --> 42:44.720]  with a golf club or something.
[42:44.720 --> 42:49.680]  This is all but it's true, but then, which is why, just shifting gears, now that I've
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.800]  warned you, I'll go a little bit ADD here, I think, in the mode of firing the short barrel
[42:54.800 --> 43:02.320]  shotgun out the back door.
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.320]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.920]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my
[43:10.920 --> 43:13.640]  listeners to do three things right away.
[43:13.640 --> 43:15.760]  Number one, study the past.
[43:15.760 --> 43:18.320]  History really does repeat itself.
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.160]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[43:23.160 --> 43:26.000]  Number three, take decisive action.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.080]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.240]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[43:35.240 --> 43:39.160]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[43:39.160 --> 43:42.480]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[43:42.480 --> 43:46.000]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.800]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[43:50.800 --> 43:51.800]  half.
[43:51.800 --> 43:56.560]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.240]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[44:02.240 --> 44:05.960]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.120]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[44:13.440 --> 44:14.440]  at home.
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.640]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[44:19.640 --> 44:20.640]  shots.
[44:20.640 --> 44:25.520]  It's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[44:25.520 --> 44:28.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[44:28.800 --> 44:34.640]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[44:34.640 --> 44:35.640]  world government.
[44:35.640 --> 44:38.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[44:38.040 --> 44:42.040]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[44:42.040 --> 44:48.040]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[44:48.040 --> 44:49.400]  of the Republic.
[44:49.400 --> 44:55.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.480]  now in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[44:59.480 --> 45:06.320]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.160]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[45:11.160 --> 45:15.160]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.800]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[45:19.800 --> 45:25.040]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[45:25.040 --> 45:31.320]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.640]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[45:35.640 --> 45:40.960]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.200]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[45:46.200 --> 45:52.480]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[45:52.480 --> 45:53.480]  Lungs Generator.
[45:53.480 --> 45:54.480]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[45:54.480 --> 46:05.760]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[46:05.760 --> 46:08.480]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[46:08.480 --> 46:11.040]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[46:11.040 --> 46:14.960]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your
[46:14.960 --> 46:16.440]  health and your own family.
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.480]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[46:19.480 --> 46:21.800]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.040]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.480]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[46:35.480 --> 46:38.640]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[46:38.640 --> 46:40.160]  I can't stress this enough.
[46:40.160 --> 46:42.800]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.040]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.720]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[46:51.720 --> 46:54.360]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.160]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[46:58.160 --> 47:02.160]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[47:02.160 --> 47:09.160]  Here's to Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:32.160 --> 47:42.760]  We are back live with syndicated talk show host, Top Voice Talent, you name it, John
[47:42.760 --> 47:43.760]  B. Wells.
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.840]  He's got another website, not just johnbwells.com, we'll tell you about that website here in
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.840]  just a moment.
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.800]  Before I go any further, I want to remind listeners that we are listeners supported.
[47:53.800 --> 48:00.080]  Our sponsors, people that buy the books, the DVDs, the t-shirts, the films, all of it
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.440]  at infowars.com, subscribers, infowarsnightlynews at prisonplanet.tv.
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.520]  This is how we've built this alternative media platform, now reaching more than 10
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.360]  million people a week, conservatively, just on YouTube.
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.200]  That's about 25% of our audience is on stuff on the web like that.
[48:20.200 --> 48:25.320]  Several million a day on the radio, over a million a day with infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[48:25.320 --> 48:34.800]  We're reaching about, conservatively, probably 20 million people a week now, one way or another.
[48:34.800 --> 48:37.960]  Millions a week, just on the podcast, 600,000 a day.
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.880]  It's very, very, very exciting and it's only growing.
[48:41.880 --> 48:45.200]  And when each and every one of you spreads the word on Facebook, Twitter, tells your
[48:45.200 --> 48:48.880]  friends, your family, your neighbors about the show, I mean, I'm not risking my life
[48:48.880 --> 48:49.880]  for nothing.
[48:49.880 --> 48:52.880]  I know in my gut, I know historically we can beat these tyrants.
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.320]  This is a very nasty form of tyranny we've got growing, this whole scientific new world
[48:57.320 --> 48:58.320]  order.
[48:58.320 --> 48:59.320]  It's got to be defeated.
[48:59.320 --> 49:04.440]  We've got the new infowars because knowing is half the battle, G.I. Joe's style shirt.
[49:04.440 --> 49:05.600]  Very, very popular.
[49:05.600 --> 49:07.720]  That's available at infowars.com.
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.120]  We've got all the in the fed shirts on sale right now at infowars.com.
[49:12.120 --> 49:13.200]  People will ask, what is that?
[49:13.200 --> 49:15.320]  You can explain to them about the Federal Reserve.
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.280]  We have a new film only available in North America because this is out of Europe, but
[49:20.280 --> 49:21.280]  it's in English.
[49:21.280 --> 49:24.160]  It's very powerful, so I made a deal with them and got a bunch of them.
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.760]  Scientists under attack, genetic engineering, and the facts that are coming out.
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.600]  We've got that new film available at infowars.com.
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.680]  And when you purchase the books, the videos, all of it, it makes this show possible.
[49:39.680 --> 49:42.680]  But the most important thing is spreading the word.
[49:42.680 --> 49:47.000]  You know about the Federal Reserve situation, we're in contact with the Dallas Police Department
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.160]  about now talking to other witnesses that indeed there was a provocateur there trying
[49:51.160 --> 49:52.560]  to set us up.
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.960]  That shows that we're hurting them for them to go to those type of links, that the fact
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.000]  the Federal Reserve is all complaints with YouTube trying to take down our videos.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.840]  And YouTube didn't do it, by the way, because we called them on it.
[50:04.840 --> 50:06.840]  Shows we're hurting them.
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.840]  I mean, think about this, ladies and gentlemen, we're reaching tens of millions of people
[50:10.840 --> 50:13.720]  a week now, and it's only growing.
[50:13.720 --> 50:14.880]  And they can't really kill me.
[50:14.880 --> 50:19.400]  I mean, they may still, I get threats all the time because I'm nothing special.
[50:19.400 --> 50:21.840]  This information is out there now.
[50:21.840 --> 50:23.640]  I mean, go to the Drudge Report today.
[50:23.640 --> 50:25.600]  Luke Radowski went and interviewed Alec Baldwin.
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.440]  He endorsed capitalism.
[50:27.440 --> 50:29.520]  That's up on the Drudge Report.
[50:29.520 --> 50:33.640]  Our article about the State Department running Occupy Wall Street, that's up on Drudge Report.
[50:33.640 --> 50:39.280]  Number one website in the world for news, tens of millions a day.
[50:39.280 --> 50:40.520]  Truth is contagious.
[50:40.520 --> 50:41.840]  Truth is popular.
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.240]  And yes, for some of us that are out at the very tip of the spirit, it's dangerous.
[50:46.240 --> 50:50.080]  But it's like the Braveheart line.
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.560]  Yes, we might go out on this battlefield and lose today.
[50:54.560 --> 50:59.680]  But what about many years from now lying in our beds, about to die?
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.120]  What will we give to just come back here and tell our enemies you can take our lives that
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.520]  you can't take our freedom?
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.760]  I mean, it infuriates me to see this video, we're going to play a clip of later, of state
[51:09.760 --> 51:14.520]  police with Homeland Security and TSA looking at people on the highway like we're all guilty
[51:14.520 --> 51:15.520]  in criminals.
[51:15.520 --> 51:19.320]  Like we're being inducted into a prison and pulling people out of cars and searching
[51:19.320 --> 51:22.800]  vehicles without warrants because they're trying to stop terrorism.
[51:22.800 --> 51:25.400]  That should make you fight or flight.
[51:25.400 --> 51:31.680]  It should make you boil with disgust and concern that we know where this leads 100% of the
[51:31.680 --> 51:32.680]  time.
[51:32.680 --> 51:36.880]  Going back to John B. Wells, John, I mean, you hear the point I'm making.
[51:36.880 --> 51:40.440]  You went to break making the point about it's all in time.
[51:40.440 --> 51:44.480]  You had gotten to the point where you had gotten to the point where you thought you
[51:44.480 --> 51:47.320]  would just stay invisible.
[51:47.320 --> 51:50.800]  Please continue where the break cut into what you were saying.
[51:50.800 --> 51:54.360]  And then let's get into some other subjects and also talk about your other website.
[51:54.360 --> 51:58.960]  Well the thing is, Alex, I used to think invisibility was the key and that just run away from it.
[51:58.960 --> 51:59.960]  There's no place to run.
[51:59.960 --> 52:01.720]  It will visit you wherever you are.
[52:01.720 --> 52:04.160]  So I just reverse myself on that.
[52:04.160 --> 52:08.040]  It's like visibility, high visibility is the key in that way.
[52:08.040 --> 52:09.040]  Look, we're all mortal.
[52:09.040 --> 52:10.920]  We're all going to check out of here one day.
[52:10.920 --> 52:14.000]  We're all going to begin the final boarding process out of this world.
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.400]  However, now is the time to stand for something or just cower like little mice and just let
[52:20.400 --> 52:22.320]  the cat take you over.
[52:22.320 --> 52:23.320]  That's what's going to happen.
[52:23.320 --> 52:29.520]  However, that said, with all this Occupy Wall Street, Occupy the Fed stuff, I'm beginning
[52:29.520 --> 52:35.160]  to wonder if the apparatus isn't so big and things are not so screwed up, if you will,
[52:35.160 --> 52:41.200]  and so far down the road that, I mean, revolution concerns me because if something like that
[52:41.200 --> 52:46.880]  were ever to happen, that's when our enemies would fall upon us because they would see
[52:46.880 --> 52:50.480]  that as the weakest moment to what end.
[52:50.480 --> 52:54.400]  I don't know because, you know, at least in theory, the rest of the world relies on the
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.320]  United States for so much.
[52:56.320 --> 52:59.680]  If you'll just indulge me a second here, this came from Patrick Henry and it's a short
[52:59.680 --> 53:00.680]  piece.
[53:00.680 --> 53:05.840]  But he said this was his speech on the Stamp Act, March 23rd, 1775, it is natural for man
[53:05.840 --> 53:07.840]  to indulge in the illusions of hope.
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.480]  We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren
[53:12.480 --> 53:15.840]  till she transforms us into beasts.
[53:15.840 --> 53:19.880]  Is this the part of a wise man engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
[53:19.880 --> 53:24.680]  Are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes, see not, and having ears
[53:24.680 --> 53:29.040]  hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
[53:29.040 --> 53:34.360]  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth,
[53:34.360 --> 53:39.400]  to know the worst, and to provide for it, and you contrast that with George W. Bush.
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.440]  And I actually liked him until I got into it a little bit, and then I'm not so sure.
[53:43.440 --> 53:47.360]  Who said, let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.600]  of September the 11th, followed by Gore Vidal, who said apparently conspiracy stuff is now
[53:51.600 --> 53:54.680]  short and for unspeakable truth.
[53:54.680 --> 53:58.640]  So I'm just as jacked up and angry about this as you are.
[53:58.640 --> 54:01.240]  And you have been given your gift, I have been given mine.
[54:01.240 --> 54:07.040]  So if we can just bring some people, you don't have to obey us blindly or join our legions
[54:07.040 --> 54:13.440]  blindly, but at least listen and see how these events are affecting your lives.
[54:13.440 --> 54:14.440]  Bind together.
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.720]  Such a concerted effort is being made to drive us away from each other, black against white
[54:19.720 --> 54:25.280]  against brown against Asian against the federal people, the local people, the state people.
[54:25.280 --> 54:27.400]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[54:27.400 --> 54:32.380]  We have to be a nation, not just a country, any place can be a country.
[54:32.380 --> 54:33.880]  We need to be a nation.
[54:33.880 --> 54:37.040]  And that's the end of my rant for the next few seconds anyway.
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.400]  Well, John beautifully said, and that's why the globalists are trying to break up our
[54:40.400 --> 54:46.360]  sovereignty and bring so many people in and then tell them, don't become Americans, no,
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.040]  keep your nationality so they can play us off against each other.
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.440]  That's the real, the real end game.
[54:53.440 --> 54:55.600]  And look, people call it a revolution.
[54:55.600 --> 54:59.880]  I'm involved in an information warfare revolution against lies.
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.820]  But I've always said, I'm not a revolutionary, I'm a restorationist.
[55:03.820 --> 55:09.440]  Our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, though not fully lived up to in our country's history,
[55:09.440 --> 55:16.360]  was the greatest flower of renaissance and awakening and enlightenment.
[55:16.360 --> 55:19.560]  And I want to go forward to the past.
[55:19.560 --> 55:24.480]  I don't want to be a three, 4,000 year old thug run tyranny because we're going back
[55:24.480 --> 55:27.920]  before 1776 and 1789.
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.840]  We're going back to ancient tyranny with a high tech overlay.
[55:31.840 --> 55:37.480]  I want to go forward to the past, to the most advanced thing we've developed.
[55:37.480 --> 55:39.720]  I want to restore our republic.
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.960]  That's why when I pulled up to that checkpoint 98 miles into Texas and they said, we're going
[55:43.960 --> 55:50.880]  to search your car, I mean, I righteously had zero fear and that actually scared me
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.880]  after the fact, even though my little children were with me, I didn't care and didn't even
[55:56.880 --> 55:58.320]  have to pump myself up.
[55:58.320 --> 56:05.200]  I was so focused and so disgusted with these people that at first they thought they scared
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.160]  me, you know, six border patrol guys around me and it was the opposite.
[56:09.160 --> 56:13.400]  They, I said, I know the government brings in the drugs and I just totally hit them hard
[56:13.400 --> 56:15.360]  and I'll play it tonight on the nightly news.
[56:15.360 --> 56:22.800]  But my point is, is that I have to make myself now, try to even have some concern because
[56:22.800 --> 56:25.240]  I still want to have that frostiness.
[56:25.240 --> 56:31.400]  It's like I'm getting to where I have zero fear and it's almost the extreme opposite
[56:31.400 --> 56:33.640]  of what a lot of people have.
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.360]  Do you get where I'm going here?
[56:35.360 --> 56:36.360]  Oh, I absolutely do.
[56:36.360 --> 56:42.920]  I mean, did I read that right the other week that a 747 or I think that was the model number
[56:42.920 --> 56:47.160]  of the aircraft full of cocaine was allowed to come into this country in exchange for
[56:47.160 --> 56:52.160]  some cooperation against the Zetas, which as you know, is made up of military deserters
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.160]  and other really hardcore guys.
[56:54.160 --> 56:59.560]  Yeah, and that's just their cover in the Texas newspapers that, oh, we let in this tonnage
[56:59.560 --> 57:04.320]  of cocaine and yeah, Wachovia and Wells Fargo run these aircraft with cocaine and yeah,
[57:04.320 --> 57:09.760]  I mean, it's totally controlled and actually the big banks in the U.S., not the U.S. government,
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.020]  if you read all the federal documents that are admitted, they're funding all the cartels
[57:13.020 --> 57:16.080]  against each other to try to just keep prices up.
[57:16.080 --> 57:19.120]  It's so cold-blooded.
[57:19.120 --> 57:20.760]  And I don't know what the end game is.
[57:20.760 --> 57:24.520]  I mean, if they did succeed in destroying the country, reducing the system, sort of
[57:24.520 --> 57:27.480]  a brawling, internally brawling third world nation.
[57:27.480 --> 57:29.720]  I mean, what is to be gained from this?
[57:29.720 --> 57:30.720]  I just don't know.
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.160]  I think it might go back to, I mean, I keep quoting movies, but again, it's the brilliant
[57:34.160 --> 57:35.160]  screenwriters.
[57:35.160 --> 57:36.160]  I think it's true.
[57:36.160 --> 57:43.080]  I don't think some of these people can be assigned any other motive or initiative other
[57:43.080 --> 57:51.160]  than they just like to see the world burn.
[57:51.160 --> 57:55.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[57:55.800 --> 58:00.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[58:00.120 --> 58:04.440]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[58:04.440 --> 58:05.760]  allows you to have.
[58:05.760 --> 58:06.760]  It's true.
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.520]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[58:11.520 --> 58:15.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[58:15.840 --> 58:19.840]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[58:19.840 --> 58:23.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.040]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.760]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[58:31.760 --> 58:35.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[58:35.560 --> 58:36.960]  one of my old sponsors.

[59:10.800 --> 59:13.160]  like E. coli and Salmonella?

[59:58.960 --> 59:59.960]  Network.
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:09.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:24.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.480]  John B. Wells has been our guest for the last 50 minutes or so.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.840]  He joins us in this first little segment of this hour, the Webster Carpley on the economy
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840]  on Libya.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840]  He joined us yesterday.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.200]  He's popping back in today because of these big developments.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.000]  He's recently been to Libya.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.600]  We're talking again to John B. Wells.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.640]  Look, your survival instincts, all of your survival instincts are kicking in, but the
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:54.760]  mind control system will try to create a conscious fear so you will divert your own instinctive
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.560]  concerns into that.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.840]  And go ahead, comment on that.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.880]  Well, again, there's a psychological war that's being waged against us, and that's precisely
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.480]  what it is designed to do, is make you subservient to this coming system.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.120]  I mean, I think that George W. Bush said about out of these troubled times, our objective,
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.400]  a new world order could emerge today, that new world order is struggling to be born,
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.280]  and a world quite different from the one we have known.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.440]  It's like somebody said one time, people will tell you they're bad intentions if you just
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.840]  allow yourself to hear it.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:37.080]  And I think he said that they use the term new world order over 100 times in his administration.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.960]  That's frightening in itself.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.080]  But again, there's no doubt that this is an orchestrated effort.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.160]  Look, it's undeniable.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.520]  Nobody wants it.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.800]  People just want to live their lives and go along, make a little money, enjoy their families,
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800]  isn't that?
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]  But that's what we've got to do.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:01.280]  Well, instead of just pushing back to get them off our backs, we've got to route these
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.480]  parasite control freaks out.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.720]  Just like when they try to tell people, you know, your grandpa in World War II veteran
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.480]  dies, you go to the Houston VA cemetery, one of the biggest in the country, and they say
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.520]  you can't have a priest or a pastor here to pray, you've got to get aggressive and go
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520]  after them.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.600]  So they go to the federal court, first the Pentagon denied it, turned out they'd ordered
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600]  it.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.680]  Again, they're always behind the scenes trying to create basically a Soviet America for the
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680]  bankers.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.520]  They don't want freedom and they want to have population reduction and they want to shut
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.600]  down our free speech.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.120]  That's why it's so important now to support alternative media more than ever.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  In closing, what's your view on the Internet kill switch and FEMA coming up later this
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.760]  month, next month, testing takeover systems of radio?
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.400]  Well, it's just they're going to begin rubbing it in our faces now because we haven't been
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.120]  able to stop them from doing it, except in isolated cases, we haven't been able to stop
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.240]  them from invading our privacy.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:03.720]  Just everybody keep in mind that while they are able to log every keystroke, every email,
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:10.040]  everything that you do is stored somewhere, including conversations on your cell phone.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.320]  Just remember something old Chicago criminal lawyer told me one time, who's recently passed
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.880]  away, don't ever say anything over a phone or in an email or a text message that you
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.040]  wouldn't want repeated or played back in front of a federal grand jury.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:32.560]  Just let discretion be your guide, but more than that, reconnect with your true character.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.560]  Whatever that is, good character or bad character, pick a side.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.560]  We're out of time, we're out of time, it's just about game time.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.600]  At what side you're going to be on and go there, if you're going to be one of these
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  people out there that says, I'm worth more than $7 an hour, I'm not going to do anything,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.040]  I want you to give it to me, forget about it, you're not going to get it.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.200]  The only thing that you're going to get is what you're given.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.320]  You're not going to be able to make a life for yourself, it's going to be made for you,
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  and then what?
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.720]  You're assigned an apartment, you're assigned a little card as to whether or not you can
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.720]  even drive a car, if that's the life you want, just sit there and do nothing, otherwise
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.600]  participate in this great event.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.440]  Put this thing back like it was, nobody has improved upon the wheel, there are always
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:25.120]  going to be injustices overcome, work on that, but for God's sake, hold on to the foundation
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.400]  and that foundation is the United States Constitution, that is what has enabled us to do what no
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.560]  other nation or combination of nations have been able to do in 235 years.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.280]  If you're 50 years old, you've been alive more than 20% of the time that this nation's
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.840]  even been in existence.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:48.720]  Be part of it, breathe life back into the spirit of 1776 and liberty or value your need
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.360]  to total tyranny and submit to being a slave.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.480]  John B. Wells, incredible interview, can't wait to have you back, thank you for spending
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.480]  time with us.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.080]  Thank you, Alex, it was a pleasure.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.240]  It was a pleasure having you, amazing.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.080]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.920]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920]  risk.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.080]  This means to make money.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.280]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.840]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.560]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.240]  or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:32.760]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.140]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.440]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.480]  to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:27.280]  It is Friday, the 21st day of October 2011.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.480]  We are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.960]  Tommy Wolf who was arrested at Occupied Wall Street will give us her perspective in a brief
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.880]  interview coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:47.000]  We'll get her take on it as a Rhodes scholar and as an establishment, leftist who has criticized
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.040]  the police state of George W. Bush and now of Barack Obama.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:58.800]  She's one of the more fair people out there, so we want to get her perspective on it, the
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.800]  bestselling author joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:05.920]  We've got Bob Chapman popping in as he does every Friday on the big economic developments
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.400]  in Europe and around the world.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.680]  The admission now that this country, by more and more economists, is in a depression, never
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.680]  left the deep recession.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.000]  And this is an engineered implosion of our society.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.660]  We'll also talk with Bob about the 79 trillion that's in even USA Today and Reuters, Bloomberg
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.160]  broke it two days ago.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:33.200]  I know I've been mentioning it the last few days because it's a big deal, 79 trillion
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:40.800]  dollars in additional derivatives now that has been moved over to the Federal Depositors
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.440]  Insurance Corporation and William K. Black, the former top federal regulator that prosecuted
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.040]  a lot of these crooks in the last round 15 years ago, he's come out and said this will
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.920]  be the destruction of Bank of America and with it, the U.S. economy, they're going to
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:02.920]  sign us on to 79 trillion dollars.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.760]  And they're going to have Herman Cain on the fake right, pushing 999999.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:15.840]  In fact, there's an article out today, topitinfullwars.com, by Peter Schiff of Euro-Pacific Capital.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:21.720]  I'm going to work on getting him on the nightly news tonight saying the hidden nine of Herman
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720]  Cain.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.600]  That's right, because there's the 9% that they're going to have for the income tax.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.320]  He doesn't discuss the 9% or so for Social Security FICA.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:36.560]  He doesn't support the employee matching, the employer matching of that.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.520]  Oh, you didn't know employers have to match that?
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.720]  So you're getting paid 20 bucks an hour.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.080]  You're really getting paid about 26, 27 an hour.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.120]  But that money's paid to the government.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.040]  Not counting the money they then take out of your check on top of it.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.680]  See, it's all this hidden taxation you don't see till you actually write the checks.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.000]  I write the checks.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  I see it all.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.720]  A lot of people say, Alex, you ought to just tell the IRS that's private and works with
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.520]  a private fellow reserve to go to Hades.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.080]  We pick our battles here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.800]  The federal courts have a 98% conviction rate.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.560]  Federal courts sentenced black people to death 160, 70 years ago who ran away from their
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.560]  plantations.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.960]  So I'm going to pick my battles.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.760]  They have rigged juries, total criminals running them.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.120]  Most of them on the take.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.880]  Most of the government is criminal narcotics traffickers or paid by that 500 billion a year.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.920]  They used to pay their criminal army.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.720]  And so I follow all the fake rules, all the fake laws, all the fake garbage, so I can
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:52.520]  be 100% strong and up front here covering real information.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.000]  Now I do confront naked body scanners.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.920]  I do confront internal checkpoints and get in the police face and say no to that because
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:07.880]  it's an absolute clear and present hardcore manifestation of classical tyranny.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.800]  But when you get down to the king's men and the taxation system, that is something that
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.200]  we languish under.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.800]  But I'm now digressing.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:30.880]  The point is that the globalists are basically exempt from taxation and regulation.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:36.640]  And they want to jack up taxes now to pay down the derivatives bubble that they've had
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.120]  their operatives that they spent decades getting into every power position and every regulatory
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:48.840]  position at the SEC, Congress, Federal Reserve and Treasury.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.320]  And they're dropping the hammer.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.360]  They always intended to saddle us with their debt.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.880]  They bought the world through fraud with the Ponzi money.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.040]  But then holding the world hostage, they bring us fully under their economic control and
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.520]  give the private banks governance powers, as is now happening with the Super Congress
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.960]  here in the US, as is now happening with the Euro takeover in Europe.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:17.960]  It's here, full Bankster occupation, full domination, the end of America, the end of
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:25.480]  liberty, total tyranny, and a physical oppression with domestic police, domestic secret police,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.280]  domestic federal police, local police, federalized deputies, spying threat fusion centers.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.920]  They're in the news now admitting what we've done for 20 years.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.920]  The Pentagon's got ground penetrating radar looking through all your walls.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.480]  The police departments are getting trucks now that look right through your walls and
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:48.680]  also blast you with high powered radiation and radio waves, sound waves.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.480]  There's a bunch of different types of systems they have.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.840]  That's in mainstream media today.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.360]  They're just getting ready to tell the slaves about it.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.400]  Again, they're reporting checkpoints all over the country.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.520]  They're just going to continue to roll it out, roll it out, roll it out and flaunt it in
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.960]  your face.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.080]  Just Sunday, it happened again, 100 mile, 98 mile into the country checkpoint.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:17.360]  I'm going to play that video later in audio here from what happened Sunday because it
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.400]  integrates in with all this TSA checkpoint news that's in mainstream newspapers and TV
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.800]  stations.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.080]  And they're like, we're going to start your vehicle, 98 miles into the U.S. and I said
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.520]  this is a violation of my Fourth Amendment and they said the Supreme Court has ruled
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.080]  and I said the Supreme Court has ruled you can check immigration status and the Supreme
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.720]  Court has also ruled black people weren't humans so I don't want to hear it but I said
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.840]  you are here with a drug dog and you know they haven't ruled you can have drug checkpoints
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  and they know that.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.560]  They know it's illegal.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.160]  They know it's official oppression and a civil rights violation.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.280]  He says I'm not looking for drugs, I'm looking for narcotics.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.400]  So that's the first thing I want to get into today but coming up Union President testifies
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:07.320]  ICE, I have a C-SPAN clip, ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals including
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.320]  fugitives.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:16.000]  You know I'd say, I haven't really ever counted it up but I'd say about 40% of my crew here
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.120]  at the office is Hispanic and a bunch of them have told me that whenever they're driving
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:30.320]  through these checkpoints, 98, 100 miles inside the border, if they're Hispanic or look Hispanic
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.880]  it's just come on through because they don't want the trouble of illegals and this is actually
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:42.040]  come out in the news, they're there just to shake everybody down and it's incredible.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.680]  So this has nothing to do, they do some show arrest of illegals here and there at a meat
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.120]  packing plant that isn't part of the inside group or they'll do a raid on a Walmart once
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.680]  and it came out then give them green cards.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.560]  That came out in the news again yesterday, C&S News had that.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.580]  This is all coming out in Congress and so they want to search my car and I'm like the
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:06.760]  border patrol has been caught in fast and furious, shipping drugs in, guns out with
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:14.440]  the ATF FBI and what, six other, it's eight agencies total, so five other agencies on
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.240]  top of those three and I said the game's over bud, I don't use your products, I'm not the
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.800]  government that brings the drugs in here and you're not going to do this folks, they're
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.080]  getting ready under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, this is admitted, they're
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.640]  getting you used to government putting their hands on you.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:40.480]  You've never been to jail, you're not a criminal, you get uppity about a cop walking over and
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.240]  asking you questions at the shopping mall or wherever, you're like, why are you doing
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.240]  that?
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.640]  You're informed historically, you know that's what happens in third world countries and
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:54.360]  Soviet, Russia and places like that, they're just breaking the ice, getting you used to
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  blood draws at checkpoints, federalization of police, the feds at checkpoints, the feds
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:12.080]  at proms now, the feds at the prom now, this is the type of stuff that's going on, this
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.040]  is right out of central casting of a corrupt, oppressive North Korean style system.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:26.120]  This is the social engineers 100% consciously, they've announced every airport in the US,
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.040]  every major airport will get naked body scanners and now Austin's getting them next month and
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.880]  they're saying everyone will be forced through, the TSA said in the Chicago Tribune, they
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.080]  said we will force everyone starting next year, so first it's opt out, opt out, embarrass
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.080]  you, grab on you, while the idiot TSA says they're frying themselves.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:16:05.440]  You may be arrested and your subject to other police action.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:11.200]  tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality, it really says
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.000]  that the state is God.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.520]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.120]  on earth, this film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.560]  now being expanded nationwide, this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.640]  has established an old powerful shadow state, police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.600]  to which our republic has fallen, prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:44.440]  dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.360]  on every street corner, it's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan, the

[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.880]  You've heard Alex explaining how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.600]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.440]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.120]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.880]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.480]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.120]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.640]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:41.440]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  system.

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:09.680]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:37.840]  Okay, I want to go to Eric, Tim, Jeff, Robert, Keith, and many others that are patiently
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:45.080]  holding on this live Friday edition, but first I want to get into treason.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.320]  As you know, it has come out yet again in congressional testimony and we covered this
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320]  yesterday.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:59.160]  The Associated Press carried it so that CNS News, Napolitano testified DHS is authorizing
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.680]  illegal aliens to work in the U.S.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.320]  They've been hired to build part of the border show offense when they do do raids on dairies
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.120]  and meat packing plants.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.080]  In every case, they hire them all on the spot and give them green cards.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.680]  It's all for public consumption.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.040]  Here's a headline, Union President testifies ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.680]  illegals, including fugitives.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.400]  Now, we've heard the Border Patrol come out with this information for years.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.640]  We've heard sheriffs come out where they'll arrest a truckload of 10, 15 illegals or more
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.920]  and be ordered to turn them loose.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.560]  But then citizens get the book thrown at you and they want to search your car.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.040]  It's all about using the excuse to invade your life.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.800]  I'm not an enemy of the Border Patrol.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.960]  Okay, I'm just upset over the fact that they're being used to do unconstitutional things.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:58.480]  And we have that video clip coming up here in just a moment, but you add all of this
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.120]  together with an article like this one.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.760]  And this is just coming out today.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.000]  I see this stuff every day.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.160]  But this is unprecedented because it's Janet Napolitano admitting it in testimony.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.480]  And here's the issue, federal law is still there.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.480]  You aid in a bed.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.680]  In fact, when I was down in South Padre, I was talking to a business owner and I actually
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:31.440]  looked it up the story he told me about where one of the owners of the sightseeing boats
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.640]  and dolphin watching and fishing boats, he owned a bunch of them.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.200]  And he basically had bought up a lot of the town over decades running it.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.160]  He got caught using one of his big boats to bring illegals into Houston, 100 miles north
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.880]  of there or so.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.240]  And he got a year in prison and they took all his boats and stuff.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  Well, that's just because he was a small fry.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.560]  You see, violating that federal law was a felony.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:01.880]  But they're saying because Obama is the president, he can violate federal laws.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.720]  He can order citizens killed.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.640]  Oh, but it's just Al Qaeda, the precedents now set.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.280]  They say you're Al Qaeda.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.360]  The precedents now set to set up checkpoints all over the country.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.160]  In fact, I have those reports I'm going to get to here in a moment.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.160]  And here's another report out of Fox News.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:25.840]  Senators have drafted a bill to give visas to foreigners buying pricey homes.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.080]  And I'm not so much even against that if foreigners come with money.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.080]  That's the issue.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.280]  People come here and get put on welfare.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:39.040]  And then the Ford Foundation teaches them to hate America and to vote for gun control.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.440]  I mean, you've got to keep the illegals out or they're going to become the majority and
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.480]  vote to take all their liberties away.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.560]  Once you get it, that's why the megacorporations are for it.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.240]  It's not just about driving down wages.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.760]  That 500,000 isn't quite nearly enough, it should at least be a million.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.680]  And that you guarantee that you're going to be able to get a job, you got a job waiting
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:07.400]  for you, or that you're not going to ever seek welfare and sign a form, sign an agreement
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:12.600]  that you're going to move here for 10 years, you don't get any free largesse.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.800]  There's 310 million Americans.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.280]  There's almost 7 billion people outside the country.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.600]  The census is 7 billion globally, but that was a couple of years ago and it's not entirely
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  accurate to estimate.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.000]  It's more like 7 billion, 200 million.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.640]  So there's 6.9 billion people that want to come here.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.560]  Well, they won't want to come here very soon if they all get here.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.040]  I mean, have you been to a real federal country, folks?
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.880]  Well, there's people saying, oh, like Perry, let's give the lowest tuition that's taxpayers
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880]  supported.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.760]  50% of it at least is paid for by taxpayers.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.080]  Let's give in-state tuition, taxpayers subsidized it to the illegals.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.760]  You don't have a big heart if you don't.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.880]  A big heart, most people I know can't afford to send their kids to college.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.880]  Who are citizens?
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.160]  Forget what color they are, but the illegals, they do.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.960]  I mean, this is such a game how they use the big heart of the American people.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.000]  Can you go to Mexico or Nicaragua or El Salvador or South Korea?
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Can you go anywhere and get free education or close to it?
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.760]  No, of course not.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.520]  You get arrested.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.920]  But I digress.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:27.080]  This is the ridiculous mind game the globalists have pulled on us.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.000]  Now, the good news is, despite all these claims of being a man of peace, because he's going
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.840]  to pull all the troops out when there's over 100,000 contractors and they're just renaming
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]  the troops as non-...
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840]  It's the same trick from two years ago.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.280]  They're renaming the troops as non-military.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.480]  They're still troops, but it's in a logistic support role.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.040]  You didn't read the fine print, huh?
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.440]  More mind games, just like they were going to be out of Afghanistan in one year, huh?
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.920]  Ten years later.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.640]  Then you look at Obama's jobs bill, and it admittedly has a free trade deal that's one
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.240]  sided to move jobs to Latin America and South Korea.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.520]  That's the jobs bill.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.880]  But wait.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.880]  It gets worse.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.040]  Let me find it here in my stack.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.280]  I already read it earlier.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.040]  Already read the headline earlier.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.880]  Oh, boy, I can't even keep track of all this.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.600]  Guys, pull up the headline.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:30.640]  General Electric Profits increased 57% for me so I can read that off the screen and also
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.760]  show that to listeners out there.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:40.120]  Point it out for people, thank you, because I can't seem to find it here in my stack.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.000]  There's just too much.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:51.240]  The point is General Electric runs the President's Economic Board and they have publicly stated
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.680]  they're going to move their X-ray division overseas.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.680]  General Motors, with billions of dollars it was given, over five billion total, moved
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.720]  plants to Brazil, Eastern Europe and China.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.640]  Your tax money paid to move it out of the country.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:20.840]  But before we get to that, let's go ahead and play that clip from C-SPAN where the head
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:29.800]  of the union admits that ICE was ordered to let illegal aliens stay in the country,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.440]  including criminals.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.120]  When I last testified before the subcommittee on July 25, 2011, I reported among other things
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.640]  that ICE enforcement removal officers and agents in the field alleged that unwritten
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.200]  directives from ICE headquarters had been issued nationwide ordering officers not to
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.800]  arrest aliens unless it was confirmed that the alien had received a prior conviction
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.240]  for a criminal offense.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.000]  Aliens who could not be arrested included but were not limited to ICE fugitives who had
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.600]  been ordered deported by a federal immigration judge as well as aliens who had illegally
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.680]  re-entered the United States after deportation, a federal felony.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.360]  ICE officers and agents also alleged that they were not permitted to arrest or even
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:18.680]  speak to, confirmed or suspected illegal aliens, encountered in the field during operations
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:44.160]  and were prohibited from running standard criminal records checks for once in warrants.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:29:07.600]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.160]  Folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.920]  listeners to do three things right away.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.320]  Number one, study the past.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.600]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.440]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.280]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.360]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.520]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.440]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.760]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:47.240]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.080]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  half.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:56.840]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:02.040]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.680]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.360]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360]  risk.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.000]  Rising means to make money, the Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.240]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.360]  good as what you're using now.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.120]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.800]  or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:33.320]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.680]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.080]  to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:49.200]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:31:06.080]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.800]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.160]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.720]  your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.760]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.080]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.280]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.320]  small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.720]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.920]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.080]  I can't stress this enough, you should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.040]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.640]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.240]  and high food costs.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:20.320]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.680]  like E. coli and Salmonella?
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.840]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.

[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:34.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.180]  I was tired.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:50.520]  I went down to investigate the border and what was happening there with the cartels and
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.520]  things.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.480]  I spent a few days with my family there at a hotel in South Padre.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.000]  The red tide hit a couple of days into it and they thought, oh, it's no problem.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.640]  The hotel told me, don't worry about it, but I noticed all the fish dying and I couldn't
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.640]  breathe.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:07.680]  I didn't know it was a neurotoxin and some of my kids got sick.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.240]  So on our way back, I'm not feeling too good.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.440]  My kids are sick in the back.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.200]  I just want to get home and 98 miles into the U.S.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.640]  I never left the U.S.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.120]  I pulled up at the same border patrol checkpoint I was at three weeks ago.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.600]  I wanted to go back down there and cover what was happening at the border.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.760]  I pull up and the guy says, I'm going to direct you over here.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.960]  I'm going to search your vehicle.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960]  They got drug dogs.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.400]  He goes, I'm going to check your immigration status with a drug dog.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.880]  And I go over and I say, I know about the border patrol deal in drugs.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.040]  You can pull it up.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.200]  Just type border patrol caught bringing drugs in, fast and furious, sent a lower cartel,
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:53.640]  eight agencies involved in Homeland Security in allowing certain cartels to bring drugs
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.640]  in.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.480]  They're told, let certain 18-wheelers through.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:03.240]  But I'm not saying the individual who came to the RV was a drug dealer.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.240]  No.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.160]  I'm saying that this is an agency caught doing it over and over again.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.440]  So they are the ones who should have people searching them.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.720]  Not me and my family with all their license plate reading cameras that are 200 yards before
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.720]  you get there.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.320]  They're already running your plates.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.920]  You pull in there and you're guilty.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.080]  You're bad.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.080]  They're the official.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:28.920]  You're the authority like Nazi Germany.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.920]  You're going to be checked.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.440]  And I told them, and I'm in it.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.200]  I'm going to file suit on the next cop, the next checkpoint, the next garbage.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:40.200]  The next TSA that tries to grab my genitals, I'm suing your butt.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.720]  And you may beat the rap, but you're not beating the ride.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.000]  It's time to recognize this stuff is going nationwide.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.200]  This is a takedown.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.200]  They're training you to literally be in a database when you go to a checkpoint they
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.200]  set up.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:59.920]  They set up years ago the plan to have internal checkpoints at state borders, random checkpoints,
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.920]  highway checkpoints, and now they're doing it.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.800]  This isn't just 98 miles in.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.760]  This is in Tennessee with the feds out of their jurisdiction.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.760]  This is so nightmarish.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.320]  Now this is unedited video except for the names of my children and things like that
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:21.360]  and video of my children who were involved who have been cut out of the video.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.200]  But here it is, Nazi Germany comes to America, and you're like, but they're just checking
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.200]  you.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.200]  Why don't I check them?
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.000]  I mean, I got an article, in fact, let's show the other article before we go to this.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Look at that.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.720]  CNS News, an Apollo-Tano DHS authorizing illegal aliens to work in the U.S.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.960]  You can see the clip right there.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:50.720]  It's come out in Associated Press that illegal aliens built the border fence.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:58.040]  Legal aliens are openly allowed to come into the U.S. and I'm not against, by the way,
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.240]  the folks from Mexico coming in here want a job because the globalists are employing
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.240]  their country.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.080]  The point is they're brought into drive-down wages.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.920]  They're brought in by the big corporations to bust the unions and all the systems.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.000]  But then the unions are bought off so they promote open borders.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.600]  Instead of folks staying in Mexico and causing an actual downfall in that corrupt system,
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.000]  the globalists use it as a steam valve to then bring down the U.S.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.520]  See, it's all divided in conquer.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.320]  It's very sophisticated geometry.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.240]  That's why the average person who hasn't thought about it doesn't understand it.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.920]  But again, I'm digressing.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:38.240]  The point is, illegals, they've frozen all deportations of people from Mexico because
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.280]  it's political.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.360]  Everybody yells from Honduras, Nicaragua, China, you're gone.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.000]  They had camps, by the way, down on the border filled.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.800]  They had 5,000 with Salvadorans.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.480]  All Salvadorans, just at that particular Bayview detention center.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.840]  I did an investigation of that while I was there on the radio that a lot of you watched.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.080]  The point is, this is all going on.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.560]  And so it's so asinine, now watch the video.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:11.480]  This is important because I know the Supreme Court's rule that 100 miles in, that's about
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.760]  a third of the country, all the way around the nation, you can pull up the maps of this.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.960]  In fact, pull up a Constitution-free Zomper, folks, just type that in and you'll get the
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.160]  official maps.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:31.320]  They are searching people, and I've talked to a lot of folks here in my office, a couple
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:38.200]  of the guys that work in the shipping and advertising department, who happen to be Hispanic.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:45.760]  And he says, when you go through these things, and they do a, I guess, stereotypical typecasting
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.000]  or whatever, they just wave you through, because they don't want illegals.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  They don't want that.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.480]  They're there to search vehicles, they're there to break the will of the American people,
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.800]  they're there to set the precedent.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:03.720]  100 miles into the country, around a third of our geometric, geographical mass, you
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  were searched.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.600]  This is absolute bull.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.880]  Now, here's the key to all of this, because I know I'm ranting on and on before I get
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.440]  to the video.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.560]  I tell them, I know the Supreme Court's rules, you can do this, the Supreme Court also ruled
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.840]  black people weren't humans.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.560]  So I don't, they rule I can't own private property tomorrow, I can't own guns, or that
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.880]  I got to turn my kids over to the state, I'm not following it.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.400]  But they say, the Supreme Court's rule, we can verify citizenship, yeah, they do these
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:39.160]  internal citizen checkpoints instead of at the border, where they wave everybody through.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.080]  And then he says, I say, you're looking for drugs, I'm going to sue you, you want to violate
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  my Fourth Amendment?
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.160]  He says, no, we're not, we're looking for narcotics.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:53.600]  So he plays some little mind game with me, and they first swaggered over like a gang.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.120]  And again, I have my camera on in my lap, I wasn't going to hold it up like last time
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.960]  when they said, turn your camera off, and I didn't.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.840]  I said, Richard, you watch, he's like, this will be a piece of cake, and I said, no, it
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.840]  won't.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.960]  Okay, they're going to want to pull us over, Richard went down there with me to help produce
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.080]  the show and drive in the RV.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.080]  And I kept the camera in my lap roll, and when I got up and got in his face, I mean,
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.920]  this is the death of everything.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.160]  And folks, a lot of you are saying, hey, we like the border patrol, they're protecting
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.280]  us, baloney.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.280]  This has nothing to do with our sovereignty.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.680]  This is about the Fourth Amendment being killed.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.360]  And again, I just showed you clips of Tennessee and other states where they're running checkpoints
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.640]  on the citizens with Homeland Security.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:38.400]  This is about a total takeover and domestic checkpoints to travel in this country where
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.920]  you then just disappear.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.680]  The government's already said they'll kill citizens without warrants.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.920]  The government's already said they'll round people up.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.680]  This is about total tyranny by the banksters imploding this country.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:52.680]  So I'm not the enemy of these border patrol agents, but I've studied the facts and I know
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680]  what's happening.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:08.680]  Let's go ahead and go to the report.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.280]  All right, again, we exposed the unconstitutional internal checkpoints here.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.320]  And here I was wanting to go down and check out the border, go down and interview some
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.840]  people.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:25.800]  I shot that from my hotel balcony before the red tide hit and made us all basically sick.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:29.640]  The air was just full of that neurotoxin being released by the algae, which is being fed
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.480]  by all the artificial fertilizer pouring out through the rivers and the gulf.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.040]  And I pulled up to it and I knew what was coming.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:49.400]  I decided not to be provocative, it was just amazing.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:53.800]  Look, we just opened our bikes' cars up, right?
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.560]  These guys now already made them a big star earlier.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.040]  This is hilarious.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.560]  Again, right here, I'm not filming the drug dog, people opening their cars and it going
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.240]  in their cars, because last time I did film that, they said, turn your camera off and
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:11.240]  I refused.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:17.040]  I said, I'm just going to sit here and hold it in my lap just to prove to Richard who
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.640]  was thinking, oh no, let's just be nice and see what they do.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]  It was a test.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:25.120]  I sat there and was talking with the camera in my lap, aimed at Richard, down where they
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:31.040]  couldn't see it, and I was watching them search the people's cars.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:51.840]  I was watching them pull them over and put the dog in their car.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.040]  We're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.040]  at home.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:09.200]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]  shots.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.480]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.200]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.720]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:37.600]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.600]  of the republic.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:45.000]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.720]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.760]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:58.760]  risk.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:43:59.760]  Saving means to make money.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.920]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.440]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:15.240]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.840]  or antibacterials.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:22.480]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.760]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:28.040]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.120]  to do something you've never done before.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:38.240]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.

[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:58.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.360]  allows you to have.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:10.060]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:14.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.520]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:56.760]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:10.520]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:18.960]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.600]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.720]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:35.520]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.080]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.240]  ride all day with confidence.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.160]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:51.520]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:00.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.840]  Okay, we're back.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.720]  It's M4Wars Nightly News.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:10.200]  We're about to talk to our next guest on The Economy, and we've got another guest on who's
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:16.040]  kind of an apologist for the congenital liars of the establishment.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:22.920]  But I wanted to just talk about the report we covered last night, $79 trillion of Bank
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.960]  of America derivatives that they're about to have American taxpayers try to pay for
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.560]  and then lecture us all day about our debts.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.680]  It's just incredible.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.080]  So it's very important to realize that it's the ultra-rich, waging war against the middle
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.280]  class trying to con basically people that aren't aware of it.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:48.080]  So we're going to be talking about Herman Keynes' $9999 plan.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.200]  Where does that extra $9 come in?
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:57.000]  And with more on The Economy and this vital election, we're joined by the CEO of Euro
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.840]  Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.680]  He's written an excellent article today that M4Wars.com picked up, Business Insider and
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.080]  many other sites.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.880]  There's a hidden nine in Herman Keynes' $9999 plan.
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:16.240]  Now obviously my criticism is we were always told by the fair taxers they would get rid
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.520]  of the income tax and bring in a sales tax or VAT.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.560]  Herman wants both, and those nines can become 15s, 20s, 30s as they've done in Europe and
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.560]  England.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.760]  And then there's also the FICA.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.280]  They're not going to want to get rid of social security in there.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.360]  They're going to keep $9999.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:39.840]  But we'll find out the other hidden nine that Peter Schiff is talking about here today.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.320]  Peter, thanks for joining us.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.360]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.720]  So you've written this article, but break it down.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.880]  Where is the hidden nine in Herman Keynes' plan?
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:59.120]  Well, the fourth nine is the 9% payroll tax that is imposed through what is purported
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.720]  to be a 9% corporate income tax.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.120]  It isn't a 9% corporate income tax.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.880]  It actually is a gross receipts tax.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.840]  And embedded in that gross receipts tax is a 9% tax on payrolls.
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:19.680]  And the only way for businesses to recoup that payroll tax is through their workforce.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:26.040]  Now, granted, that represents a reduction of the 15.3% payroll tax that is already
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.200]  in place, where half of it is paid directly by the worker and the other half is paid indirectly
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:34.080]  by the worker through reduced wages.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.440]  But the problem is, Herman Keynes is claiming that he completely gets rid of the payroll
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.200]  tax, that it no longer exists.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  That's not true.
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.200]  It's still there.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.360]  It's just not as high.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.800]  But the problem is, the way Herman is selling his plan to the average worker is that he's
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.920]  going to get a reduction in taxes because he's going to have no payroll taxes and he's
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.960]  going to pay just a 9% income tax and a 9% sales tax.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:04.240]  If that were really the case, then pretty much all working Americans would get a tax
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.880]  cut under the Herman Keynes plan.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.560]  Of course, if you retired and they were going to get a tax hike, but if you account for
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.980]  the fourth nine, that's not the case.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.240]  That's a game changer.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:22.760]  What the fourth nine means is that the majority of Americans under the 999 plan are going
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.520]  to be paying 27% of their income in taxes, which is much higher than a lot of those people
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.600]  pay now.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.720]  So the only way the plan works, the only way it's revenue neutral is because you have
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:40.280]  big tax increases on the middle class and lower class to pay for tax cuts for higher
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  income workers.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.480]  Now, it is a pro-growth plan.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.640]  We are going to get more economic growth out of this plan.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.600]  We're going to get more jobs out of this plan because we're freeing up capital, we're treating
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:52.560]  capital a lot better, we're going to have more investments, we're going to have more
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.300]  savings, we're going to have more job creation, but we're going to have to pay for that by
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:59.080]  putting the bill on the middle class.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.100]  Now if we don't want to stick the middle class with a bill, then we need to cut government
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:04.760]  spending dramatically.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.920]  But the government wants to pretend that we can have a growing economy, all this government
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.120]  spending, and stick the bill on the rich, it ain't going to work.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.680]  Because if we try to put the bill on the high income earners, then we're not going to get
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.040]  the economic growth, then we're not going to get the jobs.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.120]  We're just going to have a lot of government and a lot of unemployment.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.800]  Sure, Peter, let me interject here because this is important.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:31.080]  I saw the Economic Policy Journal criticize you, why Peter Schiff and Arthur Laffer are
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:37.440]  wrong about Herman Cain 999, and it's got classic, class warfare garbage about you just
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:43.960]  don't want rich people taxed, but sales taxes, VAT taxes, from what I've researched, just
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:49.960]  basic economics, that always hits the poorest people, so this makes no sense.
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:55.080]  Yeah, and of course the people that are hurt the most by taxes that discourage job creation
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.960]  are the people who are looking for jobs.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.080]  So by keeping taxes high on the job creators, we're keeping a lot of people unemployed.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.200]  They would be better to get a job and then pay some taxes than to be unemployed and pay
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:12.520]  no taxes, but our Laffer is applauding the 999 plan because he doesn't know about the
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:13.520]  hidden nine.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.960]  See, I have a difference of opinion.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.360]  I figured out that there's a fourth nine.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:23.960]  Our Laffer doesn't even know that yet, but the thing is I'm in favor of moving towards
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.920]  a tax structure where people are taxed based on what they spend, not based on what they
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:29.920]  earn.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.960]  Now, the standard liberal argument is, well, that's not fair because the rich people don't
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.840]  spend everything like the poor people, they save some of their money.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:42.360]  Well, precisely, we want them to save their money because when they save their money,
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.200]  they're delaying gratification for themselves.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.320]  They're postponing their consumption into the future.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:52.920]  When they eventually spend, they'll pay the taxes, but in the meantime, the money is used
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:54.360]  to grow the economy.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.960]  It provides capital for businesses, either the individual who's earning the money uses
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.940]  it to grow his own business or he loans it out either through the banking system or directly
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.720]  to some other entrepreneur.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:10.840]  So why would we want to take money that was going to be used to grow the economy and send
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:14.040]  it to Washington where it's going to use it to undermine the economy?
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.600]  All right, Peter, let me expand on that because I had read your excellent, there's a hidden
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:22.200]  nine in Herman Cain's plan today.
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:23.760]  I hadn't read this full article.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]  Now I've actually had a chance.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:32.120]  We were talking to scan over it a bit and they're actually criticizing you in this, but they're
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:39.320]  saying you're endorsing his 9999 plan, but I follow you closely.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.120]  I hadn't seen you endorse Cain's 9999 plan.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.480]  Now I haven't endorsed it and I think it's a loser in the general election.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:53.040]  If Cain gets the nomination with his 9999 plan, it's going to come out that there's a fourth
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.840]  nine in there and the public is going to reject it because they're not going to vote for higher
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.360]  taxes on themselves.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.880]  But my whole point is, it shows just how much of the tax burden the rich currently bear.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.560]  I mean, if you're going to reduce the taxes on the upper income people so that it's the
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.160]  same as people that earn less money, you can't do that.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.760]  So either you've got to massively cut government spending or you've got to raise taxes on the
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:23.640]  middle class in order to cut taxes on upper income, but if we don't cut the taxes, we're
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:24.640]  not going to get growth.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.600]  Let me quantify this because I had a college student call me today and he said, you don't
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:34.720]  want to redistribute the wealth, the 1%, you're basically anti-American, but it wasn't reality
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.680]  based and so quantify that.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.600]  You're explaining to people, if you cut the taxes on the rich, yeah, that would speed
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.880]  the economy up, but this plan actually increases it overall in the poor who aren't paying a
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.200]  lot of taxes right now and that'll cause issues as well.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  That's what you're getting at, right?
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.080]  But it's also increasing taxes on the middle class.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  Most people are going to get a tax hike under this plan.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.880]  See the real problem is government is too big.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.040]  Government is too expensive.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:05.760]  We have to cut government so that we don't have to raise taxes on anybody.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.440]  In fact, if we cut enough government, we can lower taxes on everybody, but if we want
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.200]  all this government that we have now, it is very expensive and we can't put the bill
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.000]  just on the rich because then the economy collapses.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.760]  So if we want all this government, the truth is the middle class has got to pay for it
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.240]  and people think that the rich are getting away with murder.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:29.480]  Look, I'm paying about half my income in taxes right now, I don't know how much more
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:30.480]  I can take.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:35.560]  Yeah, they're trying to pretend that the rich are paying less in taxes than their secretaries.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.560]  That's nonsense.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.400]  And not only are the rich paying higher rates than their secretaries, but in absolute numbers,
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:46.080]  I mean, think about Warren Buffett, they're saying he's paying less rate than his secretary.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.080]  They're saying Warren Buffett is paying 17%.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.680]  Yeah, but he's paying like 10 million a year.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.720]  I mean, his secretary might be paying a higher rate, but maybe she's only paying 10,000 versus
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.080]  his 10 million.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.240]  But it's also a lie because Warren Buffett is the biggest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.040]  He doesn't even take a salary, he works for free.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.320]  So his income is Berkshire's income and Berkshire Hathaway is paying 35% income tax.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:11.520]  That's Warren's money.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.480]  He's paying his taxes through Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:15.480]  True.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.000]  So not only is he paying a lot more in taxes than his secretary, but he's paying a higher
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.640]  rate and anybody who says otherwise, including Warren Buffett, is lying.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.560]  Here in Texas, we have a stealth income tax that's the franchise tax.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:34.920]  I pay taxes on all the equipment, everything, and a percentage on my profits.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.560]  And I mean, it's taxes on top of taxes.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.080]  So let me ask you this question.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.040]  Why then do we see the ultra rich, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and others?
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.000]  I mean, I have my answer for it.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.280]  Why do we see them promoting higher taxes?
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.800]  Well, you know, Warren Buffett, you know, he actually benefits from the estate tax
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:00.040]  because a lot of businesses have to be sold because they can't survive the estate tax.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.640]  And then Warren gets to buy him up on the cheap through Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:08.160]  So he has an interest in breaking up a lot of these businesses, even though it's a destructive
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.160]  tax on the income tax.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  I don't know.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]  Maybe he just wants to be liked.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.720]  You know, it's a lot easier to be liked if you adopt these liberal agenda.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:36.000]  It's more difficult to have to explain to people why just taxing the rich is a bad deal.
