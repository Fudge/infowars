[00:00.000 --> 00:10.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already Sunday, the 6th day of August 2017, I'm your host
[00:10.360 --> 00:13.920]  Alex Jones, and I'll be live here the next two hours.
[00:13.920 --> 00:18.840]  We've hit the zeitgeist, one of the top stories, in fact it's according to Google, the third
[00:18.840 --> 00:26.920]  top story in the country this weekend, concerns martial law and concerns civil war and concerns
[00:26.920 --> 00:31.680]  a coup against Trump, all that thanks to Michael Savage, Kit Daniels, and then of course Matt
[00:31.680 --> 00:34.720]  Drudge linking to our story at infowars.com.
[00:34.720 --> 00:38.520]  That's coming up in the second segment, but first.
[00:38.520 --> 00:44.440]  Only 4% of those coming into the UK of refugees at present, 96% of those coming into the UK
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.320]  last year up to June 2015 are economic migrants.
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.560]  They aren't escaping the Syrian conflict, in fact they aren't even on the same continent.
[00:54.560 --> 00:57.840]  They aren't even escaping conflict in Libya.
[00:57.840 --> 00:59.080]  Who are they?
[00:59.080 --> 01:04.380]  They are the economic migrants posing as refugees under the guise of the United Nations
[01:04.380 --> 01:10.160]  replacement migration operation, threatening the stability of western civilization.
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.720]  This is no accident.
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.880]  You will find them in Calais, France, disrupting the highways and rioting in the streets.
[01:16.880 --> 01:20.760]  You will find them in Hamburg, Germany, demanding a government handout.
[01:20.760 --> 01:26.120]  And in numbers exceeding expectations, you will find them on the shores of Italy if they
[01:26.120 --> 01:27.720]  survive the journey.
[01:27.720 --> 01:34.480]  Paul Joseph Watson reports new figures show that just 1.4% of migrants arriving in Italy
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.040]  are Syrian refugees, confirming the fact that the overwhelming majority of people flooding
[01:40.040 --> 01:45.000]  into Europe are economic migrants from countries not at war.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.600]  The numbers obtained by West Monster via Eurostat underscore how the true nature of
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.560]  the migrant crisis is being completely misrepresented by the press, left-wing groups and politicians.
[01:57.560 --> 02:04.720]  Over 20% of the asylum claims are from Nigerians, Bangladeshis also accounted for over 9% of
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.840]  asylum claims, while Pakistanis accounted for 7.5% and migrants from the small country
[02:11.840 --> 02:17.280]  of the Gambia accounting for 7.9% of asylum requests.
[02:17.280 --> 02:26.800]  Out of the entire 248,290 asylum claims received by EU countries, so far this year, just 14%
[02:26.800 --> 02:28.120]  were from Syrians.
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.640]  This includes individuals who have fake identity papers and merely claim to be Syrian to receive
[02:33.640 --> 02:34.720]  better treatment.
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.720]  As many as 15 million, a malleable globalist army of anarchy are heading to Europe within
[02:40.720 --> 02:47.360]  the next 3 years, and only 10-15% of this mob have the skills, training or education
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.800]  to fill in any gaps in European trades.
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.360]  The media ignores it, and the delusional sycophants in high places support the sheer madness that
[02:56.360 --> 03:02.440]  will replace the institutions the pawns of globalism inhabit, but one person isn't turning
[03:02.440 --> 03:03.920]  a blind eye.
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.680]  President Trump's rational proposal to the globalist invasion is a ray of hope.
[03:08.680 --> 03:17.040]  The RAISE Act, R-A-I-S-C, will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions
[03:17.040 --> 03:19.240]  and billions of dollars.
[03:19.240 --> 03:25.080]  It will do this by changing the way the United States issues green cards to nationals from
[03:25.080 --> 03:26.280]  other countries.
[03:26.280 --> 03:33.080]  The RAISE Act ends chain migration and replaces our low-skilled system with a new points-based
[03:33.080 --> 03:36.680]  system for receiving a green card.
[03:36.680 --> 03:43.320]  This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English, financially
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.280]  support themselves and their families, and demonstrate skills that will contribute to
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.000]  our economy.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.720]  Only 1 in 15 out of a million new immigrants come here because of their job skills and
[03:55.720 --> 03:58.560]  their ability to succeed in this economy.
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.280]  That means it puts great downward pressure on people who work with their hands and work
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.280]  on their feet.
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.320]  Now for some people, they may think that's a symbol of America's virtue and generosity.
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.720]  I think it's a symbol that we're not committed to working-class Americans.
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.360]  We looked at countries like Canada, Australia, and others.
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.280]  What we're introducing today is model on the current Canadian and Australian systems.
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.560]  It's pro-worker, it's pro-growth, and it's been proven to work.
[04:25.560 --> 04:32.240]  That no mockingbird media brainwashing device has questioned the lopsided globalist cuckolding
[04:32.240 --> 04:38.560]  of your country's future stability should ring alarm bells from sea to shining sea.
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.240]  And the notion that you actually think immigration is at a historic low, the foreign-born population
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.240]  in the United States today, Jim, Jim.
[04:46.240 --> 04:49.240]  I'm talking about how border crossings work.
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.960]  I want to be serious, Jim, do you really have CNN not know the difference between green
[04:52.960 --> 04:55.080]  card policy and illegal immigration?
[04:55.080 --> 04:59.080]  John Bowne, reporting for Infowars.com.
[04:59.080 --> 05:01.680]  Stay with us, folks.
[05:01.680 --> 05:06.880]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com
[05:06.880 --> 05:07.880]  is writing about it.
[05:07.880 --> 05:11.880]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.920]  apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[05:16.920 --> 05:21.720]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers, but the grasshoppers will
[05:21.720 --> 05:23.920]  still sing the tune if they can make money.
[05:23.920 --> 05:27.760]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.760]  to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[05:30.760 --> 05:35.200]  There are still very effective low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[05:35.200 --> 05:39.840]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.160]  realization increases your chances of survival.
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.600]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms,
[05:47.600 --> 05:51.680]  to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[05:51.680 --> 05:56.040]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.480]  the best-case scenario.
[05:57.480 --> 06:00.200]  Get more information at Infowars.com.
[06:00.200 --> 06:01.200]  I'm David Knight.
[06:30.200 --> 06:37.200]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.200]  Worldwide.
[06:38.200 --> 06:40.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:48.200 --> 06:58.200]  The world, not just the United States, sits on a knife's edge.
[06:58.200 --> 07:08.720]  The future, destiny of humanity, is in all of our hands.
[07:08.720 --> 07:14.840]  More so than ever, humanity controls its environment to a great extent, controls the technological
[07:14.840 --> 07:24.560]  developments, controls so many aspects that to the eyes of an ancient, it would seem magic.
[07:24.560 --> 07:34.640]  Despite all of this, our street smarts, our cunning, our common sense has never been lower.
[07:34.640 --> 07:41.160]  But many a historian, going back thousands of years to Babylon, Rome, and Egypt, wrote
[07:41.160 --> 07:52.000]  that the city dweller became soft, became weak, and that then it gave rise to gangs and
[07:52.000 --> 07:59.880]  corruption, and finally the nation state would become weak, the city state would become weak
[07:59.880 --> 08:02.760]  and would fall.
[08:02.760 --> 08:12.320]  But now those cycles are accelerated, compounded as we move at light speed, literally, through
[08:12.320 --> 08:26.080]  the fiber optic and through the silicon, interfaced with our human minds, towards infinity.
[08:26.080 --> 08:35.040]  As the great social engineers of the world, pretend they're God, and all they really
[08:35.040 --> 08:37.600]  are is parasites.
[08:37.600 --> 08:43.520]  Now, let's break it all down, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:43.520 --> 08:48.000]  The globalists have quite a job on their hands, and the media that's been tasked with this
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.680]  has been given quite a job to run their psyops.
[08:51.680 --> 08:58.080]  The CIA four years ago got Obama to get Congress to legalize the CIA and more than 30 other
[08:58.080 --> 09:02.720]  federal agencies to engage in direct deception of the American people.
[09:02.720 --> 09:06.960]  It was picked up in the Washington Post, it was picked up in foreign affairs, it was picked
[09:06.960 --> 09:14.000]  up in the Sunday Times of London, that we're going to directly lie to you now to complete
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.320]  the globalist takeover, because, well, just half-truths haven't worked, we're going to
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.480]  completely lie to you, we're going to tell you Obamacare is free, we're going to tell
[09:24.480 --> 09:28.720]  you to keep your doctor, we're going to tell you that it's children coming across the border
[09:28.720 --> 09:37.000]  and not 80 plus percent, 83 percent adults.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.400]  We're going to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders when he openly won New Hampshire
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.920]  and a bunch of other states, and we're going to give it to Hillary, and we're going to
[09:46.920 --> 09:48.440]  steal it from Trump.
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.400]  And remember, though, they were in neocon publications like Foreign Affairs and like
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.440]  National Review saying, we're going to take the delegates from him, it doesn't matter
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.160]  if you want all these states, we're allowed to, the party picks, the public didn't buy
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.880]  into that.
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.600]  And Trump challenged it so they had to back off, but remember they would first say, oh,
[10:10.600 --> 10:18.040]  we're not planning to take delegates, well, here you are on CNN saying, today tell conservative
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.560]  media it's not happening to keep you asleep, but on CNN they'd say, of course we're not
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.160]  going to let Trump have the nomination, we're taking the delegates.
[10:27.160 --> 10:35.920]  Then they were on CNN and MSNBC with Nancy Pelosi's daughter leading the effort saying,
[10:35.920 --> 10:47.600]  oh, electors all the time who represent the delegates, it's easy for them to just say
[10:47.600 --> 10:49.080]  it's not going to be Trump.
[10:49.080 --> 10:55.120]  We're just going to not have Trump get the inauguration, we're just going to have in
[10:55.120 --> 10:57.440]  the electoral college them not see him.
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.680]  And then we're going to have a civil emergency, CNN said.
[11:00.680 --> 11:04.040]  And then we're going to have a new election run by Homeland Security, Obama signed an
[11:04.040 --> 11:09.480]  executive order as if they were going to go out with this plan.
[11:09.480 --> 11:16.080]  And then we're going to seat, through this new election run by the Democrats in control
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.400]  of Homeland Security, we're going to federalize all 50 states, all 50 Attorney Generals have
[11:20.400 --> 11:22.840]  written letters saying don't do this, including Democrats.
[11:22.840 --> 11:28.680]  It ends the federalist system, it's basically martial law over the electoral process.
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.760]  Homeland Security, run by Jay Johnson at the time, was going to federalize things, they
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.880]  were not going to seat Trump, they were not going to take the delegates and have the electors
[11:37.880 --> 11:45.840]  put him in on January 6th, he would then be sworn in on January 20th, this is the Constitution.
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.680]  They said we're going to ignore all of that, and we're going to have new elections in six
[11:51.680 --> 11:52.680]  months.
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.600]  But until six months, that'd be right now, until six months after January 20th, we'll
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.720]  just put everybody that lost, who are incumbents back in.
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.000]  And we'll have special elections in places where somebody didn't run.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.720]  Now that was announced by them and put out, and then I came on the air and said that's
[12:11.720 --> 12:14.080]  stealing the election.
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.080]  That's fraud.
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.200]  And that's basically martial law, that violates this area of the Constitution.
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.680]  All 50 Attorney Generals agree with me, within days.
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.200]  They all sent letters saying this is insane.
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.640]  So they had to back off, and it's the same thing now.
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.720]  They tried to take the nomination, then they tried to block him being inaugurated, then
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.160]  they tried to block people physically getting into the barriers around the mall.
[12:42.160 --> 12:49.920]  I was there, it took me three hours, live on Facebook mentions, being attacked by mobs
[12:49.920 --> 12:54.560]  of men, women, and children as shields, because they'd say you were attacking kids, tried
[12:54.560 --> 12:55.560]  to push through.
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.400]  It took us hours and hours to get in.
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.200]  Then CNN showed when the gates had opened, 10 minutes in, to show small crowds coming
[13:03.200 --> 13:04.560]  in and said it was empty.
[13:04.560 --> 13:11.160]  No, I was there, half the crowds were families crying that they couldn't get in, beat up
[13:11.160 --> 13:13.120]  with bloody noses.
[13:13.120 --> 13:14.520]  There's video of all of it.
[13:14.520 --> 13:17.560]  They would attack families with little boys and girls.
[13:17.560 --> 13:19.360]  We're talking four, five years old.
[13:19.360 --> 13:21.400]  They have no shame.
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.520]  It was traumatizing.
[13:22.520 --> 13:25.160]  I began running up, screaming and cussing at police.
[13:25.160 --> 13:26.160]  I did.
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.880]  I said, you will GD get in there and do something.
[13:29.880 --> 13:31.400]  And finally cops had tears in their eyes.
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.880]  They went over and arrested some people, because they were ordered not to, or they'd be fired.
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.720]  Just like you see Washerman Schultz saying, you investigate Seth Rich, you investigate
[13:39.720 --> 13:44.200]  these laptops, you investigate the Pakistani government, you're going to lose your jobs.
[13:44.200 --> 13:47.600]  Remember that?
[13:47.600 --> 13:48.880]  So all of this is going on.
[13:48.880 --> 13:50.720]  Now, why do I tell you all that?
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.640]  Because we've been through this before, because while they're on MSNBC and in Mother Jones
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.240]  and all these establishment publications and foreign affairs and Atlantic Monthly saying
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.800]  don't let him get elected, have martial law basically, have new staged elections, never
[14:05.800 --> 14:07.920]  let Republicans get elected again.
[14:07.920 --> 14:08.920]  We've got to take over.
[14:08.920 --> 14:09.920]  We're a dying party.
[14:09.920 --> 14:11.640]  I mean, they admit all this.
[14:11.640 --> 14:12.640]  Okay.
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.240]  While all that's going on, there's on the news saying no one's trying to take the nomination.
[14:18.240 --> 14:21.360]  Then no one's trying to take the electors.
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.840]  No one's trying to block him becoming president.
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.840]  That's insane.
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.320]  Alex Jones is insane.
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.960]  Now it's in Newsweek, Time, CNN, MSNBC.
[14:30.960 --> 14:41.840]  On every channel that I am insane and that I've made up that on a Wolf Blitzer program
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.200]  on C-SPAN, he hosted for the Aspen Institute two weeks ago.
[14:45.200 --> 14:47.280]  We've played it probably 10 times here.
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.400]  He has the former head of national security clapper with the head of CIA Brennan formally
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.440]  saying don't worry, we don't need impeachment.
[14:56.440 --> 14:58.640]  He's going to be removed the next couple of months.
[14:58.640 --> 15:01.600]  The plan's already in place.
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.560]  Then Al Gore goes on The Late Late Show three days after a senior pastor that met with senior
[15:06.560 --> 15:10.760]  congressman who we had on goes public and says they're planning to kill him.
[15:10.760 --> 15:13.400]  Oh yeah, he's now talked to Congress again.
[15:13.400 --> 15:14.880]  The plan is to kill Trump.
[15:14.880 --> 15:16.960]  Now how do you counter that?
[15:16.960 --> 15:23.320]  You play a clip of me talking about runoff, making frogs bisexual, so it makes no sense.
[15:23.320 --> 15:29.000]  Not to me joking around seven years ago in a Cobra Commander outfit, in a comedy piece
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.560]  we did, and then you cut to, this is what they actually did.
[15:33.560 --> 15:36.560]  Deep State is going to kill the president, Alan Jones.
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.560]  You read it.
[15:37.560 --> 15:38.560]  They never have one link.
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.400]  It just says he's totally insane.
[15:40.400 --> 15:41.400]  He's crazy.
[15:41.400 --> 15:44.360]  Meanwhile, I've got him all saying remove him, kill him, overthrow him, blow up the White
[15:44.360 --> 15:45.360]  House.
[15:45.360 --> 15:47.520]  So, who broke through this?
[15:47.520 --> 15:49.920]  Michael Savage covered it, Drudge linked to it.
[15:49.920 --> 15:52.000]  It's now one of the top stories in the country.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.400]  We hit the zeitgeist thanks to all of you.
[15:54.400 --> 15:58.680]  They're now forced to cover the plan to kill the president, civil war, and more, and we
[15:58.680 --> 16:00.680]  could stop it.
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.120]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been
[16:05.120 --> 16:06.720]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.200]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.440]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[16:16.440 --> 16:20.160]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in, and when the Fukushima crisis
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.760]  worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[16:29.760 --> 16:30.760]  and your family.
[16:30.760 --> 16:36.240]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[16:36.240 --> 16:42.040]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[16:42.040 --> 16:43.680]  ever concerning iodine.
[16:43.680 --> 16:45.600]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.880]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[16:49.880 --> 16:51.920]  any optimum health regimen.
[16:51.920 --> 17:20.880]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.760]  Easy to use, and let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables,
[17:25.760 --> 17:29.080]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.880]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.880]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[17:35.880 --> 17:39.880]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.720]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[17:45.720 --> 17:49.200]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[17:49.200 --> 17:52.760]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[17:52.760 --> 17:56.760]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[17:56.760 --> 17:57.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[17:57.760 --> 18:02.280]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.

[18:12.960 --> 18:16.560]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its
[18:16.560 --> 18:17.560]  core.
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.560]  Every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but Biotrusillinium
[18:22.560 --> 18:26.720]  is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[18:26.720 --> 18:30.240]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[18:30.240 --> 18:35.280]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.440]  is also the perfect supercharger to survive shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[18:40.440 --> 18:42.240]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[18:56.400 --> 18:58.520]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[18:58.520 --> 19:02.200]  This is the time to support infowarslife.com.
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.580]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[19:06.580 --> 19:11.280]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[19:11.280 --> 19:12.800]  to detoxify the body.
[19:12.800 --> 19:15.160]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.680]  Stick metal and chemical defense support.
[19:17.680 --> 19:19.200]  It's made in the USA.
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.120]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[19:24.120 --> 19:25.960]  the body and it supports the info war.
[19:25.960 --> 19:28.200]  It is a classical 360 Winn.
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.680]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[19:32.680 --> 19:37.360]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[19:37.360 --> 19:38.360]  get.
[19:38.360 --> 19:41.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[19:41.600 --> 19:46.640]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[19:46.640 --> 19:51.880]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[19:51.880 --> 19:54.600]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.880]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[19:57.880 --> 20:04.880]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[20:04.880 --> 20:11.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:34.880 --> 20:44.880]  It's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[21:04.880 --> 21:32.800]  Now notice the globalists and all of their anti-American mercenary organizations are
[21:32.800 --> 21:36.640]  telling you they're the resistance now, no they're the deep state, they're the foreign
[21:36.640 --> 21:41.920]  banks, they're the people that conquered this country, we're taking it back, we are the resistance,
[21:41.920 --> 21:44.120]  you are the resistance.
[21:44.120 --> 21:52.200]  And the enemy in publications every day on national TV says Alex Jones is writing the
[21:52.200 --> 21:58.080]  talking points for the second American Revolution, he's the enemy.
[21:58.080 --> 22:03.600]  And then I read the classified Department of Defense documents from three years ago,
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.480]  word for word what I'm saying.
[22:09.480 --> 22:15.040]  But ladies and gentlemen, they didn't get it from me because they're even using words
[22:15.040 --> 22:20.560]  I've never heard of till I looked them up that are semi-classified gestalt words that
[22:20.560 --> 22:24.560]  mean whole bodies of knowledge that I had to look up that I learned from.
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.960]  I fell down the rabbit hole yesterday because my wife was taking a continued education course
[22:29.960 --> 22:34.320]  for eight hours and so I had all four of the children and I was in there cooking food hanging
[22:34.320 --> 22:43.760]  around the house with my laptop, with my iPad all day and I read four hours of documents
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.840]  just on McMaster and it's everything I heard and worse.
[22:47.840 --> 22:55.880]  God help us, he's a Wahhabist just like Brennan.
[22:55.880 --> 22:58.560]  I mean, it's beyond overwhelming.
[22:58.560 --> 23:03.080]  No wonder they've got former top counterterrorism FBI agents that ran whole sections saying
[23:03.080 --> 23:05.280]  this guy is the enemy within.
[23:05.280 --> 23:13.360]  You know how much money the Arabs have folks, they buy people off and I've got to apologize.
[23:13.360 --> 23:19.920]  I used to hear 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, the super right wing go oh there's
[23:19.920 --> 23:24.760]  a plan to merge with Islam and sell out Christianity and flood Europe with Muslims and make us
[23:24.760 --> 23:30.440]  take Sharia law and it was so incompatible with the West and I knew the left was anti-American
[23:30.440 --> 23:34.840]  and globalist but I didn't think they'd ever merge with something that cuts women's genitals
[23:34.840 --> 23:39.800]  off with loppers and puts total bags over their heads and throws gays off buildings
[23:39.800 --> 23:46.160]  and now I've got all the documents and the admissions from the Saudi Arabian government
[23:46.160 --> 23:53.760]  and from McMaster and from Brennan and it's like oh my God and they just purged dozens
[23:53.760 --> 23:59.800]  of people this week and last week out of the National Security Council who are hardcore
[23:59.800 --> 24:05.440]  veterans, highly decorated, top strategists, tops of their class because you read these
[24:05.440 --> 24:09.240]  memos and it's not just the one that got a bunch of attention last week, I ended up
[24:09.240 --> 24:18.720]  reading parts of 20, 30 memos, I mean I couldn't stop, I said four hours, I did four hours
[24:18.720 --> 24:23.600]  at one stop walking around with the pad while I'm feeding the baby and making food and cooking
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.400]  hamburgers and everything else and I mean I was like out in the pool with the kids
[24:28.400 --> 24:33.520]  with the iPad in my hand and my kids were like dad you never do this and usually at
[24:33.520 --> 24:37.400]  least on Saturday you don't work and I just said I can't stop reading this, I can't stop
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.200]  watching this, I sent the crew like 30 something links, they can't even process it all, it's
[24:43.200 --> 24:51.280]  so cut and dry, I cannot believe it, I mean it is incredible.
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.480]  The globalists are wild, I mean look at demographics, there's a billion and a half
[24:55.480 --> 25:02.280]  Muslims, there's about to be 3 billion in 2026, 2027, the numbers vary but we're talking
[25:02.280 --> 25:15.160]  9 years, 10 years, there's already 1.5 billion with a B, there was 200 million just 35 years
[25:15.160 --> 25:21.320]  ago, I mean they're having six kids on average and I'm not against humans but they come from
[25:21.320 --> 25:25.240]  places where they're all killing each other, always one-upping who's the most radical and
[25:25.240 --> 25:30.680]  they're totally incompatible and I have a stack of news, they banned new synagogues
[25:30.680 --> 25:35.160]  in major cities of Australia this weekend because it quote makes the Muslims mad and
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.480]  I'm not on one side or the other but I'm for the side being abused, no new synagogues in
[25:40.480 --> 25:47.320]  Sydney and Perth and other areas, I saw mainstream news like it was a good thing, Australia banned
[25:47.320 --> 25:52.440]  Sydney synagogue over Islamist attack fears, I mean see you have to submit to Islam and
[25:52.440 --> 25:57.120]  take your rights away or they'll kill you.
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.800]  I put up a video a few months ago on YouTube of Muslims beating up a bunch of police in
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.800]  Sydney and they took it down saying it was hateful because I was showing Islam in a bad
[26:05.800 --> 26:12.880]  life, I can't show Muslims beating up a bunch of cops but this isn't about the Muslims
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.120]  for 1400 years have tried to take Europe, no one would ever let them in, we lost millions
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.120]  of people fighting them, the Hindus have lost 140 million people, it's estimated fighting
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.600]  them, that's why you've got the Indians just completely loving Trump because they, and
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.160]  genetically they're just like the Muslims they're fighting but it's the Muslims almost
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.080]  always killing them and when the Hindus fight back they call them radicals, the Hindus aren't
[26:36.080 --> 26:41.240]  attacking anybody unless you try to kill them, they're completely open to any religion that
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.340]  leaves them alone and lets them live, very Americana, why do you think Indians integrate
[26:45.340 --> 26:54.560]  so well into America but I digress, Islam does not, Islam does not and I'm just getting
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.000]  total chills right now because I did the whole first big segment on how they tried to take
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.080]  the nomination, then they said we're not going to let him be seated as the president, then
[27:03.080 --> 27:07.840]  they physically attacked me but I didn't care, I was watching women bleeding from the nose
[27:07.840 --> 27:13.920]  and I flipped out, as people saw on tape they started screaming at the police what is your
[27:13.920 --> 27:20.720]  problem do something, finally I had like a bunch of security detail guys that had been
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.880]  former Marines army, current Navy SEALs were with us, we just ran over a bunch of them
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.680]  to get through and finally get in, I was going to be late, ran them over but the women and
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.160]  children couldn't get through, we had to run over a group of people, 10 people thick blocking
[27:35.160 --> 27:40.840]  us from getting in and a woman would be on the front run up and like punch you and then
[27:40.840 --> 27:47.840]  when you ran over her she'd scream you attacked a woman but what I'm getting at is this, they
[27:47.840 --> 27:53.040]  would say on the news, Jones is insane, no one's trying to take the electors, Jones is
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.520]  insane, no one's trying to take the nomination, Jones is insane, no one's going to federalize
[27:57.520 --> 28:03.640]  the election, remember Obama came out and said hot guy in Texas, he's full of it, the
[28:03.640 --> 28:07.480]  feds don't run your election and he already had the executive order ready, that's why
[28:07.480 --> 28:11.000]  they were so freaked out, see they thought I was getting intel from Trump, it was the
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.920]  other way around, this stuff's all public if you research, 4 hours yesterday, the kids
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.600]  go to bed at 9, I was up for another 5 hours until the middle of the night, just 3 computers
[28:24.600 --> 28:32.640]  on, just not listening to people on the internet going to the documents and when we come back
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.000]  I'm going to give you the next phase of it, with the documents, with the video clips you
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.440]  name it, here's the deal, they want to deny this stuff's going until they try it, just
[28:40.440 --> 28:43.800]  like they want to deny there's a plan to kill Trump or remove him from office, which they
[28:43.800 --> 28:48.360]  say on all their media to get their people ready, but on our media or then so called
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.600]  mainstream media, they will then say oh nothing's happening, we're insane, classic military
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.240]  tactic, they want to hit us with our feet flat, that hasn't happened, they failed again,
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.960]  we'll be right back, stay with us, it's not just our water we need to filter, it's not
[29:02.960 --> 29:06.880]  just our food that needs to be cleaned, it's the air we're breathing, especially for our
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.600]  children, the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our
[29:12.600 --> 29:17.200]  immune systems, the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa
[29:17.200 --> 29:22.960]  Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether
[29:22.960 --> 29:27.920]  it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[29:27.920 --> 29:32.920]  to the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[29:32.920 --> 29:38.360]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves,
[29:38.360 --> 29:44.520]  the general public doesn't, the Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500,
[29:44.520 --> 29:49.360]  one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean, this is a system I'm personally
[29:49.360 --> 29:53.800]  putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as
[29:53.800 --> 30:02.200]  good a job, find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com
[30:02.200 --> 30:07.160]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the
[30:07.160 --> 30:11.640]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[30:11.640 --> 30:17.120]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[30:17.120 --> 30:22.840]  had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[30:22.840 --> 30:28.120]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing and so I set out to develop
[30:28.120 --> 30:34.600]  Caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood
[30:34.600 --> 30:41.040]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time, Info Wars isn't
[30:41.040 --> 30:45.960]  just fighting the globalist, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of
[30:45.960 --> 30:51.640]  the complete media assault and winning because of your support, Caveman is finally back at
[30:51.640 --> 30:58.040]  the Info War store, you can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com
[30:58.040 --> 31:02.400]  or by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[31:02.400 --> 31:07.240]  They use their media to assassinate real news, they use their schools to teach children
[31:07.240 --> 31:12.160]  that their president is another Hitler, they use their movie stars and singers and comedy
[31:12.160 --> 31:17.720]  shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their
[31:17.720 --> 31:23.720]  ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest, make
[31:23.720 --> 31:30.320]  them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars,
[31:30.320 --> 31:35.520]  shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only
[31:35.520 --> 31:42.040]  option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens
[31:42.040 --> 31:47.920]  they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage, the only way we stop this, the only way we
[31:47.920 --> 31:54.800]  save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist
[31:54.800 --> 31:55.800]  of truth.
[31:55.800 --> 32:24.280]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[32:24.280 --> 32:28.720]  In the history of M4's life we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[32:28.720 --> 32:33.760]  Shield X2, Super Male Vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and
[32:33.760 --> 32:37.960]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[32:37.960 --> 32:44.360]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[32:44.360 --> 32:49.600]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[32:49.600 --> 32:51.280]  quality lab standard.
[32:51.280 --> 32:55.320]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure and rest secured, you're finding the tip of
[32:55.320 --> 32:59.560]  the spear in the M4 war, that's infowarswives.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[32:59.560 --> 33:04.320]  Take action now before we sell out.
[33:04.320 --> 33:15.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:15.280 --> 33:20.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[33:20.120 --> 33:26.280]  Alex Jones Show, if you're a new listener, we'll
[33:26.280 --> 33:29.680]  sing on fine stations across the country or watching us live on the internet or an archive
[33:29.680 --> 33:30.680]  of this later.
[33:30.680 --> 33:38.800]  You want to know why is John Oliver and Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah and CNN and ABC and
[33:38.800 --> 33:46.320]  NBC and HBO, there's three programs on HBO that attack me basically every week, Homeland,
[33:46.320 --> 33:49.200]  it just goes on and on.
[33:49.200 --> 33:55.440]  Why Newsweek every day basically, Time Magazine almost every day, New York Times, Washington
[33:55.440 --> 33:56.440]  Post.
[33:56.440 --> 33:57.440]  Why?
[33:57.440 --> 33:59.560]  What are they so scared of?
[33:59.560 --> 34:04.920]  It's because I've studied history, I'm not asleep at the wheel, other people act like
[34:04.920 --> 34:10.920]  they're experts on Black Ops, government subterfuge, regime change.
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.840]  I've actually been studying it since I was about 10 years old because I just lucked
[34:14.840 --> 34:19.560]  into history books, thought it was fascinating and have read probably 1,000 history books
[34:19.560 --> 34:24.560]  conservatively, most of them about war, military, naval strategy, both from antiquity and then
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.560]  even in modern times.
[34:26.560 --> 34:29.120]  So a lot of people pose like they're learned in government.
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.240]  I actually am and I'm a private citizen.
[34:32.240 --> 34:36.200]  So they have this headline in Newsweek on Friday, Deep State's going to kill the president,
[34:36.200 --> 34:42.280]  Alex Jones Claims, then it shows nowhere from the very broadcast I did where I played
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.400]  Al Gore saying the president's going to be removed the next two months or Brennan saying
[34:46.400 --> 34:51.560]  he's going to be removed the next few months and it's not going to be from impeachment
[34:51.560 --> 34:54.120]  and you can't remove him with a grand jury.
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.600]  And then you've got all the people saying killing, removing, COG, use continuity of government,
[34:59.600 --> 35:08.040]  declaring a Russian agent, incapacitating, neutralizing that our congressional sources
[35:08.040 --> 35:13.120]  say that means kill.
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.240]  Secret services even visited some of our sources after they've come on.
[35:17.240 --> 35:23.040]  And the sources say go, go, go talk to Al Gore, go, go, go talk to all these people that
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.200]  are publicly saying it but see as a bureaucracy they don't want to actually stop it from happening.
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.480]  They want to act like they did everything they were supposed to before it happens because
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.600]  they've been basically ordered off of really protecting the president and that's why the
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.840]  president's got his own military protectors and I'm not going to even get into that.
[35:40.840 --> 35:44.920]  I'm going to stop right there but it's known as the Department of Defense from day one
[35:44.920 --> 35:51.120]  he brought the military in and they're encamped everywhere he goes.
[35:51.120 --> 35:55.600]  So what do you call that a country in the middle of a civil war?
[35:55.600 --> 35:57.880]  A country in the beginnings of a civil war?
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.920]  It's the Democrats everywhere calling for a civil emergency, for a new election, for
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.640]  his removal outside of law, for his death.
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.800]  Well, Blitzer, a week and a half ago, he's on the Aspen Institute, C-SPAN, interviewing
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.160]  Brennan and Clapper, former head of national security, former head of the CIA and he says
[36:17.160 --> 36:19.200]  what do you mean he's going to be removed soon?
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.560]  By impeachment they go no, no, just suddenly it's already happening, it's bipartisan, it's
[36:25.560 --> 36:27.120]  got to happen, we're going to do it.
[36:27.120 --> 36:30.760]  I play the clip like ten times, should I play it again?
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.160]  It's on screen for TV viewers and then they write an article saying out of the blue, Jones
[36:37.160 --> 36:38.160]  is saying this exists.
[36:38.160 --> 36:39.680]  Now why do they do that?
[36:39.680 --> 36:42.800]  Because they don't want a debate about it.
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.480]  They want to try to steal the nomination quietly, they want to try to steal the electors and
[36:47.480 --> 36:50.680]  not let him be seated quietly, remember all that?
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.560]  And then finally we cover it in Pelosi's daughter a day after I was told they had a Justice
[36:56.560 --> 37:06.360]  Department meeting where Pelosi ordered Lynch to have me indicted for psychological terrorism
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.200]  and all this stuff and I thought it was crazy and the next day she goes out on Fox News and
[37:11.200 --> 37:17.000]  says Alex Jones' death threaded me, he needs to be arrested.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.440]  Never threatened her anyway and then it was in Obama's executive order about two weeks
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.800]  later, early January he says we're going to shut down the alternative media, we're going
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.800]  to have new elections, we're not going to let Trump be seated as the president, we're
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.440]  going to have new elections and it was all done but they choked because they don't run
[37:39.440 --> 37:46.520]  the entire military or the entire FBI or the quote deep state, that's why.
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.680]  They've got Hollywood, they've got mainstream media but they don't have the people in the
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.000]  government on average that actually pull triggers and that's why they're putting out fake polls
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.440]  that Trump's really low right now, that's why they're saying he's an idiot, that's
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.440]  why they're saying he's got to stop communicating with the public because they can cut him off
[38:03.440 --> 38:08.220]  from the public, they'll cut off his base, the American people have to realize they finally
[38:08.220 --> 38:13.040]  got somebody really returning power to America, really returning jobs, the economy, doing
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.520]  everything he said he would do and the globalist who sold this nation out, who thought they
[38:17.520 --> 38:22.720]  owned it, who thought we were a $2 whore they could pimp out, they are so angry that they're
[38:22.720 --> 38:23.720]  not in control.
[38:23.720 --> 38:30.040]  Now I've spent 38 minutes of the first hour laying out these facts before I tell you
[38:30.040 --> 38:32.240]  the evidence I'm about to go through.
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.040]  If you're a TV viewer, we've been throwing it all on screen for you, mainstream news,
[38:37.040 --> 38:42.480]  bills, documents, video clips but for radio listeners, we post it all to infowars.com.
[38:42.480 --> 38:49.520]  Like this story that went up Friday by Kent Daniels, it was top linked on Drudge and had
[38:49.520 --> 38:56.440]  more than 4 million people that link through just on infowars.com, the power of Drudge.
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.080]  Last time I checked 15,000 comments, the story has been copied on thousands and thousands
[39:02.080 --> 39:09.120]  of major platforms, WorldNet Daily picked it up but the point is it is the number one
[39:09.120 --> 39:15.560]  political news story online according to Google Analytics, Twitter, you name it, of the weekend.
[39:15.560 --> 39:19.960]  Thanks to Matt Drudge, thanks to Kent Daniels writing the story, thanks to Michael Savage
[39:19.960 --> 39:25.240]  putting all the pieces together, all of us telling the truth, ignoring mainstream media
[39:25.240 --> 39:31.880]  saying it doesn't exist and there's the article, Kent Daniels, with all the links of where
[39:31.880 --> 39:34.760]  they're saying they're going to kill him, where they're saying they're going to remove
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.160]  him outside of impeachment, which is illegal, that's the constitutional avenue, where they're
[39:39.160 --> 39:42.680]  saying he's mentally ill and he's going to be put in a mental institution, where they're
[39:42.680 --> 39:45.880]  saying they're going to use COG and how they're going to run the queue.
[39:45.880 --> 39:53.320]  In mainstream elite publications, it's savage, civil war if Trump taken down.
[39:53.320 --> 39:57.360]  We told you they'd try to steal the nomination, they tried, they failed, if we wouldn't have
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.840]  warned and if you wouldn't have spoken out and if Trump wouldn't have fought, he would
[40:02.840 --> 40:09.880]  have lost and of course Trump saw my emergency message to him and he came out three days
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.280]  later, he checked with his experts, he found the numbers I put out from Pew Research, Mason
[40:15.280 --> 40:22.640]  Dixon and other major polling agencies was accurate about the millions of illegals voting
[40:22.640 --> 40:28.000]  previously, the Democrats planned to federalize through a homeland security, the election
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.120]  and steal it and Trump came out and said, I will stand against you and they choked and
[40:33.120 --> 40:40.080]  then it all came out that they tried and failed, it all came out in their own publications.
[40:40.080 --> 40:47.360]  So the new news is they want to cause a civil war, they want to cause race riots, cop killing,
[40:47.360 --> 40:52.480]  destabilization, they can blame on Trump and have enough fear that we then accept his
[40:52.480 --> 40:58.520]  assassination or he'll have a stroke or something like that or claim he collapsed, he's had
[40:58.520 --> 41:08.200]  a mental breakdown, he's locked up, he disappears into an Air Force Medical Ward, that's all
[41:08.200 --> 41:16.320]  being bandied about right now and then there's the fight by all the scum, the different factions
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.240]  and the Democratic Party and the Republican Party and the multinational conduits and in
[41:20.240 --> 41:31.400]  his own White House, the good Trump, that good camp, the bad McMaster and the ugly Kelly,
[41:31.400 --> 41:35.920]  I don't mean physically ugly, Kelly is an unknown quantity right now, we don't know,
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.600]  Trump has confidence, Kelly delivered on 69% reduction in illegals coming across, bunch
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.880]  of other stuff, he has a good affinity, when I see him with the president I get good vibes,
[41:45.880 --> 41:50.040]  he looks like he admires the president and I don't think you can fake the body language
[41:50.040 --> 41:56.040]  I've seen from General Kelly with Trump, McMaster's day one globalist Wahhabist bad connections,
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.040]  the fourth guy Trump tried to get, who the deep state put on him, a big problem, we have
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.520]  the proof coming up next segment, but the good is Trump, the bad is McMaster, the ugly
[42:05.520 --> 42:11.400]  job is Kelly because he's even having to keep his people's family out right now as they
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.480]  engage in policy, as the globalists try to sabotage policy, they don't know if it's Ivanka,
[42:16.480 --> 42:20.360]  they don't know if it's McMaster, they don't know if it's Jared, they don't know if it's
[42:20.360 --> 42:26.440]  Bannon, they don't know who it is, Kelly has the White House Oval Office completely isolated
[42:26.440 --> 42:31.840]  to finally find out who the leaks are.
[42:31.840 --> 42:40.920]  So we're going to find out, I'm not saying Kelly's a saint, my gut level tells me, that
[42:40.920 --> 42:46.080]  time will tell, but I just, it's too soon to say but I have a good feeling overall,
[42:46.080 --> 42:48.720]  but that said, I don't operate on feelings, it's just they're always right, but I just
[42:48.720 --> 42:51.560]  always disregard them, I'll go off the evidence as it arrives.
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.880]  Now we're going to come back and lay all this out, how we stopped them having civil war,
[42:55.880 --> 43:01.160]  how we stopped them killing Trump, how you stopped them and how we have victory.
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.400]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue Florida toothpaste is now
[43:04.400 --> 43:09.520]  back in stock at m4store.com, the first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week, I thought
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.160]  it would be a six month supply for listeners, and since then people are beating down our
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.720]  doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[43:16.720 --> 43:19.800]  Research across the board is clear, in fact it's certified.
[43:19.800 --> 43:23.680]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.320]  clots and heart attacks, that's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[43:28.320 --> 43:31.960]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.240]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula, it's loaded with
[43:35.240 --> 43:38.440]  good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[43:38.440 --> 43:44.080]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients, uses Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[43:44.080 --> 43:45.480]  and eliminate bad breath.
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.880]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[43:49.880 --> 43:53.000]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[44:10.240 --> 44:14.280]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[44:14.280 --> 44:18.640]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.960]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[45:02.520 --> 45:04.520]  Dr. Griff, you developed Living Defense for us.
[45:04.520 --> 45:05.800]  It took you over a year to do it.
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.000]  Why is this so good?
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.280]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[45:12.280 --> 45:17.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.240]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[45:23.240 --> 45:25.800]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[45:25.800 --> 45:29.560]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[45:29.560 --> 45:32.120]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[45:32.120 --> 45:33.400]  These are all parasites.
[45:33.400 --> 45:35.880]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.160]  You have the neem in there.
[45:37.160 --> 45:40.360]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[45:40.360 --> 45:43.640]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[45:43.640 --> 45:43.880]  All right.
[45:43.880 --> 45:46.680]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[45:46.680 --> 45:47.800]  It just came back in yesterday.
[45:47.800 --> 45:49.720]  Living Defense, m4ware'slife.com.
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.320]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.680]  And you support the broadcast, m4ware'slife.com.
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.920]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[45:58.920 --> 46:24.920]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[46:58.920 --> 47:01.800]  That's m4warestore.com.
[47:29.080 --> 47:33.000]  All right.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.440]  We have the top Democrats, the top Rhino Republicans out there saying remove Trump.
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.520]  We've got Madonna and Cowell's others saying kill him, blow up the White House.
[47:42.520 --> 47:48.440]  We've got elite policy papers like Atlantic Monthly and others saying remove him using
[47:48.440 --> 47:51.000]  martial law under continuity of government.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.080]  Have new elections run by Homeland Security by the Democrats.
[47:55.080 --> 48:00.600]  Remove all the Republicans, including in state houses, that got elected saying it's all Russian.
[48:01.880 --> 48:07.480]  This is so outrageous that all 50, you can search into that, all 50 Attorney Generals
[48:08.040 --> 48:14.040]  sent a letter to Obama before he left saying, please rescind your executive order.
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.520]  Saying that you're federalizing elections.
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.600]  Now they've moved on to saying we're about to remove him the next month or two.
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.640]  This week, this week marks two weeks since this started.
[48:28.920 --> 48:32.840]  So they said two weeks ago, what names?
[48:32.840 --> 48:40.040]  Clapper, Brennan, Al Gore, others that within a month or two where the steps are being taken
[48:40.040 --> 48:46.520]  to remove Trump outside of the Constitution, outside of impeachment in the House and the Senate,
[48:46.520 --> 48:49.720]  you indict in the House, try on the Senate, outside of all this.
[48:50.440 --> 48:51.640]  They don't have the votes to do it.
[48:51.640 --> 48:55.160]  Trump has the legislative, the executive, the judicial, though just barely.
[48:56.840 --> 48:59.800]  It's all in Kit Daniels article on infowars.com.
[49:00.760 --> 49:04.360]  And the reason it's important is it's not just Democrats saying let's have a civil emergency,
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.080]  let's have civil war, let's kill everybody, let's take over.
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.080]  It's Savage.
[49:09.720 --> 49:15.000]  Michael Savage, Dr. Savage, smart guy saying the American people, if you try this Democrats,
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.120]  I'm warning you, I'm going to play some clips next hour.
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.440]  I'm warning you, people are going to stand up against you.
[49:22.440 --> 49:29.720]  So yes, we're hoping to peacefully fix this through information warfare, through the truth,
[49:29.720 --> 49:30.840]  our big weapon.
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.560]  It's how little old info wars, though we reach millions a day, we're still small compared to
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.360]  the whole fleet of mainstream media together.
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.200]  They're all small now, but together they're quite large still, putting out hoaxes,
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.200]  putting out racism, putting out lies, putting out, you know, globalism.
[49:46.200 --> 49:49.320]  But because of you, the audience taking action, we're formidable.
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.760]  And now you hear Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh.
[49:54.600 --> 49:56.440]  I was told about it yesterday and I went and looked at it.
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.680]  I mean, Friday, Sean Hannity was like info wars, even the Washington Post wrote about it.
[50:00.680 --> 50:02.840]  But it's not that Hannity's even getting it from me.
[50:02.840 --> 50:04.040]  It's what's happening.
[50:06.200 --> 50:08.760]  So Savage says, what is going to happen in this country?
[50:09.560 --> 50:11.800]  You have not seen mob violence in this country.
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.480]  You've seen some mob violence against instigated by Soros mobs.
[50:15.480 --> 50:18.520]  You haven't seen anything I'm telling you is coming to this country.
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.080]  You haven't seen the day of the locust yet.
[50:22.040 --> 50:25.160]  Then he lays out what's going to happen.
[50:26.600 --> 50:29.800]  You can look at the demographics of countries like Venezuela that were prosperous,
[50:30.520 --> 50:33.720]  somewhat right wing, went left wing, collapsed, fell apart.
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.800]  Demographically, people went communist.
[50:36.520 --> 50:37.960]  There's really no coming back from that.
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.400]  They're in a civil war right now.
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.320]  Government collapse, martial law.
[50:41.320 --> 50:50.280]  Here, you can have a populist, hardcore, focused, armed population of 15 percent.
[50:50.280 --> 50:53.480]  And even if a fraction of them fight back during civil war, we win.
[50:53.480 --> 50:58.120]  I mean, we have like 50 percent or somewhat awake, hardcore and armed.
[51:01.560 --> 51:05.960]  That's 50 percent are armed and hardcore, like 70 percent are armed now.
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.480]  That's the biggest demographic shift is liberals are going out and buying guns.
[51:09.480 --> 51:14.360]  They think for right wingers, but they're joining us in waking up,
[51:14.360 --> 51:17.240]  being individualists in that very process.
[51:17.240 --> 51:19.720]  I talked to all the gun shops here locally.
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.360]  I talked to them nationally and they say, oh, it's almost all liberals.
[51:23.560 --> 51:26.040]  And the process of coming in, getting a gun, getting training,
[51:26.040 --> 51:28.040]  being scared of the right wing gun instructor.
[51:28.040 --> 51:31.800]  They finally wake up and have like cathartic epithenies and go, oh my gosh,
[51:31.800 --> 51:32.520]  you're not right wing.
[51:32.520 --> 51:33.400]  You're not left wing.
[51:34.040 --> 51:37.400]  You know, when they meet the lesbian, you know, gun instructor,
[51:37.400 --> 51:38.200]  who isn't liberal?
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.080]  Who isn't conservative?
[51:39.080 --> 51:43.160]  They're just pro self-defense and the whole paradigm caves in.
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.600]  And that's why the globalist had to stop it,
[51:48.600 --> 51:51.320]  because the Democrats have extincted their own party.
[51:51.320 --> 51:52.920]  They've discredited themselves.
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.640]  Even if they kill Trump, kill me, you're already awake.
[51:57.640 --> 52:00.040]  You know what's going on better than I do in many cases.
[52:00.040 --> 52:03.480]  And the idea is out there and people understand what's going on.
[52:03.480 --> 52:09.240]  And there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[52:09.240 --> 52:13.800]  They confiscated in the last 50 years, 99% of the guns for the Venezuelan people.
[52:15.880 --> 52:21.080]  1960s, they were as rich as we were, populist country, armed, free market,
[52:21.080 --> 52:21.800]  based on that.
[52:21.800 --> 52:24.200]  And then they listened to the siren song of socialism.
[52:25.640 --> 52:28.680]  And they told the middle class, oh, it's too bad you're wealthy.
[52:28.680 --> 52:29.400]  Give up your money.
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.760]  Give up free market for the poor, you know, villagers.
[52:32.760 --> 52:34.040]  And the villagers bought into it.
[52:34.040 --> 52:35.880]  And then they blew up the golden goose.
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.720]  They slit the golden goose's throat.
[52:37.720 --> 52:39.560]  They gobbled down the meat.
[52:39.560 --> 52:40.520]  And then the goose is gone.
[52:41.320 --> 52:41.800]  It's gone.
[52:42.840 --> 52:47.400]  And now your country's burning down, even though you are rich in gold,
[52:47.400 --> 52:50.920]  rich in minerals, rich in rubies and emeralds and diamonds,
[52:50.920 --> 52:54.440]  and rich in trees, and rich in culture,
[52:54.440 --> 52:57.960]  and rich in oil and natural gas, and on and on and on and on.
[52:57.960 --> 52:59.960]  Venezuela has as much oil as the US.
[52:59.960 --> 53:06.360]  But you can't feed your people, because communism doesn't feed anybody,
[53:06.360 --> 53:07.800]  but evil globalists.
[53:09.160 --> 53:12.040]  So here's the big takeaway.
[53:12.680 --> 53:16.680]  There's an article by Kit Daniels that has been the top political story
[53:16.680 --> 53:19.880]  since Matt Drudge linked to it on Friday.
[53:21.560 --> 53:23.720]  And Drudge has linked to a lot of our stuff over the years,
[53:23.720 --> 53:25.640]  and some of it goes big, some of it doesn't.
[53:25.640 --> 53:28.280]  But Drudge is the biggest window into the media,
[53:28.280 --> 53:33.320]  the biggest stargate to really push something out to the next level there is.
[53:34.200 --> 53:35.960]  It's the biggest website in the world.
[53:35.960 --> 53:37.400]  It's like number two or three total.
[53:37.400 --> 53:39.320]  But when it comes to news, it's number one.
[53:39.320 --> 53:43.560]  It's in the top three total sites in the world, not new sites, all sites.
[53:43.560 --> 53:44.440]  Number one new site.
[53:45.720 --> 53:48.280]  And it went super, super crazy to them.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.360]  The link went off a few hours ago.
[53:50.920 --> 53:52.840]  It's probably the biggest Drudge link we've ever had.
[53:53.640 --> 53:56.600]  I mean, as of this morning, I made some calls.
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.440]  Four million independent IP addresses clicked on our story.
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.320]  Four million.
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.040]  And then they spread it and they posted it.
[54:04.040 --> 54:06.360]  And this will be the talk of talk radio this week.
[54:06.360 --> 54:10.440]  You know how satisfied I am when they tried to block their plan
[54:10.440 --> 54:11.800]  to steal the nomination from Trump.
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.280]  And I made phone calls and did some things.
[54:14.280 --> 54:16.760]  But didn't get through the president that day,
[54:16.760 --> 54:17.800]  but he did watch the video.
[54:17.800 --> 54:21.000]  And a month later called me and we had a little talk about it.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.840]  And I only say that to rub it in the globalist face.
[54:22.840 --> 54:27.320]  And then he went out, fought back against it and got the nomination.
[54:27.320 --> 54:29.320]  And the same thing with trying to steal the electors.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.960]  And the same thing with claiming nobody came to his crowds or whatever.
[54:33.960 --> 54:37.160]  And now they want to openly talk about killing him, overthrowing him.
[54:37.160 --> 54:40.120]  They want to go shop it around Congress, how they're going to do it.
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.800]  And then think we're not going to have congressmen on about it.
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.480]  We're not going to have witnesses on about it.
[54:46.040 --> 54:48.920]  We're not going to have black ops, army colonels on about it.
[54:48.920 --> 54:50.840]  You don't think Lou Dobbs isn't going to talk about it.
[54:50.840 --> 54:52.760]  And Colonel Shafer isn't going to talk about it.
[54:52.760 --> 54:54.280]  And Rush Limbaugh, I'm going to talk about it.
[54:54.280 --> 54:56.280]  And Michael Savage isn't going to talk about it.
[54:56.280 --> 54:58.040]  And you don't think that's going to happen.
[55:01.800 --> 55:03.480]  And we blew you wide open.
[55:03.480 --> 55:05.400]  Our audience got that article out.
[55:05.400 --> 55:06.280]  Judge got it out.
[55:06.280 --> 55:07.960]  And now it's in the zeitgeist.
[55:08.520 --> 55:12.120]  The number one political story, the number three story on Facebook,
[55:12.120 --> 55:14.600]  Twitter, Google, number three story total.
[55:16.200 --> 55:21.640]  Number one political, Kit Daniels, down your reactor shaft.
[55:21.640 --> 55:23.640]  Boom. How does it feel?
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.600]  You have been fighting around the clock
[55:26.600 --> 55:28.840]  to run around in your demographic publications
[55:28.840 --> 55:31.080]  where you know no libertarians or conservatives read it
[55:31.080 --> 55:34.360]  saying Kelly murdering, removing black ops, we're ready
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.480]  to try to legitimize it to all your own people in government
[55:37.480 --> 55:38.920]  who are scared to do it,
[55:38.920 --> 55:41.400]  scared to commit the crime outside the Constitution.
[55:41.400 --> 55:43.080]  You don't want to have a debate.
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.760]  While you're organizing the people for the violent coup
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.880]  and now a big giant 10 trillion Cubans spotlight,
[55:51.880 --> 55:54.600]  just hit your ass like your Count Dracula
[55:55.560 --> 55:57.000]  in the middle of the Sahara Desert,
[55:57.560 --> 56:01.480]  in the middle of the afternoon, and you are on fire.
[56:01.480 --> 56:03.240]  You are burning down.
[56:03.240 --> 56:08.840]  Your plan for the coup is burning to the ground in front of us.
[56:08.840 --> 56:11.800]  Just like I told everybody how your polls were fake
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.000]  and showed everybody the Google bots and the Facebook bots
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.200]  that oh, only certain corporations have access to.
[56:18.200 --> 56:21.320]  I can't even buy access to it, but we have sources
[56:21.320 --> 56:25.160]  and we broke the Google and the Bloomberg data bots
[56:25.160 --> 56:26.600]  and others picked up on it.
[56:27.720 --> 56:29.720]  Trump was really 15 points ahead,
[56:29.720 --> 56:32.360]  not 15 points behind the AI knows.
[56:32.360 --> 56:32.680]  Yes.
[56:33.960 --> 56:34.440]  Yes.
[56:34.440 --> 56:39.960]  Trump was at like 65 points at his July nomination
[56:40.760 --> 56:42.440]  and he was close to that on the 20th.
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.280]  He's lost about five points.
[56:44.280 --> 56:45.880]  He's down to about 60 right now,
[56:49.400 --> 56:50.680]  with likely voters.
[56:50.680 --> 56:52.920]  It's a little less obviously like 55 or so
[56:52.920 --> 56:56.040]  with the general public that dwarfs the Democrats
[56:56.040 --> 56:59.400]  who have like a 9% approval rating in national polls.
[56:59.400 --> 57:02.520]  Everyone hates that mummy Pelosi stumbling around.
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.960]  We're winning if you simply take action and spread the word
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.480]  and realize what they're doing.
[57:07.480 --> 57:09.800]  Trump has totally carried the country on his back
[57:09.800 --> 57:13.320]  and delivered on crushing globalism,
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.800]  defending free speech, getting jobs,
[57:15.800 --> 57:17.960]  getting the stock market up, trying to get small business
[57:17.960 --> 57:18.440]  loans.
[57:18.440 --> 57:21.960]  He's protecting our borders and people that want
[57:21.960 --> 57:24.520]  instant gratification and are bitching your crazy.
[57:25.160 --> 57:27.320]  Speaking of support, we need your support
[57:27.320 --> 57:28.920]  at infowarstore.com.
[57:28.920 --> 57:29.880]  The enemy hates it.
[57:30.840 --> 57:32.120]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.440]  We've got a lot of big specials running.
[57:34.440 --> 57:36.680]  We call it the 1776 specials.
[57:36.680 --> 57:38.680]  The biggest specials ever on brain force
[57:38.680 --> 57:39.160]  are amazing.
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.960]  Neutropic, it's 1776 right now.
[57:41.960 --> 57:43.320]  But regardless, you can't lose.
[57:43.320 --> 57:44.920]  Just buy a bottle of it today.
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.120]  A Hillary from prison shirt.
[57:46.120 --> 57:47.800]  You name it and support the transmission.
[57:47.800 --> 57:49.000]  Whatever you do, spread the word.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.440]  Hour number two is coming up.
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.480]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer
[57:53.480 --> 57:55.080]  of news and information.
[57:55.080 --> 57:58.440]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[57:58.440 --> 58:01.480]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[58:01.480 --> 58:04.760]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors,
[58:04.760 --> 58:08.040]  in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[58:08.040 --> 58:11.240]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[58:11.240 --> 58:13.720]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[58:13.720 --> 58:14.680]  and then processing.
[58:14.680 --> 58:17.160]  And so I set out to develop Caveman,
[58:17.160 --> 58:20.760]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.640]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[58:25.640 --> 58:28.360]  and supercharging the body at the same time.
[58:28.360 --> 58:30.760]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.200]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face
[58:34.200 --> 58:36.840]  of the complete media assault and winning
[58:36.840 --> 58:38.360]  because of your support.
[58:38.360 --> 58:41.240]  Caveman is finally back at the Info Wars store.
[58:41.240 --> 58:45.000]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.720]  at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free,
[58:47.720 --> 59:09.160]  triple-A-2533139.

[59:19.400 --> 59:23.160]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking,
[59:23.160 --> 59:25.400]  or emergency preparedness.
[59:25.400 --> 59:28.600]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal.
[59:28.600 --> 59:30.680]  You got yourself an entire meal.
[59:32.040 --> 59:33.080]  Now that looks good.
[59:33.720 --> 59:36.760]  Go to infowarstore.com for more details
[59:36.760 --> 59:41.080]  and see how you can become the master outdoor chef
[59:41.080 --> 59:44.600]  and enjoy cooking freedom with the Eco Zoom
[59:44.600 --> 59:48.120]  versus outdoor stove available right now
[59:48.120 --> 59:51.160]  at youguestitinfowarstore.com.
[59:54.040 --> 59:57.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.160 --> 01:00:15.560]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news,
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.400]  coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.640]  There is a fire, a fire of liberty,
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.960]  a fire of free will that only God can give.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.200]  And once you are infected with that great fire,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.760]  there is no turning back.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.280]  There is no longer any fear, except the fear
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.840]  of not delivering freedom, except the fear of not wrapping
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.240]  your hands around the throat of the globalist
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.680]  and squeezing till their metaphysical eyes
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.960]  pop out of their foreheads.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.600]  And right now, those eyes are just about to come out.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.440]  Those eyes are ripe.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.960]  You're driving me crazy.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.960]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.520]  Come on and burn them.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:22.520]  It's time to burn them.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.640]  Let's go ahead and go to this report.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.440]  We are taking a stand.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.160]  This culture of leaking must stop.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.520]  Newly anointed Chief of Staff John Kelly
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.560]  contacted beleaguered Attorney General Jeff Sessions
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.320]  to tell him his job was safe
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.240]  after Trump criticized Sessions
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.600]  for ignoring the White House leakers and the DNC server.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.640]  Following Kelly's reassurance, President Trump tweeted
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.760]  after many years of leaks going on in Washington,
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.400]  it is great to see the AG taking action
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.120]  for national security, the tougher the better.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.560]  First, let me say that I strongly agree with the president
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.120]  and condemn in the strongest terms
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.080]  the staggering number of leaks undermining
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.920]  the ability of our government to protect this country.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.320]  Just yesterday, we saw reports in the media
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.960]  about conversations the president had with foreign leaders.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.480]  No one is entitled to surreptitiously fight
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.960]  to advance battles in the media
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.480]  by revealing sensitive government information.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.120]  In the first six months of this administration,
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.240]  the Department of Justice has already received
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.960]  nearly as many criminal referrals
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.360]  involving unauthorized disclosures of classified information
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.880]  as we received in the previous three years combined.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.880]  Criminals who had illegally used their access
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.040]  to our most sensitive information
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.680]  to endanger our national security
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.080]  are in fact being investigated and will be prosecuted.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.800]  Since January, the Department has more than triple
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.600]  the number of active leak investigations
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.520]  compared to the number pending
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.640]  at the end of the last administration.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.480]  And we've already charged four people
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.920]  with unlawfully disclosing classified material
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.200]  or with concealing contacts with federal officers.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.200]  I stand here today as their leader
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.840]  to express our grave concern
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.600]  that unauthorized disclosures of classified material
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.360]  and damaging our mission
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.480]  and jeopardizing the safety and security
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480]  of the American public.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.680]  In the last several years,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.240]  the U.S. intelligence community has experienced
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.560]  some of the worst compromises
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.160]  of classified information in our nation's history.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.480]  Those disclosures have been disseminated
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.080]  to both the media and to our foreign adversaries.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.040]  Leftist media's use of White House leakers
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.800]  has become normalized by outlets like The Washington Post
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.640]  as the national review reports.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.720]  The reports read like parody.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.640]  The Washington Post's in-depth story on the Comey firing
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.360]  was based on the private accounts
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.720]  of more than 30 officials at the White House,
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.960]  the Justice Department, the FBI,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.680]  and on Capitol Hill as well as Trump Confidanced
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.440]  and other senior Republicans.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.600]  These confidential conversations that he had
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.680]  with Mexico and Australia
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.240]  that were just illegally leaked to The Washington Post.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240]  There's a lot of Democrats that are disturbed by this
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.400]  because it threatens our national security.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.280]  Are you disturbed by it?
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.560]  No, not at all.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.520]  I am so glad they're telling us what's going on.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.240]  And it is...
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.600]  We don't need to hear these conversations.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.640]  They're confidential.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.360]  I need to hear these conversations.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.560]  I need to hear...
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.880]  Backstabbing in D.C. is an unethical constant.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.640]  As Obama loyalists and those out to save their own necks
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.720]  politically struggle internally
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.560]  while threatening the security
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.960]  of the executive office and the nation.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.440]  Round up the leakers, post-haste.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.760]  Millions of Americans want to move forward
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.000]  on making America great again.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.320]  John Bound reporting for Infowords.com.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.680]  As most of you already know,
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.960]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.320]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.360]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.720]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors,
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.000]  in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.200]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.600]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.560]  and then processing.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.120]  And so I set out to develop Caveman,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.720]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.600]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.320]  and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.720]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.160]  We're getting results.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.920]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.320]  and winning because of your support.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.200]  Caveman is finally back at the Infowar store.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.960]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.680]  At Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:27.400]  triple-A, 253-3139.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.000]  That's right.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.760]  Austin is officially a UN sister city program.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.520]  There's only two US cities that are called Minialization.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.200]  The city takes its directives from the UN.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.320]  And just eight months ago, the outgoing Loretta Lynch
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.480]  had the Strong Cities Initiative saying
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.200]  our police departments would be under UN control.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.720]  And Austin had volunteered to be part of it.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.200]  Can't make that up.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.800]  All right, in this second hour, I normally take phone calls,
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.720]  but today we're not going to because I
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.680]  wanted to read from memos and documents and play interviews
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.000]  that have really gotten no play with some of the people
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.640]  that General McMaster of the National Security Council
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.560]  has fired and said he fired because they wrote memos
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.320]  three years ago, two years ago, a year ago,
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.040]  pointing out that George Soros and radical leftists
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.720]  were funding an ally with radical Islam, which is a fact.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.040]  I mean, we've tracked their own statements that they're
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.160]  doing this.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:34.680]  And McMaster is saying he's firing anybody who wasn't
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:41.480]  on a list of Obama supporters.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.200]  Let me explain.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.640]  A list got created, Drudge has a link to it,
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.040]  of people that were Obama holdouts and who were anti-Trump.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.200]  And a list got put around.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.480]  And so McMaster is using it as a list of anybody not
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.520]  on the fire list is to be fired.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.560]  And I've been hearing McMaster has been bad for a while
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.160]  as soon as he got in there back in April.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.240]  But man, is it documented now?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.440]  Is it documented now?
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.680]  And it is the feud between Bannon and McMaster.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.720]  So overall, Bannon is a brother in the fight
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.960]  against the globalist.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.360]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.560]  Now, let's go ahead and plow into what's coming up.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.960]  You just joined us.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.040]  We laid out how they tried to stop Trump getting in illegally,
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:30.960]  how that failed.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.640]  They had it all ready to deny his electors.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.240]  Months after I broke it, it was in even the New York
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.840]  Times last week and New York Post and others
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.160]  that he had a martial law plan in the weeks
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.280]  after the election.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.600]  But they choked.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.160]  That's right.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.080]  Obama had a civil emergency plan, quote,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.000]  martial law, that's in the documents.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.480]  Just type in, Obama had martial law planned after election.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.320]  He had the FBI tracking, quote, all the anti-Hillary sites
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.280]  and looking at them for arrest.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.280]  Well, I mean, why not?
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280]  I mean, they're just going for broke.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.120]  They've rewritten the rules of succession.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.800]  Now they got a plan to remove Trump.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.760]  But what they don't want is the exposure.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.920]  Just type in, Obama had troops ready for day after the election.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.600]  So he had all this ready and signed an executive order
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.000]  to federalize it and take it from Trump.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.960]  But he choked.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.600]  A lot of it was because Hillary was so drunk
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.280]  and so drugged out an election night from stress
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.640]  that she was just howling, screaming, and going insane.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.320]  And remember, couldn't be seen for over a day.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.200]  And we broke the fact that she was collapsing.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.040]  And they're just like, she's collapsed.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.400]  She's completely insane, throwing temper tantrums.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.440]  No, we're done.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.120]  The public won't put up with it.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.400]  Let them get in, claim these are Russian, remove them later.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.280]  This is too dangerous.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.320]  All their AI computers showed, it wouldn't work.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.680]  I mean, you understand, folks, you're not getting my opinion.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.640]  You are getting the absolute breakdown
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.160]  from all our sources, previously, currently, and also
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.720]  my analysis, which is proven to be devastatingly untarget.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.800]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.920]  It's why I'm so hated.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.040]  But I am an idiot savant when it comes
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.960]  to studying their operations.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.120]  Or so I'd like to believe.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  Once you actually start studying it, it becomes crystal clear.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.080]  Now, they're coming out now saying, I'm nuts, just
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.800]  like I was nuts every other step of the way,
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.600]  if we're saying two plus two equals four.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.880]  Deep State's going to kill the president, Alan Shum's claims
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.600]  Newsweek, never showing anything where I showed the proof,
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.560]  just like I've just shown you in the last hour, all of the proof.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.200]  They attacked me and say, oh, I've
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.800]  changed my mind because they were
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.600]  trying to stop him during the election
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.840]  and during the inauguration.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.760]  And since I've been warning the whole time trying to stop it,
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.400]  so they show clips, we'll have time to monitor the week
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.600]  they show to play all this, where, oh, he changed his mind.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.400]  They were going to steal the nomination,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.240]  but that didn't work.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.360]  And then they were going to steal the seating
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.040]  of the delegates, but that didn't work.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.040]  And then they were going to do it then, but, oh, now he says
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.760]  it's happening, yeah, because we keep beating you.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.600]  But you were calling for it, and all our listeners remember it,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.960]  and we have the news articles where you shed it
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.440]  and where you did it.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.320]  I have a skeleton crew on Sunday, but tomorrow we're
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.200]  going to show Newsweek's video report where they say,
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:33.800]  I'm insane.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.280]  There's no plan to kill the president, overthrow him,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.160]  COG removing, and then I'm going to show all the places
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.280]  where, when I said you were going to do it a few weeks
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.760]  after you admitted it, but then you always, like a villain,
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.200]  reorganize and come back.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.360]  And then I'm going to show all the different globalists,
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.560]  the Democrats, from Al Gore to Brennan and Clapper,
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.760]  saying exactly what I said and what my guest said
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.480]  months, weeks, and days before.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.560]  See, why do you think Clapper and Brennan came out and said,
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.960]  yeah, we're getting ready to remove him
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.080]  in the next few months outside of the Constitution.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.280]  And even Wolf Blitzer was like, what?
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.560]  The Constitution.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.640]  I mean, even Blitzer didn't want to be involved in some just
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.440]  outrageous stuff like this.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.080]  Yes, Wolf.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.280]  We've got it organized and bipartisan.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.400]  It's got to be done, Wolf.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.000]  There it is.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.760]  Former CIA director calls for coup.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.560]  So this is all going on, and they
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.640]  don't want to have a debate about it,
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.920]  but they want to run with stories of me opposing it
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.280]  to the readers to get them used to hearing it.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.320]  Oh, we're not going to remove him,
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.240]  but look at all these articles about it.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.880]  Meanwhile, in the policy reports,
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.280]  they're all admitting the plan.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.240]  So Savage is right.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.480]  What are we going to do if they launch it and do kill him?
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.960]  Because we know we can't give up then.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.680]  I mean, the sky's the limit of what they're going to do.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.480]  They know they've politically lost everyone.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.040]  They know there's been a realignment against them.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.920]  They know people are aware of them.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.920]  So what are they going to do?
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.520]  They want to shut down free speech,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.200]  sew things up, use the police state that Brennan and Clapper
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.920]  were over to submit that control over all of us.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.480]  But as long as we're aware of it and don't care,
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.120]  there's nothing they can do if we all resist them,
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.760]  even politically and economically, we will destroy them.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:26.080]  Because in 21st century warfare, in just-in-time delivery
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.200]  and high-tech systems, you stop buying from Amazon.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.080]  You stop going along with globalist programs.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.720]  You stop buying big corporate.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.760]  You stop watching CNN, which you've already done.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.600]  They're done.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.840]  See, in an information war, in a cyber war,
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.160]  all of you are powerful bots in that fight,
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.880]  not committing criminal hacking,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.880]  but simply speaking out against them
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.720]  and removing your support from them
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.880]  and supporting the patriotic,
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.800]  Americana Renaissance opposition, i.e. infowars.com.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.960]  i.e. DrudgeReport.com, i.e. WorldNetDaily,
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.160]  i.e. Daily Caller, i.e. Not Fox News.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.120]  You watch Fox now.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.640]  It's all backhanded attacks on the president,
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.920]  sneaky attacks, going along with stuff,
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.360]  just keeping you there as opposition control
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.840]  so they can deep-six the country.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.800]  It's gone other than Sean Hannity and a few other hosts.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.200]  It's wrecked.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.520]  And they want to get rid of Hannity
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.920]  because they know the president's so isolated now,
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.080]  the pinhole he's got is Sean Hannity.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.720]  But we fired up the bat signal
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.520]  and Hannity's doing the right thing,
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.240]  doing his own research, his own intel.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.120]  Limbaugh's coming out saying they're shopping to generals
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.040]  to overthrow Trump last week, martial law, civil war.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.120]  It doesn't matter because Limbaugh, infowars, Hannity,
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.360]  all of us dwarf CNN and Newsweek
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.040]  and all the rest of the King's Horses
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.960]  and all the rest of Soros' men.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.200]  So when we come back, former FBI agent,
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.000]  high-level warrants McMaster is the enemy camp,
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.120]  amazing research, because I was doing all the steep research
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.680]  and then just ran into these folks that had the whole thing.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.800]  And I know David Horowitz and Front Page are smart,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.920]  but man, the more research I do,
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.160]  the more I realize they are just on target.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.360]  The problem is they're focusing only on some areas
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.960]  I've got knowledge they don't have,
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.400]  they've got knowledge I don't have.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.240]  We put it together.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.080]  It's incredible.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.120]  Wait till I get to that.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.160]  We're going to let you know
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.280]  one of the guys he purged, all these patriots,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.640]  all these war heroes, all these top analysts at the Pentagon
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.160]  that helped defeat ISIS in al-Qaeda.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.280]  McMaster purges the NSC staffer
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.640]  for warning of Islamists's leftist nexus.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.800]  It's a 30-minute interview.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.160]  It's in Kit Daniels article on infowars.com.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.000]  We're going to air large sections of this interview
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  from a year ago, but he hadn't been seen publicly since.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.240]  He just got fired last week.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.840]  Rich Higgins, we're going to play that.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.840]  We're going to get to so much about Islamists
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.280]  and so much about how to defeat these people.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.200]  Because again, exposing their program,
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.280]  exposing it before they launch it,
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.440]  destroys it on the launch pad.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.600]  Please listen carefully,
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.640]  because I'm about to point out three things
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.160]  that will save you a lot of money
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.800]  while you get high-quality products
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.280]  and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.200]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout,
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.960]  we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.520]  that are out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.520]  because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.280]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.680]  on all orders above $50.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.960]  Listeners have been requesting this for years
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.840]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840]  that you need each month.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.440]  Just go to infowarsore.com,
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.440]  select your favorite product or products,
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.560]  click on auto-ship and choose how often

[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.240]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win,
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.840]  and with the new auto-ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.320]  this is a sure win.

[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.240]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com,
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.120]  free shipping on orders above $50.

[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.760]  when you sign up for auto-ship.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.960]  Today, I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.440]  of DNA Forces Finally Arrived,
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.400]  the InfoWars warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.880]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.040]  who've signed up for auto-ship
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.440]  to receive auto-stock products like DNA Force,
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.320]  and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.640]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game changer,
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.200]  like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.960]  to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.920]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.040]  of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.920]  systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid,
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.480]  BioPQQ, and many others.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.240]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.800]  175 clinical studies, and just one batch of this stuff
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.960]  costs us more than $30,000.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.640]  Visit infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.280]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force

[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.960]  through our third party certified review agency,

[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.200]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.520]  for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.480]  and flavor?
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.320]  That's right.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.040]  It's the time to build your own food storage
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.280]  with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.560]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.600]  and check out this innovative and smart technology
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.960]  that's easy to use.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.800]  And let me tell you something,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.800]  it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables,
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.600]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.840]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.040]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.800]  like canning or dehydrating,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.680]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.560]  there is no comparison.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.840]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.800]  color, and nutritional value
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.160]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.600]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.800]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best,
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.720]  most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.800]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.600]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.760]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.560]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.800]  Giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.560]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.600]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.080]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.200]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.040]  But in the 21st century,
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.560]  there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:30.040]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.160]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.680]  turn off our hormones,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.360]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.760]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.800]  to create the basic foundation
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.000]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.840]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.960]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.360]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.360]  Live from the infowars.com studios,
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.360]  Live from the infowars.com studios,
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.360]  The war was lost, the treaty signed.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.360]  It was not cut across the land.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.360]  It was not cut across the land.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.360]  It was not cut, though many tried.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.360]  I live among you, well disguised.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.360]  But now that we admit that we were taken over by globalists
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360]  and fraudulent treaties signed,
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.360]  we now have a president who's reversing all that,
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360]  and we've drawn the enemy out.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.360]  They're out in the open trying to defeat nationalism and prosperity.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.360]  They're openly rooting against the stock market
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.360]  and new jobs and factories coming home.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360]  There's huge announcements, Toyota and Mitsubishi
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.360]  and South Korean companies, over a thousand companies,
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360]  every day new announcements.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  And they're desperately trying to shut it down.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.360]  John Gondola was a former high-level FBI agent
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360]  and he runs Understanding the Threat.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.360]  And here he is on syndicated television,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  breaking down McMaster.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360]  Then I'm going to get into the interview
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.360]  with one of the people fired this week
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.360]  at the National Security Council
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.360]  who wrote a powerful memo
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.360]  before he was even in the Trump administration
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.360]  about the left and its alliance with radical Islam.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.360]  And then the WikiLeaks came out confirming all of it,
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.360]  the plan of sorrows to overthrow Israel
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.360]  and put radical Muslims in charge.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.360]  Even Saudi Arabia isn't supporting that on paper
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360]  because they know it will destabilize their nation.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.360]  Say what you want about Israel.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.360]  It's not just pro-Israel, anti-Israel.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.360]  There's different factions.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.360]  And the same factions that want our guns,
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360]  that want to bankrupt our borders,
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360]  that want world government,
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.360]  that want poor third-world populations to control,
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  they're the ones that support the destruction of Israel.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.360]  So you read these documents, this stuff gets deep.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.360]  This is not the stuff you see on CNN or even Fox.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.360]  This is the real world, folks.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.360]  And it's really coming down to the line.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360]  The demographically, the big megabanks
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.360]  have allied with radical Islam which controls Islam.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360]  And I feel sorry for people in Islam
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.360]  because they're totally enslaved.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.360]  And the dominant force of Islam,
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360]  whether it was always like that
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.360]  or it's like that now, doesn't matter.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.360]  Radical Islam runs Islam today and is the orthodoxy.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.360]  And then coming up,
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  McMaster purges NSC staffer for warning
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.360]  it was Lamas' leftist threat,
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.360]  Rich Higgins, a top official of the National Security Council,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360]  high level Pentagon and analyst,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.360]  was fired last month after arguing in a memo
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.360]  that President Trump was under sustained attack.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360]  Now, he'd said this during the campaign, by the way.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360]  He said America was.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  From subversive forces both within and outside,
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360]  the government who are deploying malice tactics
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360]  to defeat President Trump National's agenda.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.360]  Higgins seen as an ally of the White House,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360]  Chief Strategist Steve Bannon,
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  had only served in the council for a couple of months.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:24.360]  And they're getting rid of all these people.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.360]  And they're putting in people like Miss Habib.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.360]  Yes, most of the folks being replaced are Islamic
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  and are openly Islamic.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360]  And say on their Facebook,
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360]  I want to help America understand Islam
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.360]  and accept that Sharia law is constitutional.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.360]  They tell you they're going to put your three-year-old daughter
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360]  in a burqa when she walks around the street.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.360]  I mean, BBC saying women wear burqas.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]  That's coming up.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.360]  I mean, let's go ahead and go to this former senior FBI agent
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:02.360]  breaking this down on the Blazov gang.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360]  Here it is.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.360]  John, really, really troubling developments.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.360]  This National Security Advisor, McMaster,
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.360]  I mean, he just got rid of a hero,
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.360]  such a smart wise man that wrote a memo
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.360]  that was just telling it like it is.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  Tell us what's going on.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.360]  Now, first of all, I'd like to just preview
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360]  when we talk about the National Security Advisor,
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]  the president, General McMaster.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360]  We're talking about an individual
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  who when discussing the jihadi threat,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360]  the terrorist threat,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  says that they use an irreligious view of religion,
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  a made-up or extreme view of religion.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  He won't even use the word Islam to perpetrate violence.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  And that's the first piece.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.360]  So he clearly not only doesn't understand the threat,
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.360]  he's putting forth a narrative that's untrue.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.360]  Now, the reason that this is such,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.360]  the firing of Richard Higgins is so significant
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.360]  is because Richard Higgins is the one guy
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.360]  inside the National Security apparatus
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.360]  that has the deepest understanding of the Islamic threat,
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.360]  how they're working directly with the hard left Marxists,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.360]  and how inside the government this is actually unfolding
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.360]  and how it's actually working.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.360]  And he was trying to, in as clear a language as he could,
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.360]  articulate that threat because this is, in my opinion,
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:38.360]  and clearly in his opinion, this is the game.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.360]  This is the ball game.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.360]  They are trying to rip apart the people inside
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360]  the National Security Council
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.360]  who understand this marriage,
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.360]  what we call red-green accents, hard left Marxists, red,
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  the Islamists, the jihadis, the green,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360]  how they're working together.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360]  And Richard Higgins isn't the first guy,
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  but he, in my opinion, is the most important guy
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360]  that's been fired.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.360]  And I believe this is the most telling firing
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360]  that we have seen in this administration.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.360]  And I believe it puts McMaster, earlier,
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.360]  understanding the threat has said he's unfit for duty.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.360]  In my opinion, he is now standing in the enemy camp
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  because he is refusing to fire people from the Obama
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  administration who are clearly statists,
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  and in many cases, in my opinion, Marxists,
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.360]  who are pushing for an agenda that is counter to the facts
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.360]  and is counter to the National Security of the United States.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.360]  And I spent, I'm almost ashamed, probably eight hours,
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360]  four hours in one stand,
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  the kids went to bed another four or five hours.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.360]  I didn't just read what Front Page Magazine's saying,
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360]  understanding the threat, which is all 100% on target.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.360]  I was blown away.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360]  I went and actually read the papers, watched the clips,
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.360]  read the things of McMaster, all the rest of them.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360]  It's worse than they're saying.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.360]  I used to hear, like, five years ago when he was first
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]  getting into the CIA and the rest of it,
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.360]  that Brennan was a Wahhabist.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.360]  And then I learned it was all true.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  He went to Saudi Arabia, lived there 12 years,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.360]  converted to Islam, made this deal with Obama
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]  to back radical Islam to take over the Middle East,
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  overthrow our allies.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]  And you're just like, whoa.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.360]  But when we come back, because they've fired dozens of people,
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360]  you can't even keep track of it.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  I went into, like, all 18 people that have been fired
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360]  the last three weeks, a bunch of them high level.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360]  I went and looked at all of them yesterday,
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  until I got a headache doing this.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360]  And that's the problem.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360]  Now I'm here on air with all this research.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360]  I mean, how do I even cover this?
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360]  But I'm going to try.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]  We're going to read from the parts of the memo
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  that are not classified.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360]  Because he wrote a memo three years ago.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360]  He wrote one a year ago during the campaign.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360]  There's another one that he got fired for
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.360]  that was to the president.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360]  And we've confirmed.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  They say, don't go to Drudge.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  Don't go to Info Wars.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360]  Don't go to Breitbart.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  He's not going to go to the president
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  while banning the former head of Breitbart.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360]  Right there.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.360]  And he had Trump's overwhelm.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  They're trying to isolate him.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360]  I don't know if it's good that Kelly's in there saying,
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360]  you know, we're going to find the leak or sir.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.360]  It's, first, they do the leaks to make him get isolated.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  And then now he's isolated and he can't see any of this material.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.360]  But I don't have any evidence.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]  Kelly's bad yet.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  So will.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  He looked super sincere in the press conferences with Trump
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.360]  and his body language.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.560]  He is being false sincere.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560]  He's a very good fool.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:33.480]  So my gut tells me he's being sincere, but McMaster has just raged, you know, little
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.000]  pee-pee syndrome the whole time, just, you know, wants to take over, thinks Trump's an
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  idiot.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  And it's confirmed.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.840]  He talks trash about Trump to the media, big leaker.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.400]  He gets off of them, patting him on the head.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.600]  Here's some more alcohol, general.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.000]  But when we come back, you're going to get big excerpts of the Higgins memo that got
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  him fired.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  You talk about powerful.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.240]  Then we're going to play some of the, the only interview with Higgins straight ahead.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.240]  Stay with us infowars.com spread that link.

[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.920]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.640]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.120]  to detoxify the body.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.520]  It's made in the USA.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:23.440]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.280]  the body and it supports the info war.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.520]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:32.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.680]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.680]  get.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.920]  You owe it to your health, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.920]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:51.160]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  prayers together.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  We're changing the world.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.280]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.160]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.160]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.000]  It's the air we're breathing.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  Only for our children.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:14.080]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.040]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.440]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:27.520]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.840]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.880]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.880]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.080]  The general public doesn't.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.640]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.400]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:04.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:20.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.040]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.240]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:37.080]  If you have seen this, I don't want to blindside you with this, this is the latest statement,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:42.960]  latest tweet, as you were just saying, President-elect's latest unsolicited pronouncement on the intelligence
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.960]  community.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.560]  This was his tweet just a little while ago tonight, you see the scare quotes there.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.840]  The intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.240]  time needed to build a case.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.760]  Very strange, we're actually told intelligence sources tell NBC News since this tweet has
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:02.920]  been posted that actually this intelligence briefing for the President-elect was always
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.080]  planned for Friday, it hasn't been delayed.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.240]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:15.320]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320]  at you.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.760]  So, even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.760]  this.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.760]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were-
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:31.120]  I don't know, but from what I've been told, they are very upset with how he has treated
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.800]  them and talked about them.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.600]  And we need the intelligence community, we don't know, look at the Russian hacking.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.840]  Without the intelligence community, we wouldn't have discovered it.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.840]  Yeah, as if the intelligence community is represented by Chuck E. Schumer.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:50.240]  The globalists, the blue bloods on top though, we know they represent the big banks.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.240]  As if the American people's election didn't matter, it's all the poor little intelligence
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.240]  community.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.920]  Let's feed them with a little silver spoon and wipe their bottoms and tuck them in at
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.320]  night because they're little babies and we all work for them, just like the folks work
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:11.840]  for the intelligence community and a bunch of other clowns in North Korea or Venezuela.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.960]  So they're preparing this coup, they're saying they're preparing it.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.480]  Story by Kit Daniels is up on infowars.com, I had him repost it at the top, top story
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.680]  this weekend, political news.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.680]  The plan for civil war, the plan to kill Trump, they're all admitting it.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.440]  They hope you don't go read the story where it has them on video preparing it.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.040]  You say, well, why are they public if they don't want it known?
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.840]  They want to communicate it to their people and their demographics.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:46.960]  They want to act confident in a few news areas to show people in government, see we're going
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.480]  to kill him, everybody's on board, see Brennan went on the Aspen Institute and said we're
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.680]  going to remove him and see Al Gore said it on the Late Late Show, everybody's behind
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680]  it.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.800]  So sign your own death warrant, get on board.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800]  Trump's on his way out.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.000]  Why look, the Republicans are turning against him.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.920]  His poll numbers are down, all the same crap you heard during the election.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:21.040]  But right now, let's go ahead and get to the Higgins memo at the National Security Council
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:24.840]  that he was fired for a week ago that they don't want you to see that's kicked off this
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.840]  latest spat.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:31.480]  I'm going to actually play some of an interview the Daily Caller did a year ago with him.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:37.800]  But let's read some of this because it's so powerful excerpts from the Higgins memo top
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.120]  level advisors, strategists, respective Pentagon excerpts from Higgins memo.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.200]  You may have heard this before because it's what's happening through the campaign candidate
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:53.480]  Trump tapped into a deep vein of concern among many citizens that America is at risk
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.840]  of slipping away.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.960]  Globalists and Islamists recognize that for their visions to succeed, America both as
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.880]  an idea and as a national political identity must be destroyed.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.840]  Islamist ally with cultural Marxists because as far back as the 1980s, they properly assessed
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:20.640]  that the left has a strong chance of reducing Western civilization to its benefit.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.000]  Having co-opted postmodern narratives as critical points, Islamists will co-opt the movement
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.280]  in its entirety at some point in the future.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:36.640]  Note, communists take over a Russian revolution against the Czar's, North Vietnamese against
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:43.880]  the South, Maoists against the Democratic forces, against the Chinese dynasty.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.320]  Political warfare attacks a primer.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.640]  As used here, political warfare is not concerned.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:55.760]  Activists associated with the American political process, but rather exclusively refers to
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.640]  political warfare as understood by the Maoist insurgency model.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.840]  Political warfare is one of the five components of the Maoist insurgency.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.120]  These methodologies are described to synchronize the violence and nonviolent actions.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:14.880]  This approach envisions the direct use of nonviolent operations, artists and tactics
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:20.360]  as elements of the combat power and modest insurgencies in the Maoist system.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:26.320]  The formation of a counter state, this is the key right here, listen carefully, they're
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.560]  already forming the counter state but don't want you to debate it or discuss it before
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.560]  it fully launches.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.960]  They don't want it killed in the nest in the womb or before launchpad launch.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.920]  Our entire operation could be called kill launchpad.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:49.520]  This approach envisions the direct use of nonviolent operations, arts and tactics as
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:53.840]  elements of combat power and Maoist insurgencies.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.560]  The formation of a counter state, how many times have I told you this attack profile
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.960]  from my own research is Maoist, I'm sorry, this guy is so on, excuse me, let me continue.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.600]  This approach envisions the direct use of nonviolent operations, artists and tactics
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.320]  as elements of combat power and Maoist insurgencies.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:19.560]  The formation of a counter state is essential to seizing state power.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.480]  See we are forming the own American resistant state against them.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.120]  We can't just trust us seizing control of the state.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:34.160]  We have to form our own state in case we fail this level and it goes the full on revolution
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160]  or civil war.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:41.080]  Then the real muscular fight begins which we will win but will be painful but we have
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:46.880]  to fight it as savagely as we fought the information war and it has to be directed and serious
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:55.160]  and focused and pointed at the head which isn't much of a head I understand.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:05.200]  Acting as a hostile compete stance acting within a existing state, it has a alternative infrastructure.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.960]  Political warfare operation is one of the activities of the counter state.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.480]  Political warfare uses nonviolent methods such as participation that undermines the
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  morals or offers to engage in discussions as a adjunct to violence.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.080]  So they go out and kill a bunch of cops and say oh we'll federalize the cops and then
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.800]  we'll call off the heat from the Soros mobs and stop killing you if you go under Homeland
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:28.800]  Security control.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:34.200]  I mean it's so transparent they even say we're going to kill cops till they shine on the
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.040]  world government and arrest Alex Jones.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.800]  He's like you think they're going to stop once you but lick them?
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.400]  Excuse me I can't handle it anymore.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.320]  Political warfare methods can be implemented as strategic operations or tactical levels
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.320]  of operation.
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.640]  It's 100% documented I just love reading truth.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.520]  Political warfare is warfare.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.800]  Strategic information campaigns designed to delegitimize through disinformation arise
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.880]  out of nonviolent lines of effort in political warfare regimes.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.160]  They run on multiple lines of operations, support the larger nonviolent line of effort,
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.980]  are coordinated with violent lines of effort, and execute political warfare agenda promoting
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:14.920]  cultural Marxist outcomes.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.360]  Saul Olensky is the ball game.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.520]  I added that.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:23.520]  They primarily operate through narratives because the left is aligned with Islamist organizations,
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.600]  local national international levels recognize should be given a recognition be given the
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:34.680]  fact that they seamlessly incorporate through coordinated synchronized interactive narratives.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.160]  These attacks narratives are passive full spectrum institutionalized at all levels.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.560]  They operate in social media television 24 seven news cycles and all media are entrenched
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.800]  at the upper level of bureaucracies.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.360]  Political warfare has been described as propaganda through battle dress.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:57.960]  Now what's amazing is this the strength of the enemy is that it's so centralized and
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.080]  monolithic.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:04.200]  Its weakness is also that I mean you walk into any college course it isn't even on political
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:12.360]  science it's anti-American anti-Christ anti-white anti-free market anti anything.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.080]  I mean you go in there it is wreck these people turn them into desperate jellyfish so they're
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.920]  so desperate they won't want free market and it'll join with our program.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.240]  But because it's so centralized you walk into any other structures it's the same code.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.120]  So it's not hard to sabotage and destroy it by simply reaching out to the lemmings that
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.280]  have been programmed to follow it and explain their slaves.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.520]  Most people will activate immediately with actual human love and the instant recognition
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:46.320]  that you're alive and join the human operation against the AI system that this is and I'm
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.440]  not going to even get into that because I just it's unbelievable.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.960]  We're in the war for human survival right now against AI and against the satanic forces
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.640]  that control the AI system.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.600]  I'm your humble servant Alex Jones transmission continues straight ahead with exclusive interview.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:06.040]  Joe Viggs here with infowars.com today I want to talk to you about guns why we have them
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.160]  why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.920]  is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.600]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.200]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.840]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.800]  dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.360]  No it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.760]  The original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10 of what the constitutional
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.520]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.160]  The bill of rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.320]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not just the rights of actors
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.760]  or editors or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.760]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.480]  A new shipment of bio trusillineum is now available at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.280]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:11.400]  Our one of a kind infowars life bio trusillineum formula is now back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:15.000]  This is the trusillineum formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  core.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.920]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:25.160]  but bio trusillineum is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.680]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:33.080]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.160]  Bio trusillineum is also the perfect supercharger, a survival shield X2 nascent iodine as both
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.560]  help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.840]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of bio trusillineum before we sell it again.

[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.120]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.480]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:24.800]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.760]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.480]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.200]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.880]  research it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.720]  to keep their body going at optimal levels.

[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:12.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:18.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:28.880]  I have to tell you ladies and gentlemen that this is a free will universe and I realize
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:36.760]  that metaphysically we are here giving you this data because God loves you and I am just
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.040]  a humble messenger.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:44.080]  If you don't respond to this information and take action, we're going to lose but I tell
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.920]  you what makes me want to just lock myself in a high tower or a low tower or a basement
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:57.600]  and work on this information is because everything we're doing is devastating the enemy and just
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.120]  from a humble position it makes me think maybe this all is a simulation like Super Deluxe
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:08.320]  says because it's like I say stuff and then it's in the news a day later and it's affecting
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.440]  and we're beating them but it just shows what consciousness is and it's such a blessing.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.240]  The internet was created not to survive nuclear war.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.080]  It's been declassified three years ago.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.960]  I was already told by my sources at the NSA and other agencies years ago was that it
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.200]  was meant to create data points to predict possible futures to then add stimuli to control
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  possible futures.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:42.800]  So they understood the future, they took control of the future.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:52.320]  That's why Obama had that campaign slogan controlling the future or being the future.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.640]  We're involved in some epic things right now and we're being given a choice because I've
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640]  done an analysis.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.920]  If Trump was going sideways for my business it'd be better to ride the fence and attack
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.160]  Democrats and him.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  Everybody else does.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:08.160]  I'm not doing that.
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.160]  This is not a business.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.760]  They could line me up and say, you know, support the new order and pull the trigger.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:20.640]  I'd say pull the damn trigger because my consciousness, my identity being truthful is all I've got
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.520]  and it doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.080]  Doesn't mean I don't get things wrong.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.480]  It doesn't mean that I don't have my own problems but I'm not out to get you and Trump's not
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:37.200]  out to get you and I can't believe how much he's done and the way they spin it and act
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.880]  like he's done bad things and the way they, the research I did on McMaster and all the
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:48.920]  patriots, all the people he's kicked out and the Islamic payroll he's on and it's not about
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:51.280]  some fight over a power structure in the White House.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.920]  It's just, it's just a measure of where we're at as a society and a culture.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.600]  So here's five or six minutes of an interview, the full things on infowars.com, it's been
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.400]  added to the Big Kit Daniels article that's gone viral, thanks to DrudgeReport.com, it's
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:12.520]  so important that I've added to the front page of infowars again from Friday and that's
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.880]  the whole preparation for martial law, civil war and savages, Mike Savage's response to
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.920]  that.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.920]  So here is Rich Higgins, Patriot Pentagon exposing the program, this is him a year ago
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.760]  right after the nightclub pulse shooting, breaking down this wedding between globalism
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  and Islam, here it is.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.040]  The day of the Orlando attacks at the Pulse nightclub, my sister-in-law who's from Florida
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:49.840]  originally called me up, she had friends who had hung out there in years previously and
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:55.320]  for the second time, she now lives in Boston, for the second time she had been touched by
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.480]  terrorism directly, where the Boston Marathon bombing, she had been proximate to it at the
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:05.360]  time the bombing took place, she wasn't actually affected by it, but it was just closed home
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.240]  and then for her to see the second, she called me up and she asked me, Richard are you doing
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.840]  everything you can do, do people really understand this?
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.920]  And I guess with a little bit of self reflection and introspection, I recognize that I do have
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.440]  a unique vantage point from the positions I've occupied in the past in my skill baseline
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.800]  to go forward and hopefully provide for the public and really our policy makers and our
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:33.680]  politicians an alternative approach.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.000]  So why are you coming forward now to talk about this and why do you care?
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:46.240]  2016 from the enemy strategic vantage point is a pivot year, what we've seen in San Bernardino
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:53.360]  and Orlando, just this morning the statistics, in 2016 1,200 people have been killed outside
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:52:01.840]  of Iraq and Syria by operations ISIS is conducting, we're going to continue to see the growth
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:07.520]  in their kinetic attacks and I think our fixation on the kinetic attacks draws us away from the
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:13.000]  strategic perspective we actually have to this, understanding there's a political apparatus
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.800]  behind what's actually transpiring in the world.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.320]  Because of the death, because of the carnage, because of the media coverage associated therewith,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:27.120]  it draws us to fixate on particular points that may or may not lead us to the correct
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:32.640]  strategic conclusions and I think it's really important to come forward with folks who understand
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:37.840]  political warfare, who understand the impetus behind these attacks, the ideological drivers,
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.520]  the political drivers, the social drivers to aptly formulate policy solutions and strategy
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:52.080]  solutions where we've lost this war is where we've failed to actually develop a strategy
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:57.640]  and I think 15 years into the war with the political space created by the election it's
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.160]  time to at least have the discussion to take that operational pause and relook at what
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:06.920]  we're doing because what we have been doing is just not working.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:12.480]  Political warfare is nonviolent and violent actions operating in synthesis.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:16.240]  So the terror attack is done for the purpose of making you afraid.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.240]  Hit pause.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:22.840]  This is so important, back it up, again it's totally true, it's good cop, bad cop and again
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:27.240]  I should say Islam, its ideology is horrible, no one will adopt it but the globalists are
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.800]  force feeding it.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:31.320]  The deal has been made, been made.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:36.840]  So again they attack us, then oh we ban serving pork in Europe in school rooms, oh we ban
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:43.000]  new synagogues in Australia, this happened this week, then you say well I don't care
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.480]  about Jews, okay well then they're going to ban your freedom too.
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.960]  Everything must ban Islam because it's the backward authoritarianism that the globalists
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:59.280]  can then direct however they want, it's the zombie horde.
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:05.120]  Europe never let the Muslims in because they always try to overthrow it, it's a fact.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.880]  Let's go back to the guy fired by McMaster for writing a memo that is total truth.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.600]  That's why he's been fired, here it is.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:18.160]  Political warfare is nonviolent and violent actions operating in synthesis.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.520]  So the terror attack is done for the purpose of making you afraid and when you are afraid
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:27.840]  you are controlled, you can be controlled, you're willing to give away your own freedoms,
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.200]  you're willing to give away your own rights.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:33.720]  Hit pause again, back it up again, this guy is so smart, he gets, and Islam is paying
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:38.080]  off the left, I mean spending trillions, I mean they've been amassing money for a thousand
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.400]  years to do this, they could never beat us, they're pissed, every generation says they'll
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:51.440]  do it and now they're paying off to do this, it's just incredible.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.880]  It's amazing that this is the big launch, this is the big move and the McMasters and
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.760]  the Brennan's of the world get openly bought off by this because they're thinking oh it's
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:04.040]  generations off, we're going to fall to Islam because they're little sociopaths or psychopaths,
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:11.880]  no it's now, it's happening now, that's what you have to understand, this has been planned
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:19.120]  out forever, this is the whole will of it, we've lost our will as the West, now they're
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.600]  putting this will in, it's not that we don't do some hard things and some sad things but
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:29.400]  the thing is we have to have our will again or we'll be overwritten by this, this abomination,
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.400]  keep going.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:35.880]  So political warfare has to be understood and the goal of the attack on Orlando was
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:42.960]  not the death of those Americans or the wounding of those Americans, the goal of the attack
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:48.320]  on Orlando was to put fear into Americans so that you would be willing to give up, so
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.800]  you might be able to accept limits on free speech so that you might be willing to limit
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:00.600]  God, which is Islam, again it's not by accident that those things are targeted, the left again
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.640]  enabling, I see the left is almost enabling the enemy in these situations, they're not
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.760]  enabling, they're worshiping, but they had the secondary purpose there of the political
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:18.440]  protection, not everything in the war on terrorism is kinetic, we fix this, I said this year,
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:24.000]  the terror attack is the cover for the cultural takeover, it's the culture of Islam, little
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.240]  girls wearing beekeeper suits, no one allowed to have an identity, being total sex slaves,
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.880]  all of this, exactly, the terror is the cover in the overton window, they go oh that's the
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.960]  extreme of it, just accept us telling you how to live or what to do or you can't have
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.880]  pork in public schools, see, suicide bombing is just meant to make you appease and try
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.440]  to be nice, but the real mission is straight on, because Islam is its own cult, its own
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:59.240]  enslavement system, let's finish up, our affinity for guns and westerns and we appreciate
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:05.680]  that culturally, so when we think about the enemy in the war on terrorism, we think about
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.280]  the guy carrying the AK-47, exactly, or we think about the guy carrying the suicide bomber
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.800]  the physical attack is the diversion, we don't think about the subversive who is working
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:24.320]  at a school that is revising texts or curriculum informing future US government leaders, and
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.600]  it's getting people to understand this threat, that's why they removed him, they ruined a
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.760]  bunch of people like him that get it, that Flynn put in, and now you understand why they
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.520]  hated Flynn, I'll be back tomorrow, I'm gonna air the whole 30 minute interview tomorrow
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.240]  on the weekday transmission, please pray for us, please pray for yourself, this country,
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.400]  the world, for President Trump, because this is the battle for the soul of America, they've
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.760]  almost killed the country folks, they've almost killed it, we're that close.
