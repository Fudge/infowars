[00:00:01.164 --> 00:00:04.026]  It's Tuesday, July 9th, 2019.
[00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:13.172]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to be in and about the office today doing a lot of important work behind the scenes that takes a bit of generaling.
[00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:18.516]  But we've got Will Johnson, one of my favorite talk show hosts, who's visiting us in town.
[00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:23.939]  We're a sponsor of his own independent show on YouTube and other platforms that reaches millions of people a week.
[00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.903]  But he's come to town to work with us on some projects, and I decided to have him host today.
[00:00:29.443 --> 00:00:33.267]  He'll be hosting some of the War Room this week when Owen's up in D.C.
[00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:40.833]  covering the big event up there with the Trump White House social media summit as Trump prepares to take action in the Senate show.
[00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.435]  But he's going to be here.
[00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.577]  David Knight's going to pop in as a guest.
[00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.060]  Ben Garrison, the great cartoonist, is going to pop in as a guest.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.801]  And some other surprise guests today.
[00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:53.585]  But I really like Will Johnson because he's a smart guy.
[00:00:54.185 --> 00:01:00.691]  He's a loving guy and he's smooth and has a lot of confidence and really cares.
[00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:05.335]  And I've seen him go out and do these prayer meetings in California where the left comes out.
[00:01:05.335 --> 00:01:10.000]  Sometimes up to a thousand Antifa to attack him and just 50 people.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.262]  And they stood their ground when it happened.
[00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:17.767]  And that's what got Pelosi to finally admit that Antifa was bad last year was Will Johnson and others.
[00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:26.294]  He certainly paid his dues in the last few years in the fights against the globalists, and we're just excited to know there are independent reporters like him out there.
[00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:32.538]  So he's going to be piloting the good ship InfoWars today until Owen Schroer takes over.
[00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:35.841]  And then Owen's getting on an airplane to go to Washington, D.C.
[00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.303]  for all the huge coverage we're going to have there.
[00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:39.424]  But good things are happening.
[00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:42.106]  The whole globalist pedophile rings are being exposed.
[00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:43.607]  The world government's being exposed.
[00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:45.708]  Big Pharma's being exposed.
[00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.270]  The open borders are being exposed.
[00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.742]  So much is happening because you've been steadfast and we've held the course, but now...
[00:01:52.901 --> 00:02:01.304]  More than ever, we've got to continue to focus, continue to spread the word, because only your word of mouth can override the globalists and their censorship.
[00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:16.790]  Show, however you're watching, on local TV, or listening on local radio, or watching us at Infowars.com, Forged Last Show, or however you're watching or listening, download the shows, share them, there's no copyright, there's no, just get them out there, because you are overriding the AI at Google.
[00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.831]  You're overriding the censorship at Apple, and Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.952]  You're doing it!
[00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:21.452]  We're winning!
[00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.672]  But just barely.
[00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:27.476]  A year ago we were losing, but you can see the growth curve.
[00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:29.238]  We're going over the top.
[00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:33.524]  You know, if you make it to the top of the mountain, it's all downhill from there.
[00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:35.207]  Which means it's a lot easier from there.
[00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:36.188]  We're going over.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.100]  Almost there.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.702]  Summit's right there, but their best troops are dug in.
[00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:20.962]  They're demoralized.
[00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:24.143]  They know they're losing, but damn it, they've been ordered to fight to the death.
[00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:27.624]  So we've got to be ready to be lied about, to be demonized.
[00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.805]  They're going to try to put us in prison like Tommy Robinson.
[00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.146]  They're going to try to set me up like with the child porn.
[00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:35.227]  But the truth is, they're out of bullets politically.
[00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:38.568]  People don't believe a word they're saying anymore, and that's what's exciting.
[00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:49.609]  Interlaced attacks on us have only intensified the support, but that's good because I've got all these operations I'm ready to launch.
[00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.191]  Believe me, what you see on InfoWars is only the surface.
[00:03:54.191 --> 00:04:02.014]  Beneath the surface, we are doing a lot of things and a lot of organizations and a lot of groups count on you.
[00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:04.916]  I'm just the conductor here.
[00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.482]  But you're the lightning.
[00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:08.142]  You're the music.
[00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:08.803]  You're the fire.
[00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.143]  You're all the instruments.
[00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:13.005]  And when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:15.927]  So, I can't tell you about these initiatives.
[00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:21.570]  And in years down the road, just so you get some satisfaction, I'll let you know some of the stuff you financed and did.
[00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.511]  But let me tell you, it's dramatic.
[00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.772]  And it's powerful.
[00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:27.393]  And the truth is, nobody else is willing to do this.
[00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:28.994]  But you've been willing to do it.
[00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:30.395]  We've been willing to take it on the chin.
[00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:34.186]  And we're coming to the fire together, so thank you all.
[00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.246]  Coming up after the break, Will Johnson's going to take over.
[00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.707]  It's going to be quite a broadcast.
[00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:44.688]  Coming up this Thursday through Friday, 34-hour broadcast, 1776 Worldwide.
[00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:46.669]  We've got reporters in D.C.
[00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.410]  covering the big Trump summit, inside and outside.
[00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.711]  And the after events that are going to be great intel, the top memers and top social media battlers of globalists.
[00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:58.912]  This is one incredible time to be alive.
[00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:07.060]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.501]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:19.422]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:27.604]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:33.608]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the True Alpha Male Pack.
[00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:40.853]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[00:05:40.853 --> 00:05:44.535]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:47.577]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:51.640]  Show the world what a True Alpha Male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.142]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:11.005]  Ross Perot, 89 years old, has lost his battle with leukemia, but left behind a great family, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
[00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:15.828]  Ross Perot is a visionary, self-made billionaire, classic Texan.
[00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:22.992]  But more than anything, he did really care about people, as his son said in a statement today to the Dallas Morning News.
[00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:28.415]  And he knew that Canada had opened its border to the U.S., that their wages had gone down by half.
[00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:36.559]  In the end, it would be a giant fucking sound that would end up in China, and it would let the authoritarians that control China dominate world trade.
[00:06:47.768 --> 00:06:56.597]  That was back in 1991 and 1992 that he talked about the giant, Sacking Stalin, got out his charts and graphs and showed the world the facts.
[00:06:56.597 --> 00:06:58.179]  And guess what?
[00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:02.143]  Exactly what Ross Perot said would happen, happened.
[00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:04.865]  Now we have a 2.0 type Ross Perot.
[00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:19.942]  Donald John Trump, who even back at the time that Ross Perot was going on television talking about open borders and globalism being bad, Donald Trump was saying the exact same things on Oprah Winfrey and even on CNN.
[00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:24.845]  So we owe a debt, a big debt to Ross Perot.
[00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:33.947]  And just like Donald Trump gets attacked and Donald Trump gets lied about, Ross Perot got attacked and Ross Perot got lied about.
[00:07:33.947 --> 00:07:41.009]  That's why when you see him for being lied about with them saying the most incredible things you could, just the worst things with no proof.
[00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.586]  That we're over the target.
[00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:58.077]  And that's why I love this audience and appreciate you all so much because think about how far we've come since the days of Barry Goldwater and the John Birch Society and Ron Paul in the 1980s and everybody else that came before us.
[00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:07.705]  Larry MacDonald, countless others, Cleon Skousen, so many others that were attacked and audited and imprisoned.
[00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:08.505]  Congressman Hanson.
[00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:15.229]  And killed, like Congressman Begich, for exposing these things.
[00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:20.513]  There were Democrats, there were Republicans, like Senator Frank Church and others, that told the truth.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.802]  And expose this whole system when it was in its infancy.
[00:08:24.802 --> 00:08:26.824]  But now the New World Order is not in its infancy.
[00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:29.126]  It's up on its hind legs.
[00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:32.649]  And it's trying to take the planet over and trying to destroy the nation state.
[00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:38.154]  And using third world populations that they've already exploited to now be used as weapons against us.
[00:08:38.154 --> 00:08:43.499]  The truth is globalism is bad for everybody but the mega offshore banks who have designed it.
[00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.160]  It is a post-human system that's being set up.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:09:01.947]  And Ross Perot, say whatever you want about him, cared about people, cared about markets, understood, like Henry Ford did, that you've got to make the markets serve people, not people serve the markets.
[00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:07.550]  And that's where the purist libertarians, funded by the Koch brothers and others, are absolutely wrong.
[00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.812]  Because, in the final equation, they're all being subsidized by the welfare state.
[00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:15.556]  Wal-Mart, the Koch brothers, all of them.
[00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:23.022]  And so the system that they've developed, that they claim is libertarian, is actually crony capitalism and nothing but exploitive.
[00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:25.304]  So, bon voyage on your trip, Mr. Perot.
[00:09:25.304 --> 00:09:28.046]  Hope to see you someday at the next level.
[00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:34.631]  Now we're going to go back to the live feed with an amazing talk show host who's visiting us here in Austin, Texas, Will Johnson.
[00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:36.593]  And then I'm going to pop back in with a couple other reports.
[00:09:37.273 --> 00:09:55.592]  on the huge developments on the Epstein pedophile situation and the fact that Ian Coulter is now saying what I've been telling you for seven or eight years that Robert Mueller was controlling him and using him with cameras in his house and on the airplanes
[00:09:57.071 --> 00:10:01.837]  Two black male powerful businessmen.
[00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:04.260]  And that's now all coming out of them.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.766]  Powerful businessman they were never able to set up was Donald John Trump.
[00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:15.766]  Also, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is going to be coming on the show tomorrow.
[00:10:15.766 --> 00:10:23.073]  Not to talk about the stupid Russelgate stuff, but that scene and so many other big things that are happening and unfolding.
[00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:25.055]  So be sure and look forward to that.
[00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:30.120]  And Paul Joseph Watson is going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.843]  There are so many huge developments, I can't cover them all.
[00:10:33.843 --> 00:10:36.805]  They're at Infowars.com, they're at Newswars.com.
[00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:42.409]  The Russian government has said that what's happening to Tommy Robinson is wrong, that he's being persecuted.
[00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:49.794]  DrudgeReport.com, in the middle column, has linked to his powerful interview yesterday with us, his plea to President Trump for amnesty.
[00:10:51.155 --> 00:11:01.480]  As a political dissident, as a journalist being persecuted, the left has hit the comment section and is saying, oh, perfect, he's against refugees and asylum seekers, but now he wants asylum here.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.621]  Here's the difference.
[00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:10.704]  He was born in England, born in the UK, where we get our Magna Carta, our due process, our whole systems.
[00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.505]  He is a famous journalist.
[00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.727]  He is facing long prison sentences for exposing pedophile rings and simply covering them.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.922]  No one else has ever been given sentences like this.
[00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:31.292]  He's the textbook example of who we should be bringing into the country, whether they be black or white, old or young, Muslim or Christian, if they're actual well-known journalists facing prison sentences for reporting.
[00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:38.818]  That's why we bring in hundreds of people a year from Cuba and China and others, and they're given political asylum as journalists.
[00:11:38.818 --> 00:11:44.323]  Tommy Robinson is the textbook case for this, and is facing death if they send him back to prison Thursday.
[00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:45.163]  I don't
[00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:03.032]  A lot of other people.
[00:12:03.032 --> 00:12:04.393]  Ben Garrison coming on.
[00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:06.554]  So this is going to be an amazing transmission.
[00:12:06.554 --> 00:12:09.475]  Please continue to do your amazing part without you or nothing.
[00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:17.859]  Tell everyone you know on every forum and every facet and every email and every text message and word of mouth about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:18.940]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.592]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:12:32.592 --> 00:12:36.494]  To prosecute wars takes a lot of money.
[00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:47.218]  And if you look at the communists, they'll rob banks, they'll sell children to sex slavery, they'll hold people ransom for money for the revolutions.
[00:12:47.218 --> 00:12:50.219]  But that's not how our founding fathers did it.
[00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:52.100]  They just robbed British gold shipments.
[00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:55.098]  Kill people.
[00:12:55.098 --> 00:12:57.021]  We're not doing any of that.
[00:12:57.021 --> 00:13:04.209]  We're just selling t-shirts and books and films and air filtration and non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:08.734]  A general store of high quality products at great prices.
[00:13:08.734 --> 00:13:11.537]  And so, we have our new special.
[00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:13.940]  And it is the biggest special we've ever had.
[00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.327]  The last special we had was basically Christmas in July.
[00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:19.547]  It's the best specials we do.
[00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:22.829]  50% off, free shipping, stuff like that.
[00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:30.173]  This new special, if you take advantage of all the sales that are there, is 75% off.
[00:13:30.173 --> 00:13:32.474]  More than 30 items.
[00:13:32.474 --> 00:13:34.955]  The average item is 50% off.
[00:13:34.955 --> 00:13:37.556]  So the sale runs the gambit, the gauntlet.
[00:13:37.556 --> 00:13:40.318]  From 75% off to 25% off.
[00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:42.979]  And there's a bunch of other specials too.
[00:13:42.979 --> 00:13:44.080]  A dozen items.
[00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.973]  Are $17.76.
[00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:53.319]  Some of these items retail for $50 and we've never sold them for this price.
[00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:54.120]  But it's true.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.123]  I've habituated the audience to pick sales.
[00:13:57.123 --> 00:13:58.545]  And the audience is smart.
[00:13:58.545 --> 00:14:05.272]  They know, wow, these are really good deals on the air filtration, the water filtration, the seeds, supplements.
[00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:05.793]  Here's an example.
[00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:12.513]  Nobody ever put $15 plus into a turmeric formula.
[00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:20.220]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has at least $15 a product in it, not counting shipping and marketing and everything that goes into the cost.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.582]  The leading competitor puts $5 in the bottle.

[00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:30.028]  If you don't know about turmeric, you need to learn about it.

[00:15:35.655 --> 00:15:36.655]  You already understand that.
[00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:40.818]  But what you see visibly at Infowars is the tip of the iceberg.

[00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:01.688]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:01.688 --> 00:18:02.488]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.488 --> 00:18:03.049]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.569]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:06.411]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.411 --> 00:18:12.515]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.515 --> 00:18:21.241]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.482]  That's it.
[00:18:22.482 --> 00:18:25.123]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.123 --> 00:18:27.985]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:27.985 --> 00:18:29.266]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:30.186]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:35.609]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:38.410]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.470]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:49.734]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:51.635]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:51.635 --> 00:18:58.098]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.098 --> 00:18:59.058]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:03.839]  The second American revolution is happening now.
[00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:06.120]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.161]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-God world government.
[00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:16.123]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding, and we make it easy.

[00:20:22.045 --> 00:20:26.108]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:32.373]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Will Johnson.
[00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.031]  Welcome.
[00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:40.112]  My name is Will Johnson.
[00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:41.733]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:44.455]  I have the honor and privilege to be here today.
[00:20:44.455 --> 00:20:48.839]  This is such an excitement time.
[00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:50.981]  There's so much happening in the news.
[00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:57.366]  It's absolutely remarkable what's happening.
[00:20:57.366 --> 00:20:59.868]  Let me talk a little bit about myself just for a second.
[00:20:59.868 --> 00:21:03.031]  I really don't like talking about myself but I have to just to get it off my chest.
[00:21:05.863 --> 00:21:10.825]  I had no idea that I would be sitting in this chair today.
[00:21:10.825 --> 00:21:14.466]  This is such an amazing thing for me.
[00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:16.026]  It's such a blessing.
[00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:20.708]  I never imagined, just to give a brief description, my name is Will Johnson.
[00:21:20.708 --> 00:21:22.228]  I was living in California.
[00:21:22.228 --> 00:21:27.190]  I moved to Texas not anticipating that I would be sitting in this chair today.
[00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.631]  I was laid off my job and I said I'm going to get into this fight 100%.
[00:21:33.112 --> 00:21:47.937]  That's happening in America, and here I am today, and I've been speaking out vocally, loudly, for over three years now, and never imagined that I would be here.
[00:21:47.937 --> 00:21:52.579]  And I want to say I give God all glory that I am here.
[00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:59.841]  So, with that said, a lot of times I would listen to Alex in the morning.
[00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:01.502]  I would commute to work, I would listen to Alex.
[00:22:03.097 --> 00:22:10.599]  And he will talk about how he has his operation going and he needs everyone to support him, everyone to help him.
[00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:23.702]  And when I got here, I could absolutely could see, now I haven't seen everything of course, but all the people that he has working here, all the wonderful people that I've come in contact with here at InfoWars.
[00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:28.838]  It really set the stage.
[00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:32.000]  It really set what he was talking about.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.882]  I could visibly see what he was talking about.
[00:22:34.882 --> 00:22:38.965]  And it's so important that people support Infowars.
[00:22:38.965 --> 00:22:49.572]  You know, you have the liberal media, you have Democrats, you have all of the socialists left attacking Infowars, and Infowars is at the tip of the spear.
[00:22:49.572 --> 00:22:53.975]  And here I am, sitting in this chair, the hottest chair
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.525]  In America, next to the one in the Oval Office.
[00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:02.390]  This is it right here, the hottest chair in America.
[00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:12.823]  And when Brian Stelter said that Trump is the Infowars president, and I was just, this is wonderful, because
[00:23:13.985 --> 00:23:16.727]  Alex Jones, he is the general.
[00:23:16.727 --> 00:23:17.827]  General Jones.
[00:23:17.827 --> 00:23:21.389]  And you know, there's different ranks when you're a general.
[00:23:21.389 --> 00:23:27.233]  You can have a 1-star, 2-star, 3-star, all the way up to 5-star.
[00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:31.675]  And Alex Jones is the 5-star general.
[00:23:31.675 --> 00:23:32.816]  He's the highest he can be.
[00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:36.252]  He is the five-star general.
[00:23:36.252 --> 00:23:40.473]  And he has created something here that is just absolutely remarkable.
[00:23:40.473 --> 00:23:41.873]  He is at the top.
[00:23:41.873 --> 00:23:44.854]  He's been on top of this from day one.
[00:23:44.854 --> 00:23:50.075]  And people don't even recognize how much he has done here.
[00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:51.796]  And I come here and I'm just at awe.
[00:23:51.796 --> 00:23:53.156]  It's just so amazing.
[00:23:53.156 --> 00:24:01.498]  And for me to be in this seat, sitting here to be able to talk to so many people and to talk about what's happening in the world is a great honor.
[00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.552]  OK, so let's get into some of the news.
[00:24:05.552 --> 00:24:09.916]  I mean, so we already heard about Ross Perot dying.
[00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:13.879]  You know, Ross Perot was before my time, you know.
[00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:22.626]  So before I even was looking at even into politics, I mean, I heard about Ross Perot back in the day, but he was completely before my time.
[00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:28.872]  And Alex Jones, he has all the details on Ross Perot and he can give you so much more information than I can.
[00:24:29.592 --> 00:24:33.455]  But, you know, we always have to say a prayer and a loss for the dead, right?
[00:24:33.455 --> 00:24:36.257]  We never want an ill will for anybody.
[00:24:36.257 --> 00:24:39.319]  Because at one day, at one point, we all have to go there.
[00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:43.943]  At one day, we all have that appointment.
[00:24:43.943 --> 00:24:47.506]  We don't know when, but we all have that appointment.
[00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:55.872]  So, one thing that has happened, has been happening in the news, is you have these leftists going into supermarkets.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:08.846]  And they're licking ice cream, now they're spitting in tea, and one would have to think, what is going on in their mind to do such a thing?
[00:25:10.168 --> 00:25:15.535]  You know, I mean, so when I go into the store, I'm thinking about when I'm going to buy and take home and eat for later.
[00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:19.380]  Or if I'm going to buy something in a store, I'm going to take it outside and eat it right then.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:28.171]  But you have people deliberately going into these supermarkets, going into these stores, and they're eating the ice cream and then they're putting it back?
[00:25:29.471 --> 00:25:33.512]  I mean, at what point did they start thinking that this was okay?
[00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:39.073]  And who came up with the idea, let's do this and record it and see if it goes viral?
[00:25:39.073 --> 00:25:41.953]  Is this something that is normal?
[00:25:41.953 --> 00:25:43.674]  No, it's not normal.
[00:25:43.674 --> 00:25:45.874]  But this is the normalcy for the liberals.
[00:25:45.874 --> 00:25:47.914]  This is what's going on in their mind.
[00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:53.756]  And I truly believe that we're in a time to where the liberals, the leftists, they want to go to the extreme.
[00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:55.096]  That's why we're seeing this stuff.
[00:25:56.095 --> 00:25:57.697]  They go to the extreme.
[00:25:57.697 --> 00:26:01.202]  Let's see how far we can take this insanity.
[00:26:01.202 --> 00:26:07.391]  And for this to be taking place today in the year 2019, it's like we're almost going back.
[00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:10.695]  It's like we're becoming savages all over again.
[00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:11.817]  And it's 100% the left.
[00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:14.480]  Now, you know what?
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:23.428]  If it was conservatives doing this, you would have CNN, ABC, CBS, all of the alphabet network soup group, liberal media, talking about it.
[00:26:23.428 --> 00:26:25.330]  Look what Trump supporters are doing!
[00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.152]  Look what Trump supporters are doing!
[00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:30.915]  They're licking food and putting it back on the shelf, but you know what?
[00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:32.997]  Right now, they say nothing about it.
[00:26:32.997 --> 00:26:34.038]  Like, this is okay.
[00:26:34.038 --> 00:26:36.340]  This is what's expected of the left.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.542]  Do something extremely crazy.
[00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.772]  Extremely crazy.
[00:26:41.772 --> 00:26:42.552]  And then guess what?
[00:26:42.552 --> 00:26:44.153]  It's okay.
[00:26:44.153 --> 00:26:44.394]  Why?
[00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:46.255]  Because we're leftists.
[00:26:46.255 --> 00:26:50.058]  As long as we're leftists when we do this, it's okay.
[00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:55.082]  So now you have to have police officers standing in front of ice cream?
[00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:57.244]  I mean, seriously, come on, people.
[00:26:57.244 --> 00:26:59.085]  Police officers should be doing something else.
[00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:01.207]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:27:01.207 --> 00:27:05.791]  Maybe now that they have police officers standing in front of ice cream, that's racist.
[00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:07.027]  Right?
[00:27:07.027 --> 00:27:10.729]  Because the left, they're always calling police officers racist.
[00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:16.313]  So maybe police officers standing in front of ice cream is now racist.
[00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:18.294]  Oh my goodness.
[00:27:18.294 --> 00:27:20.055]  Are they going to protect the vanilla?
[00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:22.236]  Or are they going to protect the chocolate?
[00:27:22.236 --> 00:27:25.318]  Which one are they going to protect first?
[00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:27.679]  This is the police officers having to protect ice cream.
[00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:33.463]  This is the insanity that we're living in, in America, on the planet Earth today.
[00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:38.875]  Who thought of this crazy stuff?
[00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:47.359]  I mean, you know, if I now when I go in, I don't even want to buy and you know, I don't even buy ice cream that comes in the tub, especially as it is.
[00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:48.360]  And then tea.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.922]  I only buy the tea if the tea hasn't had have not had the seal broken on it.
[00:27:52.922 --> 00:27:54.903]  Some tea when you buy it has a seal on it.
[00:27:54.903 --> 00:27:56.764]  You have to make sure the seal is there.
[00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:05.807]  Because if the seal is not there and I walk outside and I open it up and the seal's been broken, I'm going to return that tea, wherever I buy it from.
[00:28:05.807 --> 00:28:08.207]  No matter what the drink is, I'm going to return it.
[00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:10.628]  I'm going to tell them that the seal was broken.
[00:28:10.628 --> 00:28:18.070]  And if I have an issue with it, I'm going to say, maybe you need to call the police because someone is tampering with the food in your establishment.
[00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.771]  We should not be experiencing this in the year 2019.
[00:28:21.673 --> 00:28:25.977]  I'm not, you know what, really, the left would love to blame President Trump for this.
[00:28:25.977 --> 00:28:36.086]  Because the left has been doing everything crazy, crazy, crazy after President Trump won in 2016.
[00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:37.608]  Think about it.
[00:28:37.608 --> 00:28:41.652]  Now, we had crazy people in the past, but it's never been this crazy.
[00:28:41.652 --> 00:28:46.076]  They are going to a new plateau with their craziness, and they're not going to stop.
[00:28:47.051 --> 00:28:48.895]  They like the craziness.
[00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:50.738]  They enjoy the craziness.
[00:28:50.738 --> 00:28:51.940]  That's why they're doing it.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.604]  And we're gonna see more of it.
[00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:54.525]  More after this break.
[00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:57.291]  My name is Will Johnson and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:05.134]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:17.964]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:25.830]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.791]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:37.315]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:38.156]  Don't miss this one!

[00:29:53.183 --> 00:29:53.504]  We're good.
[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:11.698]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[00:30:11.698 --> 00:30:15.821]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:25.188]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[00:30:25.928 --> 00:30:27.950]  The system is vulnerable.
[00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.633]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:34.256]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:41.162]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[00:30:41.162 --> 00:30:46.508]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[00:30:47.368 --> 00:30:47.929]  1776 Worldwide
[00:31:04.383 --> 00:31:07.505]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[00:31:07.505 --> 00:31:08.266]  What does it really mean?
[00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:12.869]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[00:31:12.869 --> 00:31:14.770]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:23.677]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[00:31:23.677 --> 00:31:26.719]  We're going to do a 34 hour special broadcast
[00:31:27.697 --> 00:31:30.278]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
[00:31:30.278 --> 00:31:31.258]  with David Knight.
[00:31:31.258 --> 00:31:35.859]  Runs right through with me and many others until the next day at 6 p.m.
[00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:36.940]  on The War Room.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.820]  We're going to have our crew in D.C.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.001]  at the White House Summit on social media.
[00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:47.262]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[00:31:47.262 --> 00:31:49.043]  So everybody, share that link.
[00:31:49.043 --> 00:31:52.964]  Infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[00:31:54.032 --> 00:31:54.653]  8 a.m.
[00:31:54.653 --> 00:31:57.715]  Central at Infowars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide.
[00:32:01.075 --> 00:32:03.096]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[00:32:03.096 --> 00:32:05.096]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:32:05.096 --> 00:32:11.598]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:23.682]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:32:23.682 --> 00:32:26.763]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[00:32:26.923 --> 00:32:29.425]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:32:56.863 --> 00:32:58.785]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:03.248]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:05.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.036 --> 00:33:34.597]  All right.
[00:33:34.597 --> 00:33:35.438]  Welcome back.
[00:33:35.438 --> 00:33:36.100]  Welcome back.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.049]  My name is Will Johnson and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:43.994]  What a wonderful time this is.
[00:33:43.994 --> 00:33:45.918]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[00:33:47.082 --> 00:33:54.604]  You know, with everything going on, you would think that at some point the left would be like, OK, we're going a little bit too far.
[00:33:54.604 --> 00:33:58.826]  We're our craziness is going a little overboard.
[00:33:58.826 --> 00:34:01.526]  Maybe we should dial it back.
[00:34:01.526 --> 00:34:03.667]  But they don't dial it back.
[00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:09.029]  They keep going and going and going and going.
[00:34:09.029 --> 00:34:12.870]  I think before 2020 gets here, which is a short time,
[00:34:14.193 --> 00:34:18.857]  We're going to see so much more insanity from the left.
[00:34:18.857 --> 00:34:20.959]  I think they're going to go to the extreme.
[00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:26.783]  I mean, everything that they do is just completely insane.
[00:34:26.783 --> 00:34:28.024]  Think about it.
[00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.746]  So, let me give you an example.
[00:34:31.087 --> 00:34:42.676]  You know, I just talked about the ice cream and how now you have police officers, they're guarding the cabinets that's holding the ice cream.
[00:34:42.676 --> 00:34:46.539]  You know, chocolate ice cream matters.
[00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:49.221]  I mean, so they're going to make it racist, right?
[00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:50.341]  They probably will.
[00:34:50.341 --> 00:34:53.824]  I mean, I wouldn't put it past these leftists to make it racist.
[00:34:53.824 --> 00:34:54.865]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:34:55.936 --> 00:35:01.179]  The insanity that we're seeing today is coming from somewhere.
[00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:04.181]  And I truly believe that we're in a spiritual battle.
[00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:07.003]  This spiritual battle that we're seeing is intensifying.
[00:35:07.003 --> 00:35:13.067]  Why else do you think that they would be going to the extreme with their insanity?
[00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:22.393]  This spiritual battle, you have demons taking over the minds of people, convincing them to do this insanity, to do crazy things.
[00:35:23.908 --> 00:35:25.249]  No one expected this.
[00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:27.451]  I mean, seriously?
[00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:29.093]  Well, I will take it back.
[00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:36.179]  You've had people in the past talk about how liberalism will come, you know, and fascism will come in the form of liberalism.
[00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:37.240]  You know, we've seen that.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.582]  We've heard that.
[00:35:38.582 --> 00:35:39.462]  And here it is.
[00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:45.708]  I think what it is, no one just anticipated that it would happen this soon or today in the year 2019.
[00:35:48.672 --> 00:35:50.233]  They are just insane.
[00:35:50.233 --> 00:36:01.441]  I mean, it's to the point now they're telling, you know, young boys, young girls, young ladies, that you don't have to be the way God created you.
[00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:03.522]  You can be something entirely different.
[00:36:03.522 --> 00:36:05.423]  If you want to be a doorknob, you can.
[00:36:05.423 --> 00:36:08.565]  If you feel like it, you can be a doorknob.
[00:36:08.565 --> 00:36:10.787]  This is the way they're teaching children.
[00:36:11.943 --> 00:36:24.276]  You know, it's the whole thing with the whole transgender, dragon queen, dragon story telling time where they're trying to indoctrinate the children today so when they become young adults they can say this is the norm.
[00:36:25.362 --> 00:36:26.123]  It's insane.
[00:36:26.123 --> 00:36:27.504]  It's insane.
[00:36:27.504 --> 00:36:28.945]  Let me change subjects a little bit here.
[00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:32.328]  Let's talk about making America great again.
[00:36:32.328 --> 00:36:44.038]  So Nancy Pelosi, she's here in the news recently talking about making America, or she's saying basically that President Trump wants to make America white again.
[00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:48.102]  You know, if you really think about it, when did America
[00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:52.724]  Or when was America ever just white?
[00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:54.947]  Because we've always had Indians here.
[00:36:54.947 --> 00:36:57.089]  There's always been black people here.
[00:36:57.089 --> 00:37:03.275]  Regardless on how many Democrats put them on slave ships, or liberalism, or people on the left put them on slave ships and brought them here.
[00:37:04.298 --> 00:37:10.662]  It's always been diverse in America, so it's never been strictly just white.
[00:37:10.662 --> 00:37:24.229]  But see, they want to push this narrative that President Trump is only about white people, or the Republican Party is only about white people, when the Republican Party was created to help black people.
[00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:27.871]  It was created, I want to emphasize on that, created
[00:37:29.363 --> 00:37:29.463]  to
[00:37:53.510 --> 00:38:03.113]  Every single time you have Republicans that put something in place that will benefit black people, Democrats will step in to try to stop it.
[00:38:03.113 --> 00:38:05.874]  The Civil Rights Act, who was against that?
[00:38:05.874 --> 00:38:07.315]  Democrats.
[00:38:07.315 --> 00:38:10.016]  Black people voting, who was against that?
[00:38:10.016 --> 00:38:11.356]  Democrats.
[00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:15.758]  Ending slavery by Republicans, who wanted to stop that?
[00:38:15.758 --> 00:38:16.398]  Democrats.
[00:38:18.743 --> 00:38:23.169]  Black people being on welfare, being in the ghettos, living in these situations.
[00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:24.271]  Who wanted to stop that?
[00:38:25.692 --> 00:38:29.073]  Democrats wanted to continue it, but Republicans wanted to stop it.
[00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:42.375]  It's always been Democrats that always come in and try to change and reverse everything that Republicans did that were good for black people, and then they want to try to change it to make it look like they take credit for it.
[00:38:42.375 --> 00:38:53.237]  It's always been, the common denominator has always been Democrats coming into play, trying to reverse everything positive that Republicans did for black people.
[00:38:54.245 --> 00:38:55.346]  Here it is.
[00:38:55.346 --> 00:38:56.306]  We're seeing it today.
[00:38:56.306 --> 00:38:59.088]  It's happening all over again.
[00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:00.148]  President Trump.
[00:39:00.148 --> 00:39:01.489]  Prison reform.
[00:39:01.489 --> 00:39:04.611]  Now the Democrats, they act like they're for it.
[00:39:04.611 --> 00:39:06.852]  But really, they're against it.
[00:39:06.852 --> 00:39:08.673]  Because President Trump will take credit for it.
[00:39:09.758 --> 00:39:11.820]  They don't want to give President Trump credit for it.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.665]  And let me tell you, making America great, you know what that means for me as a black male in this country?
[00:39:18.665 --> 00:39:25.571]  Making America great means that we are going to have fathers in the household.
[00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.352]  That's what it means to me.
[00:39:27.352 --> 00:39:32.857]  It means that we're going to teach children to be respectful to the elders.
[00:39:32.857 --> 00:39:34.438]  That's what it means to me.
[00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:38.562]  Making America great again says that we are going to have
[00:39:39.628 --> 00:39:46.752]  Students and black males and just children in general respect law enforcement.
[00:39:46.752 --> 00:39:50.535]  And ultimately, God.
[00:39:50.535 --> 00:39:56.519]  See, right now the Democrats, they want to take the whole thing and twist it and make it look like America, make America great again.
[00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:58.460]  It's only specifically for white people.
[00:40:00.151 --> 00:40:05.452]  I mean, what it is, the Democrats are excluding black people in all of this.
[00:40:05.452 --> 00:40:08.052]  What about making America great for black people?
[00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:09.553]  They don't even say that.
[00:40:09.553 --> 00:40:14.714]  You can't say it's BLM, Black Lives Matter, because then Black Lives Matter, they exclude white people.
[00:40:14.714 --> 00:40:19.834]  When you talk about America, that is the biggest difference between Republicans and Democrats.
[00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:26.456]  Republicans will talk about Americans as a whole, but you have liberals only talk about specific groups.
[00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:26.856]  Why?
[00:40:26.856 --> 00:40:28.596]  Because they want to do that to divide us.
[00:40:30.902 --> 00:40:34.283]  And you have the same thing with the whole Nike coming out.
[00:40:34.283 --> 00:40:35.704]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:40:35.704 --> 00:40:36.924]  Bessie Ford.
[00:40:36.924 --> 00:40:42.606]  And see, now to my understanding, to my understanding, she was against slavery.
[00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:47.948]  And you have Crapper Nick coming out there talking about how, this is so bad, this is so bad.
[00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:51.329]  This is the model of the left.
[00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:58.251]  Find something that's good, find something that's going to benefit the American people and see how you can destroy it.
[00:40:58.251 --> 00:41:00.292]  That is it, that's the ultimate goal here.
[00:41:01.505 --> 00:41:04.647]  Destroy everything.
[00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:06.288]  Take something that is good and destroy it.
[00:41:06.288 --> 00:41:09.290]  That has been the model of the Democrat left.
[00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:10.751]  And that's what they are about today.
[00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:17.836]  And in my personal, on unitedamericanfirst.com, I'm always talking about how the Democrats support everything of Satan.
[00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:19.817]  And I still say that today.
[00:41:19.817 --> 00:41:30.144]  Because everything that they do, when they support, when they do these crazy things for his abortion, telling little Johnny that he can be little Kimberly, going against everything of God.
[00:41:31.195 --> 00:41:33.397]  Now, am I saying the Republicans are angels?
[00:41:33.397 --> 00:41:34.158]  Absolutely not.
[00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.919]  We're all sinners.
[00:41:35.919 --> 00:41:41.184]  But you don't have, you only have one group that's openly supporting everything of Satan.
[00:41:41.184 --> 00:41:43.467]  And that is the Democrat Party.
[00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.549]  The Democrat Party also created the KKK.
[00:41:45.549 --> 00:41:48.511]  This is nothing new that I am telling you.
[00:41:48.511 --> 00:41:49.993]  Everyone is aware of all of this.
[00:41:51.837 --> 00:42:03.442]  But making America great again means that I have the opportunity to sit in the chair that I'm sitting in right now.
[00:42:03.442 --> 00:42:05.723]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.384]  That's making America great again.
[00:42:08.436 --> 00:42:19.946]  What an honor, what a blessing for me to be sitting in this chair, and to have the nerve, the audacity to sit there and say that because you're white, because you were born white, that you're automatically a neo-Nazi white supremacist.
[00:42:19.946 --> 00:42:24.570]  That's because they have nothing credible to say.
[00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:30.936]  Infowars.com is where the truth is at.
[00:42:30.936 --> 00:42:32.718]  This is at the tip of the spear.
[00:42:34.488 --> 00:42:36.269]  Is that the tip of the spear?
[00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:39.712]  Alright, after this break, we're gonna come back with more.
[00:42:39.712 --> 00:42:43.134]  And during this break, I'm going to sip on my TurboForce.
[00:42:43.134 --> 00:42:46.796]  I like to put it in hot tea and sip it.
[00:42:46.796 --> 00:42:47.897]  It's wonderful.
[00:42:47.897 --> 00:42:51.019]  Get your TurboForce today at infowarestore.com.
[00:42:51.019 --> 00:42:55.142]  That's how you support the fight with all of us.

[00:42:56.203 --> 00:42:56.543]  God bless.
[00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:16.847]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:43:16.847 --> 00:43:24.231]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:26.372]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:43:26.372 --> 00:43:30.614]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:43:30.614 --> 00:43:38.557]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:43:38.557 --> 00:43:41.259]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:43:41.259 --> 00:43:46.161]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:47.362]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:43:47.362 --> 00:43:48.182]  They have side effects.
[00:43:48.342 --> 00:43:52.927]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.941]  The second American revolution is happening now.
[00:45:03.941 --> 00:45:06.201]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[00:45:06.201 --> 00:45:11.243]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-god world government.
[00:45:11.243 --> 00:45:14.903]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding.
[00:45:14.903 --> 00:45:16.224]  And we make it easy.

[00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:19.196]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[00:46:24.645 --> 00:46:29.509]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[00:46:29.509 --> 00:46:36.796]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[00:46:36.796 --> 00:46:42.160]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart.
[00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:48.186]  And we are all made by the same Almighty God!

[00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:50.449]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:53.231]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ!
[00:46:53.231 --> 00:46:54.933]  Full power!
[00:46:54.933 --> 00:46:56.014]  Damn the torpedoes!
[00:46:56.014 --> 00:47:03.241]  Go straight at them!
[00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:05.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:34.502 --> 00:47:34.942]  All right.
[00:47:34.942 --> 00:47:36.363]  Welcome back.
[00:47:36.363 --> 00:47:37.784]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.784 --> 00:47:38.865]  My name is Will Johnson.
[00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:42.648]  I have the honor and privilege to be sitting next to David Knight.
[00:47:42.648 --> 00:47:43.409]  Thank you.
[00:47:43.409 --> 00:47:47.552]  Thank you for joining me in this wonderful time.
[00:47:47.552 --> 00:47:49.593]  Well, it's an honor to have you join us here, Will.
[00:47:49.593 --> 00:47:50.474]  I really appreciate that.
[00:47:50.894 --> 00:47:52.616]  Yeah, and you know what?
[00:47:52.616 --> 00:47:56.519]  To me, I'm still at awe that I'm actually sitting in his chair.
[00:47:56.519 --> 00:47:56.819]  You know?
[00:47:56.819 --> 00:47:58.621]  I mean, the reason why I said it... Yeah, I know.
[00:47:58.621 --> 00:47:59.001]  It's strange.
[00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:01.584]  You watch something and then all of a sudden you're on that set.
[00:48:01.584 --> 00:48:02.725]  It's really kind of strange.
[00:48:02.725 --> 00:48:02.965]  Yeah, it is.
[00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:04.446]  I was like that when I first came here, too.
[00:48:04.446 --> 00:48:05.127]  Yeah, it is.
[00:48:05.127 --> 00:48:05.827]  I mean, well...
[00:48:06.788 --> 00:48:09.630]  A week ago, I was laid off my job.
[00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:14.973]  And I just upped and moved my family here to Texas, not anticipating that I would be sitting in this chair today.
[00:48:14.973 --> 00:48:17.235]  So, I mean, look at God.
[00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:17.915]  Look at God.
[00:48:17.915 --> 00:48:19.156]  I mean, I give God all credit.
[00:48:19.156 --> 00:48:20.557]  You know, God is an awesome God.
[00:48:20.557 --> 00:48:23.819]  Yeah, providence was talked about all the time by the founding fathers, wasn't it?
[00:48:23.819 --> 00:48:26.561]  And it's not just for nations, it's especially for each of us individually.
[00:48:26.781 --> 00:48:28.602]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:48:28.602 --> 00:48:42.329]  So, you know, in the last segment I was talking about making America white again and also with, you know, and this insanity of... I said, no, no, no, the acronym I said today was, we gotta say, count American citizens again.
[00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:44.330]  That's caca, right?
[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.732]  We're gonna wind up with a national country, right?
[00:48:46.732 --> 00:48:48.493]  So that should be the new motto.
[00:48:48.493 --> 00:48:50.354]  You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:48:50.354 --> 00:48:52.335]  Why is it racist that
[00:48:53.484 --> 00:48:57.811]  If you want to count American citizens, why is it racist?
[00:48:57.811 --> 00:48:59.994]  To me, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:59.994 --> 00:49:02.117]  Why is it racist?
[00:49:02.117 --> 00:49:03.279]  Because everything is racist.
[00:49:03.279 --> 00:49:07.325]  That's the tool that they use to make sure that they can oppose you.
[00:49:07.325 --> 00:49:08.947]  And again, if you look at what they're saying, Will...
[00:49:10.124 --> 00:49:14.670]  You've got NPR and other people saying, well look at what President Trump said Friday as he's heading out to the airplane.
[00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:20.858]  He's saying, well, it's about apportioning districts as well as how you're going to do the money.
[00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:23.221]  Well, that's exactly the same thing that a California judge said.
[00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:26.966]  California judge said, if you ask this question, it's going to cost
[00:49:27.486 --> 00:49:31.168]  California, political power, and it's going to cost them money.
[00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:33.789]  The California judge can say that, but President Trump can't.
[00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:34.670]  And it's true.
[00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:35.590]  It is about that.
[00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.611]  It is about a raw exercise of power.
[00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:44.595]  And I said, as important as that citizenship question is, and it is very important because that's how they're going to allocate political power.
[00:49:45.055 --> 00:49:57.017]  Even if they don't give the vote to foreign citizens criminally trespassing in the United States, then they're going to have more people in the census, which means that California will get more seats in Congress and more seats in the Electoral College.
[00:49:57.017 --> 00:50:02.039]  So it is a very important question, and that's a reason why it should be on the census.
[00:50:02.039 --> 00:50:12.781]  But now they're coming back and they're saying, even Judge Napolitano this morning, while he was getting coffee, was saying, well, you know, you've got to give the judges a reason for why you, you can ask any question you want, but you've got to give them a good reason for why you asked that question.
[00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:13.641]  It's like, no you don't!
[00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:16.342]  That's a lawyer talking.
[00:50:16.342 --> 00:50:18.463]  Judge Napolitano is basically a lawyer.
[00:50:18.463 --> 00:50:26.948]  You don't need to have the presidency bow down to the judiciary, to the judges, to every single... We've got 3,500 federal judges.
[00:50:26.948 --> 00:50:30.810]  He doesn't have to get unanimous approval of every one of those judges.
[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:35.572]  One federal judge should not be able to blackball a presidential policy when he has that authority.
[00:50:35.572 --> 00:50:37.473]  And that's the most important question.
[00:50:37.473 --> 00:50:39.534]  It is a question of authority.
[00:50:39.534 --> 00:50:40.355]  And if President Trump
[00:50:40.715 --> 00:50:44.738]  We're to successfully push back against these people by doing something like an executive order.
[00:50:44.738 --> 00:50:50.922]  That would be the most important thing that he's done in his presidency because that's how they're blocking him everywhere.
[00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:52.083]  Andrew Jackson did that.
[00:50:52.083 --> 00:50:54.545]  Andrew Jackson said to the Supreme Court, all right, they've made their decision.
[00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:55.525]  Let's see them enforce it.
[00:50:55.525 --> 00:50:56.846]  They don't have the ability.
[00:50:56.846 --> 00:51:03.291]  So because the Democrats know that they're going to lose power, lose seats, let's make up something and say it's racist.
[00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:03.651]  Yeah.
[00:51:03.651 --> 00:51:04.792]  Has nothing to do with it.
[00:51:04.792 --> 00:51:06.453]  Has nothing to do with being racist.
[00:51:06.453 --> 00:51:09.195]  I mean, if you're an American citizen, yeah, raise your hand.
[00:51:09.955 --> 00:51:10.936]  Is that racist?
[00:51:10.936 --> 00:51:12.158]  All of a sudden that is racist.
[00:51:12.158 --> 00:51:13.939]  That doesn't make a lick of sense.
[00:51:13.939 --> 00:51:16.842]  That's, you know, that is the tactics of the left.
[00:51:16.842 --> 00:51:17.263]  That's right.
[00:51:17.263 --> 00:51:22.628]  Make up something, make it racist, and then we'll just go with it at that angle.
[00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:25.651]  Well the other part of this is that they want to go and these judges say
[00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:31.341]  Okay, I can say that it's about money and political power, but President Trump can't say that.
[00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:35.184]  And if President Trump says that, that is evidence of bias.
[00:51:35.184 --> 00:51:43.210]  So these judges put themselves in the position of saying, I'm going to base my ruling not on what the Constitution says the President has authority on.
[00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.232]  I'm not going to base my ruling on what the law says.
[00:51:46.232 --> 00:51:47.853]  I'm not going to base it on any of that stuff.
[00:51:47.853 --> 00:51:50.955]  I'm going to base my ruling on what I think he thinks.
[00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:16.954]  I'm not going to allow that because I don't like his motives as I imagine them.
[00:52:16.954 --> 00:52:23.262]  Yeah, I mean, I was just looking at it and I just, how were they able to do this?
[00:52:23.262 --> 00:52:28.228]  And like you said, you have one judge to come in and they just, one judge changed everything.
[00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:32.553]  And as a leftist judge, of course, one probably appointed by Obama.
[00:52:32.853 --> 00:52:35.114]  Well, look at what's happening with Congress.
[00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:39.015]  Congress has abdicated their authority to the administrative state.
[00:52:39.015 --> 00:52:42.376]  All these different three-letter bureaucracies that just write the rules for us.
[00:52:42.376 --> 00:52:46.417]  And then if it's a rule that we violate, we don't have any constitutional protections of due process.
[00:52:46.417 --> 00:52:48.498]  We don't have the presumption of innocence.
[00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:51.098]  We don't have any protection against excessive fines.
[00:52:51.098 --> 00:52:52.599]  We don't have due process.
[00:52:52.599 --> 00:52:54.079]  They can come in and say, you violated that.
[00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:55.120]  It started with the IRS.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.020]  Now they're all doing that.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.566]  Remember when the FAA said, if you don't register your toy drone with us, we're going to fine you $25,000?
[00:53:01.566 --> 00:53:10.755]  People pushed back against that, but we've had our elected representatives in Congress abdicate their authority.
[00:53:10.755 --> 00:53:14.299]  Rand Paul is the only person and a couple of people in Congress who've worked with him
[00:53:14.619 --> 00:53:14.839]  I think?
[00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:50.935]  And so it's a very important thing for us to get that back because right now we have a situation where we have not only taxation without representation, we have legislation without representation, we have these unelected bureaucrats who are there for life and we can't get rid of them and they're dictating and shutting down every aspect of President Trump.
[00:53:50.935 --> 00:53:54.256]  Even when he had the immigration restrictions.
[00:53:54.816 --> 00:53:56.596]  They called it a Muslim ban.
[00:53:56.596 --> 00:53:59.477]  And he had seven different countries.
[00:53:59.477 --> 00:54:00.417]  One of them was North Korea.
[00:54:00.417 --> 00:54:02.558]  I forget one of the other ones that was not Muslim.
[00:54:02.558 --> 00:54:04.318]  But two of them were obviously not Muslim.
[00:54:04.318 --> 00:54:05.938]  North Korea is not Muslim, by the way.
[00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:08.259]  And then he had five Muslim countries.
[00:54:08.259 --> 00:54:11.219]  Well, that's only 10% of all the Muslim countries in the world.
[00:54:11.219 --> 00:54:13.540]  These were countries that Obama had gone to war with.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:13.680]  Right.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.740]  And they called it racist.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.660]  And they said, you can't do that.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.221]  And those federal judges who shut that down.
[00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:19.601]  This is that same thing again.
[00:54:19.601 --> 00:54:22.182]  Everything that President Trump does is racist.
[00:54:22.182 --> 00:54:23.742]  For example, the Fourth of July.
[00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:28.125]  Fourth of July has all of a sudden now become racist.
[00:54:28.125 --> 00:54:30.227]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:54:30.227 --> 00:54:40.918]  The left, they will not stop going above and beyond their own insanity trying to make everything look racist or completely against America.
[00:54:40.918 --> 00:54:41.719]  The Fourth of July.
[00:54:42.748 --> 00:54:48.351]  I know Alex Jones, he was talking about Trump's speech on the 4th.
[00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:51.192]  And it was absolutely a wonderful speech.
[00:54:51.192 --> 00:55:01.217]  And of course, you have the left again trying to make it look like that it was racist or the 4th of July now is all of a sudden about Trump and Trump only.
[00:55:02.284 --> 00:55:05.805]  Well, here's the thing about the Fourth of July and why they want to make it about slavery and so forth.
[00:55:05.805 --> 00:55:15.009]  They want to go back and have you focus on their interpretation of history 200 years ago so that you don't pay attention to the fact that you are now a slave today.
[00:55:15.009 --> 00:55:25.574]  Each and every one of us, regardless of what our skin color is, we are each of us a slave to the federal government and these regulatory agencies that rule over us and make these rules.
[00:55:25.574 --> 00:55:30.816]  And if you were, and they want to get us fighting with each other so we don't fight with them to try to get our freedom back.
[00:55:30.936 --> 00:55:31.637]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:31.637 --> 00:55:35.259]  We're like all the little ants and they don't want to distract.
[00:55:35.259 --> 00:55:37.261]  You know, it's the same thing like with the history.
[00:55:37.261 --> 00:55:45.207]  You know, they want to go back and change the history to where, to make it look like the Democrats have always been for minorities and black people and women, which has not been the case.
[00:55:45.207 --> 00:55:54.395]  You know, I was talking about that a little bit earlier, how every time the Republican Party came up with something that's going to benefit black people, the Democrats will step in to try to reverse it or try to stop it.
[00:55:54.855 --> 00:55:55.495]  Yeah!
[00:55:55.495 --> 00:55:57.116]  I mean, that's the common denominator.
[00:55:57.116 --> 00:55:57.837]  It's always been that.
[00:55:57.837 --> 00:55:58.837]  Democrats pay for reparations.
[00:55:58.837 --> 00:55:59.438]  Exactly!
[00:55:59.438 --> 00:56:00.138]  You know what?
[00:56:00.138 --> 00:56:01.038]  Thank you.
[00:56:01.038 --> 00:56:02.319]  I didn't even mention that one.
[00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:04.160]  The Republicans came up with reparations.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.703]  The Democrats reversed it when they gave it to black people, 40 acres and a mule.
[00:56:08.703 --> 00:56:13.625]  Democrats came in and said, no, you're not going to have it, so you have to give this property over to your former slave owners.
[00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:14.746]  It's always been that.
[00:56:14.746 --> 00:56:15.927]  Here's the thing that's most amazing.
[00:56:16.647 --> 00:56:25.870]  Kamala Harris comes up with her first, you know, she was one of the first ones to jump into reparations, in spite of the fact that she's not African-American, that nobody in her family was ever enslaved.
[00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:30.151]  Her father was Jamaican, bragged about the fact they owned slaves, her mother was from India.
[00:56:30.151 --> 00:56:37.033]  Now, she comes up with, I think, probably the first concrete proposal for how to do reparations.
[00:56:37.033 --> 00:56:40.234]  As she said, she wants to give $25,000 to every black individual who makes up to $100,000.
[00:56:45.775 --> 00:56:50.519]  Or a black head of household that makes up to $125,000 in the household income.
[00:56:50.519 --> 00:56:51.820]  Now think about that.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:57:06.871]  You know, as you had the black writer for Quillette saying, he said, look, my parents or grandparents, they might have had your great-grandparents who were slaves, or my parents who suffered under Jim Crow, they had standing to do something about this.
[00:57:06.871 --> 00:57:09.353]  They could have sued about this, because I've had a lot of privileges.
[00:57:09.353 --> 00:57:12.095]  And he goes, so you're going to take money from a poor white
[00:57:12.455 --> 00:57:16.857]  Appalachian worker and you're gonna give it to me when I'm making a six-figure salary?
[00:57:16.857 --> 00:57:19.378]  And that's exactly what Kamala Harris wants to do!
[00:57:19.378 --> 00:57:20.779]  It's absolutely amazing!
[00:57:20.779 --> 00:57:22.019]  She put a price tag on it.
[00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:25.361]  A hundred billion dollars of racism right there from Kamala Harris.
[00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:29.222]  Yeah, you know it just goes to show more insanity from the left.
[00:57:29.222 --> 00:57:29.863]  Yeah.
[00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:34.265]  Be as crazy as you can be because that's what everyone wants to see.
[00:57:34.265 --> 00:57:37.526]  Alright, we are on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:37.526 --> 00:57:38.626]  Will Johnson, David Knight.
[00:57:38.626 --> 00:57:41.368]  We will be right back after this break.
[00:57:41.368 --> 00:57:41.928]  See you in a minute.
[00:57:49.384 --> 00:57:57.452]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[00:57:57.452 --> 00:58:03.677]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[00:58:03.677 --> 00:58:12.305]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[00:58:13.486 --> 00:58:28.755]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America can not do.
[00:58:39.696 --> 00:58:40.838]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:40.838 --> 00:58:41.979]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:44.964]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:44.964 --> 00:58:46.446]  Full power!
[00:58:46.446 --> 00:58:47.527]  Damn the torpedoes!
[00:58:47.527 --> 00:58:48.429]  Go straight at them!
[00:58:50.896 --> 00:59:06.783]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[00:59:06.783 --> 00:59:08.483]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:59:08.483 --> 00:59:19.368]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:59:19.588 --> 00:59:20.108]  We're good to go.
[00:59:39.497 --> 00:59:41.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:17.644]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:17.644 --> 01:00:20.145]  Divide and conquer.
[01:00:20.145 --> 01:00:27.586]  Turn man against woman, woman against man, father against son, black against white.
[01:00:27.586 --> 01:00:30.067]  It just goes on and on.
[01:00:30.067 --> 01:00:33.868]  And now we see every sporting event
[01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:45.885]  Every human action that takes place being turned into an attempt to manipulate human minds and turn us against each other.
[01:00:45.885 --> 01:00:46.826]  And who's doing it?
[01:00:46.826 --> 01:00:56.992]  A consortium of big, powerful, exploitive megacorporations who just 50 years ago made about 20% of the profit for themselves.
[01:00:56.992 --> 01:00:57.612]  Now they get 70%.
[01:01:00.128 --> 01:01:14.637]  But they're the ones all day telling you about inequity between black people and white people and old people and young people and people of the third world, people of the first world, because it's a distraction from what they're doing, a rearguard action.
[01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:19.399]  Look at this headline by Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:20.600]  Equal pay?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.443]  Women's World Cup brings in $131 million, compared to men's, which earned $6 million.
[01:01:29.542 --> 01:01:40.168]  Now, if something has $6 billion coming in versus $131 million, who's going to get paid more?
[01:01:40.168 --> 01:01:53.976]  You know, it's kind of like if a movie comes out that costs $100 million to make, but it makes $500 million, do the producers make more money on that versus a movie that costs $1 million to make that makes $20 million?
[01:01:55.626 --> 01:02:05.856]  A fifth grader would say that the one that makes the hundreds of millions more, that the people would get paid more.
[01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:11.521]  And if people in history chose to go see women's sporting events,
[01:02:12.922 --> 01:02:17.448]  More than they would see men's, the women would be paid more.
[01:02:17.448 --> 01:02:22.795]  Now I know our audience understands this, but when you pull back and you see the women's team from the U.S.
[01:02:22.795 --> 01:02:31.506]  winning and it being turned into an America-hating, throw American flags on the ground, bitch and complain, demand more funding, that's not going to get more money to the women.
[01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:44.760]  In fact, just like the NFL, pay is set to be cut because NFL viewership is down about 39% from four years ago because of all of the Kaepernick-type garbage.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.903]  People are tuning out of this crap.
[01:02:47.903 --> 01:02:53.309]  Hollywood's bottom line is getting smaller and smaller because no one wants to go see movies
[01:02:54.642 --> 01:02:56.823]  With all the politically correct garbage.
[01:02:56.823 --> 01:03:00.464]  But why does the system keep doing it?
[01:03:00.464 --> 01:03:14.528]  Because if you look at the profits, hundreds of billions a year by Hollywood, hundreds of billions a year by sports, it's still a fraction of the trillions and trillions a day in digital money transfers that the globalists have created out of thin air.
[01:03:15.506 --> 01:03:19.770]  You've got Facebook coming out with its own digital blockchain currency.
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:27.277]  They can make trillions out of thin air so they don't care if they run Hollywood and the NFL and women's sports into the ground.
[01:03:27.277 --> 01:03:29.279]  Hey, I love women's sports.
[01:03:29.279 --> 01:03:30.260]  I love all sports.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.881]  It's great.
[01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:32.282]  I like watching the women at the Olympics.
[01:03:32.282 --> 01:03:34.044]  Boy, I love watching the pole vaulters.
[01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.585]  Love watching those beautiful strong bodies.
[01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:42.197]  It doesn't matter, because I won't tune into it, because everything is a lecture.
[01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:50.783]  I won't watch men's sports, I won't watch women's sports, because anytime I try to sit down with the family and watch it, it is laced with crap.
[01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:51.784]  So we watch old movies.
[01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.287]  My kids want to go over to Friends Houses and watch the crap, they can do it.
[01:03:56.287 --> 01:03:58.667]  But I'm not going to be part of this anymore.
[01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:03.808]  And the real thing we can do is vote with our dollars and pull back from this and not support it.
[01:04:03.808 --> 01:04:07.409]  It's like the New York Times and all these other big groups, The Washington Post, they're bankrupt.
[01:04:07.409 --> 01:04:11.970]  But they've got big, powerful billionaires behind them that are propping them up.
[01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.970]  Infowars is supported by you.
[01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.771]  And that's why I always say, I am in your hands.
[01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:24.557]  And that's because I am in your hands, and this is an independent media organization powered by We The People.
[01:04:24.557 --> 01:04:29.321]  That's why InfoWars is yours, and its destiny lies with you.
[01:04:29.321 --> 01:04:35.126]  Now back to Will Johnson, David Knight, and the rest of the crew in Austin, Texas.
[01:04:35.126 --> 01:04:42.013]  I am working today on some big, secret projects, and I'll be back in the studio, Lord willing, tomorrow.

[01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:18.285]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.041]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:06:23.041 --> 01:06:25.182]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.422]  My name is Will Johnson.
[01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:31.705]  I have the honor and privilege to be sitting here today with Mr. David Knight.
[01:06:31.705 --> 01:06:33.306]  So, the soccer team.
[01:06:33.306 --> 01:06:33.806]  Yeah.
[01:06:33.806 --> 01:06:38.388]  The soccer team, you know, Alex was just talking about it before the break.
[01:06:38.388 --> 01:06:39.349]  What are your thoughts on it?
[01:06:40.089 --> 01:06:42.691]  Well, you know, Will, this is the fourth time the women's, U.S.
[01:06:42.691 --> 01:06:45.433]  women's soccer team has won the World Championship.
[01:06:45.433 --> 01:06:49.296]  Why have we not heard about them when they did it the first, second, and third time?
[01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:54.360]  I think it's simply because you've got a Colin Kaepernick figure there, a person of Megan Rapinoe.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.943]  She is now, this is why everybody is talking about it, why they've made a big deal out of it.
[01:06:58.943 --> 01:07:01.024]  It wasn't a big deal the first three times they did it.
[01:07:01.024 --> 01:07:01.805]  Now it is.
[01:07:01.805 --> 01:07:04.307]  And if you go back to the last time they won the World Championship, it was 2015.
[01:07:06.169 --> 01:07:12.504]  Two years later, they played an under 15 year old boys team and got beaten 5-2.
[01:07:15.276 --> 01:07:18.817]  Then, they played, went on in the tournament, and they beat the Russians.
[01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:24.398]  So, I mean, they weren't a really weak team by world standards of the women's soccer.
[01:07:24.398 --> 01:07:33.020]  And then two years later, they win the soccer thing again, but now it's all because of the fact that they are protesting President Trump.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.300]  This is why the corporate media is making a big deal out of it.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.961]  That, right there, that only.
[01:07:36.961 --> 01:07:40.721]  And I said, because they're being paid for by the taxpayers.
[01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:43.682]  And we're told all the time that we have to just shut up
[01:07:44.262 --> 01:07:52.128]  And go away, because the internet is now owned by a handful of giant private corporations.
[01:07:52.128 --> 01:07:57.371]  They now own the internet, and so we should just shut up and get off of the public square if they say so.
[01:07:57.371 --> 01:07:59.753]  Well, okay, by those same rules, since the U.S.
[01:07:59.753 --> 01:08:01.754]  taxpayer owns the U.S.
[01:08:01.754 --> 01:08:04.476]  women's soccer team, can we tell these people to shut up and go away?
[01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:07.618]  I mean, I'm not about censorship.
[01:08:07.618 --> 01:08:09.760]  Look, I'm fine if she wants to protest this stuff.
[01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:10.836]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:14.778]  But, you know, this is a double standard that we see, is what I'm pointing out.
[01:08:14.778 --> 01:08:15.939]  It is, it is.
[01:08:15.939 --> 01:08:18.660]  I completely agree with you.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:25.042]  How do you, so how do they expect to get paid the same amount when they don't bring in the same amount?
[01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:33.206]  Is it just because they're taxpayers, they just want to, you know, increase the taxes on the American people, just give them more money that way, regardless?
[01:08:33.206 --> 01:08:39.389]  So maybe in that case, instead of increasing the pay for the women, how about decrease the pay for the men?
[01:08:39.969 --> 01:08:40.691]  That's right, yeah.
[01:08:40.691 --> 01:08:42.796]  Well, I mean, it's not going to be market-based.
[01:08:42.796 --> 01:08:43.117]  I mean, look...
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.631]  The World Soccer Championships aren't really market-based anyway.
[01:08:48.631 --> 01:08:57.013]  It's by the fact that Nike goes out there and uses this as an opportunity to make money off of their anti-Americanism, off of their anti-Trump.
[01:08:57.013 --> 01:08:59.053]  Nike simply just hate Trump.
[01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:00.974]  They hate America.
[01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:03.054]  And I said this a long, long time ago.
[01:09:03.054 --> 01:09:07.715]  I mean, everybody's saying, well, look, see, this wasn't about the police situation at all.
[01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:09.556]  No, of course it wasn't about the police situation.
[01:09:09.556 --> 01:09:10.876]  If it was about the police situation,
[01:09:11.596 --> 01:09:14.678]  You would have these leaders who are pushing back against this.
[01:09:14.678 --> 01:09:25.485]  They would say, look, there's a higher percentage of black people that have abuse of the system of the police, but there's more white people in terms of absolute numbers.
[01:09:25.485 --> 01:09:31.669]  So let's get the black people together and the white people together and let's decide how we are going to control the system.
[01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:33.090]  And we've got bad actors.
[01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:36.793]  How do we purge them out of the system instead of allowing them to stay in the system?
[01:09:36.793 --> 01:09:38.614]  But they don't want to solve that problem.
[01:09:38.614 --> 01:09:41.276]  They want to use that as a means to divide people.
[01:09:41.796 --> 01:09:44.179]  That's what it's always been about from day one.
[01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:47.962]  It's also been about the Marxism that tries to deconstruct our culture.
[01:09:47.962 --> 01:09:51.806]  And now you can clearly see that with this Betsy Ross situation.
[01:09:51.806 --> 01:09:56.771]  And the fact that Nike immediately jumps in and says, well, we need to have equal pay.
[01:09:56.771 --> 01:09:59.654]  You know, they're being criticized in France for being too white.
[01:10:00.354 --> 01:10:03.136]  This women's soccer team.
[01:10:03.136 --> 01:10:11.780]  You can't win, once you go down this path of let's divide everybody by demographics, even the women's soccer team can't win that fight, ultimately.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:18.844]  Yeah, you know, they just put up on a screen, I was going to talk about how the stadium was chanting equal pay, equal pay, equal pay.
[01:10:19.484 --> 01:10:22.467]  You know, maybe everyone... They were chanting F Trump, F Trump.
[01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:23.187]  Yeah, basically.
[01:10:23.187 --> 01:10:25.570]  And they came back and said, we're ashamed to be Americans.
[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:26.931]  It's like, well, I'm ashamed you're an American.
[01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:30.434]  Yeah, you know, I mean, exactly.
[01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:37.220]  I mean, why don't everybody that was in the stadium go ahead and pay another hundred bucks on their ticket?
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.020]  Exactly.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.420]  So the equal pay will come in.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.602]  I guarantee everyone in the state will say, no, I don't want to pay an extra hundred bucks.
[01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:49.983]  You know, our tickets should be free, you know, because the whole socialism thing and the whole soccer thing, they want to make everything free.
[01:10:49.983 --> 01:10:54.004]  They want to steal our money, taxpayer dollars, and just pay for everything.
[01:10:54.004 --> 01:10:59.766]  I wouldn't be surprised if the other countries say, well, you know what, because America, you should pay for everything.
[01:10:59.766 --> 01:11:02.166]  So when we have games, you should pay for that too.
[01:11:02.166 --> 01:11:02.887]  That's right.
[01:11:02.887 --> 01:11:03.207]  That's right.
[01:11:03.207 --> 01:11:04.447]  I mean, what's stopping them from doing it?
[01:11:04.787 --> 01:11:12.829]  You have men's sports that people willingly pay what I consider to be exorbitant prices to go watch men play a boys' sport, right?
[01:11:12.829 --> 01:11:14.990]  I'm not interested in spectator sports.
[01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:16.330]  That's why I'm in politics.
[01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:17.731]  It's not a spectator sport.
[01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:21.272]  But people pay big ticket prices to go watch these contests.
[01:11:21.272 --> 01:11:23.552]  They don't do that for women's sports.
[01:11:23.552 --> 01:11:24.072]  That's true.
[01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:24.653]  Okay?
[01:11:24.653 --> 01:11:25.493]  Why is that?
[01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:27.913]  Maybe they should take a look at that.
[01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:29.954]  But they're not going to approach this from a market standpoint.
[01:11:30.234 --> 01:11:33.476]  They're just going to demand that they get equal results.
[01:11:33.476 --> 01:11:36.438]  They're not going to try to figure out what the public wants.
[01:11:36.438 --> 01:11:37.159]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:49.267]  You know, let's talk, this is still related to the soccer, but the whole point of them dropping the flag and then you had to have one of them come and snatch it up really quick, trying to prevent it from being on the ground too long.
[01:11:49.267 --> 01:11:59.654]  But the point that she dropped it in the first place, trying to celebrate doing their little dance, whatever it is, their celebration dance, and they dropped the flag.
[01:12:00.294 --> 01:12:04.455]  I mean, so, they're already disrespecting America.
[01:12:04.455 --> 01:12:05.935]  That's right, yeah.
[01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:13.357]  You know, I mean, maybe because foosball is not a traditional American sport, maybe that's the reason why they felt comfortable doing it.
[01:12:13.357 --> 01:12:19.898]  I don't know the reason why she would drop it in the first place on a national scene like that, on the national level.
[01:12:19.898 --> 01:12:23.679]  Well, she knows that this is going to give her a Nike contract.
[01:12:23.679 --> 01:12:29.080]  You know, if you spit in the face of America, you spit in the face of Trump, you're going to get a Nike contract.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:29.740]  It's just that simple.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.541]  So that's how you do it.
[01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:32.241]  Yeah.
[01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:33.141]  Virtually struggling.
[01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:36.803]  Talk bad about America and we'll give you some extra perks.
[01:12:36.803 --> 01:12:37.703]  That's right.
[01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:47.548]  But you know, this whole, again, this whole identity politics stuff comes around because they're being criticized for being too white, but take a look at what's happening across women's sports, and we've talked about this over and over again.
[01:12:47.548 --> 01:12:54.331]  You know, whether it's track and field, or whether it's this particular team playing under 15-year-old boys, you know, women are
[01:12:56.992 --> 01:13:18.525]  Having, you know, problems, college-age women are very concerned about the fact, or people even in high school who want to get a college scholarship, said, look, I've worked very hard at this sport, and I can't get any recognition because I'm getting, we've got people coming in here, transgender male or females, or I'm getting confused, guys who, biological guys who say they're females.
[01:13:18.525 --> 01:13:20.646]  They're coming in and they're winning all the sports, right?
[01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.588]  And so that's unfair, fundamentally unfair.
[01:13:23.288 --> 01:13:29.510]  To women, to girls who are working really hard to get a scholarship to go to college or whatever.
[01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:32.911]  And so all of these policies come back around to them.
[01:13:32.911 --> 01:13:43.434]  You know, once you go down this path of saying, we're going to not have things based on merit, but we're going to base things on demographics, then you start to have these fights.
[01:13:43.434 --> 01:13:44.474]  And that's the whole point.
[01:13:44.474 --> 01:13:49.656]  They want people fighting over demographics because they've, the whole Marxist tactic
[01:13:50.276 --> 01:13:54.119]  Has been to get people in the past to fight over different classes.
[01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:55.039]  That worked in Europe.
[01:13:55.039 --> 01:13:57.501]  That was very stratified by classes.
[01:13:57.501 --> 01:13:58.802]  Here in America, it didn't work.
[01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:05.526]  So you had people like Bill Ayers and others, the Weather Underground, saying, hey, this class warfare is not working.
[01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:07.227]  Let's use race warfare.
[01:14:07.227 --> 01:14:11.189]  And they were the ones who started promoting this white skin privilege.
[01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.970]  And that's where we are today.
[01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:12.930]  Yeah, you know.
[01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.490]  Into education, that's where they're pushing all this.
[01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:26.993]  You know, and that was part of the whole topic when I was talking about earlier how the left come up with all these crazy things on how to divide us and they use it when they don't have anything concrete to stand on.
[01:14:26.993 --> 01:14:29.473]  Let's just kick up something insane.
[01:14:29.473 --> 01:14:30.014]  Yeah.
[01:14:30.014 --> 01:14:37.095]  Racism, something to divide us, something that is a hot topic button that people will talk about instead of the real issues.
[01:14:37.495 --> 01:14:40.097]  Well, we've got to make sure that divided, they fall.
[01:14:40.097 --> 01:14:41.298]  Exactly.
[01:14:41.298 --> 01:14:42.539]  That's exactly it.
[01:14:42.539 --> 01:14:48.223]  You know, when we come back from the break, let's talk a little bit about Ross Perot, if we can.
[01:14:48.223 --> 01:14:51.025]  Because he had United We Stand, right?
[01:14:51.025 --> 01:14:52.205]  He was all about uniting people.
[01:14:52.205 --> 01:14:56.168]  He was before my time, and you're just a little bit more mature than I am.
[01:14:56.168 --> 01:14:57.809]  Just a little bit.
[01:14:57.809 --> 01:14:59.410]  We'll talk a little bit more about Ross Perot.
[01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:05.335]  But, you know, I think what's happening across the world is they're trying to make it the norm to
[01:15:06.115 --> 01:15:19.401]  Talk bad about America, to talk bad about President Trump, and to make themselves look good like they're so brave and so strong standing up against a neo-Nazi white dictator that's sitting in the Oval Office.
[01:15:19.401 --> 01:15:22.583]  And that's the way they're pushing it, which we all know is not true.
[01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:25.004]  Everybody loves Trump, especially the hip-hop world.
[01:15:25.004 --> 01:15:26.285]  I want to be like Trump.
[01:15:26.285 --> 01:15:28.566]  I want to be like Trump until he became president.
[01:15:28.846 --> 01:15:29.206]  We're good to go.

[01:16:23.976 --> 01:16:25.758]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.123]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:33.665]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.665 --> 01:17:36.607]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:41.811]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[01:18:57.069 --> 01:19:01.952]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:19:02.608 --> 01:19:12.994]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:19:12.994 --> 01:19:17.837]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:32.346]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[01:19:32.446 --> 01:19:50.215]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:19:50.215 --> 01:19:56.919]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:04.422]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:35.213 --> 01:20:38.594]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:38.594 --> 01:20:42.314]  My name is Will Johnson, sitting in with David Knight.
[01:20:42.314 --> 01:20:48.416]  It's an honor to be a guest on the AJ Show, the Alex Jones Show, and to be sitting here with you.
[01:20:48.416 --> 01:20:52.677]  We're talking about many different topics.
[01:20:52.677 --> 01:20:55.617]  One of the producers just handed me an article here.
[01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:59.078]  I'm not sure how it was controversial, but they were talking about a Swedish
[01:21:00.018 --> 01:21:01.559]  Oh, here it is.
[01:21:01.559 --> 01:21:07.964]  A migrant gang shoved a gun into a Swedish boy's mouth and it stirs controversy.
[01:21:07.964 --> 01:21:10.545]  I'm not sure how that stirs up controversy.
[01:21:10.545 --> 01:21:12.527]  It's completely insane.
[01:21:12.527 --> 01:21:15.489]  It's wrong is wrong, no matter what it is.
[01:21:15.489 --> 01:21:17.050]  And someone's shoving a gun.
[01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:20.052]  I'm like, oh, wait a minute, but he's a migrant.
[01:21:20.052 --> 01:21:21.533]  It's OK.
[01:21:21.533 --> 01:21:22.574]  It's OK.
[01:21:22.574 --> 01:21:27.217]  Migrants are OK, no matter how bad they are, no matter the insane things that they do.
[01:21:27.987 --> 01:21:28.828]  It's just like Andy Falk.
[01:21:28.828 --> 01:21:34.275]  You look at these little skinny kids, dressed in black with black helmets on, and they can do whatever they want, right?
[01:21:34.275 --> 01:21:40.664]  They go up and smack some guy wearing a MAGA cap in the face, and it's the MAGA cap guy that's hateful.
[01:21:40.664 --> 01:21:42.526]  And he deserved it, because he's wearing a MAGA cap.
[01:21:42.927 --> 01:21:46.809]  Yeah, you know, I mean, I wear mega hats, you know, my hat.
[01:21:46.809 --> 01:21:51.731]  So actually on my on my personal website, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, I sell them on there.
[01:21:51.731 --> 01:21:53.892]  And I've had right liberals attack me.
[01:21:53.892 --> 01:21:56.513]  How dare you wear that hat or sell that hat?
[01:21:56.513 --> 01:22:00.295]  And they're like, you're just trying to get people to buy them.
[01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:02.036]  You know, I mean, this is look at this.
[01:22:02.036 --> 01:22:03.777]  This is insane.
[01:22:04.517 --> 01:22:06.959]  And so what was the controversy in that?
[01:22:06.959 --> 01:22:08.240]  What is that?
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.580]  Because he's a white male?
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:10.701]  I mean, it's okay?
[01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:10.981]  Yeah.
[01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.883]  I mean, is that what exactly is that?
[01:22:12.883 --> 01:22:18.727]  They commit crimes because, you know, you're not supposed to point out the crimes of certain groups, right?
[01:22:18.727 --> 01:22:19.247]  Yeah.
[01:22:19.247 --> 01:22:25.691]  I mean, it's just like it's just like the the migrant that came across the southern border of America had the young girl with him.
[01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:30.655]  And to my understanding, he raped her for over four months and then end up killing her.
[01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:31.475]  And they put her in jail.
[01:22:31.475 --> 01:22:34.257]  And then you have the left that's trying to defend him.
[01:22:35.138 --> 01:22:40.022]  I mean, you know, it just makes me think about all of the insanity that is taking place.
[01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.425]  But let's talk about Ross Perot.
[01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:49.431]  I think that's the main thing I want to talk about here because I think you're going to educate me on him.
[01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.952]  I'm just trying to refresh my memory.
[01:22:50.952 --> 01:22:52.934]  It's been a while.
[01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.777]  1992 was really the year that everybody remembers Ross Perot.
[01:22:55.777 --> 01:22:58.699]  That's when he ran as a third party candidate for presidency.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.403]  And, you know, a lot of things have happened since then.
[01:23:02.403 --> 01:23:05.065]  A lot of people have forgotten what that was about.
[01:23:05.065 --> 01:23:15.375]  But fundamentally, as I said this morning, you go back and that quote about the giant sucking sound that he had, and it was spot on and prophetic.
[01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:17.277]  He knew what was going to happen.
[01:23:17.277 --> 01:23:19.199]  And what immediately happened, as I said this morning,
[01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.752]  And the show that precedes this one.
[01:23:22.752 --> 01:23:24.113]  We had had between the U.S.
[01:23:24.113 --> 01:23:28.736]  and Mexico, for years before that, a rough trade parity.
[01:23:28.736 --> 01:23:31.578]  Some years, you know, we would be ahead, some years they would be ahead.
[01:23:31.578 --> 01:23:36.021]  But the spread was never more than two to five billion dollars, as soon as NAFTA was passed.
[01:23:36.781 --> 01:23:41.982]  The trade deficit shot up to $17 billion in the favor of Mexico.
[01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:43.942]  It stayed there for two or three years.
[01:23:43.942 --> 01:23:49.223]  It's never gotten less than $17 billion, and it's gotten up to $72 billion.
[01:23:49.223 --> 01:23:50.944]  It is a giant sucking sound.
[01:23:50.944 --> 01:23:54.964]  And it's not just Mexico, but it's also the situation with China as well.
[01:23:54.964 --> 01:23:56.545]  So he was right to identify that.
[01:23:56.545 --> 01:24:00.365]  Of course, you had both Bush and Clinton who wanted that to go through.
[01:24:00.365 --> 01:24:02.146]  The establishment parties wanted that to go through.
[01:24:02.146 --> 01:24:04.326]  So there's a lot of connections between him
[01:24:04.986 --> 01:24:05.186]  I don't
[01:24:23.854 --> 01:24:25.975]  Bush and Clinton were tied at 24%.
[01:24:25.975 --> 01:24:34.161]  Even in the primaries, you had people in states like Oregon and Washington, they're writing in Ross Perot in the primaries.
[01:24:34.161 --> 01:24:35.082]  They wrote him in.
[01:24:35.082 --> 01:24:40.565]  13% of the people who are Democrats in Oregon voted for Ross Perot as a write-in candidate.
[01:24:40.565 --> 01:24:41.986]  15% on the Republican side.
[01:24:41.986 --> 01:24:44.188]  So he had bipartisan support.
[01:24:44.188 --> 01:24:48.731]  He was murdering both of the establishment candidates.
[01:24:48.731 --> 01:24:51.553]  And so he said, he dropped out in July, he said, I've had
[01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:55.075]  Threats of violence against my family.
[01:24:55.075 --> 01:24:59.198]  And that got a lot of people's attention when he said that.
[01:24:59.198 --> 01:25:04.222]  And as things went on, he was saying, yeah, I've been threatened by the CIA, the FBI, and all these other people.
[01:25:04.222 --> 01:25:05.183]  Oh, he's crazy.
[01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.724]  He's Looney Tune, right?
[01:25:06.724 --> 01:25:09.946]  The FBI and the CIA would never try to overthrow an election.
[01:25:09.946 --> 01:25:16.351]  They would never come after somebody who is outside of the political establishment, who wanted to shake up things.
[01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:20.394]  I mean, he was talking about, he was polling at 39% when he was talking about
[01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:26.216]  Raising taxes and cutting spending.
[01:25:26.216 --> 01:25:29.837]  Because he had a plan to balance the budget in five years.
[01:25:29.837 --> 01:25:33.359]  And yet, people saw him as a can-do candidate.
[01:25:33.359 --> 01:25:39.481]  You know, we had this debacle with Iran, which is really where most people's memory of the history of Iran begins.
[01:25:39.481 --> 01:25:46.724]  Most people don't remember when the CIA overthrew the Iranian elections in the 1950s and put that despot, the Shah, of Iran in.
[01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:49.665]  And when the CIA trained the secret police, the Savak,
[01:25:50.365 --> 01:25:50.626]  Yeah.
[01:26:00.973 --> 01:26:05.817]  Went from a hardcore socialist or Marxist, that gave us the Ayatollah.
[01:26:05.817 --> 01:26:07.279]  That's how our foreign policy works.
[01:26:07.279 --> 01:26:12.043]  But people remember the American embassy being taken over in Iran.
[01:26:12.043 --> 01:26:14.565]  And they remember the impotence of Jimmy Carter.
[01:26:14.565 --> 01:26:21.071]  And they remember the fact that Ross Perot, and it was memorialized in a movie called, what was it, I wrote down, Wings of Eagles.
[01:26:21.963 --> 01:26:25.006]  And had Richard Crenna playing Ross Perot.
[01:26:25.006 --> 01:26:27.908]  Ross Perot got his people out of Ron.
[01:26:27.908 --> 01:26:29.369]  Jimmy Carter didn't.
[01:26:29.369 --> 01:26:33.693]  So he was seen as a can-do person, a successful businessman.
[01:26:33.693 --> 01:26:36.495]  That's why he had that kind of broad support.
[01:26:36.495 --> 01:26:38.737]  Then he says, well, I've had death threats against my family.
[01:26:38.737 --> 01:26:41.920]  Everybody says, oh, he's a crazy conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.964]  Would anybody say that today after what we have seen done to President Trump?
[01:26:47.485 --> 01:26:49.187]  I believe Ross Perot.
[01:26:49.187 --> 01:26:50.828]  I believed him then, quite frankly.
[01:26:50.828 --> 01:26:55.953]  I believed that the CIA and the FBI was capable of that kind of stuff back then.
[01:26:55.953 --> 01:26:59.597]  But I think everybody would believe him today if he were to say that.
[01:26:59.597 --> 01:27:04.282]  I mean, I don't know how anyone would not believe him today.
[01:27:04.522 --> 01:27:04.862]  That's right.
[01:27:04.862 --> 01:27:07.143]  After what we just saw for the last three years.
[01:27:07.143 --> 01:27:07.884]  Oh, exactly.
[01:27:07.884 --> 01:27:08.364]  Exactly.
[01:27:08.364 --> 01:27:14.727]  And so, you had Dan Quayle take point on that and called him, criticized him as a temperamental tycoon.
[01:27:14.727 --> 01:27:15.947]  He said, ah, he's just a folk hero.
[01:27:15.947 --> 01:27:21.710]  He's got a lot of, you know, they focus on his character flaws and his eccentricities and that type of thing.
[01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:24.592]  Just like, same game plan that we see with President Trump.
[01:27:24.592 --> 01:27:25.912]  Threaten him.
[01:27:25.912 --> 01:27:27.513]  Talk about killing him.
[01:27:27.513 --> 01:27:30.895]  Come after his temperamental qualities and so forth.
[01:27:30.895 --> 01:27:33.896]  Look, nobody's perfect, but he was a lot better than
[01:27:34.298 --> 01:27:35.424]  Than George H.W.
[01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:38.278]  Bush or Bill Clinton.
[01:27:39.113 --> 01:27:41.355]  And so they talked about him, played that aspect up.
[01:27:41.355 --> 01:27:45.397]  He got back into the race in October, but he never recovered in the polls.
[01:27:45.397 --> 01:27:48.539]  When he came back in, he was in a distant third place.
[01:27:48.539 --> 01:27:50.621]  He didn't win a single state.
[01:27:50.621 --> 01:27:53.102]  The Republicans believe that he cost them the election.
[01:27:53.102 --> 01:27:55.404]  No, that didn't cost them the election.
[01:27:55.404 --> 01:28:00.648]  What cost them the election was the read-my-lips promise from George H.W.
[01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:01.208]  Bush.
[01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:03.329]  That was what he focused his whole campaign on.
[01:28:03.329 --> 01:28:05.251]  Just like President Trump said, I'm going to build a wall.
[01:28:06.231 --> 01:28:07.052]  George H.W.
[01:28:07.052 --> 01:28:08.934]  Bush said, read my lips, no new taxes.
[01:28:08.934 --> 01:28:10.435]  Nobody believed him, really.
[01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:16.780]  We were hoping that it was going to be true, because he had called Reagan's tax cut programs voodoo economics.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:23.686]  And then, as soon as he became president, he gave us what was then the biggest tax increase the United States had ever seen.
[01:28:23.686 --> 01:28:27.289]  And that was essentially what cost him the election.
[01:28:27.289 --> 01:28:32.353]  People looked at it and said, well, you know, some people say it cost the Democrats more than it did Republicans.
[01:28:32.353 --> 01:28:33.554]  Some people say it cut the other way.
[01:28:34.294 --> 01:28:35.815]  But that's the story of Ross Perot.
[01:28:35.815 --> 01:28:37.257]  Well, thank you for that.
[01:28:37.257 --> 01:28:37.857]  Sure.
[01:28:37.857 --> 01:28:42.640]  Like I said, Ross Perot was before my time, and you're just a little bit more mature than I am.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.202]  You have all the information on that.
[01:28:44.202 --> 01:28:46.623]  Hey, I want to thank everyone for staying with us, sticking with us.
[01:28:46.623 --> 01:28:49.185]  We will be back after this break.
[01:28:49.185 --> 01:28:53.268]  David Knight, you come on after the Alex Jones Show, right?
[01:28:53.268 --> 01:28:55.330]  No, I come on in the mornings at 8 o'clock Central.
[01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:55.790]  My bad.

[01:29:58.069 --> 01:30:02.232]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:30:02.232 --> 01:30:03.292]  They are technocrats.
[01:30:03.292 --> 01:30:05.594]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:30:05.594 --> 01:30:12.938]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:30:12.938 --> 01:30:14.819]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:30:14.819 --> 01:30:16.921]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:30:17.421 --> 01:30:23.784]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.

[01:31:03.849 --> 01:31:10.190]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:20.712]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars.
[01:31:20.712 --> 01:31:22.393]  You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:27.554]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:31:27.554 --> 01:31:28.774]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[01:31:28.814 --> 01:31:30.474]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:59.729 --> 01:32:02.311]  1776 worldwide.
[01:32:02.311 --> 01:32:05.474]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[01:32:05.474 --> 01:32:06.214]  What does it really mean?
[01:32:06.214 --> 01:32:10.838]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[01:32:10.838 --> 01:32:12.739]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[01:32:12.739 --> 01:32:21.626]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[01:32:21.626 --> 01:32:24.689]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[01:32:25.649 --> 01:32:28.231]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at a.m.
[01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:29.211]  with David Knight.
[01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:33.814]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m.
[01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:34.895]  on the War Room.
[01:32:34.895 --> 01:32:40.038]  We're gonna have our crew in DC at the White House Summit on social media.
[01:32:40.038 --> 01:32:45.221]  We're gonna be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:47.022]  So everybody, share that link.
[01:32:47.022 --> 01:32:50.925]  Infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[01:32:52.222 --> 01:33:01.278]  8am central at Infowars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:01.278 --> 01:33:03.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:19.750]  You found it.
[01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:21.791]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:31.392]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Will Johnson.
[01:33:31.392 --> 01:33:32.013]  Welcome back.
[01:33:32.013 --> 01:33:32.593]  Welcome back.
[01:33:32.593 --> 01:33:33.833]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:35.133]  My name is Will Johnson.
[01:33:35.133 --> 01:33:41.574]  It is an honor and a privilege to be sitting in this chair as a guest host for the AJ Show.
[01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:45.055]  So in this next segment, we are going to have Ben Garrison on with us.
[01:33:46.192 --> 01:33:48.693]  Beautiful artwork that he has created.
[01:33:48.693 --> 01:33:56.255]  The memes, the message that he puts across has absolutely ticked off the left.
[01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:58.896]  So I already automatically love this man.
[01:33:58.896 --> 01:34:00.237]  I mean, he does everything.
[01:34:00.237 --> 01:34:01.597]  He's fighting against the left.
[01:34:01.597 --> 01:34:05.499]  I mean, everything he's putting out from what I've been seeing has been completely accurate.
[01:34:05.499 --> 01:34:07.559]  Nothing has been a lie.
[01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:11.401]  He's just putting out his story, his message, and I wish I could draw half
[01:34:12.441 --> 01:34:13.862]  As well as he does.
[01:34:13.862 --> 01:34:16.303]  So without further ado, Mr. Garrison, thank you for joining me.
[01:34:16.303 --> 01:34:18.684]  Thanks for having me.
[01:34:18.684 --> 01:34:19.364]  It's an honor.
[01:34:19.364 --> 01:34:20.265]  It's an honor.
[01:34:20.265 --> 01:34:22.306]  So let me ask you this.
[01:34:22.306 --> 01:34:25.147]  So a lot of people already know who you are.
[01:34:25.147 --> 01:34:30.950]  How did you get started in doing the memes and the graphics like this?
[01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:33.731]  And why did you do it?
[01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:35.151]  I got started 10 years ago.
[01:34:35.151 --> 01:34:37.393]  That's why we just put out a
[01:34:39.261 --> 01:34:43.483]  A big coffee table book to celebrate our 10-year anniversary of drawing cartoons.
[01:34:43.483 --> 01:35:02.314]  I say our because my wife, Tina, also occasionally draws cartoons, but I started drawing them in 2009 as a way to protest the banker bailout, the great banker bailout, where everybody got bonuses, taxpayer bonuses, and the bankers got rewarded for their criminal acts.
[01:35:02.314 --> 01:35:04.775]  That's what it boiled down to, and I got very angry.
[01:35:04.775 --> 01:35:07.637]  That's when I started listening to Alex Jones about that time, too.
[01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:16.319]  I would listen to him, and he was just a fountainhead of great metaphors and very visually-oriented language.
[01:35:16.319 --> 01:35:20.042]  And I would hear him say something, and I would think to myself, well, that's a cartoon.
[01:35:20.042 --> 01:35:20.882]  I've got to draw it.
[01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:31.970]  And the first one I did that he said was the March of Tyranny, where I showed two legs marching along, connected by the Federal Reserve at the top.
[01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:34.631]  That's one of my most famous cartoons.
[01:35:34.631 --> 01:35:36.813]  Well, that was based on something Alex said.
[01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:41.003]  But that was my first firewall cartoon and that came about in 2010.
[01:35:41.003 --> 01:35:53.208]  And I've been drawing him ever since, but you know, I've had quite a rocky road to start out with because I got attacked by trolls and got my reputation ruined.
[01:35:53.208 --> 01:36:00.050]  And I went through a lot of pain and suffering until we finally turned it around when Trump was elected in 2016.
[01:36:01.934 --> 01:36:05.316]  That's when my wife Tina and I, we decided we're just going to draw more cartoons.
[01:36:05.316 --> 01:36:09.437]  Instead of giving up, we'll just draw more and more of them and see what happens.
[01:36:09.437 --> 01:36:12.679]  And what happens, what happened was, became a big success.
[01:36:12.679 --> 01:36:19.021]  And I'm really shocked because it's very difficult to be able to draw cartoons for a living.
[01:36:19.021 --> 01:36:24.424]  So I'm able to do that now, which is very gratifying, especially after all the money they cost me for many years.
[01:36:25.467 --> 01:36:26.268]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:36:26.268 --> 01:36:27.629]  It's beautiful artwork.
[01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:31.233]  I wish I could just, like I said, I wish I could do just a quarter.
[01:36:31.233 --> 01:36:34.136]  You know, I can't even draw a straight line.
[01:36:34.136 --> 01:36:35.237]  I'll just take practice.
[01:36:35.237 --> 01:36:36.639]  You know, I draw all the time.
[01:36:36.639 --> 01:36:41.564]  So if you want to be an artist, if anybody out there wants to be an artist, you could do it.
[01:36:41.564 --> 01:36:43.285]  It's just you got to draw every day.
[01:36:43.285 --> 01:36:44.387]  It's just like a musician.
[01:36:44.387 --> 01:36:45.588]  You have to practice every day.
[01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:48.406]  So, you know, I've been drawn pretty much all my life.
[01:36:48.406 --> 01:36:52.728]  And when I first started out, I was lousy and I knew a lot of people still think I am.
[01:36:52.728 --> 01:36:56.910]  But I, you know, I had to do a lot of criticism, a lot of what I call inertia.
[01:36:56.910 --> 01:37:03.094]  There's the voice of inertia always tells you negative things to keep you from doing what you want to do.
[01:37:03.094 --> 01:37:07.436]  You have to overcome this voice of inertia.
[01:37:07.436 --> 01:37:09.877]  The inertia tells you, we'll do it later.
[01:37:09.877 --> 01:37:10.718]  Procrastinate.
[01:37:10.718 --> 01:37:11.338]  Don't do it now.
[01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:17.016]  No, when I feel that inertia, I tell myself, no, we're going to do it now.
[01:37:17.016 --> 01:37:20.340]  Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, do it, do it now!
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:28.910]  So let me ask you, have you ever drawn one where it could be perceived as being anti-American?
[01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.230]  No.
[01:37:50.929 --> 01:37:52.711]  And you're getting the left to attack you.
[01:37:52.711 --> 01:37:55.694]  So it only means that you're doing the right thing, my opinion.
[01:37:55.694 --> 01:38:01.419]  Because just like me speaking out, being a black male, and I speak out against what the left is doing, they attack me.
[01:38:01.419 --> 01:38:03.080]  I've had the death threats.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.562]  It's almost to the point to where it's just a normal thing.
[01:38:05.562 --> 01:38:08.665]  And if I'm not getting the death threats, I'm not doing my job.
[01:38:08.665 --> 01:38:10.647]  So you doing the cartoons, I'm pretty sure
[01:38:11.287 --> 01:38:11.828]  Well, yeah.
[01:38:11.828 --> 01:38:13.389]  I mean, in the early days, that really bothered me.
[01:38:13.389 --> 01:38:14.991]  I hated being called a Nazi.
[01:38:14.991 --> 01:38:15.951]  I hated being called a racist.
[01:38:30.769 --> 01:38:50.169]  And I would do I kind of actually I went into like a virtue signaling mode to prove to the world that I wasn't a racist and a Nazi and I wrote a book that was a flop because the book is predicated on me being a virtue signaler trying to defend myself and then after that flop I said to heck with it I don't care anymore and I sort of got to this point where
[01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:53.779]  People can say whatever they like, and it doesn't bother me at all.
[01:38:53.779 --> 01:38:56.421]  I've kind of grown a thick hide that I didn't have before.
[01:38:56.421 --> 01:39:01.323]  And I sort of developed a little grace after all the insults that I fielded on it.
[01:39:01.323 --> 01:39:08.027]  And like you, I got, you know, a lot of... You get a lot of flack when you're over the target, and you get insulted, and you get death threats.
[01:39:08.027 --> 01:39:15.591]  I've got all the... As a matter of fact, here's the... The Socialist Democratic... The Democratic Socialist Left
[01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:21.503]  Their arguments really boil down to insults, and I have a little list here.
[01:39:21.503 --> 01:39:26.247]  I typed up a little list of all the insults I've been called, and I'll just go down the line.
[01:39:26.247 --> 01:39:31.751]  Okay, so when I first started drawing anti-Obama cartoons, my course was called a racist.
[01:39:31.751 --> 01:39:35.013]  When I questioned his birth certificate, I was called a birther.
[01:39:35.013 --> 01:39:38.476]  When I drew anti-Hillary cartoons, I was called a sexist.
[01:39:38.476 --> 01:39:43.420]  When I criticized taxpayer-funded abortion, I was called anti-feminist and misogynist.
[01:39:44.119 --> 01:39:49.343]  When I criticized the idea of America giving out free stuff to everyone on earth, I was called a hater.
[01:39:49.343 --> 01:39:53.807]  When I drew anti-open border cartoons, I was called a xenophobe.
[01:39:53.807 --> 01:39:58.491]  When I drew anti-Sharia law in America cartoons, I was called an Islamophobe.
[01:39:58.491 --> 01:40:01.133]  When I criticized the trans praise, I was called a bigot.
[01:40:01.133 --> 01:40:04.335]  When I criticized vaccine abuse, I was called anti-science.
[01:40:04.335 --> 01:40:09.239]  When I criticized Al Gore and his global warming, I was called a climate denier.
[01:40:09.239 --> 01:40:13.503]  And when I praised Trump for his America first nationalism, I was called a Nazi.
[01:40:14.417 --> 01:40:25.240]  But especially when I drew, and this has been ongoing, when I draw anti-Federal Reserve cartoons, I'm always constantly smeared as anti-Semitic.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:33.902]  And I'm not anti-Semitic, but the fact that Soros is out there, you know, pulling the strings, and the Rothschilds are pulling his strings.
[01:40:33.902 --> 01:40:38.523]  These people exist, and they're not doing good things for humanity.
[01:40:39.831 --> 01:40:43.014]  When you criticize them, it's almost like a knee-jerk reaction.
[01:40:43.014 --> 01:40:46.917]  You're supposedly to be this raging anti-Semitic.
[01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:54.364]  Well, I'm not anti-Semitic and I'm not going to let any of these names that they call me stop me from drawing more cartoons.
[01:40:54.364 --> 01:40:57.026]  That's just the way it is.
[01:40:57.026 --> 01:40:58.267]  This is what happens when you
[01:40:59.870 --> 01:41:00.110]  This is
[01:41:18.121 --> 01:41:20.122]  On both sides of war is profiting.
[01:41:20.122 --> 01:41:23.365]  They control the purse strings of the royalty and the governments.
[01:41:23.365 --> 01:41:25.426]  They're always behind the scenes.
[01:41:25.426 --> 01:41:33.211]  They want to make it so that it's some sort of a conspiracy theory that they even exist.
[01:41:33.211 --> 01:41:34.852]  Well, they do exist.
[01:41:34.852 --> 01:41:38.274]  They were instrumental in helping start the Federal Reserve, which
[01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:40.151]  Sure.
[01:41:49.392 --> 01:41:51.434]  So I'm going to continue to speak out at the Federal Reserve.
[01:41:51.434 --> 01:41:54.316]  They can call me all the names in the world they want.
[01:41:54.316 --> 01:41:55.957]  It's not going to stop me.
[01:41:55.957 --> 01:42:06.504]  You know, so instead of them taking the message that you're putting into the cartoons, they want to take it and twist it to try to say something completely different, what it's not.
[01:42:06.504 --> 01:42:09.787]  And that's like the normal tactic of the left.
[01:42:10.447 --> 01:42:20.575]  You know, they take everything and twist it, instead of just looking at what it is, the message that you have in the cartoon, which is completely accurate.
[01:42:20.575 --> 01:42:29.343]  All the cartoons that I've looked at, that I've seen, and I didn't even realize they were yours until today, which is, and I've seen so many of them and seen many of them go viral.
[01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:32.604]  They're not looking at the message.
[01:42:32.604 --> 01:42:35.306]  I think maybe it is that they are looking at the message.
[01:42:35.306 --> 01:42:43.150]  They just don't want people to recognize what the message is, so they deflect and try to get everyone to look at something else than what the truth is.
[01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:54.055]  So right after this break, we're going to come back and we're going to talk more with Ben Garrison about the cartoons and how he is doing today in this fight against the tyrannical left.
[01:42:54.055 --> 01:42:55.636]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:42:57.995 --> 01:43:02.380]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:10.029]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:43:10.029 --> 01:43:12.892]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[01:43:13.272 --> 01:43:13.932]  I don't know.
[01:43:32.717 --> 01:43:33.658]  I like to be expanding.
[01:43:33.658 --> 01:43:34.438]  I like to be winning.
[01:43:34.438 --> 01:43:35.158]  I like to be fighting.
[01:43:35.158 --> 01:43:36.339]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:43:36.339 --> 01:43:37.219]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:43:37.219 --> 01:43:38.840]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.040]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.101]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:43:41.101 --> 01:43:42.421]  We never have time to get in a dry dock.
[01:43:42.421 --> 01:43:44.122]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:43:44.122 --> 01:43:48.804]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:43:48.804 --> 01:43:50.805]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:43:50.805 --> 01:43:55.107]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the Chai Comps.

[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:00.760]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:09.262]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:45:09.262 --> 01:45:21.344]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:45:21.344 --> 01:45:24.405]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[01:45:24.605 --> 01:45:26.626]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:45:54.525 --> 01:45:56.446]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:45:56.446 --> 01:45:58.427]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:45:58.427 --> 01:46:09.653]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:46:09.653 --> 01:46:13.775]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:46:13.775 --> 01:46:16.476]  The world is going to change.
[01:46:16.476 --> 01:46:23.140]  And how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.902]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:46:25.902 --> 01:46:28.585]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:46:28.585 --> 01:46:32.208]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:39.114]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[01:46:39.114 --> 01:46:44.460]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[01:47:01.285 --> 01:47:03.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.915 --> 01:47:17.605]  We're good.
[01:47:28.556 --> 01:47:29.556]  Welcome back.
[01:47:29.556 --> 01:47:30.537]  My name is Will Johnson.
[01:47:30.537 --> 01:47:37.919]  I am sitting in for Alex Jones on the InfoWars Show.
[01:47:37.919 --> 01:47:40.299]  Today we have Ben Garrison with us.
[01:47:40.299 --> 01:47:42.860]  We're talking about the cartoons that he's created.
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:47.021]  I can't even... I have a marker and I'm like, how can I do this?
[01:47:47.021 --> 01:47:47.561]  I can't do it.
[01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:48.161]  I can't do it.
[01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.622]  And just the different shades.
[01:47:49.622 --> 01:47:55.883]  I like, you know, I do some graphics, but not nearly anything as good as Ben Garrison.
[01:47:55.883 --> 01:47:56.564]  Ben,
[01:47:58.004 --> 01:48:22.737]  So, you've been doing this for about 10 years, and you started off and you've done everything that's been pro-American, and now you're doing stuff that's pro-Trump, and you've been attacked, I've been attacked, and because we've both, you know, we've both been attacked because we show our support for America, we show our support for President Trump, and, you know, with all the attacks coming,
[01:48:23.357 --> 01:48:35.885]  And then they, like I was talking about in the last segment, how they take everything, instead of just looking at the message, when in your cartoons, your message, the message is so accurate.
[01:48:35.885 --> 01:48:39.207]  And I think that's the problem that they have with it, because
[01:48:41.078 --> 01:48:46.640]  It attracts children to look at the cartoon for one and children are not dumb.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.020]  They will grab on to what you're saying in these messages.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:59.923]  So what is what is the I guess what's the ratio between adults and children that look at your graphics or do you even know the statistics on that?
[01:48:59.923 --> 01:49:01.523]  Well, I don't know.
[01:49:01.523 --> 01:49:04.504]  I don't know what our demographics really are.
[01:49:05.782 --> 01:49:11.764]  We've got, you know, I think we've got close to 180,000 Twitter followers now, which is pretty incredible.
[01:49:11.764 --> 01:49:15.985]  Of course, you know, I think we're a shadow band half the time.
[01:49:15.985 --> 01:49:22.207]  But, you know, you use the word how the left likes to deflect things.
[01:49:23.117 --> 01:49:25.718]  That's exactly what they do, but they use a word for it.
[01:49:25.718 --> 01:49:33.323]  They always say, I noticed this common trend because I got somebody write me the other day and used the same word, and the word is dog whistle.
[01:49:33.323 --> 01:49:36.104]  Well, this cartoon is a dog whistle for this.
[01:49:36.104 --> 01:49:44.269]  It's a dog whistle for anti-Semitism, or it's a dog whistle for racism, or it's a dog whistle for whatever insult they attach to it.
[01:49:44.269 --> 01:49:51.373]  So, in other words, they want to hijack the cartoon and say, well, this is what it really means, and what it really means is what
[01:49:52.356 --> 01:50:05.101]  They use whatever insult they use to attack you to get you kicked off of social media, to get your employers to fire you, to get, you know, basically to de-platform you and make you broke.
[01:50:05.101 --> 01:50:16.586]  And that's something that a lot of people are afraid of now because they're afraid if they get and use their free speech they might say something offensive, you know.
[01:50:17.925 --> 01:50:22.810]  It's a way they do this to limit our free speech.
[01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:31.598]  And it keeps getting pared down where you can only say, you know, for once, I got a ban from Facebook once for saying tranny instead of trans.
[01:50:31.598 --> 01:50:33.640]  You can't say tranny, you have to say trans.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.561]  This is ridiculous.
[01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:36.302]  There's no such thing as a trans anyway.
[01:50:36.302 --> 01:50:38.224]  I mean, a man cannot be a woman.
[01:50:38.224 --> 01:50:39.665]  I mean, that's just impossible.
[01:50:39.665 --> 01:50:40.766]  Scientifically impossible.
[01:50:40.766 --> 01:50:43.309]  But you're supposed to pretend and go along with this delusion.
[01:50:44.091 --> 01:50:54.249]  But that's just something that I always go through, but it's funny how this word dog whistle always comes up because they want to hijack what I'm drawing instead of saying, this is what it means, it's right in front of you.
[01:50:54.249 --> 01:50:56.433]  No, it really means this.
[01:50:56.433 --> 01:50:57.595]  It's funny how they operate.
[01:50:59.105 --> 01:50:59.545]  It is.
[01:50:59.545 --> 01:51:11.434]  I was talking with David Knight how, you know, every time something comes out they, like for example, 4th of July, they're trying to say that it was racist, it's all about President Trump, instead of it being about America.
[01:51:11.434 --> 01:51:14.416]  They tried to make everything out to be racist.
[01:51:14.416 --> 01:51:16.458]  Same thing with Nike.
[01:51:16.458 --> 01:51:24.043]  You know what, actually the producers here, so I have some shades, or not shades, these are my glasses, and
[01:51:25.044 --> 01:51:31.889]  These are, I purchased these before the whole Nike thing came out and I'm gonna do this on camera.
[01:51:31.889 --> 01:51:35.692]  Maybe we can get a docu cam shot here of me doing this.
[01:51:35.692 --> 01:51:37.754]  So this is, these are Nike glasses.
[01:51:37.754 --> 01:51:51.685]  I had no idea that Nike would be doing this so I'm going to mark it out because I can't support an organization that is so anti-american and I'm gonna mark these out until I can't afford to buy some new glasses.
[01:51:52.385 --> 01:51:54.607]  I didn't know she made glasses.
[01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:59.531]  You know, I mean, it was really sad because they're pretty decent glasses.
[01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:04.836]  I guess it's the lens that really count, not the frame.
[01:52:04.836 --> 01:52:14.464]  So, but anyways, so how do you get inspired to draw the cartoons that you do?
[01:52:14.464 --> 01:52:18.787]  I mean, what, you know, like, oh, this happens, and then what's the process?
[01:52:18.787 --> 01:52:20.869]  Like, oh, that's good, and then you go with it.
[01:52:22.153 --> 01:52:38.050]  Well, the process, and this is the difficult thing, is trying to come up with the idea, but as a commercial artist, I have my own commercial art business for about 20 years, and I was trained to think in visual metaphors.
[01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:41.694]  So I think in terms of clichés and metaphors that can be made new again.
[01:52:42.623 --> 01:52:47.670]  So that's kind of a foundation, but a lot of people think I'm funny and I'm really not funny.
[01:52:47.670 --> 01:52:52.055]  I'm a real serious, you know, I'm kind of an angry guy more than funny.
[01:52:52.055 --> 01:52:57.502]  I can't think of anything more difficult to get on this stage and try to entertain people as a comedian.
[01:52:57.502 --> 01:52:59.405]  That's got to be tremendous pressure.
[01:53:00.197 --> 01:53:09.063]  So I never consider anything, any subject or topic that I'm going to make a cartoon about, my first thought is never, well, how can I make this funny?
[01:53:09.063 --> 01:53:10.884]  Too many cartoonists do that.
[01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:14.827]  They just want to boil it down to some funny gag.
[01:53:14.827 --> 01:53:19.991]  Whereas I want to go more toward satire.
[01:53:19.991 --> 01:53:24.414]  And if there's any humor in the cartoon, it's kind of derived from the satire.
[01:53:24.414 --> 01:53:27.636]  By satire, I mean, satire is more of a complex thing.
[01:53:28.484 --> 01:53:33.266]  So what I want to do is go after them by means of caricature.
[01:53:33.266 --> 01:53:36.207]  I want to mock their sanctimony.
[01:53:36.207 --> 01:53:44.369]  I want to show, you know, hey, I want to, in a visual form, show the corrupt things that they're doing and expose them.
[01:53:44.369 --> 01:53:49.551]  Much like Thomas Nast exposed Boss' tweet at Tammany Hall.
[01:53:49.551 --> 01:53:57.534]  I mean, that guy was a hero because he almost single-handedly took down the corruption that was Tammany Hall in New York City.
[01:53:57.984 --> 01:53:58.605]  We're good to go.
[01:54:11.204 --> 01:54:15.468]  This old-time American cartoon, yeah, with plenty of labels on it.
[01:54:15.468 --> 01:54:19.111]  I know the labels bother everybody, but that's an American tradition.
[01:54:19.111 --> 01:54:23.275]  So I'm kind of a real traditional conservative cartoonist.
[01:54:23.275 --> 01:54:26.177]  Yeah, not only that, you're invoking people to think.
[01:54:26.177 --> 01:54:32.603]  You're invoking people to like look at something that they're not being presented, you know, with by the mainstream media.
[01:54:32.603 --> 01:54:37.027]  Let's talk about you being invited to the summit with President Trump.
[01:54:38.809 --> 01:54:42.950]  Yeah, I mean, I was pretty surprised.
[01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:45.431]  But when you get invited by the president, you've got to go, right?
[01:54:45.431 --> 01:54:55.734]  So, okay, if I'm going to go to Washington, D.C., I don't have a big wallet, but if you're going to go to Washington, D.C., you've got to stay at the Trump International Hotel, right?
[01:54:55.734 --> 01:54:59.095]  So that's what I booked a couple nights there, and I'm going to fly out tomorrow.
[01:55:00.356 --> 01:55:03.277]  And it's really exciting and surreal at the same time.
[01:55:03.277 --> 01:55:18.043]  I mean, I sure don't know how to solve the problem of social media censorship, but I will sure keep my eyes open and my ears open to any kind of cartoon fodder that can come from anybody's suggestion.
[01:55:18.043 --> 01:55:19.043]  I'll draw it.
[01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:41.181]  Yeah, you know, I've been to the White House twice and I would love to, you know, talk directly to President Trump like one-on-one and tell him that, you know, the censorship, because it's taking place, that many people that are sharing his posts, his tweets, they're being shadow banned to where a lot of people can't see it.
[01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:48.345]  And the main reason why they're doing that is because they want the American people to believe that President Trump does not have the support
[01:55:49.218 --> 01:55:50.478]  From the American people.
[01:55:50.478 --> 01:55:53.839]  Or the American people are not supporting President Trump.
[01:55:53.839 --> 01:56:00.521]  So, and I'm pretty sure when you go there that you're going to get a whole bunch of ideas on different cartoons to draw after this.
[01:56:00.521 --> 01:56:02.262]  I can just see that coming.
[01:56:02.262 --> 01:56:07.644]  And I would love to see some of these that you're going to produce.
[01:56:07.644 --> 01:56:11.205]  So, have you thought about any before you're going?
[01:56:11.205 --> 01:56:14.246]  Or have you started on any for the summit about the censorship?
[01:56:14.246 --> 01:56:15.386]  Because I would love to see that.
[01:56:17.108 --> 01:56:17.809]  No, I haven't.
[01:56:17.809 --> 01:56:19.891]  I haven't yet, but I definitely will.
[01:56:19.891 --> 01:56:22.773]  I mean, I'm just, I'm still, it's all kind of surreal to me.
[01:56:22.773 --> 01:56:25.196]  I just, am I really going to go to the White House?
[01:56:25.196 --> 01:56:25.616]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.616 --> 01:56:27.938]  I was kind of worried yesterday.
[01:56:27.938 --> 01:56:35.325]  Well, maybe Trump's going to resume his invitation because everybody's trying so hard to, you know, I'm, I'm a libertarian.
[01:56:35.325 --> 01:56:39.329]  I'm, I'm, I like the constitution.
[01:56:39.329 --> 01:56:40.190]  You know, I support,
[01:56:41.328 --> 01:56:43.329]  A wall on our southern border.
[01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:48.350]  But mostly, I think Trump's biggest accomplishment thus far is keeping us out of war.
[01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:52.131]  I mean, the way he handled the Iran situation was brilliant.
[01:56:52.131 --> 01:57:03.254]  And if he could keep doing that, I mean, he'll have my lasting devotion because that's the most important thing is to keep us out of another war, especially a world war, which a lot of these
[01:57:05.083 --> 01:57:07.965]  You know, neocons and central banker types, that's what they want.
[01:57:07.965 --> 01:57:10.886]  That's what Hillary would have had us in a war by now.
[01:57:10.886 --> 01:57:14.488]  And if you think if Trump was elected, do you think Jeffrey Epstein would be going down?
[01:57:14.488 --> 01:57:15.129]  No way.
[01:57:15.129 --> 01:57:15.929]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:15.929 --> 01:57:24.454]  Maybe that might be a good cartoon saying, you know, showing that Trump is pulling away the suitcase and the left is probably trying to take the suitcase from him so they can start a war.
[01:57:25.194 --> 01:57:25.674]  Something.
[01:57:25.674 --> 01:57:26.435]  I don't know.
[01:57:26.435 --> 01:57:27.515]  That was just an idea.
[01:57:27.515 --> 01:57:28.856]  I would love to see something.
[01:57:28.856 --> 01:57:30.236]  I'm pretty sure you can think of something.
[01:57:30.236 --> 01:57:31.317]  The wheels are turning.
[01:57:31.317 --> 01:57:32.877]  So this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:32.877 --> 01:57:33.818]  My name is Will Johnson.
[01:57:33.818 --> 01:57:36.039]  We have Ben Garrison with us.
[01:57:36.039 --> 01:57:37.299]  I don't know if you can stay with us, Ben.
[01:57:37.299 --> 01:57:38.800]  We'll see.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.501]  We'll talk more after the break.
[01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:40.841]  All right.
[01:57:40.841 --> 01:57:41.381]  See you in a minute.
[01:57:47.230 --> 01:57:50.611]  The second American revolution is happening now.
[01:57:50.611 --> 01:57:52.892]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[01:57:52.892 --> 01:57:57.933]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-god world government.
[01:57:57.933 --> 01:58:01.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding.
[01:58:01.594 --> 01:58:02.515]  And we make it easy.
[01:58:02.515 --> 01:58:06.236]  That's why we're launching our biggest sale yet.
[01:58:06.236 --> 01:58:07.376]  $17.76 worldwide.
[01:58:07.376 --> 01:58:10.117]  Bigger than our Christmas specials.

[01:58:14.178 --> 01:58:14.458]  Down to 25% off.

[01:58:33.452 --> 01:58:35.094]  I thank you for your support.
[01:58:35.094 --> 01:58:36.795]  The Globalists hope you don't.
[01:58:36.795 --> 01:58:39.697]  Whatever you do, choose what side you're on and take action.
[01:58:48.404 --> 01:58:49.725]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.725 --> 01:58:50.505]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.505 --> 01:58:51.086]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.086 --> 01:58:51.426]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:51.426 --> 01:58:54.448]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.448 --> 01:59:00.552]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.552 --> 01:59:09.238]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.238 --> 01:59:10.098]  That's it.
[01:59:10.098 --> 01:59:13.160]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.002]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.002 --> 01:59:17.303]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.463 --> 01:59:18.223]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.223 --> 01:59:23.666]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.666 --> 01:59:26.448]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.448 --> 01:59:28.509]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.509 --> 01:59:37.773]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.773 --> 01:59:39.674]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:39.674 --> 01:59:46.157]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.157 --> 01:59:47.098]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.172 --> 01:59:53.815]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.690 --> 02:00:17.711]  Alright, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.711 --> 02:00:19.472]  My name is Will Johnson.
[02:00:19.472 --> 02:00:24.635]  We have our guest with us, Ben Garrison, cartoonist.
[02:00:24.635 --> 02:00:25.995]  Beautiful artwork.
[02:00:25.995 --> 02:00:28.076]  Beautiful, beautiful artwork.
[02:00:28.076 --> 02:00:30.317]  Stirring up the pot.
[02:00:30.317 --> 02:00:32.418]  Making the left upset.
[02:00:32.418 --> 02:00:36.640]  Which is a good thing because the left, they do not like reality.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:40.582]  So Ben Garrison, through his cartoons, he will tell the truth.
[02:00:41.462 --> 02:00:43.364]  And the left doesn't like it.
[02:00:43.364 --> 02:00:45.946]  And Ben, thank you for staying with me.
[02:00:45.946 --> 02:00:47.387]  It's an honor.
[02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:50.870]  So, you know, I've been to the White House twice.
[02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:53.332]  And both times it's just absolutely wonderful.
[02:00:53.332 --> 02:00:56.475]  I went in and they had live music.
[02:00:56.475 --> 02:00:58.236]  He had food for us.
[02:00:58.236 --> 02:01:04.361]  I went with the Black Summit meeting through Turning Point USA.
[02:01:04.361 --> 02:01:06.503]  And it was just an awesome time.
[02:01:06.963 --> 02:01:11.085]  And you know, they always try to depict President Trump being racist when he's not racist.
[02:01:11.085 --> 02:01:14.967]  You know, we're sitting in the White House, many black people.
[02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:23.192]  But the thing I like about President Trump is that he doesn't go out and try to make it look like that I'm doing this, try to get black people.
[02:01:23.192 --> 02:01:26.693]  He didn't even come out and say, look, everybody, I did this with black people.
[02:01:26.693 --> 02:01:27.474]  Look, look, look.
[02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:46.181]  He'll just do it and then the mainstream media they don't want to promote it because they don't want people to believe that he's doing things for black people and that's another way that they go to try to make it look like President Trump doesn't support black people or they want to make it they want to try to fight everything that he does when it's helping black people.
[02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:54.903]  So, you have some, the producer told me that you have some cartoons where they try to say that you're anti-semitic.
[02:01:54.903 --> 02:01:56.123]  They're never ending.
[02:01:56.123 --> 02:01:57.964]  It's never ending.
[02:01:57.964 --> 02:02:02.205]  So, what has been, I guess, the most viral cartoon that you have created?
[02:02:02.205 --> 02:02:06.306]  The one that created the most, I guess, chaos?
[02:02:06.306 --> 02:02:10.827]  And is that the same cartoon that got you recognized by President Trump?
[02:02:12.944 --> 02:02:21.744]  Well, I've had a lot of cartoons that... I guess if you want to talk about this one single cartoon that I drew that upset the most people...
[02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:38.823]  It was the Michelle Obama one, where I made her look sort of like masculine and compared her to... And I kind of did this, you know, I did this cartoon for our Patreon supporters, you know, because they get to see stuff for contributing.
[02:02:38.823 --> 02:02:41.605]  But my wife liked it so much, she released it.
[02:02:41.605 --> 02:02:43.206]  And I, oh boy!
[02:02:45.469 --> 02:02:49.218]  I admit, this isn't really in a bad taste.
[02:02:49.218 --> 02:02:52.867]  I kind of quasi-regretted it, but Michelle, being a man...
[02:02:53.749 --> 02:02:55.170]  It's an internet meme.
[02:02:55.170 --> 02:03:07.122]  And now the fact that the First Lady is also a political activist and she's trying to push these school lunches like some sort of lunch czar.
[02:03:07.122 --> 02:03:08.623]  And I said, well, wait a minute.
[02:03:08.623 --> 02:03:13.628]  Nobody elected Michelle to get in there and tell us what we can and cannot eat.
[02:03:13.628 --> 02:03:15.790]  And she's kind of an authoritarian.
[02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:18.653]  And I said, well, I'm just going to go ahead and go with this meme.
[02:03:19.902 --> 02:03:20.622]  You know what?
[02:03:20.622 --> 02:03:21.623]  I don't know if she's a man.
[02:03:21.623 --> 02:03:24.684]  I have no idea, but there's a lot of suspicious stuff.
[02:03:24.684 --> 02:03:28.645]  When Barack Obama starts calling her Michael... Yes, I saw that.
[02:03:28.645 --> 02:03:33.086]  It's like, this is a little weird, you know?
[02:03:33.086 --> 02:03:37.088]  But I still get flack for this cartoon.
[02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:43.272]  You know, I think it was, I forgot who said, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
[02:03:43.272 --> 02:03:51.976]  This really put me on the map because the Daily Mail ran a story condemning me and all the left media was condemning me.
[02:03:51.976 --> 02:03:52.436]  Really?
[02:03:52.436 --> 02:03:59.219]  That cartoon cost me a longtime friendship, somebody I knew for like almost 30 years.
[02:03:59.219 --> 02:04:01.020]  And I got, you know, unfriended.
[02:04:01.923 --> 02:04:07.225]  So, you know, I've lost a lot of my old friends from my newspaper days who are most liberal, you know.
[02:04:07.225 --> 02:04:14.909]  When you do something like this, I mean, you're going to ruffle a lot of feathers.
[02:04:14.909 --> 02:04:18.711]  You know, so why do these people think that they're off-limits?
[02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:19.931]  You know, it's crazy.
[02:04:19.931 --> 02:04:21.752]  They believe that they're off-limits.
[02:04:21.752 --> 02:04:22.692]  They're not off-limits.
[02:04:22.692 --> 02:04:23.673]  They're public figures.
[02:04:24.093 --> 02:04:29.236]  They can talk about me, they can talk about you, they can be as nasty as they want, and that's okay.
[02:04:29.236 --> 02:04:37.800]  But if you can't talk about Michelle Obama, you can't talk about the left, you can't talk about AOC, then they want to demonize you.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:46.264]  Let's talk more about it after this break, because I think this is a good topic, a hot topic, and the left probably don't want us to talk about this at all.
[02:04:46.264 --> 02:04:48.265]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[02:04:48.265 --> 02:04:52.407]  My name is Will Johnson, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[02:04:57.142 --> 02:05:13.832]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:05:13.832 --> 02:05:17.914]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[02:05:17.914 --> 02:05:21.236]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[02:05:21.596 --> 02:05:23.338]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:05:23.338 --> 02:05:27.582]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:05:27.582 --> 02:05:35.530]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:38.252]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:05:38.252 --> 02:05:43.157]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:05:43.157 --> 02:05:44.338]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:05:44.338 --> 02:05:45.159]  They have side effects.
[02:05:45.319 --> 02:05:49.902]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[02:05:49.902 --> 02:05:51.803]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:57.046 --> 02:06:00.768]  1776 worldwide.
[02:06:00.768 --> 02:06:03.929]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[02:06:03.929 --> 02:06:04.670]  What does it really mean?
[02:06:04.670 --> 02:06:09.272]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[02:06:09.272 --> 02:06:11.172]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[02:06:11.172 --> 02:06:20.076]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[02:06:20.076 --> 02:06:23.118]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[02:06:24.096 --> 02:06:26.677]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at a.m.
[02:06:26.677 --> 02:06:27.657]  with David Knight.
[02:06:27.657 --> 02:06:32.258]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m.
[02:06:32.258 --> 02:06:33.358]  on The War Room.
[02:06:33.358 --> 02:06:35.218]  We're going to have our crew in D.C.
[02:06:35.218 --> 02:06:38.419]  at the White House Summit on social media.
[02:06:38.419 --> 02:06:43.680]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:45.460]  So everybody, share that link.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:49.361]  Infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[02:06:50.291 --> 02:06:52.673]  Alright, welcome back, welcome back!
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:38.553]  So we're talking to Ben Garrison about his cartoons and one of the hot topics is uh he drew one about Michelle Obama kind of getting muscles and you know the whole thing buzz on the internet because could it possibly be that she's a man I don't know you know I don't know I mean I would like to believe that she's a woman you know but you never know
[02:07:39.233 --> 02:07:43.495]  In this day and age and the way they're pushing the whole trans thing and you never know.
[02:07:43.495 --> 02:07:52.561]  And like Ben even mentioned that there's no such thing as a trans, you know, maybe you have transformer, you know, or a, you know, I mean, what else?
[02:07:52.561 --> 02:07:56.203]  A transformer sitting outside, you know, providing energy.
[02:07:56.203 --> 02:08:03.186]  That's the only trans that, you know, really exists in this world, but they don't like it when you don't say or agree with it.
[02:08:04.207 --> 02:08:18.572]  So Ben, we were talking about how they were attacking you because you're, you know, you create this cartoon with Michelle Obama with muscles and then you one with Trump's wife and just, you know, looking really ladylike and immaculate.
[02:08:18.572 --> 02:08:22.613]  And they don't like the fact that you drew something like that.
[02:08:22.613 --> 02:08:23.914]  And I think it's pretty awesome.
[02:08:23.914 --> 02:08:27.095]  I think it's pretty awesome.
[02:08:27.095 --> 02:08:29.155]  Well, this is the kind of stuff you're not allowed to do.
[02:08:29.155 --> 02:08:33.637]  And that's that's the that's the mindset of a lot of the socialists left.
[02:08:34.204 --> 02:08:37.766]  They want to control what you think and what you can say.
[02:08:37.766 --> 02:08:39.307]  They want to channel things.
[02:08:39.307 --> 02:08:43.649]  And if you break out of that channel, then you're going to get, you're going to get whacked.
[02:08:43.649 --> 02:08:49.952]  I mean, they want you to, you know, basically the authoritarian structure, they want you to drink your fluoride.
[02:08:49.952 --> 02:08:51.893]  They want you to take your vaccinations.
[02:08:51.893 --> 02:08:55.115]  They want you to breathe the chemtrails or you're a conspiracy nut.
[02:08:55.115 --> 02:08:57.356]  You don't want you questioning anything.
[02:08:57.356 --> 02:08:59.497]  And so they're under their attack.
[02:08:59.497 --> 02:09:00.178]  Anybody who,
[02:09:01.582 --> 02:09:15.171]  Anybody who starts telling the truth, they kind of want the... It's a weird thing, because if you notice that the Democratic Socialists, I mean, they didn't even have an American flag at their last debate, were they?
[02:09:15.171 --> 02:09:16.231]  True.
[02:09:16.231 --> 02:09:18.693]  And most of them don't really believe in God either.
[02:09:18.693 --> 02:09:23.816]  They may not tell you that directly, but it's like President Xi in China.
[02:09:23.816 --> 02:09:28.319]  I mean, he came out... I remember on TV him talking about he was an atheist.
[02:09:28.319 --> 02:09:29.280]  He didn't believe in God.
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:35.045]  Okay, well now he's the dictator and he's going to be another Mao.
[02:09:35.045 --> 02:09:40.510]  But he's not happy with that, just controlling and forcing everybody to bend to his will.
[02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:42.211]  He also wants to be loved.
[02:09:42.211 --> 02:09:43.893]  He wants to be worshipped.
[02:09:43.893 --> 02:09:46.415]  So that's the same thing with the left.
[02:09:46.415 --> 02:09:47.797]  It's not that the
[02:09:52.242 --> 02:09:52.342]  Well,
[02:10:10.651 --> 02:10:13.513]  You're singled out for a lot of names, calling it ridiculous.
[02:10:29.204 --> 02:10:29.444]  I don't know.
[02:10:49.628 --> 02:10:57.874]  That's telling the truth and they don't like the fact because they're the ones that's being violent and you're just showing it.
[02:10:57.874 --> 02:11:00.295]  And to me, it's free game.
[02:11:00.295 --> 02:11:02.957]  When you're a public figure, you're completely free game.
[02:11:02.957 --> 02:11:07.340]  Have you seen some of the crazy memes that they've done on Alex Jones?
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:11.183]  And there's some of them just really, absolutely disgusting.
[02:11:11.183 --> 02:11:12.444]  But see, that's okay.
[02:11:13.104 --> 02:11:17.516]  It's okay as long as you're doing it to someone that they consider on the right.
[02:11:17.516 --> 02:11:20.424]  But if you do it to someone that's on the left, then it's like, oh, it's a problem.
[02:11:20.424 --> 02:11:20.705]  Go ahead.
[02:11:21.383 --> 02:11:25.645]  Well, the tactic that they're using is what I call is dehumanization.
[02:11:25.645 --> 02:11:33.328]  So when you call somebody a Nazi or a racist, well, those kind of people are lacking in some sort of basic humanity.
[02:11:33.328 --> 02:11:36.630]  It's like what the Catholic Church used to do in the days of the Inquisition.
[02:11:36.630 --> 02:11:39.611]  You got called a heretic, then it's okay to torture you.
[02:11:39.611 --> 02:11:40.551]  Well, you're a heretic.
[02:11:40.551 --> 02:11:42.132]  Why not torture you?
[02:11:42.132 --> 02:11:47.935]  Well, now the Antifa and the left, if they decide that you're a fascist or a Nazi and
[02:11:48.855 --> 02:11:54.318]  Based on no evidence whatsoever other than their feelings, then all of a sudden you're not a person anymore.
[02:11:54.318 --> 02:11:59.460]  You're this kind of like this subhuman entity that, why not hit them?
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:00.541]  Yeah, we need to hit them.
[02:12:00.541 --> 02:12:04.543]  And it becomes, then to them, violence becomes acceptable.
[02:12:04.543 --> 02:12:10.365]  You know, well, punching somebody or throwing a milkshake at somebody or spitting at somebody is never acceptable.
[02:12:10.365 --> 02:12:13.147]  And this is where I disagree with, I forgot who got spit on.
[02:12:13.147 --> 02:12:14.327]  It was Don Jr.
[02:12:14.327 --> 02:12:15.568]  or Eric Trump.
[02:12:16.505 --> 02:12:17.987]  But he dropped the charges.
[02:12:17.987 --> 02:12:21.853]  I think some waitress spit on him at a restaurant.
[02:12:21.853 --> 02:12:23.435]  He should oppress the charges.
[02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.657]  You know what?
[02:12:24.657 --> 02:12:26.059]  You're absolutely right.
[02:12:26.059 --> 02:12:32.508]  That is like the major problem, what I've seen in the past, because you have a lot of people on the right, the conservatives, Republicans.
[02:12:32.888 --> 02:12:36.412]  When they're attacked by some of these on the left, they say, you know what?
[02:12:36.412 --> 02:12:37.353]  Let's just let it go.
[02:12:37.353 --> 02:12:38.074]  Let's just move on.
[02:12:38.074 --> 02:12:43.920]  Because they want to have this perception that they are forgiving, which we are as Christians.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:44.421]  But you know what?
[02:12:44.421 --> 02:12:46.983]  At some point, you have to set an example.
[02:12:46.983 --> 02:12:51.148]  I mean, we can't just allow these people to continue to be violent towards
[02:12:51.828 --> 02:12:54.850]  Conservatives simply because they're supporting President Trump.
[02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:58.372]  I guarantee that they're violent towards you because you support President Trump.
[02:12:58.372 --> 02:12:59.493]  You love this country.
[02:12:59.493 --> 02:13:01.034]  Your cartoons show that.
[02:13:01.034 --> 02:13:01.814]  And they're violent.
[02:13:01.814 --> 02:13:03.035]  They want to be violent to you.
[02:13:03.035 --> 02:13:12.020]  And I'm pretty sure that they're even going to the extent of wanting to shut you down so that you can't draw a cartoon which is exercising your freedom of speech.
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.481]  It is.
[02:13:12.481 --> 02:13:12.781]  100%.
[02:13:12.781 --> 02:13:14.242]  Right.
[02:13:14.242 --> 02:13:18.664]  Well, you know, conservatives tend to be more forgiving.
[02:13:18.664 --> 02:13:20.285]  The left never forgives or forgets.
[02:13:20.285 --> 02:13:20.886]  No, they don't.
[02:13:21.437 --> 02:13:23.240]  He's got like a Rolodex in their brain.
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:25.223]  Okay, this person, there's Ben Garrison.
[02:13:25.223 --> 02:13:27.126]  Yeah, anti-Semite, anti-Semite Nazi.
[02:13:27.126 --> 02:13:31.492]  You know, they got all these little cards that they have ready to smear people.
[02:13:31.492 --> 02:13:36.700]  But you know, it's just like the Republicans, you know, the Democrats are shown as donkeys.
[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:37.101]  Donkey!
[02:13:37.581 --> 02:13:41.142]  And then you have Republicans represent like their elephant.
[02:13:41.142 --> 02:13:42.803]  Elephants don't forget anything, right?
[02:13:42.803 --> 02:13:48.404]  But in this case, when it comes to something that the left doesn't like, when it's to the right, they remember all of it.
[02:13:48.404 --> 02:13:49.845]  It's like you just said, it's like a Rolodex.
[02:13:49.845 --> 02:13:50.945]  Okay, let's go through this.
[02:13:50.945 --> 02:13:52.065]  Oh, yeah, I remember this.
[02:13:52.065 --> 02:13:53.006]  I remember that.
[02:13:53.006 --> 02:13:54.846]  They let nothing go.
[02:13:54.846 --> 02:13:59.568]  And then they attack people on the same thing that they do and keep it going.
[02:13:59.568 --> 02:14:00.308]  They don't let it go.
[02:14:01.039 --> 02:14:01.879]  That especially.
[02:14:01.879 --> 02:14:05.061]  Hillary's always attacking others on stuff that she did.
[02:14:05.061 --> 02:14:08.662]  I mean, she was the one that was colluding with Russia.
[02:14:08.662 --> 02:14:12.543]  Yes.
[02:14:12.543 --> 02:14:14.684]  What are you going to do about this?
[02:14:14.684 --> 02:14:21.387]  If we don't do something, if we don't push back, I mean, if we accept getting milkshakes thrown at us, then they're going to start throwing acid.
[02:14:21.387 --> 02:14:23.488]  They're talking about throwing acid.
[02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.948]  I forgot what kind of acid it was.
[02:14:24.948 --> 02:14:26.009]  It wasn't the kind that the
[02:14:28.058 --> 02:14:32.602]  Those Muslims were throwing at women or whatever, but it's still bad.
[02:14:32.602 --> 02:14:33.703]  It still blinds you.
[02:14:33.703 --> 02:14:39.228]  Yeah, it's acid and they're talking about doing concrete in the milkshake as well and trying to get into people's hair.
[02:14:39.228 --> 02:14:41.309]  Quit drawing concrete.
[02:14:41.309 --> 02:14:42.711]  I mean, this is Antifa.
[02:14:43.271 --> 02:14:43.931]  This is them.
[02:14:43.931 --> 02:14:51.416]  I saw the one you had the drawing where Antifa look like the swastika and and you know I think and they're being aggressive trying to attack.
[02:14:51.416 --> 02:15:04.364]  I mean they go to no end and your cartoons are absolutely wonderful and I love the fact that it shows exactly the truth and they don't like the truth being presented in such a simple way.
[02:15:04.364 --> 02:15:05.485]  The drawings aren't simple.
[02:15:05.985 --> 02:15:06.986]  I mean, I can't draw like that.
[02:15:06.986 --> 02:15:13.711]  The drawings aren't simple, but the message comes across in your drawings and your cartoons are so simple.
[02:15:13.711 --> 02:15:16.574]  They're so to the point, straightforward.
[02:15:16.574 --> 02:15:21.958]  And that's the part that they cannot stand at all because it's just the picture says it all.
[02:15:21.958 --> 02:15:24.260]  And it's just it's just remarkable.
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.942]  Hey, Ben, I want to thank you for coming on with me.
[02:15:26.942 --> 02:15:31.146]  Have a wonderful time at the summit with President Trump.
[02:15:31.146 --> 02:15:32.587]  Please tell Trump
[02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:38.014]  Stop the censorship of conservatives and get InfoWars back on Twitter.
[02:15:38.014 --> 02:15:39.135]  Tell him that in his ear.
[02:15:39.135 --> 02:15:41.696]  Please get InfoWars back on Twitter.
[02:15:41.696 --> 02:15:42.817]  Say that, sure.
[02:15:42.817 --> 02:15:45.878]  Alright, hey, thank you, thank you.
[02:15:45.878 --> 02:15:46.478]  Take care.
[02:15:46.478 --> 02:15:47.719]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:47.719 --> 02:15:49.260]  I want to thank everyone for sticking with us.
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:51.101]  We'll be back after this break.
[02:15:55.488 --> 02:15:56.748]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:56.748 --> 02:15:58.049]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:58.049 --> 02:16:01.790]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:02.870]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:04.691]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:04.691 --> 02:16:06.391]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:16:14.194 --> 02:16:15.194]  Bold statement?

[02:16:25.302 --> 02:16:26.523]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:26.523 --> 02:16:30.446]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.446 --> 02:16:31.987]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.987 --> 02:16:34.949]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.949 --> 02:16:40.513]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.513 --> 02:16:41.714]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:41.714 --> 02:16:44.656]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:44.656 --> 02:16:46.878]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:16:46.878 --> 02:16:51.321]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[02:16:55.214 --> 02:16:57.175]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:57.175 --> 02:17:02.478]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:02.478 --> 02:17:04.059]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:04.059 --> 02:17:12.424]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:18.108]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:17:18.288 --> 02:17:20.110]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:22.393]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:17:22.393 --> 02:17:26.778]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:17:26.778 --> 02:17:28.980]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:17:56.764 --> 02:18:01.608]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[02:18:56.930 --> 02:19:00.072]  1776 worldwide.
[02:19:00.072 --> 02:19:03.215]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[02:19:03.215 --> 02:19:03.975]  What does it really mean?
[02:19:03.975 --> 02:19:08.599]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[02:19:08.599 --> 02:19:10.480]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:19.387]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[02:19:19.387 --> 02:19:22.430]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[02:19:23.396 --> 02:19:25.978]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at a.m.
[02:19:25.978 --> 02:19:26.978]  with David Knight.
[02:19:26.978 --> 02:19:31.581]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m.
[02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:32.662]  on The War Room.
[02:19:32.662 --> 02:19:37.786]  We're gonna have our crew in DC at the White House Summit on social media.
[02:19:37.786 --> 02:19:42.989]  We're gonna be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[02:19:42.989 --> 02:19:44.770]  So everybody, share that link.
[02:19:44.770 --> 02:19:48.092]  InfoWars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[02:19:49.966 --> 02:19:58.741]  8am central at Infowars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide.
[02:19:58.741 --> 02:20:01.365]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:19.998 --> 02:20:32.684]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.684 --> 02:20:38.626]  By the way, I was just notified that Ross Perot has died at the age of 89.
[02:20:38.626 --> 02:20:48.671]  And of course, remember him for his runs of the presidency, but especially for his opposition to NAFTA.
[02:20:48.671 --> 02:20:49.131]  To NAFTA.
[02:20:50.117 --> 02:20:53.339]  He accurately predicted exactly what was going to happen with NAFTA.
[02:20:53.339 --> 02:20:55.261]  And of course, George H.W.
[02:20:55.261 --> 02:20:58.503]  Bush and Bill Clinton, they were both on board with it.
[02:20:58.503 --> 02:21:01.305]  So there wasn't any discussion between the two of them.
[02:21:01.305 --> 02:21:04.187]  Ross Perot had this to say about it.
[02:21:04.187 --> 02:21:05.788]  Run the clip.
[02:21:05.788 --> 02:21:09.871]  We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
[02:21:09.871 --> 02:21:11.753]  To those of you in the audience who are business people,
[02:21:12.921 --> 02:21:14.022]  Pretty simple.
[02:21:14.022 --> 02:21:26.168]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young 25... Let's assume you've been in business for a long time, you've got a mature workforce.
[02:21:26.168 --> 02:21:36.653]  Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care, that's the most expensive single element, making a car, have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement,
[02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:43.886]  And you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[02:21:43.886 --> 02:21:45.987]  I'm the only guy that talks numbers.
[02:21:45.987 --> 02:21:46.908]  I love this.
[02:21:46.908 --> 02:21:48.509]  Nobody else will even talk about it.
[02:21:48.509 --> 02:21:51.170]  As I've said, it's like a crazy aunt in the basement.
[02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:53.692]  Everybody knows she's there, but nobody talks about her.
[02:21:53.692 --> 02:21:54.972]  I'm talking about it.
[02:21:54.972 --> 02:21:58.034]  Then I can talk, you know, with endless numbers about it.
[02:21:58.034 --> 02:22:01.856]  And then when I finish, typically the establishment press said, he didn't tell us enough.
[02:22:01.856 --> 02:22:02.977]  Now, just for the record,
[02:22:04.157 --> 02:22:05.898]  Uh, I don't have any spend doctors.
[02:22:05.898 --> 02:22:07.720]  I don't have any speech writers.
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.801]  Probably shows.
[02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:12.282]  Do you guys ever do anything but propaganda?
[02:22:12.282 --> 02:22:13.403]  Isn't it your business also?
[02:22:13.403 --> 02:22:15.404]  Would you even know the truth if you saw it?
[02:22:15.404 --> 02:22:15.785]  Oh, yes.
[02:22:15.785 --> 02:22:16.725]  I don't believe you would.
[02:22:16.725 --> 02:22:23.350]  Now, when you've got a 7 to 1 wage differential between the United States and Mexico, you will hear the giant sucking sound.
[02:22:23.350 --> 02:22:23.770]  That's right.
[02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:29.756]  Look at wage costs, look at the lack of regulation, lack of health care costs.
[02:22:29.756 --> 02:22:32.159]  That's basically what's happened with China as well.
[02:22:32.159 --> 02:22:36.324]  The giant sucking sound of money going south.
[02:22:36.324 --> 02:22:37.545]  And of course he was absolutely right.
[02:22:38.271 --> 02:22:42.453]  We've had a rough parity of trade deficits between the U.S.
[02:22:42.453 --> 02:22:44.835]  and Mexico, for example.
[02:22:44.835 --> 02:22:50.037]  It fluctuated from between two and five billion dollars each year.
[02:22:50.037 --> 02:22:51.098]  Some years, the U.S.
[02:22:51.098 --> 02:22:51.778]  would be ahead.
[02:22:51.778 --> 02:22:53.119]  Some years, Mexico would be ahead.
[02:22:53.119 --> 02:23:03.745]  But it never fluctuated by more than two to five billion dollars, with one country some years ahead and another year the other country would have a surplus of trade.
[02:23:03.745 --> 02:23:05.286]  But after NAFTA was passed,
[02:23:06.343 --> 02:23:09.326]  The trade deficit with Mexico immediately jumped.
[02:23:09.326 --> 02:23:13.651]  Remember, it was trading in the 2 to 5, plus or minus 2 to 5 billion dollars.
[02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:17.175]  It jumped to 17 billion dollars.
[02:23:17.175 --> 02:23:19.157]  And it stayed there for the next two or three years.
[02:23:20.276 --> 02:23:24.617]  And it never got any lower than a $17 billion deficit.
[02:23:24.617 --> 02:23:30.079]  So you had a situation where, you know, some years we had a $2 to $5 billion trade surplus with Mexico.
[02:23:30.079 --> 02:23:32.539]  Some years they had the surplus with us.
[02:23:32.539 --> 02:23:33.800]  But it always was $2 to $5 billion.
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:34.360]  It jumps to $17 billion.
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:35.100]  It got as high as $72 billion.
[02:23:39.548 --> 02:23:42.831]  But it's now typically about, you know, 50-60 billion dollars a year.
[02:23:42.831 --> 02:23:45.533]  That is what is called a giant sucking sound.
[02:23:45.533 --> 02:23:52.399]  And of course, the establishment, both Democrat and Republican, was full on to go with that.
[02:23:52.399 --> 02:23:55.121]  And that's why these people hate President Trump so much.
[02:23:55.121 --> 02:23:59.305]  Because he said, we're not going to let that sucking continue.
[02:23:59.305 --> 02:24:00.946]  It's gotten much bigger.
[02:24:00.946 --> 02:24:04.109]  The problem has gotten much bigger with China.
[02:24:04.109 --> 02:24:05.390]  They all come after President Trump.
[02:24:05.390 --> 02:24:05.891]  Say, look at this!
[02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:08.440]  He invented tariffs.
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:10.761]  No, he didn't.
[02:24:10.761 --> 02:24:23.744]  Tariffs invented the United States, quite frankly.
[02:24:23.744 --> 02:24:25.645]  So that's exactly what we're seeing today.
[02:24:25.645 --> 02:24:31.586]  The Democrats are trying to suck the life out of America.
[02:24:32.927 --> 02:24:33.848]  My name is Will Johnson.
[02:24:33.848 --> 02:24:35.211]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:35.211 --> 02:24:37.895]  That was a great report by David Knight.
[02:24:37.895 --> 02:24:44.365]  The Democrats are now trying to suck the life out of America.
[02:24:44.365 --> 02:24:45.206]  We're all seeing it.
[02:24:45.206 --> 02:24:47.249]  We're all experiencing it together.
[02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:52.982]  I mean, you know, look at the FBI, look at the way that they attack President Trump.
[02:24:52.982 --> 02:24:55.885]  You had people with inside of the FBI.
[02:24:55.885 --> 02:25:00.591]  You have the Democrats, the mainstream media, day in, day out.
[02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:05.576]  They have nothing else to talk about other than trying to take out the President of the United States.
[02:25:05.576 --> 02:25:07.838]  Anything related to President Trump
[02:25:08.743 --> 02:25:28.181]  They'll talk about it, and every now and then they'll bring up something to talk about, you know, just to try to make it look like they're reporting on the news, but it's like a two-minute segment, and then they'll go on to talk more and more about what President Trump is doing, or what he's not doing, that won't make them happy.
[02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:31.624]  You know, they want everything to be done their way.
[02:25:31.624 --> 02:25:34.626]  So they're going to suck the life out of us, just like vampires.
[02:25:35.689 --> 02:25:39.292]  The left reminds me of vampires.
[02:25:39.292 --> 02:25:40.433]  The Walking Dead.
[02:25:40.433 --> 02:25:45.217]  And they want to suck the life out of America, out of Americans.
[02:25:45.217 --> 02:25:47.559]  They don't care about Americans.
[02:25:47.559 --> 02:25:53.104]  The Democrats, the left, they put illegals before the American people.
[02:25:54.557 --> 02:25:56.938]  I confronted Kamala Harris about that.
[02:25:56.938 --> 02:26:00.580]  I confronted Kevin de Leon in California about that.
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.382]  He was the author of the Sanctuary City Bill in California.
[02:26:05.382 --> 02:26:09.724]  And I confronted him asking, why are you putting illegals before the American people?
[02:26:09.724 --> 02:26:11.525]  Same thing with Kamala Harris.
[02:26:11.525 --> 02:26:12.625]  And they were dumbfounded.
[02:26:12.625 --> 02:26:14.786]  They didn't even know how to answer that.
[02:26:14.786 --> 02:26:18.668]  Because America to them, to the left, does not matter.
[02:26:19.628 --> 02:26:20.769]  It does not exist.
[02:26:20.769 --> 02:26:22.750]  They want to change America.
[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:25.791]  They want to destroy America.
[02:26:25.791 --> 02:26:30.093]  They hate President Trump more than they love the country.
[02:26:30.093 --> 02:26:31.794]  Think about that.
[02:26:31.794 --> 02:26:35.636]  They're willing to destroy this nation just to get what they want.
[02:26:35.636 --> 02:26:40.518]  And if they are not able to get what they want, destroy it.
[02:26:40.518 --> 02:26:43.439]  Suck the life out of the country.
[02:26:43.439 --> 02:26:48.682]  Everything that they do is about destruction against the American people.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:50.921]  You know, I'll give an example.
[02:26:50.921 --> 02:26:54.045]  There's Maxine Waters.
[02:26:54.045 --> 02:26:59.391]  She, you know, there's no news, no surprise how she hates President Trump.
[02:26:59.391 --> 02:27:05.497]  She's been talking about impeachment from day one simply because she doesn't like him, simply because Hillary Clinton lost.
[02:27:06.405 --> 02:27:07.887]  We actually have a video clip.
[02:27:07.887 --> 02:27:10.730]  I don't know if we have time to play that video clip.
[02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:13.253]  We'll play it when we come back in the next segment.
[02:27:13.253 --> 02:27:17.639]  But she wants to just do everything she can to take out President Trump.
[02:27:17.639 --> 02:27:20.903]  And it's, you know, it's the whole model of the left.
[02:27:20.903 --> 02:27:22.725]  AOC is the same way.
[02:27:22.725 --> 02:27:24.087]  Rashida Tlaib.
[02:27:24.087 --> 02:27:24.828]  Ilhan Omar.
[02:27:26.328 --> 02:27:32.631]  They put all these crazy people in position to try to do everything they can to take out America.
[02:27:32.631 --> 02:27:37.133]  And it just so happened to be that President Trump is the president of these United States.
[02:27:37.133 --> 02:27:42.455]  And because he is the president of these United States, he is number one on their target.
[02:27:42.455 --> 02:27:45.877]  The next on their target are the American people.
[02:27:45.877 --> 02:27:54.280]  And as long as the American people keep supporting a president that's doing positive things for this country, they are going to continue to attack.
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:55.161]  Mad Maxine.
[02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:59.290]  Why is she still in office?
[02:27:59.290 --> 02:28:00.952]  AOC, why is she still in office?
[02:28:00.952 --> 02:28:05.615]  Same thing with her going down to the border trying to make it look like ICE members are making people drink toilet water.
[02:28:05.615 --> 02:28:09.098]  I mean, seriously, come on.
[02:28:09.098 --> 02:28:12.200]  They knew we were coming and they were still making people do this.
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:15.242]  Complete and total lies.
[02:28:15.242 --> 02:28:17.084]  I have a colleague, a friend,
[02:28:18.157 --> 02:28:26.291]  Wingman, Ben Bergquist out of California, he went to the same facility that AOC went to and he said it's nothing what she was saying.
[02:28:26.291 --> 02:28:27.994]  I completely trust him over her.
[02:28:29.324 --> 02:28:30.385]  She's a total liar.
[02:28:30.385 --> 02:28:31.866]  And that is the motto of the left.
[02:28:31.866 --> 02:28:34.228]  If you can't get what you want, then lie about it.
[02:28:34.228 --> 02:28:34.928]  Lie about it.
[02:28:34.928 --> 02:28:35.909]  It is okay.
[02:28:35.909 --> 02:28:36.930]  Completely lie about it.
[02:28:36.930 --> 02:28:43.715]  And as long as we lie about it, then the American people will believe it because we're going to continue to tell the lie over and over and over and over.
[02:28:43.715 --> 02:28:47.257]  Because American people to the left, they believe that we're dumb.
[02:28:47.257 --> 02:28:49.019]  They don't believe that we can get it.
[02:28:49.019 --> 02:28:49.919]  My name is Will Johnson.
[02:28:49.919 --> 02:28:51.301]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:51.301 --> 02:28:53.042]  We will be back after this message.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:59.742]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.742 --> 02:29:01.823]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.823 --> 02:29:03.564]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.564 --> 02:29:10.107]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:15.189]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.189 --> 02:29:19.891]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.331 --> 02:29:23.432]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:29:56.206 --> 02:29:59.587]  The second American revolution is happening now.

[02:32:44.646 --> 02:32:45.787]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:32:45.787 --> 02:32:48.549]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ!
[02:32:48.549 --> 02:32:50.251]  Full power!
[02:32:50.251 --> 02:32:51.352]  Damn the torpedoes!
[02:32:51.352 --> 02:32:59.679]  Go straight at them!
[02:32:59.679 --> 02:33:02.342]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.165 --> 02:33:15.577]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:15.577 --> 02:33:16.843]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.465 --> 02:33:26.786]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:26.786 --> 02:33:30.168]  Stories up on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:33:30.168 --> 02:33:42.314]  Now remember, years ago, I wrote down that Jeffrey Epstein was videotaping people inside of his house, inside his mansions, inside his private island, and inside his Lolita Express pedophile plane.
[02:33:42.314 --> 02:33:45.616]  The children were way younger than the media was saying.
[02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:47.497]  Now they're admitting down to age 10.
[02:33:47.497 --> 02:33:49.338]  It goes below that.
[02:33:49.338 --> 02:33:51.479]  And it came out in court documents that Robert Mueller
[02:33:52.495 --> 02:34:01.639]  Back during the Clinton and then Obama days, working with Comey and others, was using Epstein as a confidential informant.
[02:34:01.639 --> 02:34:02.860]  Well, he wasn't an informant.
[02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:05.761]  He was a guy running the blackmail scam.
[02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:14.966]  And so this is how they were getting all this power over politicians and this corrupt upper echelon of the FBI run by the deep state consortium of the Bushes and the Clintons.
[02:34:16.414 --> 02:34:20.238]  And that's the deep state cabal that's been using all this blackmail to control people.
[02:34:20.238 --> 02:34:22.400]  It's well known in Europe that pedophilia is used as well.
[02:34:23.402 --> 02:34:26.083]  So that's how they've been running this operation.
[02:34:26.083 --> 02:34:31.904]  Now Ann Coulter is coming out and beginning to stick her toe in the pond, which is good.
[02:34:31.904 --> 02:34:33.884]  Ann obviously knows the full story.
[02:34:33.884 --> 02:34:38.465]  But it shows, as Ann Coulter is a bellwether, that this is all coming out.
[02:34:38.465 --> 02:34:39.345]  Here's the story.
[02:34:39.345 --> 02:34:46.646]  Ann Coulter thinks Epstein had state-sponsored, close quote, and was running a, quote, blackmailing operation.
[02:34:46.646 --> 02:34:49.667]  Something much bigger is behind this, quote.
[02:34:50.727 --> 02:34:53.468]  And then the whole article gets into everything I told you.
[02:34:53.468 --> 02:34:55.368]  I said five years ago.
[02:34:55.368 --> 02:35:00.630]  I think I was exposing... Epstein got let off nine years ago.
[02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:01.610]  Yeah, it was 2009.
[02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:05.171]  So he let off basically ten years ago.
[02:35:05.171 --> 02:35:06.271]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:35:06.271 --> 02:35:07.291]  I'm getting old.
[02:35:07.291 --> 02:35:09.632]  I've been covering this for ten years.
[02:35:09.632 --> 02:35:10.872]  Okay?
[02:35:10.872 --> 02:35:13.053]  We've been saying the deep state operates off this guy.
[02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:29.514]  And five or six other major groups, I was told by Hollywood folks years ago about cults where they brand women and how they were using 50 Shades of Grey to recruit women into things where they didn't understand that it was really a sex cult, slave cult.
[02:35:29.514 --> 02:35:34.237]  They would then show them snuff films and things, and that Harvey Weinstein was involved.
[02:35:34.237 --> 02:35:35.418]  And I said that, what?
[02:35:36.351 --> 02:35:44.588]  Two years ago, before I even started getting indicted, and The Huffington Post attacked me, because I said they're sex cults, so they brand women.
[02:35:44.588 --> 02:35:46.912]  I was told this by people that were investigating it.
[02:35:48.953 --> 02:35:59.356]  I mean, look, Eric Prince, founder of Blackwater, was in the news right at the same time we were in the news, right before the election, explaining that these people are running sex trafficking on airplanes.
[02:35:59.356 --> 02:36:01.477]  Well, you think he just pulled that out of the air?
[02:36:01.477 --> 02:36:03.958]  Or maybe out of his rear end or something?
[02:36:03.958 --> 02:36:05.258]  We're not just playing games here.
[02:36:05.258 --> 02:36:09.479]  We're risking our lives telling you the truth.
[02:36:09.479 --> 02:36:12.040]  You ever wonder why Eric Prince got demonized so much?
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:13.421]  Why Eric Prince was the devil?
[02:36:13.421 --> 02:36:17.762]  Why they imprisoned all those innocent Blackwater people and I even went along with the BS 15 years ago?
[02:36:19.423 --> 02:36:22.845]  It's because they weren't playing ball with the globalists.
[02:36:22.845 --> 02:36:23.985]  And they were seen as rivals.
[02:36:23.985 --> 02:36:26.386]  And I'm not even going back and kissing Blackwater's butt here.
[02:36:26.386 --> 02:36:34.209]  I'm just throwing out a caveat of the history of the type of stuff that's really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:34.209 --> 02:36:39.572]  If you want to say something bad about Blackwater, they're working with the shycoms too closely right now in Africa, but whatever.
[02:36:39.572 --> 02:36:41.032]  I don't want to digress.
[02:36:41.032 --> 02:36:45.614]  The point is, this story is up on Infowars.com and it's a big, big deal.
[02:36:45.614 --> 02:36:47.035]  And it validates and vindicates
[02:36:47.315 --> 02:36:54.119]  When I say story, there's like eight or nine with mainstream news admitting Bill Clinton flew way more than 20 times.
[02:36:54.119 --> 02:36:57.700]  Bill Clinton's lying about only flying six times on the Alita Express.
[02:36:57.700 --> 02:37:02.343]  That Bill Clinton went to the sex slave island while the sex slave children were brought in by traffickers.
[02:37:02.343 --> 02:37:04.524]  This is evil stuff.
[02:37:04.524 --> 02:37:08.446]  But beyond that, why do our politicians sell out the country?
[02:37:08.446 --> 02:37:10.907]  Because they are compromised.
[02:37:10.907 --> 02:37:13.329]  Only really bad people get pushed to that level.
[02:37:13.329 --> 02:37:15.250]  And that's why they're freaking out is because they don't have any dirt.
[02:37:16.246 --> 02:37:17.667]  On Donald Trump.
[02:37:17.667 --> 02:37:21.950]  They've had 25 fake women come out and say that Donald Trump raped them.
[02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:23.711]  Turns out they're all fake.
[02:37:23.711 --> 02:37:25.712]  They've tried similar crap on me.
[02:37:25.712 --> 02:37:37.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, they have had news stories in the New York Times and in the Associated Press that are 100% fake, 100% lies, and they won't even retract them.
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:39.901]  And I'm working right now on preparing the lawsuits against them.
[02:37:39.901 --> 02:37:41.742]  It's going to cost money, but we've got to do it.
[02:37:41.742 --> 02:37:43.584]  Because what's the new lie going to be like?
[02:37:44.424 --> 02:37:53.433]  They had NPR a few months ago say that I was a bully that beat all these kids up in school, and that they all kidnapped me, tied me up, and knocked all my teeth out.
[02:37:53.433 --> 02:37:54.354]  I said, I'll go to the doctor.
[02:37:54.354 --> 02:37:55.254]  He can scan my teeth.
[02:37:55.254 --> 02:37:56.776]  I've never had a tooth knocked out.
[02:37:56.776 --> 02:37:58.357]  They go, oh, we don't want that.
[02:37:58.357 --> 02:38:00.239]  And my own producer's like, oh, it's all bull.
[02:38:00.239 --> 02:38:01.480]  Nobody believes it.
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.321]  Alex, you shouldn't care.
[02:38:02.321 --> 02:38:03.782]  And I said, no.
[02:38:03.782 --> 02:38:05.044]  They're not going to stop.
[02:38:06.579 --> 02:38:12.682]  Now I've learned the New York Times is calling people up, saying that I fire guns at employees' feet.
[02:38:12.682 --> 02:38:14.743]  Totally insane lies.
[02:38:14.743 --> 02:38:24.608]  But again, it's the same media that said no one showed up to Trump's 4th of July deal, and then when the photos were released of it being hundreds and hundreds of thousands, they said it was photoshopped.
[02:38:24.608 --> 02:38:28.890]  My point is, these people will do anything.
[02:38:28.890 --> 02:38:32.932]  So, if you think they're liars, folks, when you're not a public figure that's a patriot,
[02:38:34.255 --> 02:38:36.897]  You have no idea.
[02:38:36.897 --> 02:38:41.921]  Folks, they will lie at levels never before seen.
[02:38:41.921 --> 02:38:42.862]  They are desperate.
[02:38:42.862 --> 02:38:43.803]  They want power.
[02:38:43.803 --> 02:38:45.084]  They know they're losing.
[02:38:45.084 --> 02:38:50.968]  But thanks to your support and your prayers, America is turning the corner and I am so incredibly excited.
[02:38:50.968 --> 02:38:55.432]  Look at how the giant pedophile ring control system is coming out.
[02:38:55.432 --> 02:38:57.694]  Look at how the system is so incredibly scared.
[02:38:57.694 --> 02:39:01.196]  Look at how the arrest of pedophiles are up over tenfold.
[02:39:02.317 --> 02:39:04.819]  And Trump is unraveling their whole system.
[02:39:04.819 --> 02:39:06.961]  We should be thanking God every moment.
[02:39:06.961 --> 02:39:10.583]  All right, back to the crew, Will Johnson and the rest of the folks.
[02:39:10.583 --> 02:39:13.125]  Don't forget the War Room's coming up today at 3 p.m.
[02:39:13.125 --> 02:39:14.186]  Central.
[02:39:14.186 --> 02:39:18.770]  Whatever you do, spread the link, spread the article, spread the videos, because you are the resistance.
[02:39:18.770 --> 02:39:28.557]  And thanks to Trump's report for top-linking to the Tommy Robinson interview yesterday, where he's begging Trump for political emergency amnesty as a persecuted journalist.
[02:39:31.696 --> 02:39:34.739]  Great report, great report, Alex Jones.
[02:39:34.739 --> 02:39:38.442]  So I want to see if we have time to squeeze this clip in there.
[02:39:38.442 --> 02:39:43.406]  This is what I was talking about, Maxine Waters.
[02:39:43.406 --> 02:39:46.468]  This is clip number eight, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:39:46.468 --> 02:39:48.330]  I think we have time to play that.
[02:39:48.330 --> 02:39:55.576]  So this is Maxine Waters, again, talking about President Trump and how everything is just twisted.
[02:39:55.576 --> 02:39:56.577]  See if we can play that video.
[02:39:58.467 --> 02:40:04.452]  In 2016, Trump's campaign pitch to African Americans was, and I quote, What have you got to lose?
[02:40:04.452 --> 02:40:12.860]  As if we all live in squalor at the bottom of the barrel in his eyes and have no hope without his condescending paternalistic help.
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:17.944]  It doubled as a pitch for black votes and a dog whistle to his white face.
[02:40:17.944 --> 02:40:20.607]  Trump demonizes anyone he does not like.
[02:40:21.227 --> 02:40:25.190]  Does not like him or isn't willing to pledge loyalty to him.
[02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:32.395]  He is especially eager to demonize blacks and his contempt for us is loud and clear.
[02:40:32.395 --> 02:40:42.663]  Trump attempted to destroy Kaepernick for protesting police brutality, saying, and I quote, maybe he should find a country that works better for him.
[02:40:43.563 --> 02:40:53.169]  When NFL players kept protesting, Trump said NFL owners should say, get that blank blank off the field right now.
[02:40:53.169 --> 02:41:04.656]  If I wasn't with y'all, I would have said it.
[02:41:04.656 --> 02:41:06.057]  They don't know those words.
[02:41:08.194 --> 02:41:09.095]  Okay, you know what?
[02:41:09.095 --> 02:41:09.715]  It's enough.
[02:41:09.715 --> 02:41:11.456]  She's so disgusting.
[02:41:11.456 --> 02:41:12.737]  She's so disgusting.
[02:41:12.737 --> 02:41:14.438]  She's absolutely disgusting.
[02:41:14.438 --> 02:41:16.839]  I've been to the White House twice.
[02:41:16.839 --> 02:41:22.023]  See, she's telling all this stuff as if it's facts.
[02:41:22.023 --> 02:41:30.068]  Of course, if you're gonna be on a football field and you're gonna say something and you're gonna protest against the flag, against police officers, seriously?
[02:41:30.939 --> 02:41:33.142]  Police officers are doing their job.
[02:41:33.142 --> 02:41:39.652]  Police officers wake up every day wondering if today is going to be the day some idiot out there is going to take them out.
[02:41:39.652 --> 02:41:41.896]  This is the left trying to demonize everything.
[02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:45.812]  You even have Kamala Harris demonizing ICE.
[02:41:45.812 --> 02:41:48.855]  You have the left demonizing the police officers.
[02:41:48.855 --> 02:41:53.799]  I've had police officers send me messages saying, Will, thank you for saying something.
[02:41:53.799 --> 02:41:55.580]  Thank you for standing up.
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:42:04.627]  Thank you for showing the truth that not all police officers, because there are some bad apples in the police department and police officers will admit to that.
[02:42:04.627 --> 02:42:07.510]  But they don't go all out to say that police officers are bad.
[02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:15.897]  Maxine Waters, the rest of the Democrats, they're doing nothing but pushing lies about white people and President Trump.
[02:42:15.897 --> 02:42:18.399]  They are the ones creating this division.
[02:42:18.399 --> 02:42:21.442]  If you didn't have the left, we wouldn't have this.
[02:42:21.442 --> 02:42:22.823]  This wouldn't even be a thing.
[02:42:22.823 --> 02:42:24.305]  I wouldn't even be talking about it.
[02:42:24.305 --> 02:42:30.010]  But you have the left constantly, every single day, trying to make it look like something that it's not.
[02:42:31.468 --> 02:42:36.349]  The people that need to leave the country are those that are on the left.
[02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:39.330]  Just imagine a country without leftists.
[02:42:39.330 --> 02:42:42.131]  Imagine how much more prosperous we would be.
[02:42:42.131 --> 02:42:46.392]  Imagine how much more great this country would be.
[02:42:46.392 --> 02:42:48.533]  The left, they are the virus.
[02:42:48.533 --> 02:42:49.493]  That's not right, people.
[02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:51.013]  It's liberalism.
[02:42:51.013 --> 02:42:52.133]  My name is Will Johnson.
[02:42:52.133 --> 02:42:53.614]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:53.614 --> 02:42:54.374]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.374 --> 02:42:55.414]  1776 worldwide.
[02:42:59.110 --> 02:43:02.252]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[02:43:02.252 --> 02:43:03.012]  What does it really mean?
[02:43:03.012 --> 02:43:07.615]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[02:43:07.615 --> 02:43:09.516]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[02:43:09.516 --> 02:43:18.401]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[02:43:18.401 --> 02:43:21.463]  We're going to do a 34 hour special broadcast
[02:43:22.421 --> 02:43:25.023]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at a.m.
[02:43:25.023 --> 02:43:26.004]  with David Knight.
[02:43:26.004 --> 02:43:30.608]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m.
[02:43:30.608 --> 02:43:31.689]  on the War Room.
[02:43:31.689 --> 02:43:36.833]  We're gonna have our crew in DC at the White House Summit on social media.
[02:43:36.833 --> 02:43:42.018]  We're gonna be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[02:43:42.018 --> 02:43:43.799]  So everybody, share that link.
[02:43:43.799 --> 02:43:47.723]  InfoWars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[02:43:48.756 --> 02:43:49.397]  8 a.m.
[02:43:49.397 --> 02:43:52.822]  Central at Infowars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide.
[02:43:55.732 --> 02:44:11.636]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[02:44:11.636 --> 02:44:13.357]  It is completely independent of all that.
[02:44:13.357 --> 02:44:24.240]  It is an old-school, American, 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:25.421]  We're good to go.
[02:44:56.561 --> 02:45:04.626]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[02:45:04.626 --> 02:45:10.849]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:20.675]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[02:45:20.675 --> 02:45:23.316]  As long as we stay true to our
[02:45:23.636 --> 02:45:35.923]  As long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America can not do.
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:48.001]  Infowars.com.
[02:45:48.001 --> 02:45:49.143]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:45:49.143 --> 02:45:52.146]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:45:52.146 --> 02:45:53.607]  Full power!
[02:45:53.607 --> 02:45:54.709]  Damn the torpedoes!
[02:45:54.709 --> 02:45:55.590]  Go straight at them!
[02:45:58.047 --> 02:46:02.170]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:46:02.170 --> 02:46:05.332]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[02:46:05.332 --> 02:46:08.475]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:46:08.475 --> 02:46:20.703]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:46:20.703 --> 02:46:25.767]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:46:25.767 --> 02:46:27.088]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[02:46:27.108 --> 02:46:28.769]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:46:59.196 --> 02:47:15.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.324 --> 02:47:17.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:17.766 --> 02:47:21.928]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.928 --> 02:47:23.989]  Something really important.
[02:47:23.989 --> 02:47:24.689]  Okay.
[02:47:24.689 --> 02:47:26.870]  We're not women's soccer.
[02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:27.791]  We're not the NFL.
[02:47:29.634 --> 02:47:41.237]  If there's anybody here that's going to be disrespectful to either the American or the Canadian National Anthem, grab your gear and get the f*** out now, because you'll never see the ice in this arena.
[02:47:41.237 --> 02:47:55.060]  A video has gone viral of a hockey coach telling the team during their training that if they want to disrespect the Canadian or American flag, just get the hell out right now.
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:56.260]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:47:58.641]  But why is this so important?
[02:47:58.641 --> 02:48:04.265]  Because when a group is trying to conquer you, they try to tell you to take your flag down.
[02:48:04.265 --> 02:48:10.389]  And the people saying that they hate the American flag and other Western flags don't even know why.
[02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:13.251]  In most cases, they're just told by the media it's a cool thing to do.
[02:48:14.776 --> 02:48:20.521]  All this grew out of fake media cases where police supposedly shot innocent black men.
[02:48:20.521 --> 02:48:28.268]  And in almost every case, it turned out that the media was actually lying about it all and trying to foment a race war in this country.
[02:48:28.268 --> 02:48:30.750]  And we have the documents from FEMA.
[02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:32.352]  We have the documents from Obama.
[02:48:32.352 --> 02:48:33.533]  We have the witchy leak documents.
[02:48:33.533 --> 02:48:35.254]  We have the Antifa documents.
[02:48:35.254 --> 02:48:36.115]  We know they're doing this.
[02:48:36.115 --> 02:48:37.516]  So I'm all for free speech.
[02:48:38.697 --> 02:48:49.706]  If you want to go home and burn American flags at your house, if you want to burn Canadian flags, you want to burn rainbow flags, you want to burn Budweiser flags, that's your business in your own backyard.
[02:48:49.706 --> 02:48:55.630]  But when you work for a sports team, be it professional hockey, anything, you sign on to that code of conduct.
[02:48:55.630 --> 02:49:01.194]  And you sign on to how you behave and what you do when you're out there on that field.
[02:49:01.194 --> 02:49:07.039]  So the very left that wants to get rid of conservative speech, the very left that's always saying we don't deserve to, you know, you can be on Twitter or Facebook,
[02:49:08.277 --> 02:49:11.340]  They're the ones getting rid of free speech oncologists for everybody.
[02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:20.608]  But then they say, oh, but we need to go out and kneel during the national anthem and grandstand and say America sucks.
[02:49:20.608 --> 02:49:24.492]  All because Nike and others will give them sponsorships if they do.
[02:49:24.492 --> 02:49:29.837]  It's these globalist corporations that are the problem and who want to destroy the nation state.
[02:49:29.837 --> 02:49:31.619]  Because then you won't have any redress.
[02:49:32.898 --> 02:49:36.980]  With federal or state courts or the legislature or politicians, you can vote out.
[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:40.342]  You'll have global government exploiting you.
[02:49:40.342 --> 02:49:41.102]  And that's what's happening.
[02:49:41.102 --> 02:49:43.384]  These people want to get our flag and destroy it.
[02:49:43.384 --> 02:49:45.385]  They want to remove the Betsy Ross flag.
[02:49:45.385 --> 02:49:47.106]  It's asinine.
[02:49:47.106 --> 02:49:49.347]  And it's incredibly dangerous.
[02:49:49.347 --> 02:49:53.609]  But the good news is there's a major backlash to it and people are seeing through it.
[02:49:53.609 --> 02:50:00.413]  And idiot organizations like the NFL have lost 39% of their viewers in the last four or five years and are losing billions.
[02:50:01.033 --> 02:50:01.954]  And I say good.
[02:50:01.954 --> 02:50:03.656]  Go bankrupt.
[02:50:03.656 --> 02:50:06.138]  Go bankrupt and teach you a lesson.
[02:50:06.138 --> 02:50:09.001]  Stop cow-telling to Hollywood and the globalists.
[02:50:09.001 --> 02:50:13.686]  Back to Will Johnson and the rest of the crew in the ATX.
[02:50:13.686 --> 02:50:15.728]  Something really important.
[02:50:15.728 --> 02:50:16.449]  Okay.
[02:50:16.449 --> 02:50:18.611]  We're not women's soccer.
[02:50:18.611 --> 02:50:19.532]  We're not the NFL.
[02:50:21.371 --> 02:50:32.391]  If there's anybody here that's going to be disrespectful to either the American or the Canadian National Anthem, grab your gear and get the f*** out now, because you'll never see the ice in this arena.
[02:50:34.437 --> 02:50:35.197]  Yep.
[02:50:35.197 --> 02:50:35.998]  You know what?
[02:50:35.998 --> 02:50:37.519]  Let me ask this question.
[02:50:37.519 --> 02:50:40.801]  What do the American flag mean to you?
[02:50:40.801 --> 02:50:45.583]  You know, for me, as a black male in America, the American flag means freedom.
[02:50:45.583 --> 02:50:50.246]  Not just to me, but to millions of people in the country.
[02:50:50.246 --> 02:50:55.549]  The American flag is the flag that won during the Civil War.
[02:50:55.549 --> 02:50:58.791]  Had the other flag won, I would not be sitting here today.
[02:50:58.791 --> 02:51:00.812]  I would not have the freedoms that I have today.
[02:51:02.372 --> 02:51:07.857]  The American flag is the flag for all Americans, and for them to do what they're doing is terrible.
[02:51:07.857 --> 02:51:13.001]  So we're going to look at this report with Tommy Robinson, and we'll see you after the break.
[02:51:16.178 --> 02:51:21.239]  Europe, the UK and the US, to a great extent, is being swallowed up by authoritarianism.
[02:51:21.239 --> 02:51:27.660]  Mass censorship of nationalist conservatives, Christians, veterans groups, pro-gun groups, pro-life groups.
[02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:30.541]  Now, Tommy Robinson is doing an emergency appeal to the President.
[02:51:30.541 --> 02:51:33.021]  He's been laying out the evidence of the fraud.
[02:51:33.021 --> 02:51:41.162]  What is your direct appeal about what you're facing, your family's facing, and why you need him to give you emergency asylum, which I think is a very good chance we can get him to do?
[02:51:41.162 --> 02:51:44.063]  President Trump, the American government,
[02:51:45.481 --> 02:51:47.522]  Britain has fallen.
[02:51:47.522 --> 02:51:52.123]  Even yourself, if you was in Britain, you would be arrested and tried.
[02:51:52.123 --> 02:51:55.103]  You would be tried because Sadiq Khan would demand it.
[02:51:55.103 --> 02:52:01.185]  The political pressure that has been put on the judiciary system would be the similar pressure that would be put on for yourself.
[02:52:01.185 --> 02:52:08.126]  I'm an English man, a British citizen who loves my country and it hurts me to have to say I have no future here.
[02:52:08.126 --> 02:52:11.887]  The only future that lies for me is death.
[02:52:11.887 --> 02:52:14.228]  Death at the hands of an establishment who will feed me
[02:52:14.986 --> 02:52:18.607]  To Islamic gangs of jihadis within the prison system.
[02:52:18.607 --> 02:52:21.368]  I have 48 hours before my sentencing.
[02:52:21.368 --> 02:52:26.410]  I previously spent three months in solitary confinement for journalism, for breaking no law.
[02:52:26.410 --> 02:52:31.271]  The reality is, and I urge you please, get your lawyers to look through this case.
[02:52:31.271 --> 02:52:33.932]  You will expose and see complete corruption.
[02:52:34.671 --> 02:52:37.373]  I'm being found guilty when I've broke no laws.
[02:52:37.373 --> 02:52:39.956]  I've not been tried by my peers.
[02:52:39.956 --> 02:52:43.419]  12 members of the British public, that's the Magna Carta.
[02:52:43.419 --> 02:52:44.900]  That's common law.
[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:50.585]  Common law is if members of my peers, if the British public find me guilty, I'd accept my fate.
[02:52:50.585 --> 02:52:51.866]  I'm not being tried.
[02:52:51.866 --> 02:52:53.728]  I think this is a backdoor ruling.
[02:52:54.188 --> 02:52:58.989]  In order for the government to silence me, imprison me, and inevitably have me killed.
[02:52:58.989 --> 02:53:03.630]  I'm a father of three, with three beautiful children, and a wife, and a beautiful wife.
[02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:10.332]  Last time I was in prison, the police went to my family's home to tell them, and they had intel, that there were going to be acid attacks against them.
[02:53:10.332 --> 02:53:12.292]  They went to my wife, they went to my mother.
[02:53:12.292 --> 02:53:15.873]  They're going to take me away and leave my family vulnerable.
[02:53:15.873 --> 02:53:16.373]  My crime?
[02:53:17.370 --> 02:53:22.795]  Awakening the British public to the mass problems from open border immigration.
[02:53:22.795 --> 02:53:25.897]  Importing a culture of dominance and violence.
[02:53:25.897 --> 02:53:29.700]  And see, the globalists don't want the public to be aware of this.
[02:53:29.700 --> 02:53:34.945]  They don't want people to understand the problems that come with their utopia vision for our world.
[02:53:35.758 --> 02:53:37.099]  I've spoke out.
[02:53:37.099 --> 02:53:38.759]  I've laid my life.
[02:53:38.759 --> 02:53:42.541]  I'm saying to you, I want to keep on fighting, but I can't fight it because I'm going to be killed.
[02:53:42.541 --> 02:53:49.685]  And as a journalist, as a British citizen, I beg you, I beg Donald Trump, I beg the American government, just look at my case.
[02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:53.026]  If you look at my case, you will see the wrongdoings.
[02:53:53.026 --> 02:53:56.908]  We are imprisoning journalists and our media celebrate it.
[02:53:57.640 --> 02:54:04.021]  I'm being imprisoned for asking a convicted paedophile, how do you feel about your verdict?
[02:54:04.021 --> 02:54:05.501]  That is the reality.
[02:54:05.501 --> 02:54:07.662]  My conviction for causing anxiety?
[02:54:07.662 --> 02:54:09.962]  For causing anxiety?
[02:54:09.962 --> 02:54:10.902]  This is even before.
[02:54:10.902 --> 02:54:16.984]  I want to get on to the final charges, but this is a direct appeal on behalf of my family.
[02:54:16.984 --> 02:54:21.004]  On behalf of my family, we love the United States.
[02:54:21.004 --> 02:54:22.545]  I have no future here.
[02:54:22.545 --> 02:54:23.525]  It's inevitable.
[02:54:23.525 --> 02:54:24.325]  I will be murdered.
[02:54:24.325 --> 02:54:25.045]  I will be killed.
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:29.846]  And I'll be imprisoned on Thursday for journalism.
[02:54:29.846 --> 02:54:32.891]  We talk about North Korea, we talk about China, we talk about Russia.
[02:54:32.891 --> 02:54:34.333]  Our freedoms are gone.
[02:54:34.333 --> 02:54:35.915]  Our free speech is gone.
[02:54:35.915 --> 02:54:36.316]  It's gone.
[02:54:36.316 --> 02:54:37.798]  We live in a post-free speech era.
[02:54:38.456 --> 02:54:43.537]  And exactly the same, what they've inflicted in this nation, I know they want to do to yours.
[02:54:43.537 --> 02:54:46.618]  I know they want to take your freedoms, they want to change your constitution.
[02:54:46.618 --> 02:54:49.679]  I know there's people who would take away your rights tomorrow.
[02:54:49.679 --> 02:54:52.760]  The difference is, they want to do it to you in America.
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:54.420]  They've done it to us.
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:55.940]  They've done it to us.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:58.441]  Our free speech is gone and it's celebrated.
[02:54:58.441 --> 02:55:02.342]  It's celebrated by the people in power, who rule over us, the globalists.
[02:55:02.342 --> 02:55:04.042]  It's celebrated.
[02:55:04.042 --> 02:55:06.483]  It's celebrated when a journalist is being imprisoned.
[02:55:07.170 --> 02:55:11.453]  The media, they're not journalists, they're activists!
[02:55:11.453 --> 02:55:14.615]  I just, I make this as a direct appeal.
[02:55:14.615 --> 02:55:22.701]  I ask American citizens, please make sure somehow, I ask Alex Jones, I ask anyone, make sure this lands in the American government.
[02:55:22.701 --> 02:55:31.767]  I know that when I was taken and kidnapped off the street and unlawfully held, which has been proven, I know that congressmen from the Republican Party stepped in.
[02:55:31.767 --> 02:55:33.728]  I know that pressure was put on the British government.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:36.302]  I'm telling you now, it's not pressure that's needed.
[02:55:36.302 --> 02:55:38.824]  I need evacuation out of this country.
[02:55:38.824 --> 02:55:42.828]  Because there are people and dark forces at work in this nation.
[02:55:42.828 --> 02:55:48.733]  The same dark forces at work in this nation that want to repel you as the leader of the free world from even entering this country.
[02:55:49.591 --> 02:55:54.752]  There are many people in this country who would want to seek the same against you that they seek against me.
[02:55:54.752 --> 02:55:56.412]  The same lies that are told about you.
[02:55:56.412 --> 02:55:58.333]  I have to fight these lies.
[02:55:58.333 --> 02:56:02.054]  I've fought these lies as a young working class man from a town in England.
[02:56:02.054 --> 02:56:07.195]  I've had to fight against the labelling, against the stigma, the Nazi, the racist, the fascist.
[02:56:07.195 --> 02:56:10.475]  All the words used to destroy a man's reputation.
[02:56:10.475 --> 02:56:13.116]  I've had to fight and fight and fight as a single individual.
[02:56:13.999 --> 02:56:21.984]  And right now I'm about to be imprisoned and I'm saying if you care about freedom like I know you do, I know America loves freedom, I know you'll fight for it and die for it and so would we.
[02:56:21.984 --> 02:56:23.905]  Ours is gone.
[02:56:23.905 --> 02:56:24.345]  It's gone.
[02:56:24.345 --> 02:56:26.627]  The country's fallen.
[02:56:26.627 --> 02:56:35.152]  I want to make a genuine appeal to President Trump, to the Republican Party, please consider me and my family for political asylum.
[02:56:35.777 --> 02:56:48.029]  The British state's appeasement to Islam, the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda.
[02:56:48.029 --> 02:56:49.851]  To the world watching.
[02:56:50.882 --> 02:57:01.050]  If this was happening to a journalist in any other country, in China, in Russia, in North Korea, human rights lawyers would be fighting to defend them.
[02:57:01.050 --> 02:57:03.171]  Political correctness is that powerful in this country?
[02:57:03.171 --> 02:57:06.614]  I can't find a human rights lawyer to defend me or even mention me.
[02:57:06.614 --> 02:57:12.138]  Every time we speak to lawyers about anything, as soon as they hear it's my name, nope, we walk away.
[02:57:12.138 --> 02:57:19.524]  And I ask again, if you're watching this, if you're in the administration of President Trump, Donald Trump,
[02:57:20.296 --> 02:57:23.117]  Junior, I'm pleading with you.
[02:57:23.117 --> 02:57:25.718]  Please raise concerns over this case.
[02:57:25.718 --> 02:57:28.880]  I promise you all of the information.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:32.141]  All my own barristers have said they've gone against the law.
[02:57:32.141 --> 02:57:39.904]  My own barristers said that it's impossible for me to get convicted, yet I've been found guilty of all three charges.
[02:57:39.904 --> 02:57:44.006]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:46.551]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.551 --> 02:57:47.331]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.331 --> 02:57:47.911]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:47.911 --> 02:57:48.432]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:48.432 --> 02:57:51.253]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.253 --> 02:57:57.377]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.377 --> 02:58:06.182]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.182 --> 02:58:07.342]  That's it.
[02:58:07.342 --> 02:58:10.004]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.004 --> 02:58:12.845]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.845 --> 02:58:14.126]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.286 --> 02:58:15.047]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:15.047 --> 02:58:20.490]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.490 --> 02:58:23.272]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.272 --> 02:58:25.334]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.334 --> 02:58:34.600]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:36.502]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[02:58:36.502 --> 02:58:42.986]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:42.986 --> 02:58:43.927]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:46.528 --> 02:58:57.759]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[02:58:57.759 --> 02:59:01.903]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[02:59:01.903 --> 02:59:02.364]  The world
[02:59:03.004 --> 02:59:04.585]  Is going to change.
[02:59:04.585 --> 02:59:11.990]  And how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:14.011]  The system is vulnerable.
[02:59:14.011 --> 02:59:16.693]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[02:59:16.693 --> 02:59:20.336]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[02:59:20.336 --> 02:59:27.240]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[02:59:27.240 --> 02:59:32.564]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[02:59:33.184 --> 02:59:51.793]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from Infowarsstore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:04.349 --> 03:00:09.336]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:09.336 --> 03:00:11.498]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.498 --> 03:00:14.622]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[03:00:18.596 --> 03:00:19.357]  Welcome back.
[03:00:19.357 --> 03:00:19.937]  Welcome back.
[03:00:19.937 --> 03:00:21.378]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.378 --> 03:00:22.538]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:00:22.538 --> 03:00:27.842]  I have had the honor and privilege to sit in the chair for Alex Jones today.
[03:00:27.842 --> 03:00:29.703]  This has been an awesome ride.
[03:00:29.703 --> 03:00:35.847]  Like I said in the beginning, I had no idea that I would move to Texas and have the privilege to sit in this chair.
[03:00:36.907 --> 03:00:39.371]  The fourth hour, Paul Watson is going to take over.
[03:00:39.371 --> 03:00:45.379]  I've yet to actually have a one-to-one conversation with Paul Watson.
[03:00:45.379 --> 03:00:51.748]  I watch all of his videos on Twitter and I see a lot of his articles on InfoWars.
[03:00:51.748 --> 03:00:52.509]  How's it going, Paul?
[03:00:53.424 --> 03:00:54.826]  Hey Will, how's it going?
[03:00:54.826 --> 03:00:56.347]  It's been a real honor.
[03:00:56.347 --> 03:01:07.259]  You know what, I think I received a phone call from the UK, and I was wondering if it was you, because I was saying, you know what, if someone has Paul's number, please give them my number, I would love to talk to them.
[03:01:07.259 --> 03:01:10.483]  This was a while ago, and I know you've been extremely busy with the summit.
[03:01:11.023 --> 03:01:11.683]  Summit News.
[03:01:11.683 --> 03:01:14.204]  So it's a real honor to talk to you.
[03:01:14.204 --> 03:01:17.405]  I know we have the five-minute segment here and you're gonna take over in the fourth hour.
[03:01:17.405 --> 03:01:27.369]  I just want to talk to you here before you went on because I never had the decent or I had I never had the privilege to have a conversation with you.
[03:01:27.369 --> 03:01:32.110]  So how's it going?
[03:01:32.110 --> 03:01:32.611]  So I know
[03:01:34.341 --> 03:01:43.525]  I know that you're in the UK and you're seeing so many things, and I see a lot of the articles that you have on InfoWars, like all the attacks and stuff.
[03:01:43.525 --> 03:01:54.651]  You're like so on it, and I know some of the reports that you put out, I say, ooh, I see this report, I'm gonna do it, and then before I know it, you already have a report and you already have it on InfoWars and it's already ran.
[03:01:55.291 --> 03:02:09.999]  It's like you're like ahead of the game and I'm like man, you know, I just I'm almost jealous But you know, it's awesome that you're in the fight and I have to tell you I have a my producer She she just loves your accent.
[03:02:09.999 --> 03:02:22.006]  She loves your voice and she says I just love the way he sounds so it's just you come across very genuine and I think you're you've been absolutely awesome, so
[03:02:23.132 --> 03:02:24.594]  I appreciate that.
[03:02:24.594 --> 03:02:29.659]  I mean, the accent and the voice, I've kind of toned it down over the past few years.
[03:02:29.659 --> 03:02:35.386]  A lot of people who I meet still say things like, you know, why do you sound so angry in your videos?
[03:02:36.199 --> 03:02:46.863]  Well, I've toned it down to a certain extent, but it's not that I'm angry, it's because I script all the videos, you see, so you have to remember each sentence before you deliver it to camera.
[03:02:46.863 --> 03:02:59.067]  So if you're fumbling and stumbling over the same sentence like five times in a row, you get a little bit angry and you have to, you know, get a little bit worked up to force out that sentence and get it right.
[03:02:59.067 --> 03:02:59.307]  Yes.
[03:02:59.307 --> 03:03:01.728]  So that's why sometimes it comes across as a little bit too
[03:03:02.429 --> 03:03:18.895]  Forceful, but normally I've softened the edges a little bit over the past couple of years and I think that gets across the message a little bit better to people rather than this, you know, rat-a-tat, bam-bam-bam method that maybe I was known for a couple of years in the past.
[03:03:19.625 --> 03:03:20.867]  Yeah, but you know what?
[03:03:20.867 --> 03:03:23.050]  I think you have every right to be angry.
[03:03:23.050 --> 03:03:24.712]  I think we all should be angry.
[03:03:24.712 --> 03:03:31.641]  You know, we have the left, these socialist communists, they're doing all of these crazy things and we're supposed to just be happy about it?
[03:03:31.641 --> 03:03:33.844]  We're supposed to go along with it?
[03:03:33.844 --> 03:03:35.306]  Like there's nothing wrong with it?
[03:03:35.746 --> 03:03:42.748]  I mean, I think we have every right to be angry when they're trying to teach our children that, you know, if you're a little boy that you can be a girl.
[03:03:42.748 --> 03:03:44.009]  That is not right.
[03:03:44.009 --> 03:03:45.489]  It's not right in the mind.
[03:03:45.489 --> 03:03:50.351]  You know, years ago, had we seen something like that, they would say that you're completely insane.
[03:03:50.351 --> 03:03:55.092]  And, you know, they have these drag queens going attacking these little kids.
[03:03:55.092 --> 03:03:56.713]  They would try to put them in jail.
[03:03:56.713 --> 03:03:58.474]  But now, today, they're glorifying it.
[03:03:58.474 --> 03:03:59.534]  They're making it okay.
[03:04:00.134 --> 03:04:07.639]  And I think we have every right, you have every right to be angry about them doing this crazy stuff to all of us as a society.
[03:04:07.639 --> 03:04:10.480]  I mean, that's just my opinion on it.
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:12.202]  It's completely sick, Will.
[03:04:12.202 --> 03:04:24.309]  And obviously the latest thing is, we literally had a convicted pedophile bragging about how he found Desmond is Amazing hot on a WordPress blog, which is still up as far as I know.
[03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:27.351]  And that's the point at which his mother got upset about it.
[03:04:27.751 --> 03:04:31.555]  Not when they were literally throwing dollar bills at him at a gay club in New York.
[03:04:31.555 --> 03:04:32.536]  That was fine.
[03:04:32.536 --> 03:04:38.601]  It was when an actual pedophile started lusting over this 12-year-old kid on the internet, then she got upset about it.
[03:04:38.601 --> 03:04:40.783]  So yeah, it's completely la la land.
[03:04:40.783 --> 03:04:41.804]  It's crazy.
[03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:43.766]  Well, hey, thank you for talking with me.
[03:04:43.766 --> 03:04:44.687]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:04:44.687 --> 03:04:48.270]  It's been an honor to sit in this chair for Alex Jones today.
[03:04:48.270 --> 03:04:50.072]  Next hour, Paul Watson.
[03:04:54.689 --> 03:04:58.307]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:04:58.871 --> 03:05:09.257]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:05:09.257 --> 03:05:14.100]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[03:05:14.100 --> 03:05:28.589]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[03:05:28.709 --> 03:05:46.476]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:05:46.476 --> 03:05:53.179]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:06:04.426 --> 03:06:16.769]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:16.769 --> 03:06:23.830]  We are live just before the Alex Jones Show on this July 9, 2019 edition.
[03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:28.811]  I'm going to go over the latest Jeffrey Epstein news, probably later on in the show.
[03:06:28.811 --> 03:06:32.112]  There are some new developments on that, which we've been covering all day.
[03:06:32.759 --> 03:06:55.053]  First we'll probably start off with this and this goes straight to the heart of what Andy Warhol once said which was basically everybody will get their 15 minutes of fame and of course with social media that makes it so much easier for people in their narcissistic zeal to clamour for that 15 minutes of fame.
[03:06:56.030 --> 03:07:09.020]  Now we've always had kids doing stupid things, and since the internet and since the rise of social media, we've always had kids doing stupid things so they can get interviewed, so they can get views on the internet.
[03:07:09.020 --> 03:07:15.205]  You know, we had the Tide Pod thing last year where people were literally filming themselves eating Tide Pods.
[03:07:15.205 --> 03:07:21.270]  At least that was damaging only to themselves, but this bizarre trend
[03:07:22.438 --> 03:07:30.027]  ...of people licking food, eating food, swilling mouthwash and spitting it back, continues.
[03:07:30.027 --> 03:07:31.409]  This is a new fad.
[03:07:31.409 --> 03:07:33.211]  Here's the latest example.
[03:07:33.211 --> 03:07:38.297]  You saw the guy there spitting into a jug of sweet tea.
[03:07:38.297 --> 03:07:42.402]  Headline, viral video shows man spitting into sweet tea before putting it back on shelf.
[03:07:44.198 --> 03:07:53.664]  There was one girl who turned out to be a minor, which is why she didn't get hit with the 20-year prison sentence, the maximum sentence that this could have procured for her.
[03:07:53.664 --> 03:07:55.445]  That was probably never going to happen.
[03:07:55.445 --> 03:07:58.386]  It was more likely going to be a slap on the wrist, a fine.
[03:07:58.386 --> 03:08:00.468]  But she got away with it completely.
[03:08:00.468 --> 03:08:02.949]  There were no charges whatsoever.
[03:08:02.949 --> 03:08:12.695]  Now, yet another video has emerged showing someone tampering with food in a grocery store, this time featuring a man spitting into a jug of sweet tea and placing it back on the shelf.
[03:08:14.053 --> 03:08:20.937]  Now again, we don't know where this happened, we don't know who this is, it's in a grocery store somewhere in America.
[03:08:20.937 --> 03:08:32.084]  Apparently, by the way this has got 4 million views on Twitter alone, having originally been posted on Reddit, so if you combine them all it's probably got almost 10 million views.
[03:08:32.084 --> 03:08:39.609]  Robbie Starbuck tweeted that apparently this individual, the spitting guy, has been identified, and he's a big leftist!
[03:08:41.118 --> 03:08:46.079]  Robbie Starbuck tweeted, they found this creep and I don't want to shock anyone but he's another leftist.
[03:08:46.079 --> 03:08:50.300]  Leftism destroys respect and societal norms at a very basic level.
[03:08:50.300 --> 03:08:58.902]  Then like this guy's recent post they're going to complain about July 4th celebrations as if that's what's hurting our country.
[03:08:58.902 --> 03:09:10.184]  So it appears that this guy has literally been whining about July 4th celebrations while he's literally spitting into cartons of sweet tea and putting it back on store shelves, which is by the way a
[03:09:11.178 --> 03:09:17.080]  Crime, tampering with a consumer product and it carries with it up to 20 years in jail.
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:29.723]  None of these people are going to get that, but it is very serious to the point where we now have cops literally guarding ice cream freezers in grocery stores in America.
[03:09:29.723 --> 03:09:35.985]  Headline, cops now protecting ice cream freezers after licking trend goes viral.
[03:09:35.985 --> 03:09:38.266]  Some grocery stores are making customers show ID
[03:09:39.727 --> 03:09:42.929]  So buying ice cream is now like buying cigarettes and alcohol.
[03:09:42.929 --> 03:09:53.375]  It says, please see employee for help with a lock on the freezer door, because they don't want anyone else trying to replicate this disgusting fad.
[03:09:53.375 --> 03:10:00.559]  And in one store, and the Keller Police Department in Texas posted this on their own public safety Facebook page.
[03:10:01.246 --> 03:10:14.571]  They've got two officers protecting the store's ice cream freezer with the caption, the only Blue Bell ice cream being licked here in Keller this holiday weekend will be the kind you've already purchased.
[03:10:14.571 --> 03:10:19.373]  So you've got actual crimes taking place in Chicago.
[03:10:19.373 --> 03:10:25.355]  I think there was something like dozens of people shot, five killed just over July 4th weekend alone.
[03:10:25.355 --> 03:10:29.717]  But now they're having to use police resources in all these different towns to guard
[03:10:30.641 --> 03:10:36.086]  I scream freezers because this trend is going viral on social media.
[03:10:36.086 --> 03:10:41.251]  You had another case of it in New Orleans headline.
[03:10:41.251 --> 03:10:45.214]  Bizarre trend of people licking food then putting it back continues.
[03:10:45.214 --> 03:10:47.336]  This was a 36-year-old man.
[03:10:47.336 --> 03:10:49.338]  This wasn't a child.
[03:10:49.338 --> 03:10:50.379]  This wasn't a minor.
[03:10:50.379 --> 03:10:51.600]  This wasn't a teenager.
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:56.885]  It was 36-year-old Linise Lloyd Martin III doing precisely the same thing
[03:10:57.814 --> 03:11:04.555]  As the kids did to a carton of Blue Bell ice cream at a grocery store in Belrose, west of New Orleans.
[03:11:04.555 --> 03:11:10.097]  It later emerged Martin had purchased the ice cream before the stunt, but it doesn't matter.
[03:11:10.097 --> 03:11:20.579]  Unlawful posting of criminal activity for notoriety and publicity and criminal mischief is a crime in New Orleans, so he's in big trouble.
[03:11:20.579 --> 03:11:22.439]  Martin was inspired by a teen.
[03:11:22.439 --> 03:11:24.060]  Imagine a grown man, a 36-year-old man,
[03:11:26.164 --> 03:11:32.730]  Thinking that he's going to get some internet clout by posting a video of himself licking some ice cream and putting it back.
[03:11:32.730 --> 03:11:35.412]  That's what defines his life now.
[03:11:35.412 --> 03:11:36.153]  And that's the point.
[03:11:36.153 --> 03:11:39.596]  Everyone's going to get their 15 minutes of fame.
[03:11:39.596 --> 03:11:48.384]  But then because of the internet, because the internet is forever, this is going to define their lives forever when people Google their names.
[03:11:48.384 --> 03:11:52.288]  So future employers, future girlfriends and boyfriends,
[03:11:53.100 --> 03:11:57.522]  They're going to see when they Google their name that this is what they're infamous for.
[03:11:57.522 --> 03:12:00.584]  What an achievement that is.
[03:12:00.584 --> 03:12:10.588]  Another clip shows what appears to be a transgender individual, nobody knows quite who or what this is, taking a swig of mouthwash before spitting it back in the bottle and walking away.
[03:12:10.588 --> 03:12:13.870]  And yes, in most of these cases they probably already bought the item.
[03:12:14.955 --> 03:12:20.238]  Then walked back into the store and pulled this stunt just for the views.
[03:12:20.238 --> 03:12:24.361]  Because almost every video has got like 4 million views.
[03:12:24.361 --> 03:12:33.386]  Another person who goes by the name Sean Mendes on Twitter had his friend film him scooping out a chunk of ice cream with his hand before putting it back in the freezer.
[03:12:33.386 --> 03:12:39.490]  And that guy got into a row on Twitter with James Charles, the makeup
[03:12:40.399 --> 03:12:44.460]  Artist YouTuber who's got like 15 million subscribers on YouTube.
[03:12:44.460 --> 03:12:49.821]  He then posted a video of a police officer showing up at his house.
[03:12:49.821 --> 03:12:53.221]  It's all totally criminal behavior.
[03:12:53.221 --> 03:12:55.722]  I expected these videos to get deleted.
[03:12:55.722 --> 03:12:58.442]  This one's got 20 million views!
[03:12:58.442 --> 03:13:00.282]  And it's still on his Twitter.
[03:13:00.282 --> 03:13:04.463]  This is like his- the crowning achievement of his life.
[03:13:04.463 --> 03:13:05.883]  And he's completely proud of it.
[03:13:05.883 --> 03:13:08.844]  He literally scooped out a huge chunk with his hand.
[03:13:09.574 --> 03:13:11.937]  Throws it back in the freezer.
[03:13:11.937 --> 03:13:20.507]  They've had to do product recalls in a bunch of these places at a cost of God knows how many thousands and thousands of dollars.
[03:13:20.507 --> 03:13:24.211]  This guy literally posted the police officer visiting his home.
[03:13:24.211 --> 03:13:28.176]  He's proud of it because he's got 20 million views.
[03:13:30.333 --> 03:13:36.775]  If you create a social media environment which rewards narcissism, then this is what's going to happen.
[03:13:36.775 --> 03:13:40.236]  The kids are definitely not alright.
[03:13:40.236 --> 03:13:47.278]  In fact, I'm just looking at this guy with his 20 million views to see if he's done it again.
[03:13:47.278 --> 03:13:53.860]  In fact, he's posted another video of somebody else doing it.
[03:13:53.860 --> 03:13:55.860]  So it just continues.
[03:13:55.860 --> 03:13:57.581]  I'm looking at another video now of some
[03:13:59.142 --> 03:14:02.224]  Rotund individual who's basically doing the same thing.
[03:14:02.224 --> 03:14:03.364]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:03.364 --> 03:14:11.048]  This shows no sign of stopping and it's being encouraged by this kind of osmosis effect.
[03:14:11.048 --> 03:14:14.470]  Even though it's a criminal offense and they could face up to 20 years in prison.
[03:14:14.470 --> 03:14:15.991]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:15.991 --> 03:14:26.777]  Meanwhile, of course, you have Belle Delphine who is basically an e-thot who gets incel losers to send her beta books on Patreon.
[03:14:27.443 --> 03:14:33.025]  For example, she says that she will basically talk to them for $2,500 a month.
[03:14:33.025 --> 03:14:40.308]  She literally started selling pots of her own bath water on the internet for $30.
[03:14:40.308 --> 03:14:44.750]  It was sold out within 48 hours.
[03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:53.653]  Then all these guys and their girlfriends started posting messages on social media saying that this had led to the breakup of relationships.
[03:14:54.480 --> 03:15:06.888]  Because the girl had opened the package and realized that her boyfriend was literally spending $30 a pop buying dirty bath water from some skanky ether on the internet.
[03:15:06.888 --> 03:15:10.871]  This is the state of Western masculinity in 2019.
[03:15:10.871 --> 03:15:15.274]  In fact, I'm going to put this in a video.
[03:15:15.274 --> 03:15:16.175]  I've compared it to the
[03:15:17.316 --> 03:15:18.798]  Shroud of Turin.
[03:15:18.798 --> 03:15:23.163]  Owning Belle Delphine's bathwater is kind of like owning the Shroud of Turin.
[03:15:23.163 --> 03:15:30.272]  But whereas Jesus Christ was the Son of God, rose from the dead, and became the central figure of the world's largest religion, Belle Delphine...
[03:15:31.514 --> 03:15:39.784]  Her activity consists of throwing eggs at mirrors and basically splashing around in her own dirty bathwater.
[03:15:39.784 --> 03:15:41.245]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:15:41.245 --> 03:15:43.328]  This is modern culture.
[03:15:43.328 --> 03:15:46.011]  On the one hand, you've got to admire her entrepreneurship.
[03:15:46.011 --> 03:15:49.134]  On the other hand, it's total and utter degeneracy.
[03:15:49.134 --> 03:15:49.555]  We'll be back.
[03:15:53.342 --> 03:15:54.563]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.563 --> 03:15:58.484]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.484 --> 03:16:00.025]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.025 --> 03:16:02.986]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.986 --> 03:16:08.528]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.528 --> 03:16:09.749]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.749 --> 03:16:12.670]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:14.891]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:16:22.854 --> 03:16:29.218]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.218 --> 03:16:32.240]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:38.184]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.184 --> 03:16:41.967]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.967 --> 03:16:43.228]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.228 --> 03:16:44.569]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.569 --> 03:16:50.773]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.773 --> 03:16:52.214]  Available at Amazon Books.

[03:17:54.206 --> 03:17:55.527]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:17:55.527 --> 03:17:56.327]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:17:56.327 --> 03:17:56.888]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.888 --> 03:17:57.408]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:57.408 --> 03:18:00.250]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.250 --> 03:18:06.353]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.353 --> 03:18:15.158]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.158 --> 03:18:16.339]  That's it.
[03:18:16.339 --> 03:18:18.961]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:18.961 --> 03:18:21.822]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.822 --> 03:18:23.103]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.263 --> 03:18:24.023]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:24.023 --> 03:18:29.467]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.467 --> 03:18:32.248]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.248 --> 03:18:34.329]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.329 --> 03:18:43.575]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.575 --> 03:18:45.476]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:18:45.476 --> 03:18:51.959]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:51.959 --> 03:18:52.900]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:54.315 --> 03:18:57.696]  The second American revolution is happening now.
[03:18:57.696 --> 03:18:59.976]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[03:18:59.976 --> 03:19:05.017]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-God world government.
[03:19:05.017 --> 03:19:08.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding.
[03:19:08.678 --> 03:19:09.978]  And we make it easy.
[03:19:09.978 --> 03:19:13.319]  That's why we're launching our biggest sale yet.

[03:19:42.178 --> 03:19:43.879]  The Globalists hope you don't.
[03:19:43.879 --> 03:19:46.782]  Whatever you do, choose what side you're on and take action.
[03:19:57.211 --> 03:20:10.799]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.799 --> 03:20:17.863]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.863 --> 03:20:21.585]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:23.564 --> 03:20:35.151]  We are back, and before I get back into some more news, I want to tell you about the Betsy Ross 1776 Limited Edition shirt, which is now available at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:20:35.151 --> 03:20:51.660]  Of course, we had the controversy last week, the dangerous, deadly, Nazi, white supremacist, original American flag with the 13 stars that has been hung at white supremacist rallies across the country, including Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration.
[03:20:53.399 --> 03:20:57.201]  Because it's that racist for the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:20:57.201 --> 03:21:03.845]  Now we've got a t-shirt to commemorate the, um, butthurt that that caused last week.
[03:21:03.845 --> 03:21:12.729]  Unlike the politically correct cowards, we're bringing you an all-new design featuring the pride and joy of revolutionary America, the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:21:12.729 --> 03:21:19.413]  Now you can share with the world your patriotism and love of freedom while letting the Liberals and Democrats know these colours don't run.
[03:21:20.885 --> 03:21:22.767]  Limited edition print.
[03:21:22.767 --> 03:21:25.931]  We've only got 4,000 of these in stock.
[03:21:25.931 --> 03:21:31.276]  It features two separate designs in two separate colours with only 1,000 of each design.
[03:21:31.276 --> 03:21:37.143]  So you can choose between the Since 1776 and the These Colours Don't Run taglines.
[03:21:37.955 --> 03:21:41.457]  And you can choose a blue or white background on the black.
[03:21:41.457 --> 03:21:46.741]  We've got the InfoWars.com logo as well as America's back.
[03:21:46.741 --> 03:21:53.806]  Celebrate the greatest country on earth and spread American patriotism and pride wherever you go with the Betsy Ross 1776 shirt today.

[03:22:11.142 --> 03:22:24.946]  Limited stock only, so be sure and get your hands on that Betsy Ross limited edition special t-shirt before it goes right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:22:24.946 --> 03:22:29.527]  Now, I put up an article on summit.news a couple of hours ago about the Women's World Cup.
[03:22:30.484 --> 03:22:49.510]  Which, if you live in the United Kingdom, has been shoved down our throats for the past three, four weeks solid in a desperate attempt to socially engineer everyone to like it, when compared to the men's game, at least according to the statistics, revenue-wise, there's really no comparison.
[03:22:49.510 --> 03:23:00.153]  And of course, we've had this narrative in the United States as well for the past three weeks, that the US women's soccer team deserves equal pay to the men's soccer team.
[03:23:01.289 --> 03:23:13.978]  Now let's just ignore for the moment the fact that a team of under 15 boys literally beat the US women's professional soccer team 5-2 back in 2017.
[03:23:13.978 --> 03:23:17.961]  Maybe they should be paid the same or even more than the women's team.
[03:23:17.961 --> 03:23:19.522]  And this is the same thing at every point.
[03:23:19.522 --> 03:23:25.787]  In fact, I remember getting into an argument with a feminist who seriously made the argument
[03:23:26.368 --> 03:23:39.740]  That the only reason men are better at sports than women, despite having bigger bone density, despite being faster, despite being having more stamina, despite having better spatial awareness,
[03:23:41.202 --> 03:23:51.167]  The only reason men are better at sports is because of social conditioning and because they're encouraged to get into sports as children at an early age.
[03:23:51.167 --> 03:24:07.215]  Even though you literally had the professional US women's soccer team, the best of the best, they won the World Cup, were beaten 5-2 by a team of teenage boys, same thing happened with the Australian women's soccer team.
[03:24:07.938 --> 03:24:09.159]  Professional.
[03:24:09.159 --> 03:24:10.080]  That's their job.
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:11.461]  They train day in, day out.
[03:24:11.461 --> 03:24:12.642]  That's all they do.
[03:24:12.642 --> 03:24:15.224]  They were beaten by a team of under 15 boys.
[03:24:15.224 --> 03:24:18.207]  7-0.
[03:24:18.207 --> 03:24:24.532]  So clearly there's something more than social engineering going on, social conditioning from birth.
[03:24:24.532 --> 03:24:26.053]  But no, that doesn't matter.
[03:24:26.053 --> 03:24:34.320]  We have to accept this bizarre identity politics credo that there are no biological, physical differences between men and women.
[03:24:35.834 --> 03:24:48.165]  And Megan Rapinoe, who is the pink-haired, purple-haired feminist who hates Donald Trump and refused to sing the national anthem, she's obviously been at the forefront of this narrative.
[03:24:48.165 --> 03:24:59.034]  In an interview after the World Cup win, she said, regarding the equal pay argument, everybody's ready for it, everybody wants it, everybody's ready for the conversation to be moved to the next piece.
[03:25:00.103 --> 03:25:07.745]  Well, maybe that next piece should be allowing transgenders to play for women's soccer teams.
[03:25:07.745 --> 03:25:15.767]  And then we'll see if there are any biological differences between men and women, because usually they tend to dominate, don't they?
[03:25:15.767 --> 03:25:22.568]  There you see her involved in that incident where the US flag was dropped on the ground.
[03:25:22.568 --> 03:25:26.649]  Obviously, a massive sign of disrespect was immediately picked up by one of her teammates.
[03:25:27.981 --> 03:25:35.266]  So she's been at the forefront of this argument, trying to claim that women, women soccer players, should be paid the same as men.
[03:25:35.266 --> 03:25:41.030]  Well, when you look at the actual revenue they bring in, somewhat of a difference.
[03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:51.718]  Forbes reports the Men's World Cup in Russia generated over six billion in revenue, with the participating teams sharing 400 million.
[03:25:51.718 --> 03:25:54.940]  Meanwhile, the Women's World Cup is expected to earn 131 million.
[03:25:57.751 --> 03:26:00.772]  And that's over a full four-year cycle.
[03:26:00.772 --> 03:26:15.219]  So in other words, a four-year cycle compared to a one-year cycle, the Women's World Cup earned £5,869,000,000 less in revenue than the Men's World Cup.
[03:26:15.219 --> 03:26:18.340]  And yet they want to be paid the same.
[03:26:18.340 --> 03:26:25.303]  The media may have attempted to socially engineer people to embrace women's soccer by shoving it down our throats every five minutes, which they've done in the UK.
[03:26:26.371 --> 03:26:30.534]  But people just aren't interested to anywhere near the level of the men's game.
[03:26:30.534 --> 03:26:31.914]  That's just a fact.
[03:26:31.914 --> 03:26:35.377]  Because it's slower, it's not as high quality.
[03:26:35.377 --> 03:26:42.021]  Granted, if you look at women's soccer from 15-20 years ago, it was hilariously poor.
[03:26:42.021 --> 03:26:43.201]  I mean, let's be honest.
[03:26:43.201 --> 03:26:45.843]  The quality has drastically increased.
[03:26:45.843 --> 03:26:55.409]  And there's no problem with encouraging young women who want to play soccer to do so, and there's no problem with celebrating them when they are victorious, as was the US women's soccer team.
[03:26:56.397 --> 03:27:11.649]  But again, to suggest that the pressure they're under in these kind of situations, these televised games, and the quality that they produce on the field, to suggest that is on a par with the men, is completely absurd.
[03:27:11.649 --> 03:27:22.738]  I did a video about this, the truth about gender, basically making the point men are better at sports than women because of physiological differences, that is clear as day.
[03:27:22.738 --> 03:27:23.819]  The only sport
[03:27:25.026 --> 03:27:36.171]  In which women perform better than men in the entire world is long-distance swimming because women naturally have more body fat, so they float better, so they're better at long-distance swimming.
[03:27:36.171 --> 03:27:43.454]  That is literally the only sport in the world that biological women are better than biological men.
[03:27:43.454 --> 03:27:45.455]  So you want to pay them the same or more for that?
[03:27:45.455 --> 03:27:45.915]  Go ahead!
[03:27:46.812 --> 03:27:51.214]  But in every other instance, in every other sport, there are huge differences.
[03:27:51.214 --> 03:28:01.980]  And that's why the revenue is significantly different to the tune of $5,869,000,000 in terms of the World Cup.
[03:28:01.980 --> 03:28:06.542]  Because again, a lot of people don't want to watch women's soccer.
[03:28:06.542 --> 03:28:09.224]  It's not very entertaining, sorry.
[03:28:09.224 --> 03:28:11.965]  If you're involved in it, if you've got family who do it,
[03:28:12.668 --> 03:28:13.549]  Fair enough.
[03:28:13.549 --> 03:28:14.789]  I don't want to watch it.
[03:28:14.789 --> 03:28:28.696]  And no matter how much they cram it down your throat, by claiming that it's on the same level as the men's game, in terms of entertainment value, importance, skill, or revenue, it's just not going to wash.
[03:28:28.696 --> 03:28:33.419]  Because biologically, men and women are, God forbid, different.
[03:28:33.419 --> 03:28:37.041]  Women are better at other things than men, which are equally or more important.
[03:28:37.041 --> 03:28:41.003]  I would argue that child-rearing is way more important than kicking around a ball.
[03:28:41.886 --> 03:28:43.568]  And they should be celebrated for that.
[03:28:43.568 --> 03:28:45.070]  And they're not.
[03:28:45.070 --> 03:28:49.375]  In this culture, child-rearing, parenting is denigrated.
[03:28:49.375 --> 03:28:51.177]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[03:28:51.177 --> 03:28:52.739]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:28:52.739 --> 03:28:53.460]  Don't go away.
[03:28:53.460 --> 03:28:55.423]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.423 --> 03:29:01.470]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms
[03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:07.273]  Are there loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat?
[03:29:07.273 --> 03:29:10.655]  Are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong?

[03:29:54.822 --> 03:29:59.668]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[03:30:54.984 --> 03:30:58.105]  1776 worldwide.
[03:30:58.105 --> 03:31:01.266]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[03:31:01.266 --> 03:31:02.006]  What does it really mean?
[03:31:02.006 --> 03:31:06.627]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[03:31:06.627 --> 03:31:08.528]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[03:31:08.528 --> 03:31:17.430]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[03:31:17.430 --> 03:31:20.471]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[03:31:21.448 --> 03:31:24.029]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
[03:31:24.029 --> 03:31:25.009]  with David Knight.

[03:31:29.611 --> 03:31:30.691]  on The War Room.
[03:31:30.691 --> 03:31:35.772]  We're going to have our crew in DC at the White House Summit on social media.
[03:31:35.772 --> 03:31:41.014]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[03:31:41.014 --> 03:31:42.815]  So everybody, share that link.

[03:35:20.518 --> 03:35:25.141]  That is available right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:25.141 --> 03:35:31.825]  Now I was talking before the break about the equal pay controversy with the US women's soccer team.
[03:35:31.825 --> 03:35:43.233]  Of course we had that incident with the flag where they dropped the flag on the ground and that incident involved the purple headed woman who hates Donald Trump and refuses to sing the national anthem.
[03:35:43.917 --> 03:35:46.718]  Refuses to visit the White House.
[03:35:46.718 --> 03:35:53.721]  Well, this video came out last night, and nobody's identified who this is or what team this is, but it's great.
[03:35:53.721 --> 03:35:59.243]  Headline, Hockey Coach, if you disrespect the anthem, get the F out now.
[03:35:59.243 --> 03:36:00.783]  So this is a viral video.
[03:36:00.783 --> 03:36:04.945]  It's basically a hockey coach talking to his team in the dressing room.
[03:36:05.839 --> 03:36:09.402]  And he says, if they disrespect the National Anthem, they can get the F out now.
[03:36:09.402 --> 03:36:14.906]  And not a single one of them seems to disagree because they all remain in the room.
[03:36:14.906 --> 03:36:17.828]  So this had 400,000 views when I wrote this article.
[03:36:17.828 --> 03:36:20.470]  It's probably got half a million at this point.
[03:36:20.470 --> 03:36:23.112]  In fact, it's got 582,000 views.
[03:36:23.112 --> 03:36:24.913]  It's gone completely viral.
[03:36:24.913 --> 03:36:30.818]  Not as viral as people licking ice cream and putting it back in the freezer, unfortunately, which has got 10 times the amount of views.
[03:36:31.556 --> 03:36:36.637]  But he said, quote, this is the coach talking to his players before this hockey match.
[03:36:36.637 --> 03:36:38.197]  We're not women's soccer.
[03:36:38.197 --> 03:36:39.318]  We're not the NFL.
[03:36:39.318 --> 03:36:50.000]  If there's anybody here who is going to be disrespectful to either the American or the Canadian national anthem, grab your gear and get the F out now because you'll never see the ice in this arena.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:51.900]  We don't have that problem in hockey.
[03:36:51.900 --> 03:36:53.221]  We're better than that.
[03:36:53.221 --> 03:36:59.522]  But there was no sense in wasting anybody's time if that SHIT was going to happen.
[03:36:59.522 --> 03:37:00.002]  And of course,
[03:37:00.805 --> 03:37:03.906]  There didn't seem to be any disagreement.
[03:37:03.906 --> 03:37:14.109]  So we need to find out who that guy is, what his name is, what the team is, because they need to be praised even further than just going viral on an anonymous Twitter video.
[03:37:14.109 --> 03:37:18.231]  Meanwhile in Russia, this was really interesting, I came across this video a couple of hours ago.
[03:37:18.231 --> 03:37:22.912]  It's basically Russia's second largest TV channel.
[03:37:22.912 --> 03:37:28.054]  Headline, Russian TV expresses bewilderment over West's transfix with identity politics.
[03:37:28.749 --> 03:37:42.399]  And it's a conversation between a guest and the host of this show in Russia and they're both completely at a loss to explain what the hell is going on with the West's obsession with identity politics.
[03:37:42.399 --> 03:37:52.046]  So they started off talking, it's all in Russian of course but there are subtitles on the video, they started off talking about Vladimir Putin's meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the G20
[03:37:53.351 --> 03:37:59.953]  And then the guests just suddenly start talking about the wider insanity that was taking place in the UK.
[03:37:59.953 --> 03:38:12.457]  Specifically, the 17-year-old schoolboy in Scotland, and we've probably played the video on the show before last week, who was suspended for saying that there are only two genders, male and female.
[03:38:12.457 --> 03:38:14.297]  You've probably seen that clip by now.
[03:38:14.297 --> 03:38:16.658]  He got into an argument with his teacher about it.
[03:38:16.658 --> 03:38:18.478]  He was suspended for three weeks.
[03:38:18.478 --> 03:38:20.699]  I think there's probably been further punishment after that.
[03:38:21.579 --> 03:38:34.182]  So you have these two Russians talking about it on Russia's primetime conversation chat show, and the guest says, quote, I expected it to provoke a backlash in society at least somewhere.
[03:38:34.182 --> 03:38:36.463]  It didn't, apart from on the internet.
[03:38:36.463 --> 03:38:43.164]  The host then said that he only knew of male and female and asked his guest to provide a description of the third, fourth, and fifth sex.
[03:38:43.164 --> 03:38:45.065]  So he's totally baffled as to what's going on.
[03:38:46.405 --> 03:39:02.254]  The guest then went on to describe a recent story, which again this happened, in the UK, about how staff at a London zoo had placed a banner in the penguin enclosure that reads, quote, some penguins are gay, get over it.
[03:39:02.254 --> 03:39:06.217]  He said, you know, I'm just at a loss, it's very hard to explain it all.
[03:39:06.217 --> 03:39:11.660]  The host joked, do gay penguins take offense if somebody mistakes them for straight penguins?
[03:39:12.930 --> 03:39:23.514]  The video was posted on YouTube under the headline, Does Theresa May Dislike Putin Because She Believes in 64 Genders and He Doesn't?
[03:39:23.514 --> 03:39:37.158]  So it's just interesting because it's these two Russian guys talking about the behavior of like an alien species on a different planet, but in reality they're talking about another country which is on the same continent.
[03:39:38.155 --> 03:39:39.696]  Really interesting.
[03:39:39.696 --> 03:39:44.420]  The studio audience reacts to it by applauding the host when he makes these jokes.
[03:39:44.420 --> 03:39:46.502]  They're similarly baffled.
[03:39:46.502 --> 03:39:57.790]  It's just again a sterling illustration of the complete disconnect between the West and the East in terms of this multiculturalism.
[03:39:57.790 --> 03:40:01.733]  Of course we had Vladimir Putin come out last week and identity politics.
[03:40:01.733 --> 03:40:03.555]  We had Vladimir Putin come out last week
[03:40:04.378 --> 03:40:07.179]  And saying that, you know, liberalism is in its death throes.
[03:40:07.179 --> 03:40:09.720]  The ruling elite have broken away from the people.
[03:40:09.720 --> 03:40:12.680]  The liberal idea has outlived its purpose.
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:15.781]  Multiculturalism is no longer tenable.
[03:40:15.781 --> 03:40:17.402]  They get that from the outside.
[03:40:17.402 --> 03:40:19.162]  They're seeing that in Russia.
[03:40:19.162 --> 03:40:20.423]  They're looking at the West.
[03:40:20.423 --> 03:40:21.383]  They're looking at France.
[03:40:21.383 --> 03:40:22.283]  They're looking at Germany.
[03:40:22.283 --> 03:40:23.944]  They're looking at the UK.
[03:40:23.944 --> 03:40:32.086]  They're seeing it basically collapse culturally as we invite in these vast numbers of people who share very different cultural beliefs.
[03:40:33.254 --> 03:40:44.825]  They haven't invited those vast numbers of people in, so they've still maintained a stable, steady culture, and they're seeing it from the outside, and they're absolutely baffled.
[03:40:44.825 --> 03:40:47.608]  And this is another example of that.
[03:40:47.608 --> 03:40:52.412]  Festival removes rapper who quit music fest that double-charged whites.
[03:40:52.412 --> 03:40:55.475]  So, of course, we had this story a couple of days ago.
[03:40:55.475 --> 03:40:58.358]  Detroit, Michigan's Kindred Music and Culture Festival
[03:40:59.033 --> 03:41:09.158]  ...has removed rapper Tiny Jag from the Fest's lineup after she dropped out of Afro Future Music Festival upon learning that they double-charged whites for admission.
[03:41:09.158 --> 03:41:12.320]  So this festival, Afro Music... Afro Future Music...
[03:41:13.391 --> 03:41:20.517]  Had to walk it back and say no we're not going to charge white people double because again that is the bigotry of low expectations.
[03:41:20.517 --> 03:41:31.127]  It's not only racist against white people, it's racist against non-white people presuming that they wouldn't be able to afford the $20 fee because they're all so poor.
[03:41:31.127 --> 03:41:40.355]  They had to walk it back because the ticket website Eventbrite said that it was a violation of their policy because you can't charge different prices
[03:41:41.081 --> 03:41:46.467]  Based on people's skin color, because of course that's completely racist.
[03:41:46.467 --> 03:42:01.023]  But now a different music festival has de-platformed the black artist who complained about it rightly and said that it was racist because she complained about it and said that she wouldn't perform at this festival.
[03:42:01.684 --> 03:42:11.169]  So it's now a different festival that's pulled out, that's deplatformed her at least, because she had the temerity to stand up to racism.
[03:42:11.169 --> 03:42:19.214]  And now of course she's being called an Uncle Tom, she's getting threats, and further down the rabbit hole we go.
[03:42:19.214 --> 03:42:20.834]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:42:20.834 --> 03:42:25.777]  Meanwhile, Math Teacher loses job after defending Western Civilization.
[03:42:25.777 --> 03:42:27.078]  This is up on Zero Hedge.
[03:42:28.081 --> 03:42:35.305]  Um, a math teacher says she's lost her job at a private school in Southern California for speaking out in defense of Western Civilization.
[03:42:35.305 --> 03:42:45.551]  She committed the thought crime of actually standing up for Western Civilization, the greatest thing that's ever happened to the planet.
[03:42:45.551 --> 03:42:47.452]  Now she's out of a job.
[03:42:47.452 --> 03:42:49.473]  We truly live in Clown World.
[03:42:50.373 --> 03:42:51.835]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:42:51.835 --> 03:42:52.556]  We'll be back.
[03:42:52.556 --> 03:42:53.057]  Don't go away.
[03:43:05.213 --> 03:43:16.318]  That's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, has to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:43:16.318 --> 03:43:17.779]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[03:43:17.779 --> 03:43:27.383]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trusts of the 19th century, who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:43:27.483 --> 03:43:32.445]  The Infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[03:43:32.445 --> 03:43:35.106]  To make real the actions of independent free speech.
[03:43:35.106 --> 03:43:38.108]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[03:43:38.108 --> 03:43:44.850]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[03:43:44.850 --> 03:43:47.732]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:43:47.732 --> 03:43:49.512]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:43:49.512 --> 03:43:51.433]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:43:51.433 --> 03:43:52.674]  Even it is what you just saw.

[03:47:26.576 --> 03:47:35.760]  And again, before I get back into the news, I want to bring your attention to the limited edition Betsy Ross 1776 t-shirt.
[03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:37.841]  This was a big controversy last week.
[03:47:37.841 --> 03:47:43.423]  How dare Nike even attempt to bring out a product with an American flag on it?
[03:47:44.316 --> 03:47:51.962]  The 13 star American flag, which is so racist and white supremacist, it was hung at Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration.
[03:47:51.962 --> 03:47:53.943]  That's how evil it is.
[03:47:53.943 --> 03:47:59.508]  So now we've got a limited edition print with just 4,000 t-shirts in stock.
[03:47:59.508 --> 03:48:02.810]  Two separate designs, two separate colors.

[03:48:03.471 --> 03:48:10.536]  You can choose the since 1776 design or you can choose these colors don't run design.
[03:48:11.556 --> 03:48:13.718]  Yeah, they're blue or white background.
[03:48:13.718 --> 03:48:19.724]  We've got the InfoWars.com logo on the back and the text America's Back.

[03:48:53.231 --> 03:48:55.074]  Let's cover some of this Epstein news.
[03:48:55.074 --> 03:48:59.059]  It's kind of died down since the indictment was announced yesterday.
[03:48:59.059 --> 03:49:07.531]  Obviously, it didn't name any high-profile names, but we did have a report out of OANN, Jack Posobiec,
[03:49:08.622 --> 03:49:28.298]  Epstein to name individuals involved in underage sex in return for five year maximum sentence so he might try and cop some kind of deal where he does actually name some of these quote high-profile individuals although he could just as easily name some underlings and protect his rich friends.
[03:49:28.298 --> 03:49:33.563]  Of course we had Bill Clinton come out last night with a statement basically saying that
[03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:45.019]  He only appeared, he only flew on the Lolita Express four times, like that's not bad enough, that he hadn't talked to Epstein in 10 years.
[03:49:45.019 --> 03:49:51.906]  That contradicts completely the flight logs which show that he was on the plane at least 26 times, if not more.
[03:49:51.906 --> 03:49:58.492]  We had a sex trafficking expert who appeared on Fox News last night who basically said he was lying.
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:07.070]  Ann Coulter came out and said that he thinks Epstein had a state sponsor and was running a blackmailing operation.
[03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:14.360]  She said Epstein, according to both the girls' accounts, wanted them to have sex with powerful men, come back to him and report on it.
[03:50:15.089 --> 03:50:22.194]  And of course he had cameras throughout the house so he was obviously trying to entrap some people so he could later blackmail them.
[03:50:22.194 --> 03:50:26.116]  She went on to say, quote, it just seems to me something much bigger is behind this.
[03:50:26.116 --> 03:50:27.937]  Perhaps a state sponsor.
[03:50:27.937 --> 03:50:29.438]  Powerful enough people.
[03:50:29.438 --> 03:50:37.524]  It just seems to me there's something very powerful force what's going on here and I'm nervous about this not coming to a conclusion.
[03:50:37.524 --> 03:50:41.586]  There's also a battle taking place on Wikipedia.
[03:50:41.586 --> 03:50:43.708]  Last time I checked it actually includes
[03:50:44.528 --> 03:50:49.334]  The deep intense connections between Epstein and Clinton.
[03:50:49.334 --> 03:50:51.657]  Yesterday for a time it didn't.
[03:50:51.657 --> 03:50:55.642]  Wikipedia editors battled to hide Bill Clinton's link to Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:50:56.627 --> 03:50:58.428]  They had the link to Donald Trump.
[03:50:58.428 --> 03:51:06.130]  Of course, Trump said in 2002, basically came out with a quote that was praiseworthy towards Epstein.
[03:51:06.130 --> 03:51:15.012]  Later reports suggested that as soon as Trump discovered that Epstein had tried to hit on a young girl at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, he kicked him out.
[03:51:15.012 --> 03:51:17.913]  And that's basically when he severed ties with him.
[03:51:17.913 --> 03:51:22.294]  That information, the Trump quote from 2002 saying he's a quote, terrific guy,
[03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:30.281]  was on Wikipedia yesterday, or it was on two days before, the Clinton connection was removed.
[03:51:30.281 --> 03:51:43.984]  They completely removed the fact that he was on the plane, the Lolita Express with Epstein, the one with underage girls on it, with beds on it, 26 times it was removed from Wikipedia.
[03:51:43.984 --> 03:51:49.305]  Last time I checked it's back on, but again this just shows you Wikipedia is not an impartial
[03:51:50.262 --> 03:51:51.523]  Forum for Information.
[03:51:51.523 --> 03:51:54.525]  It's like when they say Snopes.com is impartial.
[03:51:54.525 --> 03:51:55.465]  No, it isn't.
[03:51:55.465 --> 03:51:59.368]  It's run by far-left fringe activists.
[03:51:59.368 --> 03:52:08.574]  Wikipedia is mainly controlled by far-left fringe activists who literally edit out reality and try to dictate reality.
[03:52:08.574 --> 03:52:11.416]  There you see Conchita Sarnoff who was on Fox News last night.
[03:52:12.344 --> 03:52:23.650]  Calling Clinton a liar, saying they had the flight logs from different pilots at different times with his name entered into the flight logs with the likes of Kevin Spacey.
[03:52:23.650 --> 03:52:26.551]  That information was briefly wiped from Wikipedia.
[03:52:26.551 --> 03:52:34.335]  Who will win the Wikipedia battle to tell the truth about the high-profile clients that were linked to Jeffrey Epstein?
[03:52:34.335 --> 03:52:35.696]  We'll wait and see on that.
[03:52:35.696 --> 03:52:37.937]  It's a back and forth thing.
[03:52:37.937 --> 03:52:38.417]  Meanwhile,
[03:52:39.466 --> 03:52:44.269]  In Europe, Danish history professor says it's time to build a wall around Europe.
[03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:57.536]  This is Uffe Ostergaard, who says the integration of migrants has failed and, quote, protecting borders is necessary, otherwise the population will rebel against the government.
[03:52:57.536 --> 03:53:03.460]  He said the time has come to build walls with wire fences in four lanes, floodlights and guard posts.
[03:53:04.375 --> 03:53:08.498]  He said, ghettos are a good example of parallel societies that arise.
[03:53:08.498 --> 03:53:13.102]  The integration has not failed for everyone, but for relatively many people.
[03:53:13.102 --> 03:53:24.251]  Remember the mainstream media still to this day claims that no-go Islamic ghettos, which are all over Europe right now, where if you send a film crew, they'll attack you.
[03:53:24.251 --> 03:53:27.654]  If you're a woman walking down the street, they'll harass and accost you.
[03:53:27.654 --> 03:53:29.996]  They still claim those don't exist.
[03:53:29.996 --> 03:53:32.078]  Here's a Danish history professor
[03:53:32.887 --> 03:53:38.788]  He was a Jean Monnet Professor of European Civilization and Integration at Aarhus University.
[03:53:38.788 --> 03:53:40.049]  This is no small fry.
[03:53:40.049 --> 03:53:43.630]  He specializes in European identity history.
[03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:53.272]  He studied multicultural and multi-ethnic states, including ones that collapse, such as Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire and their successor states.
[03:53:53.272 --> 03:53:54.932]  He knows what he's talking about.
[03:53:54.932 --> 03:53:59.033]  He's saying we need a wall around Europe because integration has failed.
[03:53:59.033 --> 03:54:01.154]  And integration has failed no more, obviously,
[03:54:01.929 --> 03:54:05.652]  Then in Sweden, where we have this headline.
[03:54:05.652 --> 03:54:11.156]  Video of migrant gang shoving gun in Swedish boys mouth stirs controversy.
[03:54:11.156 --> 03:54:13.598]  We see these videos all the time.
[03:54:13.598 --> 03:54:20.163]  Swedes, Danes, Germans being bullied by migrant gangs of youths.
[03:54:20.163 --> 03:54:24.145]  Humiliated, in some cases tortured, and they put it on video.
[03:54:24.145 --> 03:54:30.010]  A video showing a gang of migrant youths bullying a Swedish teenager by shoving a gun in his mouth and forcing him to dance.
[03:54:30.859 --> 03:54:32.960]  Has stirred controversy.
[03:54:32.960 --> 03:54:44.204]  We know they're a migrant gang because they speak with heavy accents and they refer to the gun, which they force this teen to kiss, with a Turkish name.
[03:54:44.204 --> 03:54:53.006]  So they're Turkish migrants, at least their parents are of Turkish origin, because they're referring to the gun with a Turkish word.
[03:54:53.006 --> 03:54:56.568]  The boy is clearly being humiliated for the pleasure of his tormentors.
[03:54:56.568 --> 03:55:00.189]  The video was uploaded to YouTube but subsequently deleted.
[03:55:01.974 --> 03:55:05.576]  Swedes reacted to the video with a mixture of anger and dark humor.
[03:55:05.576 --> 03:55:12.000]  One said, the youngsters voices are still cracking and they are already running around with weapons and terrorizing the Swedish people.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:13.981]  The future seems promising.
[03:55:14.841 --> 03:55:30.595]  Of course, we've featured the surveys in the past done by major institutions and newspapers which routinely show that migrants in Sweden are vastly over-represented in prison population and in violent crime and rapes in Sweden.
[03:55:30.595 --> 03:55:33.858]  The problem is the government stopped cataloguing
[03:55:34.651 --> 03:55:43.056]  statistics based on the identity of perpetrators of crime in relation to race and migrant background back in 2005, 14 years ago, because they said it was racist.
[03:55:46.747 --> 03:56:08.211]  So now the Swedish government refuses to collect crime stats on its own population because they're so terrified of that narrative which is backed up by all these different studies done by newspapers and other institutions that show that there is a huge problem with migrants not being integrated in Sweden and committing violent crimes.
[03:56:08.211 --> 03:56:10.652]  Which of course was exacerbated after 2015
[03:56:12.651 --> 03:56:25.155]  When they invited in 150,000 new refugees, mainly from Islamic countries, and that's when you start to see the rape stats increase.
[03:56:25.155 --> 03:56:36.898]  Now I think it's a third of Swedish women say they're afraid to go out at night, and remember those are the ones who admit to it, in a country where it's completely verboten to be critical of mass immigration.
[03:56:36.898 --> 03:56:38.659]  So it's probably more like two-thirds.
[03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:52.356]  We had the article the other day, Swedish author Bjorn Reyniel said that the level of crime and violence is experiencing, as Sweden is experiencing, amounts to what he called a small-scale war.
[03:56:52.356 --> 03:57:03.062]  And much of it is migrant on migrant, the gangs fighting each other, but this always spills over to the rest of the population, which is what you're seeing now in London.
[03:57:04.562 --> 03:57:08.025]  Where it's not just black-on-black, gang-on-gang crime.
[03:57:08.025 --> 03:57:11.168]  It's spilling over and innocent people are getting caught up in it.
[03:57:11.168 --> 03:57:19.717]  And it's gotten so bad to the point where Somalian parents who have migrated to London are now saying that they're sending their kids home.
[03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:29.730]  Because it's safer in Somalia than it is in London because these kids get caught up in this lifestyle of violence and they can't get out of it.
[03:57:29.730 --> 03:57:35.536]  Absolutely frightening times, but Mercedes-Benz says that London is safer than ever.
[03:57:36.295 --> 03:57:37.777]  That's gonna wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:57:37.777 --> 03:57:40.199]  Coming up next, War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:40.199 --> 03:57:42.021]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:42.021 --> 03:57:43.042]  We'll be back.
[03:57:43.042 --> 03:57:47.226]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:57:47.226 --> 03:57:48.287]  They are technocrats.
[03:57:48.287 --> 03:57:50.589]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:57:50.589 --> 03:57:57.456]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:57:57.916 --> 03:57:59.778]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:57:59.778 --> 03:58:02.260]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:58:02.260 --> 03:58:08.765]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:58:08.765 --> 03:58:13.949]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warsandlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:58:13.949 --> 03:58:22.956]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:58:23.937 --> 03:58:29.920]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:58:29.920 --> 03:58:30.861]  It is amazing.
[03:58:30.861 --> 03:58:40.867]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:44.343 --> 03:58:45.684]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:58:45.684 --> 03:58:46.444]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:58:46.444 --> 03:58:47.024]  Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.024 --> 03:58:47.385]  That's it.
[03:58:47.385 --> 03:58:50.386]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:58:50.386 --> 03:58:52.888]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:58:52.888 --> 03:58:53.988]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.419 --> 03:59:14.160]  I agree entirely.
[03:59:14.160 --> 03:59:19.603]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.603 --> 03:59:22.404]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:59:22.404 --> 03:59:24.466]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:24.466 --> 03:59:33.711]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.711 --> 03:59:35.612]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:59:35.612 --> 03:59:42.096]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.096 --> 03:59:43.017]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:47.118 --> 03:59:49.733]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
