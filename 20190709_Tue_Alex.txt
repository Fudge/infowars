[00:00.000 --> 00:07.760]  It's Tuesday, July 9th, 2019, I'm your host, Alan Jones, and I'm going to be in and about
[00:07.760 --> 00:11.560]  the office today doing a lot of important work behind the scenes that takes a bit of
[00:11.560 --> 00:17.600]  generaling, but we've got Will Johnson, one of my favorite talk show hosts, who's visiting
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.600]  us in town.
[00:18.600 --> 00:22.520]  We're a sponsor of his own independent show on YouTube and other platforms that reaches
[00:22.520 --> 00:27.200]  millions of people a week, but he's come to town to work with us on some projects and
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.000]  I decided to have him host today.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.360]  He'll be hosting some of the War Room this week when Owen's up in D.C., covering the
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.400]  big event up there with the Trump White House social media summit, as Trump prepares to
[00:39.400 --> 00:43.480]  take action in citizenship, but he's going to be here, David Knight's going to pop in
[00:43.480 --> 00:48.400]  as a guest, Ben Garrison, the great cartoonist is going to pop in as a guest, and some other
[00:48.400 --> 00:54.320]  surprise guest today, but I really like Will Johnson because he's a smart guy, he's a
[00:54.320 --> 01:00.880]  loving guy, and he's smooth and has a lot of confidence and really cares, and I've
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.560]  seen him go out and do these prayer meetings in California where the left comes out, sometimes
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.440]  up to a thousand Antifa to attack him and just to 50 people, and they stood their ground
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.560]  when it happened, and that's what got Pelosi to finally admit that Antifa was bad last
[01:15.560 --> 01:21.720]  year was Will Johnson and others, so he certainly paid his dues in the last few years in the
[01:21.720 --> 01:24.840]  fights against the globalists, and we're just excited to know there are independent reporters
[01:24.840 --> 01:31.560]  like him out there, so he's going to be piloting the Good Ship Info Wars today until Owen Shroyer
[01:31.560 --> 01:36.400]  takes over, and then Owen's going on an airplane to go to Washington D.C. for all the huge
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.160]  covers we're going to have there, but good things are happening, the whole globalist
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.320]  pedophile rings are being exposed, the world government's being exposed, big pharmas being
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.720]  exposed, the open borders are being exposed, so much is happening because you've been
[01:49.720 --> 01:54.800]  steadfast and we've held the course, but now, more than ever, we've got to continue
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.800]  to focus, continue to spread the word, because only your word of mouth can override the globalist
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.960]  and their censorship show, however you're watching on local TV or listening on local
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.280]  radio or watching us at inforwars.com, or however you're watching or listening, download
[02:09.280 --> 02:15.320]  the shows, share them, there's no copyright, just get them out there because you are overriding
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.920]  the AI at Google, you're overriding the censorship at Apple and Facebook and Twitter, you're
[02:19.920 --> 02:26.600]  doing it, we're winning, but just barely, a year ago we were losing, but you can see
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.160]  the growth curve, we're going over the top, you know what I'm saying, make it the top
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.320]  of the mountain, it's all downhill from there, which means it's a lot easier from there,
[02:35.320 --> 02:46.320]  we're going over...
[03:05.320 --> 03:21.040]  Almost there, the summits right there, but their best troops are dug in, they're demoralized,
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.440]  they know they're losing, but damn it, they've been ordered to fight to the death, so we've
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.800]  got to be ready to be lied about, to be demonized, they're going to try to put us in prison like
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.880]  Tommy Robinson, they're going to try to set me up like with the child porn, but the truth
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.760]  is they're out of bullets politically, people don't believe a word they're saying anymore,
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.680]  and that's what's exciting, and there are these attacks on us have only intensified
[03:42.680 --> 03:49.760]  the support, but that's good because I've got all these operations I've ready to launch,
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.960]  believe me, what you see on InfoWars is only the surface, beneath the surface, we are doing
[03:55.960 --> 04:02.800]  a lot of things and a lot of organizations and a lot of groups count on you, I'm just
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.920]  the conductor here, but you're the lightning, you're the music, you're the fire, you're
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.040]  all the instruments, and when you take action nothing on earth can stop you, so I can't
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.920]  tell you about these initiatives, and in years down the road just so you get some satisfaction,
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.440]  I'll let you know some of the stuff you financed and did, but let me tell you, it's dramatic
[04:24.440 --> 04:27.880]  and it's powerful, and the truth is nobody else is willing to do this, but you've been
[04:27.880 --> 04:32.320]  willing to do it, we've been willing to take it on the chin, and we're coming to the fire
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.520]  together, so thank you all, coming up after the break, Will Johnson's going to take over,
[04:36.520 --> 04:43.880]  it's going to be quite a broadcast coming up this Thursday through Friday, 34 hour broadcast,

[05:53.680 --> 06:01.560]  today.
[06:01.560 --> 06:08.720]  Ross Perot at 89 years old has lost his battle with leukemia, but left behind a great family,
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.960]  grandchildren, and great grandchildren.
[06:10.960 --> 06:17.080]  Ross Perot is a visionary, self-made billionaire, classic Texan, but more than anything, he
[06:17.080 --> 06:22.000]  did really care about people, as his son said in a statement today to the Dallas Morning
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.400]  News, that he knew that Canada had opened its border to the U.S. and that their wages
[06:27.400 --> 06:33.120]  had gone down by half in major industrial jobs and manufacturing in other areas.
[06:33.120 --> 06:38.480]  He understood that lowering our wages wouldn't help the third world.
[06:38.480 --> 06:43.600]  In the end, it would be a giant sucking sound that would end up in China and that would
[06:43.600 --> 06:47.840]  let the authoritarians that control China dominate world trade.
[06:47.840 --> 06:53.320]  That was back in 1991 and 1992 that he talked about the giant sucking sound, got out his
[06:53.320 --> 06:56.720]  charts and graphs and showed the world the facts.
[06:56.720 --> 07:02.160]  And guess what, exactly what Ross Perot said what happened.
[07:02.160 --> 07:09.400]  Now we have a 2.0 type Ross Perot, Donald John Trump, who even back at the time that
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.600]  Ross Perot was going on television talking about open borders and globalism being bad,
[07:14.600 --> 07:21.840]  Donald Trump was saying the exact same things on Oprah Winfrey and even on CNN.
[07:21.840 --> 07:27.560]  So we owe a debt, a big debt to Ross Perot and just like Donald Trump gets attacked and
[07:27.560 --> 07:34.080]  Donald Trump gets lied about, Ross Perot got attacked and Ross Perot got lied about.
[07:34.080 --> 07:37.720]  That's why when you see him for wars being lied about with them saying the most incredible
[07:37.720 --> 07:43.800]  things you could, just the worst things with no proof, that we're over the target and that's
[07:43.800 --> 07:47.800]  why I love this audience and appreciate you all so much because think about how far we've
[07:47.800 --> 07:55.120]  come since the days of Barry Goldwater and the John Burt's Society and Ron Paul in the
[07:55.120 --> 08:01.520]  1980s and everybody else that came before us, Larry McDonald, countless others, Cleons
[08:01.520 --> 08:09.760]  Gousen, so many others that were attacked and audited and imprisoned, Congressman Hansen
[08:09.760 --> 08:15.320]  had killed like Congressman Begich for exposing these things.
[08:15.320 --> 08:19.480]  There were Democrats, there were Republicans like Senator Frank Church and others that
[08:19.480 --> 08:25.360]  told the truth and exposed this whole system when it was in its infancy, but now the New
[08:25.360 --> 08:26.920]  World Order is not in its infancy.
[08:26.920 --> 08:31.280]  It's up on its hind legs and it's trying to take the planet over and trying to destroy
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.360]  the nation state and using third world populations that they've already exploited to now be used
[08:36.360 --> 08:38.160]  as weapons against us.
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.480]  The truth is, globalism is bad for everybody but the mega offshore banks who have designed
[08:43.480 --> 08:44.480]  it.
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.360]  It is a post-human system that's being set up and Ross Perot, say whatever you want about
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.800]  it, cared about people, cared about markets, understood like Henry Ford did that you've
[08:54.800 --> 09:02.280]  got to make the markets serve people, not people serve the markets and that's where
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.920]  the purest libertarians funded by the Koch brothers and others are absolutely wrong because
[09:07.920 --> 09:14.640]  in the final equation they're all being subsidized by the welfare state, Walmart, the Koch brothers,
[09:14.640 --> 09:18.960]  all of them and so the system that they've developed that they claim as libertarian is
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.040]  actually crony capitalism and nothing but exploitive.
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.040]  So boy by eyes on your trip Mr. Perot, hope to see you someday at the next level.
[09:28.040 --> 09:31.560]  Now we're going to go back to the live feed with an amazing talk show host who's visiting
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.000]  us here in Austin, Texas, Will Johnson and then I'm going to pop back in with a couple
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.200]  of other reports on the huge developments on the Epstein pedophile situation and the
[09:43.200 --> 09:49.440]  fact that Ann Coulter is now saying what I've been telling you for seven or eight years,
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.920]  that Robert Mueller was controlling him and using him with cameras in his house and on
[09:54.920 --> 10:04.640]  the airplanes to blackmail powerful businessmen and that's now all coming out of the powerful
[10:04.640 --> 10:11.320]  businessmen they were never able to set up was Donald John Trump.
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.880]  Also ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is going to be coming on the show tomorrow not
[10:15.880 --> 10:21.160]  to talk about the stupid rice and cake stuff but Epstein and so many other big things that
[10:21.160 --> 10:26.920]  are happening and unfolding so be sure and look forward to that and Paul Joseph Watson
[10:26.920 --> 10:31.640]  is going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.280]  There are so many huge developments I can't cover them all, they're at infowars.com, they're
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.880]  at newswars.com, the Russian government has said that what's happening to Tommy Robinson
[10:39.880 --> 10:46.760]  is wrong, that he's being persecuted, drugreport.com in the middle column has linked to his powerful
[10:46.760 --> 10:53.040]  interview yesterday with us, his plea to President Trump for amnesty, has a political dissident,
[10:53.040 --> 10:56.840]  has a journalist being persecuted, the left has hit the comment section and is saying
[10:56.840 --> 11:02.280]  oh perfect, he's against refugees and asylum seekers but now he wants asylum here, here's
[11:02.280 --> 11:08.880]  the difference, he was born in England, born in the UK where we get our Magna Carta, our
[11:08.880 --> 11:14.160]  new process, our whole systems, he is a famous journalist, he is facing long prison sentences
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.880]  for exposing pedophile rings and simply covering them, no one else has ever been given sentences
[11:18.880 --> 11:22.920]  like this, he's the textbook example of who we should be bringing into the country, be
[11:22.920 --> 11:28.640]  black or white, older, young, Muslim or Christian, if they're actual well known journalists facing
[11:28.640 --> 11:33.080]  prison sentences for reporting, that's why we bring in hundreds of people a year from
[11:33.080 --> 11:39.400]  Cuba and China and others and they're given political asylum as journalists, Tommy Robinson
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.760]  is the textbook case for this and is facing death if they send him back to prison Thursday
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.960]  which they're signaling they're going to do, I talked to Tommy this morning, he's with
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.080]  lawyers today but he will be joining us again live on the show tomorrow, as I said ladies
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.520]  and gentlemen a lot of things are happening, all right back to Will Johnson hosting the
[11:57.520 --> 12:04.120]  show, David Nikes coming up, we also have a lot of other people, Ben Garrison coming
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.520]  on so this is going to be an amazing transmission, please continue to do your amazing part without
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.840]  you or nothing, tell everyone you know on every forum and every facet and every email
[12:12.840 --> 12:22.560]  and every text message in word of mouth about Infowars.com and NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news
[12:22.560 --> 12:34.800]  today, Infowars, the most banned network in the world, to prosecute wars takes a lot of
[12:34.800 --> 12:42.360]  money and if you look at the communists they'll rob banks, they'll sell children to sex slavery,
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.440]  they'll hold people ransom for money for the revolutions but that's not how our founding
[12:48.440 --> 12:55.880]  fathers did it, they just robbed British gold shipments, killed people, we're not doing
[12:55.880 --> 13:03.240]  any of that, we're just selling t-shirts and books and films and air filtration in non-GMO
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.760]  heirloom seats, a general store of high quality products at great prices and so we have our
[13:09.760 --> 13:16.360]  new special and it is the biggest special we've ever had, the last special we had was
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.840]  basically Christmas in July, it's the best specials we do, 50% off free shipments, stuff
[13:21.840 --> 13:30.120]  like that, this new special if you take advantage of all the sales that are there is 75% off
[13:30.120 --> 13:37.480]  more than 30 items, the average item is 50% off so the sale runs the gambit, the gauntlet
[13:37.480 --> 13:48.120]  from 75% off to 25% off and there's a bunch of other specials too, a dozen items are 1776,
[13:48.120 --> 13:54.040]  some of these items retail for $50 and we've never sold them for this price but it's true
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.240]  I've habituated the audience to big sales and the audience is smart, they know wow these
[13:59.240 --> 14:05.360]  are really good deals on the air filtration, the water filtration, the seeds, the supplements,
[14:05.360 --> 14:13.480]  here's an example, nobody ever put $15 plus into a turmeric formula, our body's ultimate
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.400]  turmeric formula has at least $15 a product in it, not counting shipping and marketing
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.480]  everything goes to the cost, the leading competitor puts $5 in the bottle, it's the strongest
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.440]  turmeric extract with all the other key co-enzymes, if you don't know about turmeric, you need
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.880]  to learn about it, if you don't know about bodies you just find out about it, that's
[14:31.880 --> 14:38.440]  one product, and ladies and gentlemen, it is the highest discount we've ever offered
[14:38.440 --> 14:49.480]  on it, 75% off, it's just crazy, InfoWarsStore.com is the main site, InfoWarsLife.com is the
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.240]  supplement area, it takes you right to that and a celebration of the amazing victories
[14:54.240 --> 15:01.800]  we're having against tyranny, we're having the 1776 worldwide sale that we are just launching
[15:01.800 --> 15:06.200]  and a lot of these products like X2 are on the verge of selling out, brain force and
[15:06.200 --> 15:13.280]  things but whether it's winter sun or Icaron or bio, PCA or fluorolife or gut fusion, all
[15:13.280 --> 15:22.760]  shirts and hats including the new Betsy Ross 1776 are also discounted for 1776, so everything
[15:22.760 --> 15:30.040]  is on sale, okay, at InfoWarsStore.com and that's how we fund this operation and again,
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.640]  I can't tell you about all the initiatives we're involved in because when my name's
[15:33.640 --> 15:37.760]  on it, the enemy tries to shut it down, you already understand that, but what you see
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.920]  visibly at InfoWars is the tip of the iceberg, there's a giant mountain under the water
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.320]  and we are doing amazing things thanks to your support, there is nowhere on earth where
[15:50.320 --> 16:01.160]  you can financially invest, get great products back and know that you are fueling unexplosives,
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.160]  I guised.

[20:46.480 --> 20:56.220]  not going to pay for it, you're not going to pay for it, you're not going to pay for
[20:56.220 --> 21:06.240]  it, you're not going to pay for it, you're not going to pay for it, you're not going
[21:06.240 --> 21:14.220]  to pay for it, you're going to pay for it, you're not going to pay for it, you're going
[21:14.220 --> 21:20.620]  is such a blessing. I never imagined just to give a brief description. My name is Will Johnson.
[21:20.620 --> 21:25.180]  I was living in California. I moved to Texas not anticipating that I would be sitting in this
[21:25.180 --> 21:31.820]  chair today. I was laid off my job and I said I'm going to get into this fight 100%
[21:32.940 --> 21:38.300]  that's happening in America. And here I am today. And I've been speaking out
[21:38.300 --> 21:47.020]  vocally, loudly for for over three years now and never imagined that I would be here.
[21:47.660 --> 21:53.580]  And I want to say I give God all glory that I am here. So with that said,
[21:54.700 --> 22:01.020]  a lot of times I would listen to Alex in the morning and I would commute to work. I would listen
[22:01.020 --> 22:09.180]  to Alex and he will talk about how he has his operation going and he needs everyone to support
[22:09.180 --> 22:15.500]  him, everyone to help him. And when I got here, I could absolutely could see. Now I don't have
[22:15.500 --> 22:20.860]  seen everything of course, but all the people that he has working here, all the wonderful people
[22:20.860 --> 22:30.140]  that I've come in contact with here at Infowars, it really set the stage. It really set what I
[22:30.140 --> 22:36.140]  what he was talking about. I could visibly see what he was talking about. And it's so important
[22:36.140 --> 22:42.620]  that people support Infowars. You know, you have the liberal media, you have Democrats, you have
[22:42.620 --> 22:48.380]  all of the socialists left attacking Infowars and Infowars is at the tip of the spear.
[22:49.340 --> 22:57.580]  And here I am sitting in this chair, the hottest chair in America next to the one in the Oval Office.
[22:57.580 --> 23:05.900]  This is it right here, the hottest chair in America. And when the, was it Brian Stelter said that
[23:05.900 --> 23:14.540]  Trump is the Infowars president. And I was just, that's just wonderful. Because Alex Jones, he is
[23:14.540 --> 23:19.820]  the general, general Jones. And you know, there's, there's different ranks when you, when you're a
[23:19.820 --> 23:26.700]  general, you can have a one star, two star, three star, all the way up to five star. And
[23:26.700 --> 23:35.180]  and Alex Jones is the five star general. He is the highest you can be. He is the five star general.
[23:35.980 --> 23:41.740]  And he has created something here that is just absolutely remarkable. He is at the top. He's,
[23:41.740 --> 23:49.900]  he's been on top of this from day one. And people don't even recognize how much he has done here.
[23:49.900 --> 23:54.300]  And I come here and I'm just at awe. It's just so amazing. And for me to be in this seat,
[23:54.300 --> 23:59.900]  sitting here to be able to talk to so many people and to talk about what's happening in the world
[23:59.900 --> 24:07.100]  is a great honor. Okay, so let's get into some of the news. I mean, so we already heard about
[24:07.100 --> 24:14.860]  Ross Perot dying. You know, Ross Perot was before my time, you know. So before I even was looking
[24:14.860 --> 24:20.620]  at even into politics, I mean, I heard about Ross Perot back in the day, but he was completely
[24:20.620 --> 24:27.100]  before my time. And Alex Jones, he has all the details on Ross Perot and he can give you so
[24:27.100 --> 24:32.700]  much more information than I can. But you know, we all we have to say a prayer and a loss for the
[24:32.700 --> 24:38.700]  dead, right? We never want to ill will for anybody because at one day at one point, we all have to
[24:38.700 --> 24:45.420]  go there at one day. We all have to, we all have that appointment. We don't know when, but we all
[24:45.420 --> 24:52.860]  have that appointment. So one thing that has happened is been happening in the news is you
[24:52.860 --> 25:01.180]  have these leftists going into supermarkets and they're licking ice cream. Now they're spitting in
[25:01.180 --> 25:08.780]  tea. And you one would have to think what is going on in their mind to do such a thing?
[25:09.980 --> 25:13.660]  You know, I mean, so when I go into the store, I'm thinking about when I'm going to buy and take
[25:13.660 --> 25:17.340]  home and eat for later. Or if I'm going to buy something in the store, I'm going to take it
[25:17.340 --> 25:23.820]  outside and eat it right then. But you have people deliberately going into these supermarkets,
[25:23.820 --> 25:28.060]  going into these stores, and they're eating the ice cream and then they're putting it back?
[25:29.260 --> 25:35.100]  I mean, at what point did they start thinking that this was okay? And who started yummy? Who
[25:35.100 --> 25:40.620]  came up with the idea? Let's do this and record it and see if it goes viral. This is this something
[25:40.620 --> 25:46.380]  that is normal. No, it's not normal. But this is the normalcy for the liberals. This is what's
[25:46.380 --> 25:51.420]  going on in their mind. And I truly believe that we're in a time to where the liberals, the leftists,
[25:51.420 --> 25:57.820]  they want to go to the extreme. That's why we're seeing this stuff. They go to the extreme. Let's
[25:57.820 --> 26:05.740]  see how far we can take this insanity. And for this to be taking place today in the year 2019,
[26:05.740 --> 26:12.300]  it's like we're almost going back. It's like we're becoming savages all over again. And it's 100%
[26:12.300 --> 26:18.060]  the left. Now if you know what, if it was conservatives doing this, you would have CNN, ABC,
[26:18.060 --> 26:23.900]  CBS, all of the alphabet network, soup group, liberal media talking about it. Look what Trump
[26:23.900 --> 26:29.580]  supporters are doing. Look what Trump supporters are doing. They're licking food and putting it
[26:29.580 --> 26:33.820]  back on the shelf. But you know what, right now they say nothing about it. Like this is okay.
[26:33.820 --> 26:42.060]  This is what's expected of the left. Do something extremely crazy, extremely crazy. And then guess
[26:42.060 --> 26:48.940]  what? It's okay. Why? Because we're leftists. As long as we're leftists when we do this, it's okay.
[26:49.820 --> 26:56.140]  So now you have to have police officers standing in front of ice cream. I mean seriously, come on
[26:56.140 --> 27:00.380]  people. Police officers should be doing something else. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
[27:00.380 --> 27:04.780]  minute, wait a minute. Maybe now that they have police officers standing in front of ice cream,
[27:04.780 --> 27:10.620]  that's racist, right? Because the left always, they're always calling police officers racist.
[27:10.620 --> 27:17.100]  So maybe police officers standing in front of ice cream is now racist. Oh my goodness.
[27:18.140 --> 27:22.540]  Are they going to protect the vanilla or are they going to protect the chocolate? Which one are
[27:22.540 --> 27:27.980]  they going to protect first? This is the police officers having to protect ice cream. This is
[27:27.980 --> 27:36.940]  the insanity that we're living in in America on the planet earth today. Who thought of this crazy
[27:36.940 --> 27:43.340]  stuff? I mean, you know, if I, now when I go in, I don't even want to buy, you know, I don't even buy
[27:43.340 --> 27:49.660]  ice cream that comes in the tub, especially after this. And then tea, I only buy the tea if the tea
[27:49.660 --> 27:55.180]  hasn't, hasn't, have not had the seal broken on it. Some tea when you buy it has the seal on it.
[27:55.180 --> 27:59.420]  You have to make sure the seal is there because if the seal is not there and I walk outside and I
[27:59.420 --> 28:05.100]  come and I open it up and the seal's been broken, I'm going to return that tea wherever I buy it
[28:05.100 --> 28:09.180]  from. No matter what the drink is, I'm going to return it. I'm going to tell them that the seal
[28:09.180 --> 28:13.340]  was broken. And if they have an issue with it, I'm going to say maybe you need to call the police
[28:13.340 --> 28:19.260]  because someone is tampering with the food in your establishment. We should not be experiencing this
[28:19.260 --> 28:25.340]  in the year 2019. I'm not, you know what? Really, the left would love to blame President Trump for
[28:25.340 --> 28:34.140]  this because the left has been doing everything crazy, crazy, crazy after President Trump won in
[28:34.140 --> 28:41.500]  2016. Think about it. Now we had crazy people in the past, but it's never been this crazy.
[28:41.500 --> 28:45.980]  They are going to a new plateau with their craziness and they're not going to stop.
[28:45.980 --> 28:51.660]  They like the craziness. They enjoy the craziness. That's why they're doing it and we're going to see
[28:51.660 --> 28:56.460]  more of it. More to this break. My name is Will Johnson and this is the Alex Jones Show.

[30:00.220 --> 30:06.940]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[30:06.940 --> 30:13.100]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being broken
[30:13.100 --> 30:20.540]  and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes will likely
[30:20.540 --> 30:27.820]  be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The system is vulnerable.

[32:04.460 --> 32:08.540]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic
[32:08.540 --> 32:12.780]  political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why
[32:12.780 --> 32:16.860]  the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this
[32:16.860 --> 32:20.460]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real
[32:20.460 --> 32:24.940]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[32:24.940 --> 32:28.940]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[32:28.940 --> 32:33.740]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[32:33.740 --> 32:38.860]  after the Great Depression. The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty
[32:38.860 --> 32:43.740]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original
[32:43.740 --> 32:48.540]  promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working
[32:48.540 --> 32:52.540]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the
[32:52.540 --> 32:56.700]  whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting
[32:56.700 --> 32:59.980]  what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[32:59.980 --> 33:05.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:30.300 --> 33:39.980]  all right welcome back welcome back my name is will johnson and this is the alex jones show
[33:40.860 --> 33:48.460]  what a wonderful time this is what an amazing time to be alive you know with everything going
[33:48.460 --> 33:53.980]  on you would think that at some point the left would be like okay we're going a little bit too
[33:53.980 --> 34:02.060]  far where our craziness is going a little overboard maybe we should dial it back but they don't
[34:02.060 --> 34:11.660]  dial it back they keep going and going and going and going i think before 2020 gets here
[34:11.660 --> 34:19.260]  which is a short time we're going to see so much more insanity from the left i think they're going
[34:19.260 --> 34:28.620]  to go to the extreme i mean everything that they do is just completely insane think about it so let
[34:28.620 --> 34:35.580]  me give you an example you know i just talked about the ice cream and how now you have police
[34:35.580 --> 34:44.300]  officers they're guarding the uh the cabinets that's holding the ice cream you know chocolate
[34:44.300 --> 34:50.700]  ice cream matters i mean so they're going to make it racist right they're probably will i mean i
[34:50.700 --> 34:57.020]  wouldn't put it past these leftists to make it racist i mean it's just crazy the insanity that
[34:57.020 --> 35:04.060]  we're seeing today is coming from somewhere and i truly believe that we're in a spiritual battle
[35:04.060 --> 35:09.180]  this spiritual battle that we're seeing is intensifying why else do you think that they
[35:09.180 --> 35:15.820]  would be going to the extreme with their insanity this spiritual battle you have demons taking over
[35:15.820 --> 35:25.580]  the minds of people convincing them to do this insanity to do crazy things no one expected this
[35:25.580 --> 35:31.580]  i mean seriously well i will take it back you've had people in the past talk about how liberalism
[35:31.580 --> 35:37.100]  will come you know and our fascism will come in the form of liberalism you know we've seen that
[35:37.100 --> 35:43.180]  we've heard that and here it is i think what it is no one just anticipated that it would happen
[35:43.180 --> 35:52.860]  this soon or today in the year 2019 they are just insane i mean it's to the point now they're telling
[35:53.500 --> 36:00.780]  you know young boys young girls young ladies that you don't have to be the way god created you
[36:01.340 --> 36:06.380]  you can be something entirely different if you want to be a doorknob you can if you feel like
[36:06.380 --> 36:12.860]  it you can be a doorknob this is the way they're teaching children you know it's the whole thing
[36:12.860 --> 36:20.780]  with the whole transgender dragon queen dragon story telling time where they're trying to indoctrinate
[36:20.780 --> 36:25.980]  the children today so when they become younger those they can say this is the norm it's insane
[36:25.980 --> 36:31.500]  it's insane let me change subjects a little bit here let's talk about making america great again
[36:31.500 --> 36:38.140]  so nancy polosi she she's hearing the news recently talking about making america or she's saying
[36:38.140 --> 36:45.020]  basically that president trump wants to make america white again you know if you really think
[36:45.020 --> 36:54.140]  about that when did america or when was america ever just white because we've always had indians
[36:54.140 --> 36:59.260]  here there's always been black people here regardless of how many democrats put them on
[36:59.260 --> 37:03.260]  slave ship or liberalism or people on the left put them on slave ships and brought them here
[37:04.140 --> 37:11.580]  it's always been diverse in america so it's never been strictly just white but see they want to push
[37:11.580 --> 37:19.340]  this narrative that president trump is only about white people or the republican party is only about
[37:19.340 --> 37:25.340]  white people when the republican party was created to help black people it was created
[37:25.340 --> 37:33.740]  on emphasize on that created to help black people all together but you have the democrats
[37:33.740 --> 37:39.100]  they don't like that so that's why the democrats completely fight against the republicans on
[37:39.100 --> 37:43.980]  everything that they do and since i've been speaking out and since i've been doing this
[37:43.980 --> 37:48.780]  since i woke up to what the democrats have been doing to black people i come to realize and i
[37:48.780 --> 37:57.340]  recognize that the democrats every single time you have republicans that put something in place
[37:57.340 --> 38:04.220]  that will benefit black people democrats will step in to try to stop it the civil rights acts
[38:04.220 --> 38:11.580]  who was against that democrats black people voting who was against that democrats ending
[38:11.580 --> 38:19.740]  slavery by the republicans who wanted to stop that democrats black people being on
[38:19.740 --> 38:26.220]  welfare being in the ghettos living in these situations who wanted to stop that democrats
[38:26.220 --> 38:31.820]  wanted to continue it but republicans wanted to stop it it's always been democrats that always come
[38:31.820 --> 38:38.220]  in and try to change and reverse everything that republicans did that were good for black people
[38:38.220 --> 38:42.940]  and then they want to try to change it to make it look like they take credit for it it's always
[38:42.940 --> 38:50.460]  been it's the common denominator has always been democrats coming into play try to reverse everything
[38:50.460 --> 38:57.660]  positives that republicans did for black people and here it is we're seeing it today it's happening
[38:57.660 --> 39:03.660]  all over again president trump prison reform now the democrats they act like they're for it
[39:03.660 --> 39:10.060]  but really they're against it because president trump will take credit for it they don't want
[39:10.060 --> 39:15.420]  to get president trump credit for it and let me tell you making america great you know what that
[39:15.420 --> 39:22.540]  means for me as a black male in this country making america great means that we are going to have
[39:22.540 --> 39:28.780]  fathers in the household that's what it means to me it means that we're going to teach we're going
[39:28.780 --> 39:35.500]  to teach children to be respectful to the elders that's what it means to me making america great
[39:35.500 --> 39:43.900]  again says that we are going to have students and black males and just children in general
[39:43.900 --> 39:52.460]  respect law enforcement and ultimately god see right now the democrats they want to take the
[39:52.460 --> 39:57.580]  whole thing and twist it and make it look like america make america great again it's only specifically
[39:57.580 --> 40:05.260]  for white people i mean they what it is the democrats are excluding black people in all of this
[40:05.260 --> 40:10.780]  what about making america great for black people they don't even say that you can't say it's blm
[40:10.780 --> 40:15.900]  black lives matter because then black lives matters they exclude white people when you talk about
[40:15.900 --> 40:20.940]  america that is the biggest difference between republicans and democrats republicans will talk
[40:20.940 --> 40:27.100]  about americans as a whole but you have liberals only talk about specific groups why because they
[40:27.100 --> 40:34.540]  want to do that to divide us and you have the same thing with the whole nikey coming out yes
[40:34.540 --> 40:41.340]  absolutely bestie ford and see now to my understanding to my understanding she was against slavery
[40:42.460 --> 40:48.140]  and you have crapper nick coming out there talking about how oh this is so bad this is so bad this
[40:48.140 --> 40:54.380]  is the model of the left find something that's good find something that's going to benefit the
[40:54.380 --> 41:02.060]  american people and see how you can destroy it that is it that's the ultimate goal here destroy
[41:02.060 --> 41:08.380]  everything let's take something that is good and destroy it that has been the model of the democrat
[41:08.380 --> 41:13.340]  left and that's what they are about today and in my in my personal on united america first
[41:13.340 --> 41:18.700]  dot com i'm always talking about how the democrats support everything of satan and i still say that
[41:18.700 --> 41:24.620]  today because everything that they do when they support when they do these crazy things for as
[41:24.620 --> 41:30.060]  abortion telling little johnny that he can be little kimberley going against everything of god
[41:31.020 --> 41:36.300]  now am i saying that republicans are angels absolutely not we're all sinners but you don't
[41:36.300 --> 41:42.620]  have you only have one group that's openly supporting everything of satan and that is the democrat party
[41:42.620 --> 41:49.340]  the democrat party also created the kkk this is nothing new that i am telling you everyone is aware
[41:49.340 --> 41:59.660]  of all of this but making america great again means that i have the opportunity to sit in the chair
[41:59.660 --> 42:07.340]  that i'm sitting in right now do you understand what i'm saying that's making america great again
[42:07.340 --> 42:12.140]  what an honor would a blessing for me to be sitting in this chair and they have the nerve
[42:12.140 --> 42:16.380]  that that's needed to sit there and say that because you're white because you're a born white
[42:16.380 --> 42:21.820]  that you're automatically a neo-nazi white supremacist that's because they have nothing

[43:09.980 --> 43:13.660]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[43:13.660 --> 43:17.580]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[43:17.580 --> 43:21.420]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people

[43:24.460 --> 43:29.900]  and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims
[43:29.900 --> 43:35.820]  are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through
[43:35.820 --> 43:39.740]  the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say
[43:39.740 --> 43:44.220]  it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[43:44.220 --> 43:48.140]  and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects

[47:56.380 --> 48:00.620]  you know i mean the reason why it's strange you watch something and and then all of a sudden
[48:00.620 --> 48:05.500]  you're on that set it's really kind of strange yeah it is my first came here too yeah it is i mean
[48:05.500 --> 48:12.060]  well a week ago i was laid off my job no and i just upped and moved my family here to texas not
[48:12.060 --> 48:17.100]  anticipating that i would be sitting in this chair today wow wow so i mean look at god welcome
[48:17.100 --> 48:21.340]  look at god i mean i give god all credit you know god is the awesome god so yeah providence
[48:21.340 --> 48:24.780]  was talked about all the time by the founding fathers wasn't it and it's not just for nations
[48:24.780 --> 48:29.580]  it's especially for each of us individually yes yes absolutely yeah so you know in the last
[48:29.580 --> 48:35.740]  segment i was talking about making america white again and also with uh you know i'm this insanity
[48:35.740 --> 48:42.300]  of the no no no the acronism i said today was we gotta say uh count american citizens again
[48:42.300 --> 48:47.420]  that's kaka right yeah we're gonna wind up with an s whole country right so that should be the new
[48:47.420 --> 48:54.140]  motto you know you know i'm glad you brought that up why why is it racist that if you want to count
[48:54.140 --> 49:00.460]  american citizens that that why is it racist i mean to me that doesn't make any sense how is
[49:00.460 --> 49:04.940]  why is it racist you know because everything is racist that's the tool that they use to make
[49:04.940 --> 49:10.380]  sure that they can oppose you and again if you look at what they're saying well you you've got
[49:10.380 --> 49:13.580]  npr and other people saying well look at what president trump said friday as he's heading out
[49:13.580 --> 49:19.900]  to the airplane he's saying well it's about apportioning districts as well as uh how you're
[49:19.900 --> 49:23.580]  gonna do the money well that's exactly the same thing that a california judge said california
[49:23.580 --> 49:30.140]  judge said if you ask this question it's gonna cost california uh political power and it's gonna
[49:30.140 --> 49:35.180]  cost them money the california judge can say that but president trump can't and it's true it is about
[49:35.180 --> 49:40.620]  that it is about a raw exercise of power and i said as important as that citizenship question is
[49:40.620 --> 49:45.660]  and it is very important because that's how they're going to allocate political power even if they
[49:45.660 --> 49:50.220]  don't give the vote to foreign citizens criminally trespassing in united states then they're going to
[49:50.220 --> 49:55.260]  have more people in the census which means that california will get more seats in congress and
[49:55.260 --> 50:00.780]  more seats in the electoral college so it is a very important question uh and that's a reason why
[50:00.780 --> 50:04.460]  it should be on the census but now they're coming back and they're saying even jesson palatano this
[50:04.460 --> 50:08.460]  morning while i was getting coffee was saying well you know you got to give the judges a reason
[50:08.460 --> 50:12.140]  for why you you can ask any question you want but you got to give them a good reason for why you
[50:12.140 --> 50:17.660]  ask that question it's like no you don't that's a lawyer talking uh jesson palatano is basically
[50:17.660 --> 50:24.300]  a lawyer you don't need to have the presidency bowed down to the judiciary to the judges to
[50:24.300 --> 50:29.820]  every single we got 3500 federal judges he doesn't have to get unanimous approval of every one of
[50:29.820 --> 50:34.780]  those judges one federal judge should not be able to blackball a presidential policy when he has that
[50:34.780 --> 50:39.980]  authority and that's the most important question it is a question of authority and if president
[50:39.980 --> 50:44.620]  trump were to successfully push back against these people by doing something like an executive order
[50:44.620 --> 50:49.180]  that would be the most important thing that he's done in his presidency because that's how they're
[50:49.180 --> 50:53.500]  blocking him everywhere entry jackson did that entry jackson said the supreme court all right
[50:53.500 --> 50:57.340]  they've made their decision let's see them enforce it they don't have the ability so because the
[50:57.340 --> 51:02.540]  democrats know that they're going to lose power lose seats let's make up something and say it's
[51:02.540 --> 51:07.020]  racist yeah has nothing to do with it no has nothing to do with being racist i mean if you're
[51:07.020 --> 51:12.220]  an american citizen yeah raise your hand yeah is that racist all of a sudden that is racist that
[51:12.220 --> 51:17.340]  doesn't make a lick of sin that's but you know that is the tactics of the left that's right make
[51:17.340 --> 51:23.500]  up something make it racist and then we'll just go with it at that angle well the other part of this
[51:23.500 --> 51:29.660]  is that they want to go in these judges say okay i can say that it's about money and political power
[51:29.660 --> 51:35.420]  but president trump can't say that and if president trump says that that is evidence of bias so these
[51:35.420 --> 51:40.940]  judges put themselves in the position of saying i'm going to base my ruling not on what the
[51:40.940 --> 51:45.660]  constitution says the president has authority on i'm not going to base my ruling on what the law
[51:45.660 --> 51:50.540]  says i'm not going to base it on any of that stuff i'm going to base my ruling on what i think he
[51:50.540 --> 51:57.420]  thinks right and so you know what i got karnak the magnificent you know what i've read this envelope
[51:57.420 --> 52:02.700]  here and i can discern what his impure motives were he's obviously racist i think look at his
[52:02.700 --> 52:07.500]  supporters all these people are deplorable they're racist because he's racist that means that this law
[52:07.500 --> 52:11.660]  even though it is technically correct even though he has the power the delegated power to do that even
[52:11.660 --> 52:15.500]  though he has the authority to do that i'm not going to allow that because i don't like his motives
[52:15.500 --> 52:23.020]  as i imagine them yeah i mean i was just looking at it and i just how are they able to do this
[52:23.020 --> 52:28.620]  and like you said you have one judge to come in and they just one judge changed everything
[52:28.620 --> 52:34.060]  and as a leftist judge of course one probably appointed by obama well yeah look at what's
[52:34.060 --> 52:38.860]  happening with congress congress has advocated their authority to the administrative state
[52:38.860 --> 52:42.860]  all these different three letter bureaucracies that just write the rules for us and then if
[52:42.860 --> 52:46.380]  it's a rule that we violate we don't have any constitutional protections of due process we
[52:46.380 --> 52:51.100]  don't have the presumption of innocence we don't have any protection against excessive fines we
[52:51.100 --> 52:55.340]  don't have due process they can come in and say you violated that started with the irs now they're
[52:55.340 --> 52:59.580]  all doing that remember when the f a a said if you don't register your toy drone with us we're
[52:59.580 --> 53:04.940]  going to find you 25 yes i remember that yes people push back against that but it has to we
[53:04.940 --> 53:11.420]  we've had our our elected representatives in congress abdicate their authority ram paul is
[53:11.420 --> 53:15.820]  the only person in a couple of people in congress who've worked with him on what he calls the reins
[53:15.820 --> 53:21.660]  act trying to reign in the overreach of the bureaucracy but for the most part congress
[53:21.660 --> 53:26.300]  has abdicated its authority to the administrative state to these bureaucracies the presidencies
[53:26.940 --> 53:32.060]  including president trumps so far have abdicated their executive power to the judicial branch
[53:32.620 --> 53:37.420]  and so it's a very important thing for us to get that back because right now we have a situation
[53:37.420 --> 53:42.780]  where we have not only taxation without representation we have legislation without representation we
[53:42.780 --> 53:47.900]  have these unelected bureaucrats who are there for life and we can't get rid of them and they're
[53:47.900 --> 53:53.100]  dictating and shutting down every aspect of president trump Amy even the when he had the
[53:53.100 --> 53:59.580]  immigration restrictions they called it a muslim ban and he had seven different countries one of
[53:59.580 --> 54:03.340]  them was north korea i forget one of the other ones that was not muslim but two of them were
[54:03.340 --> 54:08.300]  obviously not muslim north korea is not muslim by the way and then he had five muslim countries well
[54:08.300 --> 54:12.620]  that's only 10 of all the muslim countries in the world these were countries that obama had
[54:12.620 --> 54:16.140]  gone to war with right and they called it racist and they said you can't do that and those federal
[54:16.140 --> 54:20.860]  judges who shut that down you know this is that same thing again everything that president trump
[54:20.860 --> 54:27.500]  does is racist for example the fourth of july fourth of july as all of a sudden now become
[54:27.500 --> 54:34.940]  racist i mean it's it's it's insane the left they would not stop going be above and beyond
[54:34.940 --> 54:40.700]  their own insanity trying to make everything look racist or completely against america
[54:40.700 --> 54:48.060]  the fourth of july i know uh alex jones he was talking about uh uh trump's speech on the fourth
[54:48.060 --> 54:54.140]  and it was absolutely a wonderful speech and of course you have the left again trying to make
[54:54.140 --> 55:00.780]  it look like that it was racist or the fourth of july now is all of a sudden about trump and trump
[55:00.780 --> 55:05.500]  only well here's the thing about the fourth of july why they want to make it about slavery and so
[55:05.500 --> 55:10.620]  forth they want to go back and have you focus on their interpretation of history 200 years ago
[55:10.620 --> 55:15.580]  so that you don't pay attention to the fact that you are now a slave today each and every one of
[55:15.580 --> 55:21.340]  us regardless of what our skin color is yes we are each of us a slave to the federal government
[55:21.340 --> 55:26.780]  and these regulatory agencies that rule over us to make these rules and if if you were and they
[55:26.780 --> 55:30.780]  want to get us fighting with each other so we don't fight with them yeah try to get our freedom back
[55:30.780 --> 55:35.500]  yeah exactly we're we're like all these little ants and they don't want to distract you know it's
[55:35.500 --> 55:39.500]  the same thing like with the history you know they want to go back and change the history to where
[55:39.500 --> 55:43.340]  they make it look like the democrats have always been for minorities and black people and women
[55:43.340 --> 55:47.340]  which is that has not been the case you know i was talking about that a little bit earlier how
[55:47.340 --> 55:51.340]  every time the republican party came up with something that's going to benefit black people the
[55:51.340 --> 55:56.140]  democrats will step in to try to reverse it or try to stop it yeah yeah i mean that's the
[55:56.140 --> 56:00.460]  common denominator it's always been there for reparations yeah exactly you know what thank you
[56:00.460 --> 56:05.180]  i i didn't even mention that one the republicans came up with reparations the democrats reversed it
[56:05.180 --> 56:09.740]  when they when they gave it to black people 40 acres in a mule democrats came in and said no
[56:09.740 --> 56:13.420]  you're not going to have it so you have to give this property over to your former slave owners
[56:13.420 --> 56:18.620]  it's always been that here's the thing that's most amazing kamala harris comes up with her
[56:18.620 --> 56:22.300]  first uh you know she was one of the first ones to jump into reparations in spite in spite of the
[56:22.300 --> 56:26.780]  fact that she's not african-american that nobody her family's ever enslaved her father was jamaican
[56:27.420 --> 56:31.740]  bragged about the fact they own slaves her mother was from india now she comes up with i think
[56:31.740 --> 56:38.060]  probably the first uh concrete proposal for how to do reparations and she said she wants to give
[56:38.060 --> 56:46.540]  25 000 to every black individual who makes up to a hundred thousand dollars or a black head of
[56:46.540 --> 56:51.660]  household that makes up to 125 000 in the head in the household income now think about that
[56:51.660 --> 56:58.780]  you know as you had the uh the the black writer for collette saying he said look uh my parents
[56:58.780 --> 57:02.460]  or grandparents they might have had your great grandparents who are slaves or my parents who
[57:02.460 --> 57:07.500]  suffered under jim crow they had standing to do something about this they could have sued about
[57:07.500 --> 57:12.300]  this because i've had a lot of privileges and he goes so you're going to take money from a poor white
[57:12.300 --> 57:16.700]  appalachian uh worker and you're going to give it to me when i'm making a six figure salary
[57:16.700 --> 57:21.580]  and that's exactly what kamala harris wants to do it's absolutely amazing she put a price tag on
[57:21.580 --> 57:26.700]  it a hundred billion dollars of racism right there from kamala harris yeah you know it just goes to
[57:26.700 --> 57:33.100]  show more insanity from the left yeah be as crazy as you can be because that's what everyone wants
[57:33.100 --> 57:39.820]  to see all right we are on the alex jones show will johnson david night we will be right back
[57:39.820 --> 57:45.900]  after this break see you in a minute
[57:49.180 --> 57:56.140]  as we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[57:56.140 --> 58:03.660]  heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of america it
[58:03.660 --> 58:09.980]  is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right
[58:10.540 --> 58:18.220]  and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our codes as long as we remember our great
[58:18.220 --> 58:25.980]  history as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing
[58:25.980 --> 58:35.180]  that america cannot do
[58:39.500 --> 58:45.660]  info wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power the republic in the name of jesus christ full power
[58:45.660 --> 58:48.380]  damn the torpedoes go straight at them
[58:50.700 --> 58:55.100]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[58:55.100 --> 59:00.460]  that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[59:00.460 --> 59:04.780]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[59:04.780 --> 59:09.100]  funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[59:09.100 --> 59:14.700]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[59:14.700 --> 59:18.940]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[59:18.940 --> 59:23.820]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[59:23.820 --> 59:28.380]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[59:28.380 --> 59:33.100]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the
[59:33.100 --> 59:37.820]  persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[59:38.380 --> 59:43.180]  they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom
[59:43.180 --> 59:48.220]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming defamation lawfare
[59:48.220 --> 59:55.420]  and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:12.220]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:23.100]  front lines of the info war divide and conquer turn man against woman woman against man father
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:33.820]  against son black against white it just goes on and on and now we see every sporting event
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:43.660]  that every human action that takes place being turned into an attempt to manipulate human minds
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:50.460]  and turn us against each other and who's doing it a consortium of big powerful exploitive mega
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:57.740]  corporations who just 50 years ago made about 20 percent of the profit for themselves now they get
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:04.380]  70 percent but they're the ones all day telling you about inequity between black people and white
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.860]  people and old people and young people and people of the third world people of the first world
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:16.060]  because it's a distraction from what they're doing a rearguard action look at this headline by
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:25.740]  paul joseph watson info wars dot com equal pay women's world cup brings in 131 million compared
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:37.340]  to men's which earned six billion now if something has six billion dollars coming in versus 131 million
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:44.540]  who's going to get paid more you know it's kind of like if a movie comes out that cost 100 billion
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:51.900]  to make but it makes 500 million do the producers make more money on that versus a movie that cost
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:02:00.380]  a million to make that makes 20 million a fifth grader would say that the one that makes the
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:09.340]  hundreds of millions more that the people would get paid more and if people in history chose to go
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:17.740]  see women's sporting events more than they would see men's the women would be paid more now i know
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:23.020]  our audience understands this but when you pull back you see the women's team from the us winning
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.980]  and it being turned into an america hating throw american flags on the ground bitch and complain
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:34.300]  demand more funding that's not going to get more money to the women in fact just like the nfl pay
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:41.260]  is set to be cut because nfl viewership is down about 39 from four years ago because of all of the
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:50.060]  cavernic type garbage people are tuning out of this crap hollywood's bottom line is getting
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:56.220]  smaller and smaller because no one wants to go see movies with all the politically correct
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:03.260]  garbage but why does the system keep doing it because if you look at the profits hundreds of
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:08.620]  billions a year by hollywood hundreds of billions a year by sports it's still a fraction of the
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:14.060]  trillions and trillions a day in digital money transfers that the globalists have created out
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:20.300]  of thin air you've got facebook coming out with its own digital blockchain currency they can make
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:26.140]  trillions out of thin air so they don't care if they run hollywood and the nfl and women's sports
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.580]  into the ground hey i love women's sports i love all sports it's great i like watching the women
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.180]  at the olympics boy i love watching the pool vultures love watching those beautiful strong
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:42.380]  bodies but it doesn't matter because i won't tune into it because everything is a lecture i won't
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.180]  watch men's sports i won't watch women's sports because anytime i try to sit down with a family
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:54.700]  and watch it it is laced with crap so we watch old movies my kids want to go over to friends houses
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.340]  and watch the crap they can do it but i'm not going to be part of this anymore and the real thing we
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:04.300]  can do is vote with our dollars and pull back from this and not support it it's like the new york
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.700]  times and always other big groups of the locks and poster bankrupt but they've got big powerful

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:35.740]  with mr david night so the soccer team yeah the soccer team you know alex just was just talking
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:41.660]  about it before the break um what are your thoughts on it well you know well this is the fourth time
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:47.020]  the women's us women's soccer team has won the world championship why have we not heard about them
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.100]  when they did it the first second and third time i think it's simply because you've got a colin
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:57.340]  cappernick figure they're the person of megan rapino she is now this is why everybody is talking
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.540]  about it why they've made a big deal out of it it wasn't a big deal the first three times they
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:05.100]  did it now it is and if you go back to the last time they won the world championship it was 2015
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:13.260]  two years later they played an under 15 year old boys team and got beaten five to two
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.500]  then they played went on to the tournament and they beat the russian so i mean they weren't
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:25.500]  a really weak team by world standards of the women's soccer and then two years later they
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.740]  win the uh the uh soccer thing again but now it's all because uh the fact that they are
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.820]  protesting president trump this is why the corporate media is making a big deal out of it that
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:41.660]  right there that only and i said because they're being paid for by the taxpayers and we're told
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.900]  all the time that we have to just shut up and go away because the internet is now owned by a lot of
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:54.300]  by a handful of giant private corporations they now own the internet and so we should should
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.860]  just shut up and get off of the public square if they say so well okay by those same rules
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:04.220]  since the u.s taxpayer owns the u.s women's soccer team can we tell these people to shut up and go
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:11.340]  away i mean i'm not about censorship look i'm fine if she wants to protest this stuff yeah but uh
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.300]  you know that's the double standard that we see is what i'm pointing out it it is it is i can i
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:23.020]  completely agree with you how how do you so how do they expect to get paid the same amount when
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:27.660]  they don't bring in the same amount is it just because they're taxpayers they just want to you
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.380]  know increase the taxes on the american people just to give them more money that way regardless
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:38.940]  so maybe in that case instead of increasing the pay for the women how about decrease the pay for
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.740]  the men that's right yeah well it's not it's not going to be market-based i mean look like uh
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.060]  the world soccer championships aren't really market-based anyway it's by the fact that nike
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:55.660]  goes out there and uses this as an opportunity to make money off of their anti-americanism
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:01.420]  off of their anti-trump nike simply they just hate trump they hate america and i said this
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:07.100]  a long long time ago i mean everybody's saying well look see this wasn't about the police situation
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.780]  at all no of course it wasn't about the police situation if it was about the police situation
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:17.100]  you would have these leaders who are pushing back against this they would say uh look there's a higher
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:23.900]  percentage of black people that have abuse the system of the police but there's more white people
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.900]  in terms of absolute numbers so let's get the black people together and the white people together
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:33.740]  and let's decide how we are going to control the system and we've got bad actors how do we purge
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.740]  them out of the system instead of allowing them to stay in the system but they don't want to solve
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.940]  that problem they want to use that as a means to divide people that's what it's always been about
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:48.300]  from day one it's also been about the marxism that tries to deconstruct our culture and now you can
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:54.300]  clearly see that with this betsy ross situation and the fact that nike immediately jumps in and says
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:10:00.220]  well we need to have equal pay uh you know they're being criticized in france for being too white uh
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:06.940]  this this women's soccer team you you can't win once you go down this path of let's divide everybody
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.620]  by demographics uh even the women's soccer team can't win that fight ultimately yeah you know i was
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:17.020]  they just put up on a screen i was going to talk about uh how the the stadium was chanting equal
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:23.500]  pay equal pay equal pay you know maybe everyone chanting f trump f trump yeah basically yeah came
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.420]  back and said we're ashamed to be americans it's like well i'm ashamed you're an american yeah you
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:35.020]  know i mean it's why exactly i mean why don't everybody that was in the stadium go ahead and pay
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:40.460]  another hundred bucks on their ticket exactly so the equal pay will come in i guarantee everyone in
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.260]  the stadium to know i don't want to pay an extra hundred bucks you know our tickets should be free
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.580]  you know because the whole socialism thing and the whole soccer thing they want to make everything
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.860]  free they want to steal our money taxpayer dollars and just pay for everything i wouldn't be surprised
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.740]  if the the other countries say well you know what because america you should pay for everything so
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.500]  when we have games you should pay for that too that's right that's right i mean what's the
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:08.380]  stopping from doing it you have men's sports that people willingly play what i consider to be
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:15.020]  exorbitant prices to go watch men play boys sport right i'm not interested in spectator sports that's
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:20.780]  why i'm in politics it's not a spectator sport but people pay big ticket prices to go watch these
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:26.060]  contests they don't do that for women's sports that's true okay why is that maybe they should
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.300]  take a look at that but they're not going to approach this from a market standpoint they're
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.500]  just going to demand that they get equal results they're not going to try to figure out what the
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:40.300]  public wants yeah exactly you know let's talk is this is still related to the soccer but
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.260]  the whole point of them dropping the flag and then you had to have one of them come and
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:49.340]  snatch it up really quick i'm trying to prevent it from being on the ground too long but
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:54.220]  the the point that she absolutely she dropped it in the first place trying to celebrate doing
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:12:01.500]  their little dance whatever it is their celebration dance and they dropped a flag i mean so they
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:08.620]  they're already disrespecting america that's right yeah you know i mean maybe because foosball
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.340]  is not a traditional america sport maybe that's the reason why they felt comfortable doing it i
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.380]  don't know the reason why she would drop it in the first place on the national scene like that
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:24.380]  on the national level well she knows that this is going to give her a nike contract you know if
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.020]  you spit in the face of america disrespect america trump yeah you're going to get a nike contract
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:33.900]  it's that simple oh so that's that's how you do it yeah talk about your signaling talk bad about
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:39.020]  america and we'll give you we'll give you some extra perks that's right but you know this whole
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.540]  again this whole identity politics stuff comes around because they're being criticized for being
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.300]  too white but take a look at what's happening across women's sports and we've talked about this
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:51.260]  over and over again you know whether it's track and field or whether it's this particular team
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:59.660]  playing under 15 year old boys you know that their women are having uh you know problems college
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.060]  age women are very concerned about the fact or people even in high school who want to get a
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.380]  college scholarship said look i've worked very hard at the sport and i can't get any recognition
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:15.580]  because i'm getting uh we've got people coming in here transgender male or females are confused
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.580]  guys who i did it biological guys who say they're females they're coming in and they're winning all
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:25.900]  the sports right and so that's unfair fundamentally unfair to women to girls who are working really
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:31.820]  hard to get a scholarship to go to college or whatever and uh so all of these policies come
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:37.900]  back around to them you know once you go down this path of saying we're going to uh not have
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:42.700]  things based on merit but we're going to base things on demographics then you start to have
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:47.820]  these fights and that's the whole point they want people fighting over demographics because they've
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:54.140]  the whole marxist tactic has been to get people in the past to fight over different classes that
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:58.860]  worked in europe that was very stratified by classes here in america it didn't work so you
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:04.540]  had people like bill ares and others the weather underground saying hey this class warfare is
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.740]  not working let's use race warfare and they were the ones who started promoting this white skin
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.300]  privilege and that's where we are today yeah you know education that's where they're pushing all
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.780]  the you know and that was part of the whole topic when i was talking about earlier how the left
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:23.740]  come up with all these crazy things on how to divide us and they use it when they don't have
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:31.180]  anything concrete to stand on let's just kick up something insane yeah racism something to
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:36.620]  divide us something that is a hot topic button that people will talk about instead of the real
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:42.700]  issues well we got to make sure that divided they fall exactly that's exactly it you know
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:47.500]  now when we come back from the from the break let's talk a little bit about ross perot if we
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:52.220]  can yeah because i know um he was because he had united we stand right yeah he's uniting people he's
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:57.020]  before my time and you're you're just a little bit more mature than i am just a little bit just a
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.020]  little bit so you will talk a little bit more about ross perot but you know i think what's
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:07.980]  happening across the world is becoming the they're trying to make it the norm to talk bad about america
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:13.500]  to talk bad about president trump and to make themselves look good like they're so brave and
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:19.340]  so strong standing up against a neo-nazi white dictator that's sitting in the oval office and
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:24.060]  that's the way they're pushing it which we all know is not true everybody love trump especially
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:29.100]  the hip hop world i want to be like trump i want to be like trump until he became president ran as
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:34.620]  a republican and then of course again president trump being a white man a republican doing stuff
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.660]  for black people not just black people but black people benefiting of course the democrats want to
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.380]  come in and they want to change all of it they want to destroy everything that he is doing because
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:50.220]  he's not only helping white people brown people but he's helping black people into the democrats

[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.580]  promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:17.660]  sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:22.300]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:27.260]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.820]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:36.140]  info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:40.300]  fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.420]  corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:50.060]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.180]  and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:20:04.380]  press and free speech with free markets you're listening to the alex jones show

[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:52.860]  and we sit here with you and we're talking about many different topics um i just uh one of the
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:57.420]  producers just handed me uh an article here i'm not sure how it's controversial but they were
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:06.380]  talking about a sweetest uh here it is a uh a migrant gang uh shoved gun into uh sweetest boy's
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:11.420]  mouth and it stirs controversy i'm not sure how that stirs up controversy it's it's completely
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:17.500]  insane it should it's wrong is wrong no matter what it is and someone's shoving a gun like oh wait
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:24.860]  me but he's a he's a he's a migrant it's okay it's okay migrants are okay no matter how bad they are
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:29.740]  no matter the insane things that they do oh it's just like antifa you look at these little skinny
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:34.300]  kids um dressed in black with black helmets on and they can do whatever they want right then they
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:39.420]  go up and smack uh you know some guy wearing a maga cap in the face and it's the maga cap
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:44.460]  guy that's uh hateful and he deserved it because he's wearing a maga cap yeah you know i mean i
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.980]  wear maga hats you know my hat so actually on my on my personal website united america first
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:55.020]  dot com i sell them on there and and i've had white liberals attack me so i how dare you wear that
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:00.780]  hat or sell that hat and they're like you're just trying to get uh people to buy him you know i mean
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:08.060]  this is look at this this is insane and so what was the controversy in that what what is that
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.620]  because he's a white male i mean it's okay yeah i mean is that what i'm not supposed to point out
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.860]  that they commit crimes because you know you you're not supposed to point out the crimes of certain
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:22.380]  groups right yeah i mean it's just like it's just like the uh the migrant that came across the
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:27.820]  southern board of america had the young girl with him and to my understanding he raped her for
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:32.780]  over four months and then end up killing her and they put her in jail and then you have the left
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:38.700]  that's trying to defend him yeah i mean as you know it just makes me think about all of the insanity
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:44.380]  that is taking place but let's let's talk about ross pearl um i think that's the main thing i want
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:49.580]  to talk about here because um i think you're going to educate me on him well i know i'm just
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:54.780]  trying to refresh my memory it's been a while okay 1992 was really the year that everybody
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:01.020]  remembers ross bro that's when he ran as a third party candidate for presidency and you know a lot
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:06.220]  of things have happened since then a lot of people have forgotten uh what that was about but fundamentally
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:12.620]  as i said this morning you go back and that that quote about the giant sucking sound that he had
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:18.220]  and it was spot on and prophetic he knew what was going to happen and what immediately happened
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:24.060]  as i said this morning uh and the show that precedes this one we had had between the us and
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:30.220]  mexico uh for years before that a rough trade parody some years you know we would be ahead
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:34.700]  some years they would be ahead but the spread was never more than two to five billion dollars as soon
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:41.740]  as nafta was passed the trade deficit shot up to 17 billion dollars in the favor of mexico
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.460]  that stayed there for two or three years it's never gotten less than 17 billion dollars and
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:52.540]  has gotten up to 72 billion dollars it is a giant sucking sound and it's not just mexico but it's also
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:58.780]  the situation with china as well so he was right to identify that of course you had both bush and
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.220]  clinton who wanted that to go through the establishment parties wanted that to go through
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:07.660]  there's a lot of connections between him and between president trump and he was right on
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:12.300]  that issue president trump is right on this issue is why they attack them and it was interesting
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:18.300]  also because you remember well the people who go back and look at this he was ahead in the polls
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.940]  before he dropped out of the race in july he was ahead in the polls he was pulling at 39 percent
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:29.100]  bush and clinton were tied at 24 percent even in the primaries you had people in states like
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:35.340]  organ and washington they're writing in raspiro and the primaries they wrote him at 13 percent of
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:40.700]  the people who were democrats in oregon voted for raspiro as a writing candidate 15 percent on the
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:48.620]  republican side so he had bipartisan support he was murdering both of the establishment candidates
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:53.980]  and so he said he dropped out in july he said i've had threats of violence against my family
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:25:00.700]  and that got a lot of people's attention when he said that and as things went on he was saying
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.900]  yeah i've been threatened by the cia the fbi and all these other people oh he's crazy he's loony
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:11.340]  tune right the fbi and the cia would never try to overthrow an election they would never come
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:16.220]  after somebody who is outside of the political establishment who wanted to shake up things
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.300]  i mean he was talking about he was pulling at 39 percent when he was talking about
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:26.620]  uh raising uh tax uh sorry uh yeah raising taxes and cutting spending because he's gonna
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:33.180]  had a plan to balance the budget in five years and yet uh people saw him as a can-do candidate
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:38.140]  you know we had this debacle with iran which is really where most people's memory of the history
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:44.060]  of iran begins that most people don't remember when the cia overthrew the iranian elections in
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:49.180]  the 1950s and put that despot the shaw of iran in and when the cia trained the secret police the
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:54.460]  savak to torture any of his political opposition they don't remember that that went on for a couple
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.500]  of decades all they remember is the blowback from that with the iranian people that put you know that
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:06.540]  policy went from a hardcore socialist or marxist that gave us the ayatollah that's how our foreign
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:12.540]  policy works but people remember the american embassy being taken over in iran and they remember
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:17.260]  the impotence of jimmy carter and they remember the fact that ross perot and it was memorialized
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:23.500]  in a movie called um uh what was it uh rodent wings of eagles and had richard crena playing
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:31.260]  ross perot ross perot got his people out of ron jimmy carter didn't so he was seen as a can-do
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:37.180]  person a successful businessman that's why he had that kind of broad support then he says well i've
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:41.980]  had death threats against my family everybody says oh he's a crazy conspiracy theorist would
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:49.180]  anybody say that today after what we have seen done to president trump i i believe ross perot i
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:54.620]  believed him then quite frankly i believe that the cia and the fbi was capable of that kind of stuff
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:27:00.140]  back then uh but i think everybody would believe him today if he were to say that i mean i don't
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:05.900]  know i don't know how anyone would not believe him today that's right after what we just saw for
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:11.980]  the last three years oh exactly exactly and so you had dank quail take point on that and called
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:17.100]  him criticized him as a temperamental tycoon he said he's just a folk hero he's got a lot of uh
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:21.580]  you know they they focus on his character flaws uh and his eccentricities and that type of thing
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:26.620]  just like the same game plan that we see with president trump threaten him talk about killing
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:33.180]  him come after his temperamental qualities and so forth uh look nobody's perfect uh but he was a lot
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:40.540]  better than uh george hw bush or uh or uh bill clinton and so they talked about him played
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:45.420]  that aspect up he got back into the race uh in october but he never recovered in the polls when
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:51.340]  he came back in he was in a distant third place uh he didn't win a single state uh the republicans
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:56.060]  believe that he cost them the election no that didn't cost them the election what cost them the
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:02.780]  election was the read my lips promise from george hw bush that was what he focused his whole campaign
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:08.380]  on just like president trump said i'm gonna build a wall uh george hw bush said read my lips no new
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:14.060]  taxes nobody believed him really we were hoping that it was gonna be true because he had called
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:19.100]  reagan's tax cut programs voodoo economics and then as soon as he became president he gave us
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:25.020]  what was then the biggest tax increase the united states had ever seen and that was essentially
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:30.140]  what cost him the election uh people looked at it and said well you know some people say cost the
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:34.540]  democrat democrats more than did republicans some people say it cut the other way uh but that's the
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:41.020]  story of ross perot well thank you for that sure like i said ross perot was before my time and you're
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:44.620]  just a little bit more mature than i am you have all the information on that hey i want to thank

[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:57.180]  means uh the the the message that he puts across uh has absolutely ticked off the left so i already
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:02.220]  automatically love his man i mean he does everything he's fighting against the left i mean he
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.820]  everything he's putting out from what i've been seeing has been completely accurate nothing has
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:13.020]  been a lie um he's just putting out his story his message and i wish i could draw half as well as he
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.940]  does so without further ado mr garrison thank you for joining me well thanks for having me it's an
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:24.060]  honor it's an honor so let me ask you this what so a lot of people already know who you are
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:31.580]  are how did you get started in doing the uh the memes and the the graphics like this and why did you
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:40.620]  do it well i got started 10 years ago that's why we just uh i put out a uh a big coffee table book
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:45.500]  to celebrate our 10-year anniversary of drawing cartoons i say our because my wife tina also
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:52.940]  occasionally draws cartoons but i started drawing them in 2009 as a way to protest the the uh
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:58.620]  of the banker bailout the great banker bailout where everybody got bonuses taxpayer bonuses to
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:03.260]  uh we get and the bankers got rewarded for the criminal acts that's what it boiled down to and
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:09.020]  i got very angry that's when i started listening to alex jones about that time too and i would
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:15.420]  listen to him and he was just a fountain head of great metaphors and very um visually oriented
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.900]  language and i's i would hear him say something and i would think to myself well that's a cartoon
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:26.220]  i gotta draw it and the first one i did that he said was um was the uh march of tyranny where i
[01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:32.460]  showed two legs marching along connected by the federal reserve at the top pyramid that's one
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:37.580]  of my more most famous cartoons well that was something based on something alex said but that
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:45.340]  was my first bio cartoon and that came about in 2010 and um i've been drawing him ever since but
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:50.460]  you know i've had a quite a rocky road to start out with because i got attacked by trolls and
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:56.940]  got my reputation ruined and i i went through a lot of a lot of pain and suffering until we
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:03.820]  finally turned it around when trump was elected in 2016 that's when my wife Tina and i we decided
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.420]  we're just gonna draw more cartoons instead of giving up we'll just draw more and more of them
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:13.260]  and see what happens and what happens what happened was became a big success and i'm really
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:19.580]  shocked because it's very difficult to be um be able to draw cartoons for a living so i'm able to
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.380]  do that now which is very gratifying especially after all the money they cost me for many years
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:30.060]  yeah you know what it's beautiful artwork i wish i could just like i said i wish i could do just a
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:35.900]  quarter uh you know i can't even draw a straight line i'll just take practice you know i draw all
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:41.180]  the time and so if you want to be an artist if anybody out there wants to be an artist you could
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:45.580]  do it i just you gotta draw every day it's just like a musician you have to practice every day
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:50.700]  so you know i've been drawing pretty much all my life and uh when i first started out i was lousy
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.580]  and i knew a lot of people still think i am but i you know i had to draw a lot of criticism a lot
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:37:01.340]  of what i call inertia there's a the voice of inertia always tells you negative things to keep
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:08.140]  you from doing what you want to do and you have to overcome this voice of inertia the inertia tells
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:14.700]  you we'll do it later procrastinate don't do it now no when i hear feel that inertia i tell myself
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:19.180]  no we're going to do it now you know like Arnold Schwarzenegger do it do it now
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:26.140]  now yeah so let me ask you have you ever drawn one where it was you know could be
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:34.940]  perceived as being anti-american no no so the only reason why i ask because you know if you if
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:39.900]  you draw everything that is pro-american they're not going to be happy with you obviously they're
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:45.020]  not happy with you now because you're drawing stuff that's pro-american it's pro-trump um you
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:49.180]  show your love for the country through these cartoons that you're drawing which are just
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.060]  absolutely beautiful and you're getting the left to attack you so it only means that you're doing
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:58.620]  the right thing my opinion because just like me speaking out being a black male and i speak out
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.740]  against what the left is doing they attack me i've i've had the death threats um it's almost to the
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:08.460]  point to where it's just a normal thing and if i'm not getting the death threats i'm not doing my job
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:14.060]  so you're doing the cartoons i'm pretty sure that with all the attacks that you receive have they
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:19.820]  have what what it has been the most uh i guess the most attacks that you have received just because
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:27.180]  you simply draw a cartoon well yeah i mean and in the early days that really bothered me i hated
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:32.860]  being called a nazi i hated being called a racist and i would do i would i kind of actually i went
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:38.140]  into like a virtue signaling mode to prove to the world that i wasn't a racist that i not see it i
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.420]  wrote a book that was a flop because the book was predicated on me being a virtue signaler
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:48.700]  trying to defend myself and then after that flop i said to heck with it i don't care anymore and i
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.500]  sort of got to this point where people can say whatever they like and it doesn't bother me at
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:58.700]  all i've kind of grown a thick hide that i didn't have before and i sort of developed a little grace
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:04.380]  after all the all the insults that i feel that on it and like you i got you know a lot of you get a
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:08.380]  lot of flak when you're over the target and you get insulted and you get death threats i've got all
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:16.780]  that as a matter of fact here's the the socialist democratic the democratic socialist left their
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:22.780]  arguments really boil down to insults and i have a little list here i typed up a little list of all
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:27.820]  the insults i've been called and i'll just go down the line okay so when i first started drawing
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:33.820]  anti obama cartoons my course was called a racist when i questioned his birth certificate i was called
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:39.580]  a birther when i drew anti hillary cartoons i was called a sexist when i criticized this
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.780]  criticized taxpayer funded abortion i was called anti feminist and misogynist when i criticized
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:50.140]  the idea of america giving out free stuff to everyone on earth i was called a hater when i drew
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:56.540]  anti open border cartoons i was called a xenophobe when i drew anti sharia law in america cartoons
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:01.260]  that's called a Islamophobe when i criticized the trans craze that's called a bigot when i
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:07.020]  criticized vaccine abuse that's called anti science when i criticize al al gore and his global warming
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.700]  i was called a climate denier and when i praised trump for his america first nationalism i was
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:19.420]  called a nazi but especially when i drew when i this has been ongoing when i draw anti federal
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:26.460]  reserve cartoons i'm always constantly smeared as an ant as antisemitic and i'm not antisemitic
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:32.700]  but the fact that soros is out there you know pulling the strings and the ross childs are
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.540]  pulling his strings these people exist and they're not they're not doing good things for humanity
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:45.420]  when when you criticize them it's almost like a knee jerk reaction you're you're supposedly to be
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.620]  this raging antisemitic well i'm not antisemitic and i'm not going to let any of these names that
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:57.100]  they call me stop me from drawing more cartoons and you know that's just the way it is i this this
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:02.940]  is what happens when you when you uh are effective like you said you're getting you get a little bit
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:07.180]  effective you get a little notoriety and boy they come out of the woodwork to attack you but this
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:14.700]  cartoon is not this is not a conspiracy theory this is fact i mean the ross childs were they've
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:21.900]  been for centuries um on both sides of wars profiting they control the purse strings of the
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:26.940]  the royalty and the governments they're always behind the scenes they're not some they want to
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:32.140]  make it so that there's some kind of a it's some sort of a conspiracy theory that they even exist
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.620]  well they do exist if they're they were instrumental in helping uh start the federal reserve which uh
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:44.380]  you know started a vile system of debt money in this country that's been stripping away money from
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:50.540]  america hardworking americans for over a decade or over a century so i'm going to continue to speak
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:55.020]  out the federal reserve they can call me all the names in the world they want it's not going to stop
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:42:01.980]  me you know so instead of them taking the message that you're putting into the cartoons they want
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.100]  to take it and twist it to try to say something completely different what it's not and that's
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:13.100]  it's like the normal tactic of the left you know they take everything and twist it instead of just
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:19.820]  looking at what it is the message that you have in the cartoon which is completely accurate
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:24.460]  i've all the cartoons that i've looked at that i've seen i'm not even realized they were yours
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:30.380]  until today which is and i've seen so many of them and see many of them go viral they're not
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:35.660]  looking at the message i think maybe it is that they are looking at the message they just don't
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:40.540]  want people to recognize what the message is so they deflect and try to get everyone to look at
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:44.700]  something else than what the truth is so right after this break we're going to come back and we're
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:51.980]  going to talk more with ben garrison about the cartoons and how he is doing today in this fight
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:43:00.460]  against the tyrannical left so a legion i just want listeners to understand money is what allows
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:04.780]  us to beat this and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:09.980]  info wars 50 percent off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up and stuff we're
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:14.460]  making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:18.380]  move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.060]  pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:26.940]  millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.340]  not just made a stance till the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.340]  and labored on this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:39.900]  winning the infill war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:44.060]  we need to be fixed up we never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:49.100]  the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going to plant child porn on us then they're going
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:53.100]  to kill me or you or anybody else i mean the democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary

[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.780]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:11.100]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:15.100]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.940]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.020]  become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.940]  american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to

[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:35.420]  welcome back my name is will johnson i am sitting in for alex jones on the info wars show
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:42.940]  today we have ben garrison with us where we're talking about the cartoons that he's created i
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:48.300]  can't even i have a marker and i'm like how can i do this i can't do it i can't do it and
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:55.020]  just the different shades i like you know i do some graphics but not nearly anything as good as
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:48:02.780]  ben garrison um ben so you've been doing this for about 10 years and you started off and you've
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:08.380]  done everything that's been pro-american and now you're doing stuff that's pro-trump and you've
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:15.180]  been attacked i've been attacked and because we've both you know we've both been attacked because
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:21.500]  we we show our support for america we show our support for president trump and you know with
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:26.540]  all the attacks coming and then they were like i was talking about in the last segment how they
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:33.020]  take everything instead of just looking at the message when in your cartoons your message
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:39.100]  the message is so accurate and i think that's the problem that they have with it because
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:47.020]  it it attracts children to look at the cartoon for one and children are not dumb they will
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:53.020]  grab onto what you're saying in these messages so what is what is the i guess what's the ratio
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:57.660]  between adults and children that look at your graphics or do you even know the statistics on that
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:06.940]  well i don't know uh i don't know what our demographics really are um we've got you know
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:11.580]  i think we've got close to 180 000 twitter followers now which is pretty incredible
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:18.300]  across you know i think right shadow band half the time but you know you you use the word uh how
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:25.580]  the how the the left likes to deflect things that's exactly what they do but they use a word for it
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:30.700]  they always say i i notice this common trend because i got somebody write me the other day and use
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:36.620]  the same word and the word is dog whistle well this cartoon is a dog whistle for this it's a
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.740]  dog whistle for anti-semitism or it's a dog whistle for racism or it's a dog whistle for
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:48.380]  whatever insult they attach to it so in other words they want to hijack the cartoon and say
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:54.140]  well this is what it really means and what it really means is what they use whatever insult
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:59.660]  they use to attack you to get you kicked off the social media to get your employers to fire you to
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:07.020]  get you know basically to uh deplatform you and uh and make you broke and that's that's something that
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:14.060]  um a lot of people are afraid of now because they're afraid if they get and and and and use their
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:20.540]  free speech they might say something offensive and you know it's it's a way they they do this
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:26.300]  to limit our free speech and and they keep it keeps getting pared down where you can only say
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:31.500]  you know for once i you know i got banned from facebook once for saying tranny instead of trans
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:35.740]  you can't say tranny you have to say trans this is ridiculous there's no such thing as a trans
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:40.700]  anyway i mean a man cannot be a woman i mean that's just impossible scientifically impossible but
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:46.140]  you're supposed to pretend and go along with this delusion but that's just that that's just a um
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.060]  something that i always go through but it's funny how this word dog whistle always comes up because
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.820]  they want to hijack what i'm drawing instead of saying this is what it means it's right in front
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:51:00.780]  of you know it really means that's it's funny how they operate it is i was talking with david night
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:05.900]  how you know every time something comes out they like for example fourth of july they're trying to
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:11.580]  say that it was racist it's all about president trump instead of it being about america they
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:17.420]  tried to make everything out to be racist same thing with nike um you know what actually the
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:26.780]  producers here uh so i have some shades or not shades these are my glasses and these are i purchased
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:32.700]  these before um the whole nike thing came out and i'm gonna do this on camera maybe we can get a
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:39.420]  docu cam shot here of me doing this so this is these are nike glasses i had no idea that nike
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:45.660]  would be doing this so i'm going to mark it out because i can't support uh an organization
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:51.100]  that is so anti-american and i'm going to mark these out until i can't afford to buy some new
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:57.820]  glasses i mean you make glasses you know i mean was was really sad because they're they're pretty
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:06.460]  decent glasses i guess it's the lens that really count not the not the frame so but anyways
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:14.300]  what what it was so how do you how do you get inspired to to draw the cartoons that you do
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:19.900]  i mean what what you know like oh this happens and then what's the process like oh that's good
[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:26.060]  and then you go with it well the process and this is the difficult thing is trying to come up
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:32.780]  with the idea but as a commercial artist i was you know i had my own commercial art business for
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:39.500]  about 20 years and i was trained to think in um visual metaphors so i think in terms of cliches
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:45.900]  and metaphors that can be made new again so that's kind of a foundation but a lot of people think i'm
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:51.420]  i'm funny and i'm really not funny i'm a real serious you know i'm kind of an angry guy more
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:56.620]  than funny i can't think of anything more difficult to get on this stage and try to entertain people
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:03.500]  as a comedian that's got to be tremendous pressure so i never i never consider anything any subject
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:08.140]  or topic that i'm going to make a cartoon about my first thought is never well how can i make this
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:13.740]  funny too many cartoonists do that they want to just they just want to boil it down to some funny
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:21.580]  gag or as i try i want to go toward more toward satire and if there's any humor in the cartoon
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:27.500]  it's it's kind of derived from the satire by satire i mean satire is more of a complex thing
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:34.700]  so i what i want to do is uh is go after them by means of caricature i want to mock their
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:42.540]  sanctimony i want to to show you know hey this i wanted in a visual form show the corrupt things
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:49.900]  that they're doing and expose them much like thomas nas exposed um boss tweet at timony hall
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:55.740]  i mean that guy's it was a hero because he almost single-handedly took down the the corruption of
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:01.260]  that was timony hall in new york city way back in the 1800s so that's sort of what i want to do
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:07.180]  today plus my drawing style harkens back to the old style 100 years ago of editorial cartoons
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:14.140]  that's why i draw it by hand i want to kind of evoke this old-time american cartoon yeah i
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:18.860]  would plenty of labels on it i know the labels bother everybody but that's an american tradition
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:24.700]  and so i'm kind of a real traditional conservative cartoonist yeah not only that you're invoking
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:30.460]  people to think you're invoking people to like look at something that they're not being presented
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:35.980]  you know with by the mainstream media let's talk about you being uh invited to the summit
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:43.740]  with president trump yeah i mean i was pretty surprised uh you know i but when you get invited
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:48.940]  by the president you've got to go right so i okay if i'm going to go to washington dc you know i don't
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:53.580]  i don't have a i don't have a big wallet but if you're going to go to washington c you've got
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:57.740]  to stay at the trump international hotel right so that's what i i booked a couple nights there
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:02.860]  and i'm going to fly out tomorrow and it's kind of it's really exciting and surreal at the same
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:08.700]  time i mean i i sure don't know how to solve the problem of uh you know the social media censorship
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:16.140]  but i will sure keep my eyes my eyes open and my ears open to any kind of cartoon fodder that can
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:22.620]  come from anybody's suggestion i'll draw it yeah i would if i you know i've been to the white house
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:30.220]  twice and i would love to you know talk directly to president trump like one on one and tell him
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:36.300]  that you know the censorship because it's taking place that many people that are sharing his his
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:41.420]  posts his tweets they're being shadow banned to where a lot of people can't see it and the main
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:46.300]  reason why they're doing that is because they want the american people to believe that president
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:52.380]  trump does not have the support from the american people or the american people are not supporting
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.100]  president trump so and i'm pretty sure when you go there that you're going to get a whole bunch of
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:03.100]  ideas on different cartoons to draw after this i can just see that coming and i would love to be
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:09.580]  to love to see some of these that you're going to produce so they have to have you thought about
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:14.380]  any before you're going or have you started on any for the summit about the censorship because i
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:21.180]  would love to see that no i haven't i haven't yet but i i definitely will i mean i'm just i'm still
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:26.860]  it's all kind of surreal to me i just am i really going to go to the white house yeah i'm kind of
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:31.260]  worried yesterday well maybe trump's going to resend his invitation because everybody's
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:38.460]  trying so hard to you know i am i'm a libertarian i'm i'm why would like the constitution um
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:46.140]  you know i support a wall on our southern border but mostly i think trump's biggest accomplishment
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:51.980]  thus far is keeping us out of war i mean the the way he handled the aran situation was brilliant
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:58.540]  and if he could keep doing that i mean uh he'll have my my lasting devotion because that's the
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:03.500]  most important thing is to keep us out of another war especially a world war which a lot of these uh
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:09.180]  you know neocons and central banker types that's what they want that's what the that's what hillary
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:13.820]  would have had us in a war by now and if you think it was elected you think jeffrey upstream would be
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:18.060]  going down no way yeah absolutely maybe that might be a good cartoon saying that you know
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:22.540]  showing that trump is pulling away the suitcase and and the left was probably trying to take the
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:27.740]  suitcase from him so they can start a war something i don't know that was just an idea
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:31.180]  i would love to see something i'm pretty sure you can think of something the wheels attorney
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:36.060]  so this is the alex jones show my name is will johnson we have ben garrison with us um i don't
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:41.020]  know if you can stay with us ben we'll see um we'll talk more after the break all right see you in a
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:47.020]  minute

[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:59.580]  system versus the anti-human anti god world government ladies and gentlemen any war to

[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:43.660]  you do choose what side you're on and take action
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:51.900]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey alex yeah i just
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:56.220]  want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:59:00.940]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:05.980]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:10.700]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:14.140]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:18.220]  be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:21.820]  the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:26.700]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:31.100]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:36.620]  this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:40.940]  are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:46.140]  to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank
[01:59:46.140 --> 02:00:02.060]  you sir for calling you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:21.900]  all right we are back at the alex jones show my name is will johnson we have a our guest with us
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:29.660]  ben garrison cartoonist beautiful artwork beautiful beautiful artwork stirring up the the pot
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:35.900]  making the left upset which is a good thing because the left they do not like reality
[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:43.740]  so big ben garrison through his cartoons he will tell the truth and the left doesn't like it and
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:49.660]  ben thank you for staying with me it's an honor so you know i've been to the white house twice
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:57.980]  and both times is just absolutely wonderful i went in and they had live music he had food for us
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:03.420]  i went with the uh the black summit meeting uh through third through turning point usa
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:08.860]  and it was just an awesome time and you know they always try to depict president trump
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:14.220]  being racist when he's not racist you know we're sitting in the white house many black people
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:19.740]  but the thing i like about president trump is that he doesn't go out and try to make it look like
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:25.260]  that i'm doing this try to get black people he didn't even come out and say look everybody
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:30.540]  i did this with black people look look look he'll just do it and then the mainstream media
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:34.300]  they don't want to promote it because they don't want people to believe that he's doing things for
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:39.980]  black people and that's another way that they go to try to make it look like president trump
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.140]  doesn't support black people or they want to make it they want to try to fight everything
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:50.620]  that he does when it's helping black people so you have some i the producer told me that you have
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:56.540]  some cartoons where they try to say that you're anti-semitic and then they're never ending it's
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:02:02.380]  never ending so what what has been i guess the most viral cartoon that you have created the one
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:10.060]  that created the most um i guess chaos and is that the same cartoon that uh got you recognized by
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:17.100]  president trump well i've had a lot of cartoons that i i guess if you if you want to talk about
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:24.700]  this one single cartoon that i drew that upset the most people it was the michelle obama one
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:31.180]  where i made her look sort of like masculine and compared her to you and i kind of did this
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:36.140]  you know i i did this cartoon for our patreon supporters you know because they get to see
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:43.100]  stuff for contributing and the but my wife liked it so much she she released it and and i oh boy
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:51.020]  i i got you know i admit this is a really a bad taste i kind of quasi regretted it but
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:59.260]  michelle uh being a man is an internet meme and now the fact that the first lady is also uh a
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:05.660]  political activist and she and she's trying to push these uh school lunches like some sort of
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:10.700]  some sort of lunch czar and i said well wait a minute nobody elected michelle to get in there
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:16.300]  and tell us what we can and cannot eat and she's kind of an us that's authoritarian and i i said
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:21.020]  well i'm gonna i'm just gonna go ahead and go with this meme and i you know what i don't know if
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:25.820]  she's a man i have no idea but there's a lot of suspicious stuff when when brock obama starts
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:31.260]  calling her michael yes i saw that it's like this is this is kind of this is a little weird
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:39.820]  you know but i never i still i still get flack for this cartoon but you know i think it was um
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.860]  um i forgot who said there's no such thing as bad publicity this really put me on the map because
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:52.300]  the daily mail ran a story condemning me and all the the left media was condemning me really
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:58.220]  that cartoon cost me a long time friendship somebody i knew for like almost 30 years
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:04.940]  and i got you know unfriended so i you know i've lost a lot of my old friends from my newspaper
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:10.540]  days who are most liberal you know so they don't yeah they it's it's it's when you do something
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:16.300]  like this i mean you're gonna you're gonna ruffle a lot of feathers you know so what what why so
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:21.180]  why do these people think that they're off limits you know it's crazy they believe that they're off
[02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:25.340]  limits they're not off limits they're public figures they can talk about meaning and talk
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:30.620]  about you they can be as nasty as they want and that's okay but if you don't you can't talk about
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:36.300]  Michelle Obama you can't talk about the left you can't talk about AOC then then you're then they
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.620]  want to demonize you we're gonna let's talk let's talk more about it after this break because i think
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:46.060]  this is a good topic a hot topic and the left probably don't want us to talk about this at all
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:52.460]  we'll be right back after this short break my name is Will Johnson sitting in for the great Alex Jones
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:05:01.260]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:05.020]  kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:09.260]  censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:13.020]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:17.180]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:20.220]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:24.380]  are and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere Jones sells
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:30.060]  unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:34.700]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:39.180]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:43.020]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:46.940]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:52.540]  doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:06:04.300]  two five three three one three nine 1776 that's a term i coined 15 years ago what does it really
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:10.300]  mean it means the idea of american freedom renaissance worldwide doesn't mean we go conquer
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:16.780]  countries it means our superior western values of true freedom get adopted because
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:23.100]  compared to globalism it's night and day we're going to do a 34 hour special broadcast

[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:16.940]  and now your host will johnson all right welcome back welcome back so we're talking to ben garrison
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:23.900]  about his cartoons and one of the hot topics is uh he drew one about michelle obama kind of getting
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:30.300]  muscles and you know the whole thing and buzz on the internet because could it possibly be
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:36.940]  that she's a man i don't know you know i don't know i mean i would like to believe that she's a woman
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:41.980]  you know but you never know in this day and age and the way they're pushing the whole trans thing
[02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:47.180]  and you never know and like ben even mentioned that you there's no such thing as a trans you know
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:54.460]  maybe you have a transformer you know or a you know i mean what else a transformer sitting outside
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:00.460]  you know providing energy that's the only trans that you know really exists in this world but they
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:07.260]  don't like it when you don't say or agree with it so so ben um we were talking about how they were
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:13.100]  attacking you because you're you know you create this cartoon with michelle obama with muscles and
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:18.620]  then you one with uh trump's wife and just you know looking really ladylike and immaculate and
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:24.700]  they don't like the fact that you drew something like that and i think it's pretty awesome i think
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:29.820]  it's pretty awesome well this is the kind of stuff you're not allowed to do but then that's
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:36.140]  that's the that's the mindset of a lot of the socialists left they want to control what you think
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:41.260]  and what you can say they want to channel things and if you break out of that channel then you're
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:46.860]  going to get you're going to get whacked i mean they want you to you know basically the the
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:51.740]  authoritarian structure they want you to drink your fluoride they want you to take your vaccinations
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:56.380]  they want you to breathe the chemtrails or your conspiracy nut you don't want you questioning
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:09:03.180]  anything and and so they're under their attack anybody who anybody who starts telling the truth
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:09.020]  they kind of want the uh it's it's a weird thing because if you notice that the uh
[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:15.020]  democratic socialists i mean they didn't even have an american flag at their last debate what they
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:20.700]  drew and most of them don't really believe in god either they may not tell you that directly but it's
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:27.420]  like it's like president z in china i mean he came out i remember on tv him talking about he
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:33.740]  was an atheist he didn't believe in god okay well now he's the dictator and he's this he's gonna be
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:39.420]  another mal but he's not happy with that just controlling and forcing everybody to do his
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:45.180]  bend to his will he also wants to be loved he wants to be worshipped so that's the same thing with
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:53.020]  the with the left it's not it's not that you know it's it's not that they um want to control they
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:58.860]  also they also want to replace a vacuum in their lives i think when they don't believe in god they
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:03.980]  become god and they want to tell you how things are going to be and that's the attitude that they have
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:11.580]  and a boy if you don't go along with their program then you are um they say you're singled out for a
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:16.540]  lot of nature calling it ridiculous yeah absolutely you know your cartoons are to me they would be
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:21.420]  considered free speech and you should be able to create these and talk about any public figure you
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:27.340]  want to i mean i would imagine none of your cartoons have called for violence against these
[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:32.620]  people you've just created uh stuff that they've been doing and you know i mean probably tying
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:37.100]  like ebbs seen in a rope you know they say oh this is so violent you're doing something here crazy
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:42.540]  you know but nothing is telling people to go out and be violent now you have like maxine waters
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:47.420]  and even now joe biden talking about you have to go out and be violent to people here it is you're
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:54.620]  doing cartoons that's telling the truth and they they don't like the fact because they're the ones
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:11:01.580]  that's being violent and you're just showing it and to me it's free game when you're a public figure
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:07.180]  you're completely free game have you seen some of the crazy memes that they've done on alex jones
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:13.740]  and there's some of them just really absolutely disgusting but see that's okay that's it's okay
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:18.380]  as long as you're doing it to someone that they consider on the right but if you do it to someone
[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:23.420]  is on the left in there it's like oh it's a problem go ahead well the tactic that they're using is
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:30.620]  what i what i call is dehumanization so somebody a nazi or a racist well those kind of people are
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:35.740]  lacking in some sort of basic humanity it's like what the catholic church used to do in the days
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:40.220]  of the inquisition you got called a heretic then it's okay to torture you while you're heretic
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:46.860]  you know why not torture you well now the antifa in the left if they decide that you're a fascist
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:52.700]  or a nazi and and based on no evidence whatsoever other than their their feelings then all of a
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:58.380]  sudden you're not a person anymore you're this uh this kind of like this subhuman entity that
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:03.580]  why not hit them yeah we need to hit them and it becomes then then it to them violence becomes
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:08.300]  acceptable you know well punching somebody or throwing a milkshake or somebody or spitting
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:13.260]  at somebody is never acceptable and this is where i disagree with i forgot who got spit on it was
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:19.900]  don jr or eric trump but he dropped the charges at that i think of some waitress spit at him at a
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:24.460]  rest spin on him at a restaurant he should have pressed the charges i mean you know what that
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:28.700]  you absolutely right that that that is like the major problem what i've seen in the past
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:33.740]  because you have a lot of people on the right the conservatives republicans when they when they're
[02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:37.740]  attacked by some of these on the left they said you know what let's just let it go let's just move
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:43.900]  on because they want to have this perception that they are forgiving which we are as christians but
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:49.180]  you know what at some point you have to send an example i mean we can't just allow these people
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:53.740]  to continue to be violent towards uh conservatives simply because they're supporting president
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.980]  trump they're i'm i'm guaranteed that they're violent towards you because you support president
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.620]  trump you love this country your cartoons show that and they're violent they want to be violent to
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:07.020]  you and i'm pretty sure that they're even going to the extent of wanting to shut you down so that
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:14.300]  you can't draw a cartoon which is exercising your freedom of speech it is a hundred percent right well
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:19.820]  you know conservatives tend to be more forgiving and we you know we're the left never forgives or
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:24.700]  forget no they don't got like a roll of decks in their brain okay this person there's been
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:29.660]  cares that yeah anti-semite anti-semite nazi you know they got all these little cards that they
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:34.780]  they have ready to smear people but you know it's just like the republicans are you know the
[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:41.020]  democrats are shown as donkeys donkey and then you have uh republicans represent like their elephant
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:45.180]  elephants don't forget anything right but in this case when it comes to something that the left
[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:49.180]  doesn't like when it's to the right they remember all of it it's like you just said it's like a
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:54.220]  roll of decks okay let's go through this oh yep i remember this i remember that they let nothing
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:14:00.060]  go and then they attack people on the same thing that they do and keep it going they don't let it
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:06.540]  go especially hillary's always attacking others on stuff that she did i mean she's the she's was
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:13.900]  the one that was colluding with russia yes you know what what are you gonna do about this but
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:19.020]  if we don't do something if we don't push back i mean if we accept getting milkshakes thrown at
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:23.660]  us then they're going to start throwing acid they're talking about throwing acid uh i forgot
[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:29.420]  what kind of acid it was it wasn't the kind that the you know that the um those the muslims
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:33.980]  were throwing at women or whatever but it was it's still bad it's still blind you yeah it's
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:38.460]  acid and they're talking about doing a concrete in the milkshake as well and trying to get into
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:44.860]  people's hair quit drying concrete i mean this is antifa this is them i saw the one you had
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:49.420]  you had the drawing where antifa looked like the swastika and and you know i think um and they're

[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:39.420]  it's alex jones by the way i was just notified that ross perot has died at the age of 89
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:46.540]  of course remember him for his runs of the presidency and but especially for his opposition
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:53.740]  to nafta to nafta he accurately predicted exactly what was going to happen with nafta and of course
[02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:59.500]  George h.w. bush and bill clinton they were both on board with it so there wasn't any discussion
[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:07.260]  between the two of them ross perot had this to say about it run the clip we have got to stop
[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:13.740]  sending jobs overseas to those of you in the audience who are business people pretty simple
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:18.700]  if you're paying 12 13 dollars 14 dollars an hour for factory workers and you can move your
[02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:22.780]  factory south to the border pay a dollar an hour for labor hire a young 24 that's the
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:26.940]  same you've been in business for a long time you've got a mature workforce pay a dollar an hour for
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:32.940]  your labor have no health care that's the most expensive single element making a car have no
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:39.660]  environmental controls no pollution controls and no retirement and you don't care about anything
[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:44.860]  that making money there will be a job sucking sound going south i'm the only guy that talks
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:49.660]  numbers i love this nobody else will even talk about it it's like i've said it's like a crazy
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:54.860]  aunt in the basement everybody knows she's there but nobody talks about her i'm talking about it
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:59.260]  then i can talk you know with endless numbers about it and then when i finished typically
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:04.780]  the establishment press said he didn't tell us enough now just for the record uh i don't have
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:11.340]  any spin doctors i don't have any speech writers probably shows you guys never do anything but
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:15.900]  propaganda isn't it your business would you even know the truth if you saw it oh oh yes i don't
[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:20.060]  believe you would now when you've got a seven to one right wage differential between the united
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:26.380]  states and mexico you will hear the giant sucking sound that's right look at wage costs look at the
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:32.220]  lack of regulation lack of health care costs that's basically what's happened with china as well the
[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:39.260]  giant sucking sound of money going south and of course he was absolutely right we'd had a rough
[02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:46.780]  parity of trade deficits between the us and mexico for example uh it fluctuated from between
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:52.780]  two and five billion dollars each year some years the us would be ahead some years mexico would be
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:58.140]  ahead but it never fluctuated by more than two to five billion dollars with one country some years
[02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:04.140]  ahead and the other one another year the other country would have a surplus of trade but after
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:10.060]  nafta was passed the trade deficit with mexico immediately jumped remember it was trading in
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:16.140]  the two to five plus or minus two to five billion dollars it jumped to seventeen billion dollars
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:23.340]  and it stayed there for the next two or three years and it never got any lower than a seventeen
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:27.660]  billion dollar deficit so you had a situation where you know some years we had a two to five
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:33.100]  billion dollar trade surplus with mexico some years they had the surplus with us but it always
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:37.820]  was two to five billion dollars jumps to seventeen billion dollars it got as high as seventy two billion
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:43.500]  dollars but it's now typically about you know fifty sixty billion dollars a year that is what is
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:50.060]  called a giant sucking sound and of course the establishment both democrat and republican was
[02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:55.340]  full on to go with that and that's why these people hate president trump so much because he
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:24:01.500]  said we're not going to let that sucking continue it's gotten much bigger the problem has gotten
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:07.740]  much bigger with china they all come after president trump say look at this he invented
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:13.820]  tariffs no he didn't tariffs invented the united states quite frankly
[02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:28.860]  so that's exactly what we're seeing today the democrats is trying to suck the life
[02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:37.020]  out of america my name is will johnson this is the alex jones show it was a great report by david
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:45.260]  night they the democrats are now trying to suck the life out of america we're all seeing it we're
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:51.500]  all experiencing it together i mean you know look at the fbi look at the the way that they
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  attacked president trump you had people within side of the fbi you have the democrats the the
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:03.740]  mainstream media day in day out they have nothing else to talk about other than trying to take out
[02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:10.220]  the president united states anything related to president trump they'll talk about it and every
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:14.540]  now and then they'll bring up something to talk about you know just try to make it look like
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:20.140]  they're reporting on the news but it's like a two-minute segment and then they'll go on to talk
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:27.100]  more and more about what president trump is doing or what he's not doing that's make that won't make
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:32.380]  them happy you know they want they want everything to be done their way so they're going to suck the
[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:41.580]  life out it was just like vampires the left reminds me of vampires the walking dead and they want to
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:48.780]  suck the life out of america out of americans they don't care about americans the democrats the left
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:57.580]  they put illegals before the american people i confronted camilla harris about that i confronted
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:04.620]  kevin dahleon in california about that he's he was the author of the sanctuary city bill in california
[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:09.900]  and i confronted him asking why are you putting illegals before the american people same thing
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:15.660]  with camilla harris and they were dumbfounded they didn't even know how to answer that because america
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:23.100]  to them to the left does not matter it does not exist they want to change america they want to
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:31.900]  destroy america they hate president trump more than they love the country think about that they're
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:37.180]  willing to destroy this nation just to get what they want and if they are not able to get what
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:47.260]  they want destroy it suck the life out of the country everything that they do is about destruction
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:55.660]  against the american people you know give an example there's maxine waters she you know there's no
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:01.820]  news no surprise how she hates president trump she's been talking about impeachment from day one
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:07.740]  simply because she doesn't like him simply because hillary clinton laws we actually have a video clip
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:11.900]  i don't know if we have time to play that video clip um we'll play it when we come back in the
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:17.900]  next segment but she wants to just do everything she can to take our president trump and it's the
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:24.780]  you know it's the whole model of the left aoc is the same way roshita tali ilhan omar
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:31.820]  they put all these crazy people in position to try to do everything they can to take out america
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:36.940]  and it just so happened to be that president trump is the president of these united states
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:42.700]  and because he is the president of these united states he is number one on their target the next
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:48.060]  on their target are the american people and once the american people keep supporting a president
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:55.100]  that's doing positive things for this country they are going to continue to attack mad maxine
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:02.140]  why is she still in office aoc why is she still in office same thing with her going down to the
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:06.460]  border trying to make it look like ice members are making people drink toilet water i mean seriously
[02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:12.780]  come on they say we they knew we were coming and they were still making people do this complete
[02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:21.340]  in total lies i have a colleague friend wingman ben burqa him out of california he went to the same
[02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:27.260]  facility that aoc went to and he said there's nothing what she was saying i completely trust
[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:32.700]  him over her she's a total liar and that is the model of the left if you can't give what you want
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:38.700]  and lie about it lie about it it is okay completely lie about it and once we lie about it then the
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:42.460]  american people will believe it because we're going to continue to tell the lie over and over
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:47.980]  and over and over because american people to the left they believe that we're dumb they don't believe

[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:37.420]  one dream and one magnificent destiny we all share the same heroes the same home the same heart
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:46.860]  and we are all made by the same almighty god info wars.com tomorrow's news today full power of
[02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:54.620]  the republic in the name of jesus christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him
[02:32:54.620 --> 02:33:02.220]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:16.860]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:28.300]  here is a classic example of info wars being tomorrow's news today stories up on news wars.com
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:35.420]  and info wars.com now remember years ago i broke down that jeffrey epskeen was videotaping people
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:40.620]  inside of his house inside his mansions inside his private island inside his lolita express
[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:46.220]  pedophile plane as the children were way younger than the media was saying now they're admitting
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:53.100]  down to age 10 it goes below that and he came out in court documents that robert moeller back during
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:34:00.380]  the clinton and then obama days working with comey and others was using epskeen as a confidential
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:06.380]  informant well he wasn't an informant he was a guy running the blackmail scam and so this is how
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:11.580]  they were getting all this power over politicians and this corrupt upper echelon of the fbi run by
[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:17.900]  the deep state consortium of the bushes and the clentis and that's the deep state cabal that's
[02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:22.060]  been using all this blackmail to control people it's well known in europe that pedophilia is used
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:29.580]  as well so that's how they've been running this operation now and culture is coming out and beginning
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:34.540]  to stick her toe in the pond which is good and obviously knows the full story but it shows as
[02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:40.140]  and culture is a bellwether that this is all coming out here's the story and culture thinks
[02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:47.020]  epskeen had state sponsored close quote and was running a quote blackmailing operation something
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:53.420]  much bigger is behind this quote and then the whole article gets into everything i told you
[02:34:54.060 --> 02:35:01.900]  i said five years ago i think i was exposing epskeen got let off nine years ago that was 2009
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:08.060]  so you let off basically 10 years ago okay i'm sorry i'm getting old i've been covering this for
[02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:15.740]  10 years okay we've been saying the deep state operates off this guy and five or six other
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:20.380]  major groups i was told by hollywood folks years ago about cults where they brand women
[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:25.820]  and how they were using fifty shades of gray to recruit women into things where they didn't
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:30.780]  understand that it was really a sex cult slave cult they would then show them snuff films and
[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:37.580]  things and the harvey weinstein was involved and i said that what two years ago before he even sort of
[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:42.460]  getting indicted and the hovegan post attacked me because i said there's sex cults where they brand
[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:50.300]  women i was told this by people that were investigating it i mean look eric prince
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:55.420]  founder of blackwater was in the news right at the same time we were in the news right before the
[02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:59.740]  election explaining that these people are running sex trafficking on airplanes when you think you
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:04.620]  just pulled that out of the air or maybe out of his rear end or something we're not just playing
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:10.380]  games here we're risking our lives telling you the truth you ever wonder why eric prince got
[02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:14.860]  demonized so much why eric prince was the devil why they imprisoned all those innocent blackwater
[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:21.500]  people and i even went along with the bs 15 years ago it's because they weren't playing ball with
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:25.900]  the globalist and they were seen as rivals and i'm not even going back and kissing blackwaters
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:32.860]  but here i'm just throwing out a caveat of the history of the type of stuff that's really going
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:36.540]  on ladies and gentlemen if you want to say something bad about blackwater they're working
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:40.220]  with the chide comps too closely right now in africa but whatever i don't want to digress
[02:36:40.860 --> 02:36:46.380]  the point is the story is up on info wars dot com and it's a big big deal and it validates and
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:51.980]  vindicates when i say story there's like eight or nine with mainstream news admitting bill clinton
[02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:56.540]  flew way more than 20 times bill clinton's lying about only flying six times on the holy
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:01.020]  to express that bill clinton went to the sex slave island while the sex slave children were
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:07.340]  brought in by traffickers this is evil stuff but beyond that why do our politicians sell out the
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:13.180]  country because they are compromised only really bad people get pushed to that level
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:16.860]  that's why they're freaking out is because they don't have any dirt on donald trump
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:22.780]  they had 25 fake women come out and say that donald trump raped them burns out they're all fake
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:28.780]  they've tried similar crap on me ladies and gentlemen they have had news stories in the new
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:37.500]  york times and in the associated press that are 100 fake 100 lies and they won't even retract them
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:40.860]  and i'm working right now preparing the lawsuits against them it's going to cost money but we
[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:47.420]  got to do it because what's the new lie going to be like they had npr a few months ago say that i
[02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:52.060]  was a bully that beat all these kids up in school and that they all kidnapped me tied me up and
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:55.580]  knocked all my teeth out i said i'll go to the doctor you can scan my teeth i've never had a
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:38:00.700]  tooth knocked out they go we don't want that and my own producer's like oh it's all bull nobody believes
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:07.500]  it alex you shouldn't care and i said no they're not going to stop now i've learned the new york
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:15.020]  times is calling people up saying that i fire guns at employees feet totally insane lies but again
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:19.260]  it's the same media that said no one showed up the trumps for this ill ideal and then when the
[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:23.740]  photos were released of it being hundreds and hundreds of thousands they said it was photoshopped
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:31.100]  my point is these people will do anything so if you think they're liars folks when you when you're
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:40.780]  not a public figure that's a patriot you have no idea folks they will lie at levels never before
[02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:46.460]  seen they are desperate they want power they know they're losing but thanks to your support and your
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:53.020]  prayers america is turning the corner and i am so incredibly excited look at how the giant pedophile
[02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:58.380]  ring control system is coming out look at how the system is so incredibly scared look at how
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:04.780]  the arrest of pedophiles are up over 10 fold and trump is unraveling their whole system we
[02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:09.900]  should be thanking god every moment all right back to the crew will johnson and the rest of the
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:15.180]  folks don't forget the war rooms coming up today at 3 p.m central whatever you do spread the link
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:19.740]  spread the article spread the videos because you are the resistance and thanks to drugs report for
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:26.700]  top linking to tony robinson interview yesterday where he's begging trump for political emergency
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:36.220]  amnesty as a persecuted journalist great report great report alex jones so i want to see if we
[02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:43.500]  have time to squeeze this clip in there this is what i was talking about um maxine waters um this
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:50.220]  is clip number eight if i'm not mistaken i think we have time to play that so this is maxine waters
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:56.060]  again talking about president trump and how everything is just a twisted see if we can play
[02:39:56.060 --> 02:40:03.180]  that video in 2016 trump's campaign pitched to african americans was and i quote what have you
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:09.420]  got to lose as if we all live in squalor at the bottom of the barrel in his eyes and have no hope
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:15.580]  without his condescending paternalistic help it doubled as a pitch for black boats and a dog
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:22.860]  whistle to his white face trump demonizes anyone he does not like does not like him or isn't willing
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:31.020]  to pledge loyalty to him he is especially eager to demonize blacks and his contempt for us is loud
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:39.260]  and clear trump attempted to destroy cavernic for protesting police brutality saying in our quote
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:46.220]  maybe he should find a country that works better for him when nfl players kept protesting trump
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:54.300]  said nfl owners should say get that blank blank off the field right now if i wasn't with y'all i would
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:41:13.420]  say okay you know what it's enough she's so disgusting she's so disgusting she's absolutely
[02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:19.580]  disgusting i've been to the white house twice see she she's she's telling all this stuff as if it's
[02:41:19.580 --> 02:41:25.580]  facts you know of course if you're going to be on a football field and you're going to say something
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:31.980]  and you're going to protest against the flag against police officers seriously police officers are
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:37.100]  doing their job police officers wake up every day wondering if today is going to be the day
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:41.900]  some idiot out there is going to take them out this is the left trying to demonize everything
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:47.980]  you even have camilla harris demonizing ice you have the left demonizing the police officers
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:53.660]  i've had police officers send me messages saying will thank you for saying something
[02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:59.100]  thank you for standing up thank you for showing the truth that not all police officers because
[02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:04.780]  there are some bad apples in the police department and police officers will admit to that but they
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:10.780]  don't go all out to say that police officers are bad maxine waters the rest of the democrats
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:16.620]  they're doing nothing but pushing lies about white people and president trump they are the ones
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:21.980]  creating this division if you didn't have the left we wouldn't have this this wouldn't even
[02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:27.500]  be a thing i wouldn't even be talking about it but you have the left constantly every single day
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:33.500]  trying to make it look like it's something that is not the people that need to leave the country
[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:40.460]  are those that are on the left just imagine a country without leftists imagine how much more
[02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:47.500]  prosperous we would be imagine how much more great this country would be the left they are
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:52.940]  the virus it's not white people it's liberalism my name is will johnson this is the alex jones

[02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:56.060]  off this thursday at 8 a.m central at info wars dot com forward slash show 1776 worldwide it's not
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:44:00.220]  only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's
[02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:05.740]  unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate
[02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:10.300]  donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by
[02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:15.020]  secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:20.460]  1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:24.300]  fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:29.020]  support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:33.260]  and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:37.660]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views
[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:42.700]  the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:47.580]  the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:51.580]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:59.980]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth as we gather this evening in the joy of freedom
[02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:06.220]  we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage together we are part of one of the
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:14.300]  greatest stories ever told the story of america it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people
[02:45:14.300 --> 02:45:21.740]  have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true as long as we stay

[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:19.020]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:27.740]  something really important okay we're not women's soccer we're not the nfl
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:34.060]  now if there's anybody here that's going to be disrespectful to either the american
[02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:39.260]  or the canadian national anthem grab your gear and get the out now because you'll never see the
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:48.540]  ice in this arena a video has gone viral of a hockey coach telling the team during their training
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:55.020]  that if they want to disrespect the canadian american flag just get the hell out right now
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:59.580]  we're going to play that clip in a moment but but why is this so important because when a group is
[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:05.180]  trying to conquer you they try to tell you to take your flag down and the people saying that they
[02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:11.100]  hate the american flag and other western flags don't even know why in most cases they're just
[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:18.140]  told by the media it's a cool thing to do all this grew out of fake media cases where police
[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:24.460]  supposedly shot innocent black men and in almost every case it turned out that the media was actually
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:29.420]  lying about it all and trying to foment a race war in this country and we have the
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:33.580]  documents from femo we have the documents from obama we have the wiki leak documents we have
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:39.980]  the antifa documents we know they're doing this so i'm all for free speech if you want to go home
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:43.900]  and burn american flags at your house if you want to burn canadian flags you want to burn rainbow
[02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:50.140]  flags you want to burn uh budweiser flags that's your business at your own backyard but when you
[02:48:50.140 --> 02:48:55.500]  work for a sports team be a professional hockey anything you sign on to that code of conduct
[02:48:56.140 --> 02:49:01.580]  and you sign on to how you behave and what you do when you're out there on that field so the very
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:05.420]  left wants to get rid of conservative speech the very left that's always saying we don't deserve to
[02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:10.300]  you know you can be on twitter or facebook they're the ones getting rid of free speech on colleges
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:16.620]  for everybody but then they say oh but we need to go out and kneel during my national anthem
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:23.180]  and grandstand and say america sucks all because nike and others will give them sponsorships if
[02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:29.660]  they do it's these globalist corporations that are the problem and want to destroy the nation state
[02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:35.500]  because then you won't have any redress with federal or state courts or the legislature or
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:41.020]  politicians you can vote out you'll have global government exploiting you and that's what's happened
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.660]  these people want to get our flag and destroy it they want to remove the betsy ross flag it's
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:51.820]  asinine and it's incredibly dangerous but the good news is there's a major backlash to it
[02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:56.700]  and people are seeing through it and idiot organizations like the nfl have lost 39 percent
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:02.780]  of their viewers in the last four or five years and are losing billions and i say good go bankrupt
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:08.780]  go bankrupt and teach you a lesson to stop cow telling the hollywood and the globalist
[02:50:08.780 --> 02:50:17.020]  back to will johnson the rest of crew in the atx something really important okay we're not woman
[02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:24.940]  soccer we're not the nfl if there's anybody here that's going to be disrespectful to either the
[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:30.220]  american or the canadian national anthem grab your gear and get the out now because you'll
[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:39.420]  never see the ice in this arena yep you know what let me ask this question what do the american flag
[02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:45.900]  mean to you you know for me as a black male in america the american flag means freedom not just
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:54.380]  to me but to millions of people in the country the american flag is the flag that won during the
[02:50:54.380 --> 02:50:59.820]  silver war had the other flag won i would not be sitting here today i would not have the freedoms
[02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:06.700]  that i have today the american flag is the flag for all americans and for them to do what they're
[02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:11.980]  doing is terrible so we're gonna look at this report with tommy robertson and we'll see you
[02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:18.700]  after the break all right let's take the road out europe uk and the us to a great extent has
[02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:24.140]  been swallowed up by authoritarianism mass censorship of nationalist conservatives christians
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:29.340]  veterans groups pro gun groups pro life groups now tommy robertson is doing an emergency appeal
[02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:34.300]  to the president he's been laying out the evidence of the fraud what is your direct appeal about what
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:39.100]  you're facing your family's facing and why you need him to give you emergency asylum which i think
[02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:43.980]  there's a very good chance we can get him to do president trump the american government
[02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:51.340]  britain has fallen even even yourself if you was in britain you would be arrested and tried
[02:51:51.980 --> 02:51:56.700]  you would be tried because sadee khan would demand it the political pressure that has been put on the
[02:51:56.700 --> 02:52:02.380]  judiciary system would be the similar pressure would be put on for yourself i'm an english man
[02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:07.340]  a british citizen who loves my country and it hurts me to have to say i have no future here
[02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:14.140]  the only future that lies for me is death death at the hands of an establishment who will feed me
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:20.540]  to islamic gangs of jihadis within the prison system i have 48 hours before my sentencing
[02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:26.220]  i previously spent three months on solitary confinement for journalism for breaking no law
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:32.060]  the reality is and i urge you please get your lawyers to look through this case you will expose
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:38.380]  and see complete corruption i'm being found guilty when i've broke no laws i've not been tried by
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:45.020]  a peer or by my peers 12 members of the british public that's the magna car that's common law common
[02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:49.980]  law is if if members of my peers if the british public find me duty other find me guilty i'd accept
[02:52:49.980 --> 02:52:55.820]  my fate i'm not being tried i think this is a back door ruling in order for the government to silence
[02:52:55.820 --> 02:53:01.660]  me imprison me and inevitably have me killed i'm a father of three were three beautiful children
[02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:06.540]  and a wife and a beautiful wife last time i was in prison the police went to my family's home to
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:10.700]  tell them and they had intel that there were going to be acid attacks against them they went to my
[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:16.300]  wife they went to my mother they're going to take me away and leave my family vulnerable my crime
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:24.060]  awakening the british public to the mass problems from open border immigration importing a culture of
[02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:28.940]  dominance and violence and that and they see the globalists don't want the public to be aware of
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:34.060]  this they don't want people to understand the problems that come with their utopia vision
[02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:40.380]  for our world i've spoke out i've laid my life i'm saying to you i want to keep on fighting but i
[02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:45.100]  can't fight it because i'm going to be killed and as a journalist as a british citizen i beg you

[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:04.780]  it's celebrated by the people in power who rule over us the globalist it's celebrated it's celebrated
[02:55:04.780 --> 02:55:12.540]  when a journalist is being imprisoned the media they're not journalists they're activists i just i
[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:18.060]  make this as a direct appeal i ask american citizens please make sure somehow the ask alec
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:23.260]  don't ask anyone make sure this lands in the american government i know that i know that when
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:28.060]  i was taken and kidnapped off the street and unlawfully held which has been proven i know
[02:55:28.860 --> 02:55:32.940]  that congressman from the republican party stepped in i know that pressure was put on the
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:37.420]  british government i'm telling you now it's not pressure that's needed i need evacuation out of
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:43.340]  this country because there are people and dark forces at work in this nation the same dark
[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:47.740]  forces at work in this nation that want to repel you as the leader of the free world from even
[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:52.620]  entering this country there are many people in this country who would want to seek the same
[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:57.500]  against you that they seek against me the same lies that are told about you i have to fight these
[02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:02.940]  lies i've fought these lies as a young working-class man from a town in england i've had to fight against
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:07.980]  the labeling against the state against the stigma the nazi the races the fascists all the words used
[02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:13.100]  in to destroy a man's reputation i've had to fight and fight and fight as a single individual
[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:17.980]  and right now i'm about to be imprisoned and i'm saying if you care about freedom like i know you
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:23.180]  do i know america loves freedom i may fight for it and die for it and so would we ours is gone
[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:30.860]  it's gone the country's fallen i want to make a genuine appeal to president trump to the republican
[02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:37.900]  party please consider me and my family for political asylum the british state's appeasement to islam
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:43.100]  the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting
[02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:48.700]  and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda to the world
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:57.420]  watching if this was happening to a journalist in any other country in china in russia in north
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:02.380]  career human rights lawyers will be fighting to defend them political correctness is that powerful
[02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:07.500]  in this country i can't find a human rights lawyer to defend me or even mention me every time we speak
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:14.460]  to lawyers about anything as soon as i hear it's my name no we walk away and i ask again if you're
[02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:22.300]  watching this if you're in the administration of president trump donald trump jr i'm pleading with
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:30.300]  you please raise concerns over this case i promise you all of the information all my bone barristers
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:34.780]  have said they've gone against the law my own barristers said that it's impossible for me to get
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:43.100]  convicted yeah i've been found guilty of all three charges defending the republic from enemies foreign
[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:47.820]  and domestic let's talk to margess in new york margess you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:52.220]  hey alak yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:56.860]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[02:57:56.860 --> 02:58:01.340]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:05.580]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:10.060]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[02:58:10.060 --> 02:58:13.660]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:17.660]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut
[02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:22.940]  you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years
[02:58:22.940 --> 02:58:27.500]  old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:33.020]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many
[02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:37.260]  others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the input war and even if something
[02:58:37.260 --> 02:58:42.380]  does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for

[02:59:05.980 --> 02:59:12.620]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails the system

[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:49.500]  conversation with paul watson i watched all of his videos on twitter and i see a lot of his articles

[03:00:56.700 --> 03:01:03.260]  think i received a phone call from the the uk and i was wondering if it was you because i was saying
[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:07.100]  you know what if someone has paul's number please give him my number i would love to talk to him
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:13.100]  this was a while ago and i know you've been extremely busy with the summit summit news so it's a real
[03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:17.020]  honor to talk to you i know we have the five minute segment here you're going to take over on the fourth
[03:01:17.020 --> 03:01:23.180]  hour i just want to talk to you here before you went on because i never had the decent or i had
[03:01:23.180 --> 03:01:30.700]  i never had the privilege to have a conversation with you so how's it going go ahead what do you
[03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:37.660]  want to know uh so i know um i know that you uh you're in the uk and you're seeing so many things
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:43.420]  and i see a lot of the articles that you have on on info wars um you like all the attacks and stuff
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:48.540]  you're like so on it and i know some of the reports that you put out i said oh i see this report
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:53.100]  i'm gonna do it and then before i know it you've already have a report and you already have it on
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:58.300]  info wars and it's already ran and it's like you're like a head of the game and i'm like man
[03:01:58.300 --> 03:02:03.500]  you know i just i i'm almost jealous but you know it's awesome that you're in the fight and
[03:02:03.500 --> 03:02:10.780]  i have to tell you i have a my producer um she she just loves your accent she loves your voice
[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:18.060]  and she says i just love the way he sounds so and it's just you come across um very genuine and i
[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:25.260]  think uh you're you've been absolutely awesome so i appreciate that i appreciate that will yeah
[03:02:25.260 --> 03:02:30.700]  i mean the accent and the voice i've kind of toned it down over the past few years a lot of people
[03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:36.220]  who i meet still say things like you know why do you sound so angry in your videos um well
[03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:41.020]  i've toned it down to a certain extent but it's not that i'm angry it's because i script all the
[03:02:41.020 --> 03:02:47.020]  videos you see so you have to remember each sentence before you deliver it to camera so if
[03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:53.100]  you're fumbling and um stumbling over the same sentence like five times in a row you get a little
[03:02:53.100 --> 03:02:58.380]  bit angry and you have to you know get a little bit worked up to force out that sentence and get
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:04.220]  it right yes so that's why sometimes it comes across as a little bit too forceful but normally
[03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:08.860]  i've tried like i've softened the edges a little bit over the past couple of years and i think that
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:14.460]  gets across the message a little bit better to people rather than this you know rat a tap
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:20.460]  bam bam bam method that maybe i was known for a couple years in the past yeah no you but you
[03:03:20.460 --> 03:03:26.140]  know what i think you have every right to be angry i think we also be angry you know we have the left
[03:03:26.140 --> 03:03:30.700]  these socialist communists they're doing all of these crazy things and we're supposed to just be
[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:36.060]  happy about it we're supposed to go along with it like there's nothing wrong with it i mean i think
[03:03:36.060 --> 03:03:41.260]  we have every right to be angry when they're trying to teach our children that you know if you're a
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:46.700]  little boy that you can be a girl that is not right it's not right in the mind you know years ago
[03:03:46.700 --> 03:03:50.860]  had we seen something like that they would say that you're completely insane and and you know they
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:56.940]  have these drag queens going attacking these little kids they would try to put them in jail but now
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:04:02.300]  today they're glorifying it they're making it okay and i think we have every right you have every
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:08.860]  right to be angry about them doing this crazy stuff to all of us as a society i mean that's just my
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:15.260]  opinion on it it's completely sake will and obviously the the lightest thing is we literally
[03:04:15.260 --> 03:04:21.980]  had a convicted pedophile bragging about how he found desmond is amazing hot on a word press blog
[03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:27.580]  which is still up as far as i know and that's the point at which his mother got upset about it
[03:04:27.580 --> 03:04:32.300]  not when they were literally throwing dollar bills at him at a gay club in new york that was fine
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:37.260]  it was when an actual pedophile started lusting over this 12-year-old kid on the internet then
[03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:42.540]  she got upset about it yeah so yeah it's completely low low and it's crazy well hey thank you for
[03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:47.420]  talking with me my name is will johnson has been an honor to sit in this chair for alice jones today
[03:04:48.140 --> 03:04:51.580]  next hour paul watson thank you
[03:04:54.620 --> 03:05:01.340]  info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:06.300]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together
[03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:11.340]  and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this
[03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:17.580]  size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting
[03:05:17.580 --> 03:05:22.940]  self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines
[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:27.500]  what content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[03:05:27.500 --> 03:05:31.500]  and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:35.660]  five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:40.460]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support
[03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:45.660]  press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views
[03:05:45.660 --> 03:05:50.220]  they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is
[03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:53.180]  the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[03:05:53.180 --> 03:06:12.300]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[03:06:12.300 --> 03:06:29.260]  host i'm gonna go over the latest jeffrey eppstein news probably later on in the show there are some
[03:06:29.260 --> 03:06:35.020]  new developments on that which we've been covering all day first we'll probably start off with this
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:41.340]  and this goes straight to the heart of what andy warhol one said which was basically everybody
[03:06:41.340 --> 03:06:47.580]  will get their fifteen minutes of fame and of course with social media that makes it so much
[03:06:47.580 --> 03:06:56.220]  easier for people in their narcissistic zeal to clamor for that fifteen minutes of fame now we've
[03:06:56.220 --> 03:07:01.580]  always had kids doing stupid things and since the internet and since the rise of social media
[03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:06.620]  we've always had kids doing stupid things so they can get interviewed so they can get views
[03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:12.460]  on the internet you know we had the tide pod thing last year where people were literally
[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:20.780]  filming themselves eating tide pods at least that was damaging only to themselves but this bizarre
[03:07:20.780 --> 03:07:28.140]  trend of people licking food eating food swelling mouthwash and spitting it back
[03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:35.020]  continues this is a new fad here's the latest example you saw the guy there spitting into a
[03:07:35.020 --> 03:07:42.060]  jug of sweet tea headline viral video shows man spitting into sweet tea before putting it back on
[03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:48.860]  shelf there was one girl who turned out to be a minor which is why she didn't get hit with the 20
[03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:54.140]  year prison sentence the maximum sentence that this could have occurred for her that was probably
[03:07:54.140 --> 03:07:59.180]  never going to happen it was more likely going to be a slap on the wrist of fine but she got away
[03:07:59.180 --> 03:08:05.900]  with it completely there were no charges whatsoever now yet another video has emerged showing someone
[03:08:05.900 --> 03:08:11.180]  tampering with food in a grocery store this time featuring a man spitting into a jug of sweet tea
[03:08:11.180 --> 03:08:16.620]  and placing it back on the shelf now again we don't know where this happened we don't know who
[03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:23.500]  this is it's in a grocery store somewhere in america apparently by the way this has got four
[03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:28.220]  million views on twitter alone having originally been posted on reddit so if you combine them all
[03:08:28.220 --> 03:08:35.020]  it's probably got almost 10 million views robbie starbucks tweeted that apparently this individual
[03:08:35.020 --> 03:08:42.540]  the spitting guy has been identified and he's a big leftist robbie starbucks tweeted they found
[03:08:42.540 --> 03:08:47.580]  this creep and i don't want to shock anyone but he's another leftist leftism destroys respect and
[03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:52.700]  societal norms at a very basic level then like this guy's recent post they're going to complain
[03:08:52.700 --> 03:09:00.140]  about july 4 celebrations as if that's what's hurting our country so it appears that this guy
[03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:06.300]  has literally been whining about july 4 celebrations while he's literally spitting into cartons of
[03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:13.340]  sweet tea and putting it back on store shelves which is by the way a crime tampering with a
[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:18.220]  consumer product and it carries with it up to 20 years in jail none of these people are going to get
[03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:27.020]  that but it is very serious to the point where we now have cops literally guarding ice cream
[03:09:27.020 --> 03:09:33.980]  freezers in grocery stores in america headline cops now protecting ice cream freezers after
[03:09:33.980 --> 03:09:40.860]  licking trend goes viral some grocery stores are making customers show id so buying ice creams now
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:46.780]  like buying cigarettes and alcohol says please see employee for help with a lock on the freezer door
[03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:51.340]  because they don't want anyone else trying to replicate this disgusting fat
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:09:59.740]  and in one store and the keller police department in texas posted this on their own public safety
[03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:05.900]  facebook page they've got two officers protecting the store's ice cream freezer with the caption
[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:11.180]  the only bluebell ice cream being licked here in keller this holiday weekend will be the kind
[03:10:11.180 --> 03:10:19.740]  you've already purchased so you've got actual crimes taking place in chicago i think there was
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:25.660]  something like dozens of people shot five killed just over july 4 weekend alone but now they're
[03:10:25.660 --> 03:10:32.060]  having to use police resources in all these different towns to guard ice cream freezers
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:39.820]  because this trend is going viral on social media you had another case of it in new orleans
[03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:46.940]  headline is our trend of people licking food then putting it back continues this was a 36 year old
[03:10:46.940 --> 03:10:53.420]  man this wasn't a child this wasn't a minor this wasn't a teenager it was 36 year old lenees
[03:10:53.420 --> 03:10:59.820]  loyde martin the third doing precisely the same thing as the kids did to a cart of bluebell ice
[03:10:59.820 --> 03:11:06.140]  cream at a grocery store in bell rose west of new orleans it later emerged martin had purchased
[03:11:06.140 --> 03:11:12.060]  the ice cream before the stunt but it doesn't matter unlawful posting of criminal activity for
[03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:19.340]  notoriety in publicity and criminal mischief is a crime in new orleans so he's in big trouble
[03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:27.180]  martin was inspired by a teen imagine a grown man a 36 year old man thinking that he's going to get
[03:11:27.180 --> 03:11:32.860]  some internet clout by posting a video of himself licking some ice cream and putting it back that's
[03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:38.220]  what defines his life now and that's the point everyone's going to get their 15 minutes of fame
[03:11:39.420 --> 03:11:43.820]  but then because of the internet because the internet is forever this is going to define
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:51.580]  their lives forever when people google their names so future employers future girlfriends and
[03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:57.580]  boyfriends are going to see when they google their name that this is what they're infamous for what
[03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:03.580]  an achievement that is another clip shows what appears to be a transgender individual nobody
[03:12:03.580 --> 03:12:08.540]  knows quite who or what this is taking a swig of mouthwash before spitting it back in the bottle
[03:12:08.540 --> 03:12:15.340]  and walking away and yes in most of these cases they probably already bought the item then walked
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:22.140]  back into the store and pulled this stun just for the views because almost every video has got
[03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:27.820]  like four million views another person who goes by the name shorn mendez on twitter had his friend
[03:12:27.820 --> 03:12:32.460]  friend film him scooping out a chunk of ice cream with his hand before putting it back in the freezer
[03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:41.980]  and that guy got into a row on twitter with james charles the makeup artist youtuber who's got like
[03:12:41.980 --> 03:12:48.460]  15 million subscribers on youtube he then posted a video of a police officer showing up at his house
[03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:56.700]  which is all totally criminal behavior i expected these videos to get deleted this one's got 20
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:13:04.220]  million views and it's still on his twitter this is like his the crowning achievement of his life
[03:13:04.220 --> 03:13:10.300]  and he's completely proud of it he literally scoops out a huge chunk with his hand throws it back in
[03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:17.260]  the freezer they've had to do product recalls in a bunch of these places at a cost of god knows how
[03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:23.420]  many thousands and thousands of dollars this guy literally posted the police officer visiting
[03:13:23.420 --> 03:13:31.980]  his home he's proud of it because he's got 20 million views if you create a social media
[03:13:31.980 --> 03:13:38.460]  environment which rewards narcissism then this is what's going to happen the kids are definitely
[03:13:38.460 --> 03:13:44.300]  not all right in fact i'm just looking at this guy with his 20 million views
[03:13:44.300 --> 03:13:52.140]  it's as if he's done it again in fact he's posted another video of somebody else doing it
[03:13:53.660 --> 03:13:57.500]  so it just continues i'm looking at another video now of some
[03:13:58.940 --> 03:14:04.460]  rotund individual who's basically doing the same thing absolutely incredible this shows no sign
[03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:11.820]  of stopping and it's being encouraged by this kind of osmosis effects even though it's a criminal
[03:14:11.820 --> 03:14:16.620]  offense and they could face up to 20 years in prison absolutely incredible meanwhile of course
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:26.140]  you have bell delphine who is basically an ethot who gets incel losers to send her beta books on
[03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:31.980]  patreon for example she says that she will basically talk to them for $2,500 a month
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:41.420]  she literally started selling parks of her own bathwater on the internet for $30 it was sold out
[03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:49.740]  within 48 hours then all these guys and their girlfriends started posting messages on social
[03:14:49.740 --> 03:14:55.660]  media saying that this had led to the breakup of relationships because the girl had opened the
[03:14:55.660 --> 03:15:02.860]  package and realized that her boyfriend was literally spending $30 a pop buying dirty
[03:15:02.860 --> 03:15:11.260]  bathwater from some skanky ethot on the internet this is the state of western masculinity in 2019
[03:15:12.460 --> 03:15:18.540]  in fact i'm going to put this in a video i've compared it to the um shroud of ture in
[03:15:18.540 --> 03:15:22.940]  owning bell delphine's bathwater is kind of like owning the shroud of ture in
[03:15:22.940 --> 03:15:27.180]  but whereas jesus christ was the son of god rose from the dead and became the central figure of
[03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:34.700]  the world's largest religion bell delphine her activity consists of throwing eggs at mirrors
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:41.500]  and basically splashing around in her own dirty bathwater absolutely incredible
[03:15:41.500 --> 03:15:46.700]  this is modern culture on the one hand you've got to admire her entrepreneurship on the other hand
[03:15:46.700 --> 03:15:49.500]  it's total another degeneracy we'll be back

[03:17:57.980 --> 03:18:01.980]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[03:18:01.980 --> 03:18:06.700]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[03:18:06.700 --> 03:18:11.820]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:11.820 --> 03:18:16.540]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:20.060]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[03:18:20.060 --> 03:18:24.060]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:28.300]  last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements

[03:22:17.580 --> 03:22:26.380]  t-shirt before it goes right now at info wars store dot com now i put up an article on summit
[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:32.060]  dot news a couple of hours ago about the women's world cop which if you live in the united kingdom
[03:22:32.060 --> 03:22:38.220]  has been shoved down our throats for the past three four weeks solid in a desperate attempt
[03:22:38.220 --> 03:22:44.300]  to socially engineer everyone to like it when compared to the men's game at least according
[03:22:44.300 --> 03:22:51.020]  to the statistics revenue wise there's really no comparison and of course we've had this narrative
[03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:56.380]  in the united states as well for the past three weeks that the us women's soccer team
[03:22:56.380 --> 03:23:04.700]  deserves equal pay to the men's soccer team now let's just ignore for the moment the fact that
[03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:12.460]  a team of under 15 boys literally beat the us women's professional soccer team five two back in
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:18.540]  2017 maybe they should be paid the same or even more than the women's team and this is the same
[03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:24.780]  thing at every point in fact i remember getting into an argument with a feminist who seriously
[03:23:24.780 --> 03:23:32.060]  made the argument that the only reason men are better at sports than women despite having bigger
[03:23:32.060 --> 03:23:38.460]  bone density despite being faster despite uh being having more stamina despite having better
[03:23:38.460 --> 03:23:44.780]  spatial awareness the the only reason men are better at sports is because of social conditioning
[03:23:44.780 --> 03:23:52.140]  and because they're encouraged to get into sports as children at an early age even though you
[03:23:52.140 --> 03:23:58.940]  literally had the professional us women's soccer team the best of the best they won the world cup
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:06.700]  were beaten five two by a team of teenage boys same thing happened with the australian women's
[03:24:06.700 --> 03:24:12.700]  soccer team professional that's their job they train day in day out that's all they do they
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:20.620]  were beaten by a team of under 15 boys seven nil so clearly there's something more than social
[03:24:20.620 --> 03:24:27.260]  engineering going on social conditioning from birth but no that doesn't matter we have to accept
[03:24:27.260 --> 03:24:33.580]  this bizarre identity politics credo that there are no biological physical differences between
[03:24:33.580 --> 03:24:42.460]  men and women and megan rapinoe who is the pink haired purple haired feminist who hates donald
[03:24:42.460 --> 03:24:47.100]  trump and refused to sing the national anthem she's obviously being at the forefront of this
[03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:52.540]  narrative in an interview after the world cup win she said regarding the equal pay argument
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:57.260]  and everybody's ready for it everybody wants it everybody's ready for the conversation to be
[03:24:57.260 --> 03:25:05.420]  moved to the next piece well maybe that next piece should be allowing transgenders to play
[03:25:05.420 --> 03:25:11.820]  for women's soccer teams and then we'll see if there are any biological differences between
[03:25:11.820 --> 03:25:18.460]  men and women because usually they tend to dominate don't they they see that her involved
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:24.380]  in that incident where the us flag was dropped on the ground obviously a massive sign of disrespect
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:30.140]  was immediately picked up by one of her teammates so she's been at the forefront of this argument
[03:25:30.140 --> 03:25:35.580]  trying to claim that women women soccer players should be paid the same as men well when you
[03:25:35.580 --> 03:25:43.500]  look at the actual revenue they bring in somewhat of a difference forbes reports the men's world
[03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:50.460]  cup in russia generated over six billion in revenue with the participating team sharing 400
[03:25:50.460 --> 03:25:59.020]  million meanwhile the women's world cup is expected to earn 131 million and that's over a full four
[03:25:59.020 --> 03:26:06.700]  year cycle so in other words a four year cycle compared to a one year cycle the women's world
[03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:15.900]  cup earned 5 billion 869 million less in revenue than the men's world cup and yet they want to be
[03:26:15.900 --> 03:26:21.500]  paid the same the media may have attempted to socially engineer people to embrace women's
[03:26:21.500 --> 03:26:26.700]  soccer by shoving it down her throat every five minutes which they've done in the uk but people
[03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:32.300]  just aren't interested to anywhere near the level of the men's game that's just a fact because it's
[03:26:32.300 --> 03:26:39.900]  slower it's not as high quality granted if you look at women's soccer from 15 20 years ago it was
[03:26:40.460 --> 03:26:45.980]  it was hilariously poor i mean let's be honest the quality has drastically increased and there's
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:50.780]  no problem with encouraging young women who want to play soccer to do so and there's no problem
[03:26:50.780 --> 03:26:56.700]  with celebrating them when they are victorious as was the u.s women's soccer team but again
[03:26:56.700 --> 03:27:03.740]  to suggest that the pressure they're under in these kind of situations these televised games
[03:27:03.740 --> 03:27:09.660]  and the quality that they produce on a field on the field to suggest that is on a par with the men
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:17.020]  is completely absurd i did a video about this the truth about gender basically making the point
[03:27:17.020 --> 03:27:22.540]  men are better at sports than women because of physiological differences that is clear as day
[03:27:22.540 --> 03:27:30.140]  the only sport in which women perform better than men in the entire world is long distance swimming
[03:27:30.140 --> 03:27:35.260]  because women naturally have more body fat so they float better so they're better at long
[03:27:35.260 --> 03:27:41.820]  distance swimming that is literally the only sport in the world that biological women are better
[03:27:41.820 --> 03:27:47.580]  than biological men so you want to pay them the same or more for that go ahead but in every other
[03:27:47.580 --> 03:27:53.900]  instance in every other sport there are huge differences and that's why the revenue is significantly
[03:27:53.900 --> 03:28:00.300]  different to the tune of five billion eight hundred and sixty nine million dollars in terms of the
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:07.820]  world cup because again a lot of people don't want to watch women's soccer it's not very entertaining
[03:28:07.820 --> 03:28:14.620]  sorry if you're involved in it if you've got family who do it fair enough i don't want to watch it
[03:28:14.620 --> 03:28:19.580]  and no matter how much they cram it down your throat by claiming that it's on the same level as
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:28.060]  the men's game in terms of entertainment value importance skill or revenue it's just not going
[03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:34.140]  to wash because biologically men and women are god forbid different women are better at other
[03:28:34.140 --> 03:28:39.260]  things than men which are equally or more important i would argue that childrearing is way more
[03:28:39.260 --> 03:28:45.020]  important than kicking around a ball and they should be celebrated for that and they're not in
[03:28:45.020 --> 03:28:51.500]  this culture childrearing parenting is denigrated we'll be back in the next segment breaking news

[03:35:21.100 --> 03:35:28.940]  right now at info wars store dot com now it's talking before the break about the um equal pay
[03:35:28.940 --> 03:35:34.540]  controversy with the us women's soccer team of course we had that incident with the flag where
[03:35:34.540 --> 03:35:40.220]  they dropped the flag on the ground and that incident involved the purple headed woman who
[03:35:40.220 --> 03:35:47.020]  hates donald trump and refuses to sing the national anthem refuses to visit the white house well this
[03:35:47.020 --> 03:35:52.860]  video came out last night and nobody's identified who this is or what team this is but it's great
[03:35:53.580 --> 03:36:00.620]  headline hockey coach if you disrespect the anthem get the f out now so this is a viral video
[03:36:00.620 --> 03:36:06.460]  there's basically a hockey coach talking to his team in the dressing room and he says if they
[03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:11.580]  disrespect the national anthem they can get the f out now and not a single one of them seems to
[03:36:11.580 --> 03:36:17.660]  disagree because they all remain in the room so this had 400 000 views when i wrote this article
[03:36:17.660 --> 03:36:23.660]  it's probably got half a million at this point in fact it's got 582 000 views it's gone completely
[03:36:23.660 --> 03:36:28.940]  viral not as viral as people licking ice cream putting it back in the freezer unfortunately
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:34.140]  which has got 10 times the amount of views but he said quote this is the coach talking to his
[03:36:34.140 --> 03:36:40.220]  players before this hockey match we're not women's soccer we're not the nfl if there's anybody here
[03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:45.260]  who is going to be disrespectful to either the american or the canadian national anthem
[03:36:45.260 --> 03:36:50.460]  grab your gear and get the f out now because you'll never see the ice in this arena we don't have
[03:36:50.460 --> 03:36:55.820]  that problem in hockey we're better than that but there was no sense in wasting anybody's time
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:37:04.220]  if that sh it was going to happen and of course there didn't seem to be any disagreement so we
[03:37:04.220 --> 03:37:09.420]  need to find out who that guy is what his name is what the team is because they need to be praised
[03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:15.580]  even further than just going viral on an anonymous twitter video meanwhile in russia this was really
[03:37:15.580 --> 03:37:21.340]  interesting i came across this via a couple of hours ago it's basically russia's second largest
[03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:28.540]  tv channel headline russian tv express is bewilderment over west transfix with identity politics
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:34.140]  and it's a conversation between a guest and the host of this show in russia and they're both completely
[03:37:34.140 --> 03:37:42.220]  at a loss to explain what the hell is going on with the west side obsession with identity politics
[03:37:42.220 --> 03:37:46.460]  so they started off talking it's all in russia of course but there are subtitles on the video
[03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:51.740]  they started off talking about vladimir putin's meeting with british prime minister therese may
[03:37:51.740 --> 03:37:57.100]  at the g20 and then the guests just suddenly started talking about the wider insanity that
[03:37:57.100 --> 03:38:04.300]  was taking place in the uk specifically the 17-year-old schoolboy in scotland and we've
[03:38:04.300 --> 03:38:09.660]  probably played the video on the show before last week who was suspended for saying that there are
[03:38:09.660 --> 03:38:15.180]  only two genders male and female you've probably seen that clip by now he got into an argument
[03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:19.500]  with his teacher about it he was suspended for three weeks i think he's probably been further
[03:38:19.500 --> 03:38:25.020]  punishment after that so you have these two russians talking about it on russia's prime time
[03:38:25.660 --> 03:38:32.460]  conversation chat show and the guest says quote i expected it to provoke a backlash in society at
[03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:38.460]  least somewhere it didn't apart from the internet the host then said that he only knew of male and
[03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:43.660]  female and asked his guests to provide a description of a third fourth and fifth sex so he's totally
[03:38:43.660 --> 03:38:49.660]  baffled as to what's going on the guest then went on to describe a recent story which again this
[03:38:49.660 --> 03:38:57.020]  happened in the uk about how staff at a london zoo had placed a banner in the penguin enclosure
[03:38:57.020 --> 03:39:04.060]  that reads quote some penguins are gay get over it he said you know i'm just at a loss it's very
[03:39:04.060 --> 03:39:10.460]  hard to explain it all the host joked do gay penguins take offense if somebody mistakes them
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:17.100]  for straight penguins the video was posted on youtube under the headline does tereza may dislike
[03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:25.180]  putin because she believes in 64 genders and he doesn't so it's just interesting because it's
[03:39:25.180 --> 03:39:32.060]  it's these two russian guys talking about the behavior of like an alien species on a different
[03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:37.100]  planet but in reality they're talking about another country which is on the same continent
[03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:43.020]  and really interesting the studio audience reacts to it by applauding the host when he
[03:39:43.020 --> 03:39:50.700]  makes these jokes they're similarly baffled it's just again a sterling illustration of the complete
[03:39:50.700 --> 03:39:58.140]  disconnect between the west and the east in terms of this multiculturalism of course we had
[03:39:58.140 --> 03:40:03.500]  vladimir putin come out last week and identity politics we had vladimir putin come out last week
[03:40:03.500 --> 03:40:08.700]  and saying that you know liberalism is in its death row is a ruling elite have broken away from
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:14.860]  the people the liberal idea has outlived its purpose multiculturalism is no longer tenable
[03:40:15.660 --> 03:40:20.460]  they get that from the outside they're seeing that in russia they're looking at the west they're
[03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:24.540]  looking at france they're looking at germany they're looking at the uk they're seeing it
[03:40:24.540 --> 03:40:31.180]  basically collapse culturally as we invite in these vast numbers of people who share very different
[03:40:31.180 --> 03:40:36.620]  cultural beliefs they haven't invited those vast numbers of people in so they've still maintained
[03:40:36.620 --> 03:40:43.740]  a stable steady culture and they're seeing it from the outside and they're absolutely baffled
[03:40:44.620 --> 03:40:50.620]  and this is another example of that festival removes rapper who quit music fest that double
[03:40:50.620 --> 03:40:57.260]  charged whites so of course we had this story a couple of days ago detroit michigan's kindred music
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:41:03.740]  and culture festival has removed rapper tiny jag from the fest's lineup after she dropped out of
[03:41:03.740 --> 03:41:09.500]  afro future music festival upon learning that they double charged whites for admission so this
[03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:16.460]  festival afro music afro future music had to walk it back and say no we're not going to charge
[03:41:16.460 --> 03:41:21.340]  white people double because again that is the bigotry of low expectations is not only racist
[03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:26.220]  against white people is racist against non-white people presuming that they wouldn't be able to
[03:41:26.220 --> 03:41:34.780]  afford the $20 fee because they're all so poor they had to walk it back because the ticket website
[03:41:34.780 --> 03:41:40.300]  event bright said that it was a violation of their policy because you can't charge different prices
[03:41:40.940 --> 03:41:47.420]  based on people's skin color because of course that's completely racist but now a different
[03:41:47.420 --> 03:41:56.380]  music festival has de-platformed the black artists who complained about it rightly and said that it
[03:41:56.380 --> 03:42:01.420]  was racist because she complained about it and said that she wouldn't perform at this festival
[03:42:01.420 --> 03:42:07.660]  so it's now a different festival that's pulled out that's de-platformed her at least because she
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:13.900]  had the temerity to stand up to racism and now of course she's being called an uncle tom
[03:42:13.900 --> 03:42:21.180]  she's getting threats and further down the rabbit hole we go absolutely incredible meanwhile
[03:42:22.060 --> 03:42:27.020]  math teacher loses job after defending western civilization this is up on zero hedge
[03:42:27.820 --> 03:42:32.300]  um a math teacher says she's lost her job at private school in southern california for speaking
[03:42:32.300 --> 03:42:39.100]  out in defense of western civilization she committed the thought crime of actually standing up
[03:42:39.100 --> 03:42:46.780]  for western civilization the greatest thing that's ever happened to the planet now she's out of a

[03:42:57.740 --> 03:43:01.740]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[03:43:01.740 --> 03:43:05.900]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts
[03:43:05.900 --> 03:43:09.660]  the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the
[03:43:09.660 --> 03:43:13.420]  ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[03:43:13.420 --> 03:43:17.740]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[03:43:17.740 --> 03:43:21.580]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[03:43:21.580 --> 03:43:25.900]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to

[03:48:53.820 --> 03:48:59.420]  this epstein news it's kind of died down since the um indictment was announced yesterday obviously
[03:48:59.420 --> 03:49:07.420]  didn't name any high profile names but we did have a report out of um oan and jack perso big
[03:49:08.380 --> 03:49:14.540]  epstein to name individuals involved in underage sex in return for five year maximum sentence so he
[03:49:14.540 --> 03:49:19.900]  might try and cop some kind of deal where he does actually name some of these quote high
[03:49:19.900 --> 03:49:27.020]  profile individuals although he could just as easily name some underlings and protect his rich
[03:49:27.020 --> 03:49:33.500]  friends of course we had bill clinton come out last night with a statement basically saying that
[03:49:34.140 --> 03:49:40.060]  he only appeared he only flew on the lelita express four times like that's not bad enough
[03:49:40.940 --> 03:49:47.340]  that he hadn't talked to epstein in 10 years that contradicts completely the flight logs which show
[03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:54.620]  that he was on the plane at least 26 times if not more we had a sex trafficking expert
[03:49:54.620 --> 03:50:00.940]  who appeared on fox news last night who basically said he was lying and culture came out and said
[03:50:00.940 --> 03:50:05.660]  that he thinks epstein had a state sponsor and was running a blackmailing operation
[03:50:06.860 --> 03:50:12.220]  she said epstein according to both the girls accounts wanted them to have sex with powerful men
[03:50:12.780 --> 03:50:17.340]  come back to him and report on it and of course he had cameras throughout the house so he was
[03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:23.260]  obviously trying to entrap some people so he could later blackmail them she went on to say quote it
[03:50:23.260 --> 03:50:29.180]  just seems to me something much bigger is behind this perhaps a state sponsor powerful enough people
[03:50:29.180 --> 03:50:34.220]  it just seems to me there's something very powerful force what's going on here and I'm nervous about
[03:50:34.220 --> 03:50:42.460]  this not coming to a conclusion there's also a battle taking place on wikipedia last time I checked
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:50.460]  it actually includes the deep intense connections between epstein and clinton yesterday for a time
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:57.100]  it didn't wikipedia editors battle to hide bill clinton's link to jeffrey epstein they had the
[03:50:57.100 --> 03:51:03.740]  link to donald trump of course trump said in 2002 basically came out with a quote that was
[03:51:03.740 --> 03:51:09.580]  praiseworthy towards epstein later reports suggested that as soon as trump discovered that
[03:51:09.580 --> 03:51:15.180]  epstein had tried to hit on a young girl that mara lago in florida he kicked him out and that's
[03:51:15.180 --> 03:51:21.020]  basically when he severed ties with him that information the trump quote from 2002 saying
[03:51:21.020 --> 03:51:28.300]  he's a quote terrific guy was on wikipedia yesterday or it was on two days before the
[03:51:28.300 --> 03:51:33.500]  clinton connection was removed they completely removed the fact that he was on the plane the
[03:51:33.500 --> 03:51:41.820]  lelita express with epstein the one with underage girls on it with beds on it 26 times it was removed
[03:51:41.820 --> 03:51:48.700]  from wikipedia last time i checked it's back on but again this just shows you wikipedia is not an
[03:51:48.700 --> 03:51:55.260]  impartial forum for information it's like when they say snopes.com is impartial no it isn't
[03:51:55.260 --> 03:52:03.660]  it's run by far left fringe activists wikipedia is mainly controlled by far left fringe activists
[03:52:03.660 --> 03:52:10.620]  who literally edit out reality and try to dictate reality they see conchita sonoff who was on fox
[03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:17.420]  news last night calling clinton a liar saying they had the flight logs from different pilots at
[03:52:17.420 --> 03:52:23.740]  different times with his name entered into the flight logs with the likes of kevin spacey that
[03:52:23.740 --> 03:52:30.540]  information was briefly wiped from wikipedia who will win the wikipedia battle to tell the truth
[03:52:30.540 --> 03:52:35.740]  about the high-profile clients that will link to jeffrey epstein we'll wait and see on that it's
[03:52:35.740 --> 03:52:42.860]  the back and forth thing meanwhile in europe danish history professor says it's time to build a wall
[03:52:42.860 --> 03:52:50.140]  around europe this is uffi ostegard who says the integration of migrants has failed and quote
[03:52:50.140 --> 03:52:56.700]  protecting borders is necessary otherwise the population will rebel against the government
[03:52:57.340 --> 03:53:03.420]  he said the time has come to build walls with wire fences in four lanes floodlights and guard posts
[03:53:03.420 --> 03:53:10.060]  he said ghettos are a good example of parallel societies that arise the integration has not
[03:53:10.060 --> 03:53:16.140]  failed for everyone but for relatively many people remember the mainstream media still to this day
[03:53:16.140 --> 03:53:21.900]  claims that no go islamic ghettos which are all over europe right now where if you send a film
[03:53:21.900 --> 03:53:27.500]  crew they'll attack you if you're a woman walking down the street they'll harass and accost you
[03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:33.740]  they still claim those don't exist here's a danish history professor who's a john monne
[03:53:33.740 --> 03:53:39.980]  professor of european civilization and integration the our house university this is no small fried
[03:53:40.540 --> 03:53:47.340]  he specializes in european identity history he studied multicultural and multi-ethnic states
[03:53:47.340 --> 03:53:52.780]  including ones that collapse such as austria hungary and the ottoman empire and their successor
[03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:57.260]  states you know was what he's talking about he's saying we need a wall around europe because
[03:53:57.260 --> 03:54:04.540]  integration has failed integration has failed no more obviously than in sweden where we have this
[03:54:04.540 --> 03:54:11.580]  headline video of migrant gang shoving gun in swedish boys mouthsters controversy we see these
[03:54:11.580 --> 03:54:21.020]  videos all the time swedes danes germans being bullied by migrant gang of gangs of youths humiliated
[03:54:21.020 --> 03:54:26.220]  in some cases tortured and they put it on video a video showing a gang of migrant youths bullying
[03:54:26.220 --> 03:54:32.780]  a swedish teenager by shoving a gun in his mouth and forcing him to dance has stirred controversy
[03:54:32.780 --> 03:54:38.380]  we know they're a migrant gang because they speak with heavy accents and they refer to the gun which
[03:54:38.380 --> 03:54:46.380]  they force this teen to kiss with a turkish name so their turkish migrants at least their parents
[03:54:46.380 --> 03:54:53.740]  are of turkish origin because they're referring to the gun with a turkish word the boy is clearly
[03:54:53.740 --> 03:54:58.700]  being humiliated for the pleasure of his tormentors the video was up video was uploaded to youtube
[03:54:58.700 --> 03:55:05.340]  but subsequently deleted swedes reacted to the video with a mixture of anger and dark humor
[03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:09.740]  one said the youngsters voices are still cracking and they are already running around with weapons
[03:55:09.740 --> 03:55:16.300]  and terrorizing the swedish people the future seems promising of course we've featured the
[03:55:16.300 --> 03:55:22.860]  surveys in the past done by major institutions and newspapers which routinely show that migrants
[03:55:22.860 --> 03:55:29.660]  in sweden are vastly overrepresented in prison population and in violent crime and rapes in
[03:55:29.660 --> 03:55:37.340]  sweden the problem is the government stopped cataloging statistics based on the identity of
[03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:44.060]  perpetrators of crime in relation to race and migrant background back in 2005 14 years ago
[03:55:44.060 --> 03:55:51.020]  because they said it was racist so now the swedish government refuses to collect crime stats on its
[03:55:51.020 --> 03:55:57.420]  own population because they're so terrified of that narrative which is backed up by all these
[03:55:57.420 --> 03:56:01.980]  different studies done by newspapers and other institutions that show that there is a huge
[03:56:01.980 --> 03:56:08.300]  problem with migrants not being integrated in sweden and committing violent crimes which of
[03:56:08.300 --> 03:56:18.380]  course was exacerbated after 2015 when they invited in 150,000 new refugees mainly from islamic
[03:56:18.380 --> 03:56:25.180]  countries and that's when you start to see when you start to saw the rape stats increase now I
[03:56:25.180 --> 03:56:30.060]  think it's a third of swedish women say they're afraid to go out at night and remember those
[03:56:30.060 --> 03:56:35.900]  are the ones who admit to it in a country where it's completely verboten to be critical of mass
[03:56:35.900 --> 03:56:41.420]  immigration so it's probably more like two-thirds we had the article the other day swedish author
[03:56:41.420 --> 03:56:48.620]  bjorn reynil said that the level of crime and violence is experiencing as sweden is experiencing
[03:56:48.620 --> 03:56:56.380]  amounts to what he called a small-scale war and much of it is migrant on migrant the gangs fighting
[03:56:56.380 --> 03:57:02.140]  each other but this always spills over to the rest of the population which is what you're seeing
[03:57:02.140 --> 03:57:09.500]  now in london where it's not just black on black gang on gang crime it's spilling over and innocent
[03:57:09.500 --> 03:57:15.580]  people are getting caught up in it and it's gotten so bad to the point where Somalian parents who have
[03:57:15.580 --> 03:57:22.380]  migrated to london are now saying that they're sending their kids home because it's safer in Somalia
[03:57:22.380 --> 03:57:27.740]  than it is in london because these kids get caught up in this lifestyle of violence and they can't
[03:57:27.740 --> 03:57:35.420]  get out of it absolutely frightening times but messity corn says that london is safer than ever
[03:57:36.060 --> 03:57:39.980]  i'm just going to wrap it up for the fourth hour coming out next war room with oan shroyer

[03:58:50.380 --> 03:58:54.620]  talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost
[03:58:54.620 --> 03:58:59.340]  nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to
[03:58:59.340 --> 03:59:04.060]  go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the
[03:59:04.060 --> 03:59:08.540]  public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[03:59:08.540 --> 03:59:12.220]  presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time
[03:59:12.220 --> 03:59:16.220]  to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're
