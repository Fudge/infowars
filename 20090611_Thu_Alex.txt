[00:50.200 --> 00:58.200]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[01:20.300 --> 01:21.800]  Alex Jones.
[01:28.800 --> 01:31.300]  Today is the day.
[01:39.600 --> 01:45.900]  Today is the day of the second annual Info Wars Money Bomb.
[01:45.900 --> 01:52.200]  And the website is infowars.com forward slash money bomb or infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:52.200 --> 01:55.200]  Both of those URLs will get you there.
[01:55.200 --> 02:04.500]  And I'll give you an update on the amount of money raised in the last few hours coming up after this quick break.
[02:04.500 --> 02:06.100]  But I want to introduce what's on the show.
[02:06.100 --> 02:12.100]  Obviously, this is a very important broadcast today, not really because of the money bomb.
[02:12.100 --> 02:25.000]  That pales in significance to the way the media is reporting on this deranged, no doubt out of his mind,
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  88-year-old, highly decorated World War II and Korean War veteran who went to the D.C. Holocaust Museum Memorial
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.800]  and shot up the building with a.22 rifle and killed a guard before being critically wounded by another one of the guards.
[02:43.800 --> 02:49.900]  I mean, you would think that an entire city was just wiped off the map.
[02:49.900 --> 02:57.700]  There's a lot more coverage of this one guard dying than there is of the 1,300,000 Iraqis that have died
[02:57.700 --> 03:04.600]  according to the British Medical Society Lancet.
[03:04.600 --> 03:05.900]  And that number is about a year old.
[03:05.900 --> 03:12.600]  It was 600,002 years in and 800,000 a few more years later.
[03:12.600 --> 03:18.300]  And then it's over 1.3 million.
[03:18.300 --> 03:23.200]  And I think every one of those Iraqis is just as valuable as the poor guard.
[03:23.200 --> 03:25.000]  By the way, these were not cowardly guards.
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.100]  Usually, even when it's police, when somebody comes in now, starts shooting up a school or a building, the guards run.
[03:33.100 --> 03:35.300]  These guards did not run.
[03:35.300 --> 03:40.400]  And that's why this deranged individual was not able to kill more people.
[03:40.400 --> 03:43.200]  So thank God for that.
[03:43.200 --> 03:51.900]  But what a present, what a gift to the ADL and the Southern Prairie Law Center openly trying to restrict free speech in the United States.
[03:51.900 --> 03:57.500]  What an enemy of free speech in America.
[03:57.500 --> 03:59.800]  This individual was that went and did this.
[03:59.800 --> 04:05.900]  What a fool.
[04:05.900 --> 04:19.300]  I mean, if he supposedly hated Jews and Israel so much, that deluded, moronic, delusional,
[04:19.300 --> 04:27.100]  probably, you know, some form of Alzheimer's, obviously unstable, obviously crazy.
[04:27.100 --> 04:32.100]  Back in 1981, when he ran in with fake dynamite and tried to take over a fellow reserve building.
[04:32.100 --> 04:43.100]  I mean, he had the strategy of a, I don't know, a mindless jellyfish or something.
[04:43.100 --> 04:44.600]  I know, strategy isn't a word.
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.600]  Folks, it's a joke.
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  That's the point.
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.900]  That's the, that's the joke.
[04:52.900 --> 04:57.500]  So I don't even know what to say anymore.
[04:57.500 --> 04:59.800]  It's just incredible.
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.200]  Obviously, Glenn Beck has finally engaged in the last straw for everybody.
[05:04.200 --> 05:05.900]  Now it's obvious to everyone.
[05:05.900 --> 05:07.300]  Everyone's apologizing.
[05:07.300 --> 05:11.000]  Hundreds of emails apologizing to me right now.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.300]  It was just three months ago that I said, this guy's a government operative, CIA probably.
[05:17.300 --> 05:19.600]  Everything he's doing is to set up patriots.
[05:19.600 --> 05:27.300]  They're going to stage attacks with your mind control or mental institution individuals on Jews.
[05:27.300 --> 05:30.700]  And they're going to blame it on 9-11 truthers.
[05:30.700 --> 05:34.100]  And they're going to claim 9-11 truth with al-Qaeda.
[05:34.100 --> 05:39.100]  Well, exactly what I told you is now happening and more is going to happen.
[05:39.100 --> 05:41.900]  And I'm going to break it all down.
[05:41.900 --> 05:45.300]  We get back and then get into a bunch of news on the economy.
[05:45.300 --> 05:49.400]  U.S. government seeks to rein in executive pay across the United States.
[05:49.400 --> 05:53.700]  World Health Organization declares first 21st century flu pandemic.
[05:53.700 --> 05:59.000]  We told you they secretly did that a month and a half ago, but I don't know, you always hear it first.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.400]  We hit the bar bar.
[06:00.400 --> 06:09.400]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[06:09.400 --> 06:14.700]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[06:14.700 --> 06:19.800]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
[06:19.800 --> 06:28.900]  Go to AmericanSuperFoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[07:00.600 --> 07:05.300]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[07:05.300 --> 07:10.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.100]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[07:13.100 --> 07:15.900]  Both their objective being world domination.
[07:15.900 --> 07:18.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[07:18.900 --> 07:29.400]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[07:29.400 --> 07:34.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[07:34.800 --> 07:38.700]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[07:38.700 --> 07:41.200]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[07:41.200 --> 07:44.500]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[07:44.500 --> 07:46.500]  They're after power. That's their after-easy.

[07:55.200 --> 07:59.900]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[07:59.900 --> 08:04.400]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[08:04.400 --> 08:07.000]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.300]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[08:12.300 --> 08:16.700]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[08:16.700 --> 08:22.800]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[08:22.800 --> 08:25.500]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[08:25.500 --> 08:29.100]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[08:29.100 --> 08:35.500]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[08:35.500 --> 08:41.600]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.200]  that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.300]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[08:50.300 --> 08:53.200]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.000]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.600]  Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[09:00.600 --> 09:25.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[09:25.000 --> 09:37.000]  James von Brun, 88, according to USA Today, is a highly decorated World War II veteran and Korean War veteran.
[09:37.000 --> 09:47.800]  And so according to Glenn Beck's logic, this is a man who is praised by all veterans and World War II veterans.
[09:47.800 --> 10:01.400]  All Korean War veterans, all World War II veterans, according to Glenn Beck, love and praise and honor and support.
[10:01.400 --> 10:13.100]  James von Brun going in and shooting and killing a security guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.
[10:13.100 --> 10:21.700]  Now, that of course is completely, absolutely ridiculous, but that is the level of propaganda Glenn Beck engages in.
[10:21.700 --> 10:30.500]  For those that don't know, Glenn Beck has come out and said that von Brun was a hero of 9-11 truth groups.
[10:30.500 --> 10:32.600]  And he said, it's an initial report.
[10:32.600 --> 10:33.400]  Now, we can't prove it.
[10:33.400 --> 10:43.000]  We don't know if it's true, but there's an initial report that he was admired, supported, loved.
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.400]  Praised by 9-11 truth and then gives no source.
[10:52.400 --> 11:03.600]  Well, the source is the Southern Prairie Law Center, as usual, and they went out under many handles that he supposedly used.
[11:03.600 --> 11:11.000]  And if it's them staging it and they've been caught staging activities with McVeigh and the Elohim City white supremacist compound,
[11:11.000 --> 11:20.600]  FBI declassified documents, associated presses reported on it, as well as both newspapers in Salt Lake City.
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.900]  That's where the federal court case was held and the documents ordered released.
[11:24.900 --> 11:30.000]  They commanded the organization, just like the FBI has been caught commanding the organization,
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.700]  cooking the bomb, training the driver with a 93 World Trade Center attack,
[11:33.700 --> 11:41.400]  just like they've been caught hundreds of times running, creating, commanding.
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.100]  Violent white supremacist, violent Ku Klux Klan in Dallas, Texas Monthly on that.
[11:47.100 --> 11:54.200]  Black Christian identity, blacks who believe they're the God race, and they always call them Muslims for the news.
[11:54.200 --> 12:03.400]  They can't find black Muslims to go out and do anything violent, so they always find radical street kids in Miami, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio.
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.900]  It's just over and over again. It's the same MO, and it's now admitted the feds create the groups.
[12:08.900 --> 12:15.100]  You know, mainstream media admits it's totally staged. The last one two weeks ago, hundreds of headlines.
[12:15.100 --> 12:20.500]  Literally, I'm guessing hundreds. I saw probably 30, 40 headlines in the Washington Post and everywhere going,
[12:20.500 --> 12:28.600]  oh, yeah, it was staged. The FBI caught staging it because, I mean, they're caught red-handed.
[12:28.600 --> 12:35.300]  They can't, in the Texas Monthly case, in 1998, one of the first big ones where it was totally confirmed,
[12:35.300 --> 12:41.400]  the FBI went out for years and couldn't find a Klan group.
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.000]  Two-stage attacks. So they created one in the FBI in format of 20-plus years,
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.200]  who'd created other groups and set them up decades before.
[12:50.200 --> 12:56.700]  He went out and found light trash, and these people were described in the article as totally drunk,
[12:56.700 --> 13:03.300]  on welfare, wouldn't even get out of bed many days, no teeth, dentures at 45.
[13:03.300 --> 13:09.600]  I'm not attacking you, have dentures at 45. The point is, no teeth, literally toothless, alcoholics,
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.200]  and it took a guy two years in him giving them hundreds of thousands of dollars that they would drink on liquor and gambling
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.400]  to just say, he'd say, okay, here's 50,000 more. Just say you're going to take over the Capitol, the White House, with me, and kill everybody.
[13:21.400 --> 13:24.600]  And they'd go, give me the money because, you know, these are the transcripts from the tapes.
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.500]  Give me the money. Yes, I'll say it.
[13:27.500 --> 13:33.600]  And then the headline was, Army of White Supremacists Planning to Destroy U.S. Tens of Thousand Sleeper Cells.
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.300]  It turned out it was two husbands and two of their wives totally staged.
[13:37.300 --> 13:40.700]  And it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[13:40.700 --> 13:45.400]  Now, do I think Von Brun was one of these?
[13:45.400 --> 13:48.800]  Yes, I believe it was staged.
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.000]  And in a few weeks to a few months, it will come out.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.600]  He'll probably, he may end up dying in the hospital, but I'm sure they don't want to trial.
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.300]  They may throw him in one of these new terror camps they've built in the U.S.
[13:59.300 --> 14:01.400]  They've gotten Wyoming and Montana.
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.700]  They admit the new Camp X-rays in the U.S.
[14:05.700 --> 14:08.500]  That U.S. citizens are in.
[14:08.500 --> 14:09.700]  You'll never hear from him again.
[14:09.700 --> 14:14.900]  But the point is, down the road in lawsuits, down the road investigations,
[14:14.900 --> 14:22.900]  it always comes out that he's going to have federal handlers who at least jabbed him into doing this.
[14:22.900 --> 14:29.000]  I mean, this was real effective what he did in 81.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.300]  Real effective.
[14:31.300 --> 14:41.000]  How he goes into a Federal Reserve office, gets past the guard, threatens him with a revolver,
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.600]  says he has dynamite and the guard takes the weapon and nothing happens and gets five years in prison.
[14:51.600 --> 14:57.200]  Vaughn Brune, probably staged.
[14:57.200 --> 14:59.200]  If not, he's a complete mental patient.
[14:59.200 --> 15:04.200]  I mean, there's no doubting that.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.500]  And as the Federal Reserve clearly takes over society, as the country implodes,
[15:08.500 --> 15:13.600]  you're going to have people having their kids taken by CPS, people having their farms and ranches taken by the government,
[15:13.600 --> 15:14.700]  people having their homes taken.
[15:14.700 --> 15:16.600]  There's going to be more cops getting killed.
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.700]  There's going to be shootouts everywhere, folks.
[15:18.700 --> 15:22.100]  We've been telling you a long time it's coming. The feds have been planning for it.
[15:22.100 --> 15:26.000]  And they plan to get the police and military all hyped up and use them against the people.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  And then more of the people are going to fight back and then more police and military are going to die and it's going to escalate.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.800]  And then the collapse of society is going to be blamed on the American people not going quietly into the dark.
[15:38.800 --> 15:44.300]  And then the yuppies will accept the police state and get behind it and put on uniforms and enjoy the oppression.
[15:44.300 --> 15:48.300]  And then it's going to become an even hotter war.
[15:48.300 --> 15:53.000]  And then globalists don't care. They'll sit offshore like they did when they were killing a million-plus people in Iraq.
[15:53.000 --> 16:01.100]  They'll sit offshore over a four, five, ten-year civil war and then come in once everybody's sick of the police state
[16:01.100 --> 16:09.000]  and just domesticate everybody and set up a control grid and the forced inoculations and all the rest of it.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.400]  Now, that's one possible future they're going down.
[16:11.400 --> 16:18.500]  They've got a lot of different programs going all in the same direction and combinations of those programs.
[16:18.500 --> 16:26.500]  But they're going to focus in on the white supremacist, on the nuts, on the loons,
[16:26.500 --> 16:30.800]  and not on the people fighting back when their farms and ranches are being taken and they're gunned down.
[16:30.800 --> 16:39.600]  And they're going to associate anybody that doesn't hand everything over to the offshore banks as a white supremacist.
[16:39.600 --> 16:49.800]  And as I talk about this, just hundreds of cases flood my memory of how they do this, how they operate,
[16:49.800 --> 16:56.400]  what the establishment is going to be doing.
[16:56.400 --> 16:59.700]  Listen to me very carefully.
[16:59.700 --> 17:08.400]  I remember analyzing for hour after hour, week after week, month after month, year after year of the Oklahoma City bombing,
[17:08.400 --> 17:19.000]  my first film less than two years after the bombing, America Destroyed by Design, covers Oklahoma City.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.500]  I interviewed the grand jurors.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.200]  I interviewed the grand jury foreman.
[17:22.200 --> 17:24.600]  I interviewed the police.
[17:24.600 --> 17:26.000]  I interviewed the medical workers.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.500]  I interviewed state police.
[17:27.500 --> 17:29.700]  I interviewed investigators over the years.
[17:29.700 --> 17:33.700]  You've heard them hundreds.
[17:33.700 --> 17:41.600]  FBI agents went on record and said there was an Arab with him and the name even came out on local news, Al Hussain Hussain.
[17:41.600 --> 17:48.700]  It turned out the state police were following them, aware of what they were doing, even arrested some and were told to stand down national security.
[17:48.700 --> 17:51.600]  These men worked for the U.S. government.
[17:51.600 --> 17:57.100]  McVeigh and federal affidavits and federal documents and declassified documents.
[17:57.100 --> 18:13.900]  It is admitted that McVeigh said he was carrying out a secret operation with the Special Forces Command out of Fort Benning, Georgia.
[18:13.900 --> 18:21.900]  He was assigned to Black Ops at some level above Delta.
[18:21.900 --> 18:27.500]  He was videotaped, of course, and photographed at bases years after he was supposedly out of the military.
[18:27.500 --> 18:41.000]  He was assigned, after being heavily decorated in Desert Storm, to units inside the United States that he believed, at first, that he was with former Iraqi Republican guard
[18:41.000 --> 18:49.900]  trained by the U.S., funded by the U.S. during the Iran-Iraq War, when Saddam was the United States' Anglo-American establishment's man against the Iranians.
[18:49.900 --> 18:56.500]  3,400 were brought here by George Bush Sr. at the end of the Gulf War.
[18:56.500 --> 19:00.100]  2,000 more were brought in by Bill Clinton.
[19:00.100 --> 19:07.900]  They are strategic terror teams in every major U.S. city.
[19:07.900 --> 19:16.200]  At least 5,000 Iraqi Special Forces.
[19:16.200 --> 19:24.700]  They engage in narcotics trafficking, they engage in CIA Black Ops, and they are ready, they are willing, and they are able.
[19:24.700 --> 19:33.300]  They are blackmailed, their families are under globalist control and witness protection program-type reservations.
[19:33.300 --> 19:44.600]  They are compensated lavishly with over a million dollars a year apiece, and they are standing by to attack every U.S. city.
[19:44.600 --> 19:47.000]  At that point, the media will bring out the news story.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  I've been telling you this for at least 10 years.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.900]  I've understood their attack profile.
[19:50.900 --> 19:53.800]  I'm on record.
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.000]  They are standing by to attack every U.S. city.
[19:56.000 --> 20:05.300]  At that point, whether they attack a few cities or every city, they have different battle plans, they will even have a few patsies they've got set up from within the ranks.
[20:05.300 --> 20:06.100]  And these guys know it.
[20:06.100 --> 20:13.500]  They don't have a choice to then be trotted out with militia members and white supremacists.
[20:13.500 --> 20:17.000]  And that will be the headline that America is being hit by white al-Qaeda.
[20:17.000 --> 20:32.700]  Now, I told you at least five years ago, specifically, that when they start announcing white al-Qaeda, and they're going to say mainly veterans, a lot of these will be veterans who are part of these programs.
[20:32.700 --> 20:41.100]  When they start announcing that, when they start saying veterans are working with al-Qaeda, white supremacists and militia, that that was when they were getting ready for this.
[20:41.100 --> 20:45.200]  Now you've seen them follow that exact script.
[20:45.200 --> 20:46.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're getting information here.
[20:46.900 --> 20:47.800]  You're not going to get anywhere else.
[20:47.800 --> 20:50.400]  I'm risking my life to bring you this information.
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.100]  This is the attack profile.
[20:53.100 --> 20:56.300]  This is one of their major attack profiles by exposing them.
[20:56.300 --> 20:58.300]  You may be able to back them off.
[20:58.300 --> 20:59.700]  I'll continue to break it down.
[20:59.700 --> 21:00.400]  Stay with us.
[21:00.400 --> 21:02.800]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[21:02.800 --> 21:12.200]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[21:12.200 --> 21:20.300]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.

[21:29.700 --> 21:34.700]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.

[21:39.600 --> 21:48.700]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.

[22:00.900 --> 22:06.800]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[22:06.800 --> 22:14.300]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[22:14.300 --> 22:20.900]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[22:20.900 --> 22:25.400]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[22:25.400 --> 22:36.900]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[22:36.900 --> 22:40.500]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[22:40.500 --> 22:47.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[22:47.400 --> 23:00.100]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[23:00.100 --> 23:05.600]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from INUS Resources. June 11, 2009. Gold opened this morning at 9.4530.
[23:05.600 --> 23:16.400]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 9.72.37, 4.86.18 for a half ounce and 2.4309 for a quarter ounce. That's 9.72.37, 4.86.18 and 2.4309.
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.400]  Failout equals market distortions, increase money supply while productivity is going down.
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.700]  Walls readers receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[23:24.700 --> 23:29.400]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends.
[23:29.400 --> 23:35.000]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.300]  Fiat currencies values based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[23:38.300 --> 23:42.100]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust and confidence?
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.200]  Or is it time to ensure your hard earned wealth?
[23:44.200 --> 23:49.600]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.

[25:08.800 --> 25:16.800]  There are 5,000 Iraqi Republican guards CIA trained trained in the 1980s at U.S. military bases.
[25:16.800 --> 25:25.800]  The Washington Post reported in 1999 about giant Islamic terror training centers in the U.S. at U.S. military bases.
[25:25.800 --> 25:31.800]  Were they trained jihadists to go overthrow governments in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa?
[25:31.800 --> 25:34.800]  Were they trained the Muslims to attack the Serbs?
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.800]  Radical Islam is the mind control slaves the new order needs.
[25:39.800 --> 25:43.800]  They are people that will do what they're told and carry out what they're told.
[25:43.800 --> 25:47.800]  Now that's one separate group at bases. These Iraqis aren't radical Muslims.
[25:47.800 --> 25:53.800]  These are intelligence operatives who lived under Saddam and know you follow orders or you die.
[25:53.800 --> 25:56.800]  And they fully understand like drawing straws.
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.800]  Okay, there's 5,000 of us. We stage the terror attacks if we're ordered to.
[26:01.800 --> 26:05.800]  We do what we're told and they will burn a small number of us.
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.800]  That's why they're perfect operatives from working under Saddam.
[26:09.800 --> 26:16.800]  That's why the CIA hired Saddam when he was 18 years of age training for four years in Cairo as an assassin and black ops.
[26:16.800 --> 26:20.800]  That's a Washington Post LA Times Associated Press. That's a fact.
[26:20.800 --> 26:23.800]  That's why they sent him in to assassinate Iraqi leaders.
[26:23.800 --> 26:29.800]  Then the government made a deal to make him head of security, the real head of the government with the CIA.
[26:29.800 --> 26:39.800]  In that was 69 and he was made. Got to pull the history up.
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.800]  He was made head of security later and then he had the coup in 79, but this is how they roll.
[26:44.800 --> 26:54.800]  And so these are hardcore killers and they're in every city and they are ready to stage the attacks.
[26:54.800 --> 27:02.800]  And road to tyranny covers this road to tyranny made in early 2002.
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.800]  I put an emergency release out called road to tyranny two weeks after 9 11.
[27:08.800 --> 27:15.800]  But then I made the official film in the next few months and put it out.
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.800]  And you know your average person in the CIA, your average person in the FBI, your average person in the military,
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.800]  your average person in the government, you need to listen to me carefully.
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.800]  What I've told you is the truth and it's all verifiable.
[27:30.800 --> 27:33.800]  And this is going to destroy your family's future and my family's future.
[27:33.800 --> 27:41.800]  And there's no reason we need to let offshore banks through intelligence agencies engage in these type of very wicked tricks.
[27:41.800 --> 27:44.800]  This is how the Republic falls.
[27:44.800 --> 27:51.800]  And it doesn't fall into just some boss hog corruption. It falls into high tech slavery.
[27:51.800 --> 27:54.800]  Now you can rationalize and make excuses and lie to yourselves.
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.800]  But deep down, you know, I'm telling you the truth.
[27:56.800 --> 28:06.800]  Most of you've seen the evidence or you could decide to do whatever you can quietly at least to not go along with this.
[28:06.800 --> 28:16.800]  Not only did I lay this out 10 years ago and then in specific details since 2002, I guess that's six, seven years ago.
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.800]  Over and over again on radio show after radio show after radio show.
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.800]  I am on record. In fact, I hope listeners will go dredge it up and edit it together with us.
[28:27.800 --> 28:40.800]  And all the clips then of the media, as I said in the last two years on Fox, on CNN, on MSNBC, on CNBC, on Geraldo and on Glenn Beck and on O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.
[28:40.800 --> 28:51.800]  Everywhere saying when there had never been one incident, they all looked at the camera word for word off a script and they admit the White House gives them these scripts.
[28:51.800 --> 29:01.800]  Word for word with current and former CIA operatives on the shows every time they do this when they're on the show with the CIA.
[29:01.800 --> 29:03.800]  This happened yesterday with Beck.
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.800]  And they say, mark my words, 9-11 truth is working with Al Qaeda.
[29:08.800 --> 29:10.800]  They're going to kill the American people.
[29:10.800 --> 29:12.800]  They're working with light supremacist.
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.800]  We need to use the army against them.
[29:15.800 --> 29:17.800]  They need to be tased.
[29:17.800 --> 29:19.800]  They need to be taken to a secret camp.
[29:19.800 --> 29:21.800]  It's all in my film.
[29:21.800 --> 29:22.800]  Truth rising.
[29:22.800 --> 29:28.800]  We show how they're coming after us, how they're setting us up, how the police come up and say, even on the streets of New York, they have the script.
[29:28.800 --> 29:30.800]  We're going to say you're terrorist.
[29:30.800 --> 29:31.800]  We know you're not terrorist.
[29:31.800 --> 29:37.800]  But if you don't stop protesting here on the street corner, we're going to say your camera's a gun, your backpack's a bomb.
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.800]  And they grab the camera and said, this is a gun on video in uniform.
[29:41.800 --> 29:48.800]  The standard thing they're taught is that we are Al Qaeda.
[29:48.800 --> 29:50.800]  And that they are going to frame us.
[29:50.800 --> 29:51.800]  You understand?
[29:51.800 --> 29:53.800]  It's not just that I foresaw their operation.
[29:53.800 --> 29:59.800]  We now have seen it manifest openly.
[29:59.800 --> 30:01.800]  And let me be honest with you, folks.
[30:01.800 --> 30:05.800]  My discernment as I gain more and more knowledge is accelerating exponentially.
[30:05.800 --> 30:08.800]  And I just can't believe what we're going into.
[30:08.800 --> 30:13.800]  And I now see where this road leads me, but I'm committed more than ever.
[30:13.800 --> 30:25.800]  And I just want you to know I've done everything I've done because I love humanity and I love decency and I love honor and I love innocence.
[30:25.800 --> 30:27.800]  When we get back, I'll continue to break down and go over back.
[30:27.800 --> 30:28.800]  And he's just one example.
[30:28.800 --> 30:31.800]  It's on every channel.
[30:31.800 --> 30:41.800]  As he sits there surrounded by CIA operatives on TV, and I looked into the eyes of one CIA operative, and he doesn't like what he's doing.
[30:41.800 --> 30:45.800]  It's like Judas Iscariot.
[30:45.800 --> 30:47.800]  You know, it's not too late for you to turn around.
[30:47.800 --> 30:50.800]  But for Beck, it is.
[30:50.800 --> 30:52.800]  We're on the march.
[30:52.800 --> 30:54.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[30:54.800 --> 31:00.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[31:00.800 --> 31:06.800]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[31:06.800 --> 31:11.800]  Health Botanicals, this company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.800]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[31:13.800 --> 31:20.800]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his Editor's Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009.
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.800]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners.
[31:25.800 --> 31:30.800]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[31:30.800 --> 31:33.800]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[31:33.800 --> 31:39.800]  In the Nutra Cafe, they're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[31:39.800 --> 31:41.800]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[31:41.800 --> 31:44.800]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[31:44.800 --> 31:46.800]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[32:00.800 --> 32:06.800]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[32:06.800 --> 32:12.800]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[32:12.800 --> 32:19.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[32:19.800 --> 32:21.800]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[32:21.800 --> 32:23.800]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[32:23.800 --> 32:35.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.800]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[32:40.800 --> 32:47.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[34:30.800 --> 34:32.800]  Well, well.

[34:40.800 --> 34:42.800]  Come on.
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.800]  It's on a train.
[34:44.800 --> 34:46.800]  Come on.
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.800]  We are back live. Thank you for joining us today.
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.800]  All right. I'm going to break this down as quickly and succinctly as I can now to get into all the other news.
[34:56.800 --> 34:58.800]  Glenn Beck's outrageous lie.
[34:58.800 --> 35:04.800]  Racist Von Brun is hero of 9-11 Truthers. That's a quote.
[35:04.800 --> 35:12.800]  Unbelievable. That's like saying that all World War II vets and Korean War vets are fans of Von Brun.
[35:12.800 --> 35:21.800]  Because we're not even confirmed this because he went online and signed a petition to investigate 9-11,
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.800]  which 84% of Americans in a New York Times poll said they believed needs to be investigated and that they're being lied to by the government.
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.800]  So 82% of Americans believe Von Brun is a hero.
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.800]  That's a complete lie.
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.800]  I guarantee you Von Brun watched Fox TV because he wrote on message boards about it.
[35:42.800 --> 35:47.800]  Oh, I guess Von Brun was a, I guess Glenn Beck's the supporter of Von Brun.
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.800]  This is the type of just unbelievable propaganda he engaged in.
[35:52.800 --> 35:56.800]  We're going to play this clip and break it down.
[35:56.800 --> 36:07.800]  Then I told you before we were even at a level five that we were really at a level six because I got from the state of Texas Health Department
[36:07.800 --> 36:14.800]  documents that we posted with the names of doctors and phone numbers and they were saying we were really at a level six.
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.800]  And the media and everybody said, Alex is lying. They're not really at level six.
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.800]  Well, I told you they were and now they admit they were NR.
[36:25.800 --> 36:34.800]  So she had to press who swine flu pandemic has begun first in 41 years, level six.
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.800]  There you go. Right again.
[36:38.800 --> 36:40.800]  And again, I'm not here going, I'm right. I'm right.
[36:40.800 --> 36:42.800]  The point is we know what's going on, folks.
[36:42.800 --> 36:44.800]  We've got our ear to the ground.
[36:44.800 --> 36:46.800]  We've got millions of people out there listening.
[36:46.800 --> 36:49.800]  We got contacts. We fair it through it.
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.800]  You know, we get a government document. We call the phone number on it.
[36:53.800 --> 36:55.800]  We call information.
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.800]  We check the phone number online, make sure it's a government building we're calling.
[36:58.800 --> 37:01.800]  I mean, and then it's confirmed.
[37:01.800 --> 37:08.800]  It's like the VFW is being told to categorize all their firearms and even 150 year old cannons.
[37:08.800 --> 37:11.800]  So the BATF can come confiscate them if they want.
[37:11.800 --> 37:13.800]  We report that and people don't believe it.
[37:13.800 --> 37:16.800]  Now it's admitted mainstream news today.
[37:16.800 --> 37:19.800]  And we don't make any of this stuff up.
[37:19.800 --> 37:21.800]  So that's coming up.
[37:21.800 --> 37:23.800]  Government to seek to rein in executive pay.
[37:23.800 --> 37:29.800]  We're not going to have it where all the money goes offshore and even the minions of the bankers don't get that much money.
[37:29.800 --> 37:32.800]  World Health Organization declares first 21st century flu pandemic.
[37:32.800 --> 37:35.800]  And I already mentioned that.
[37:35.800 --> 37:37.800]  Got a bunch of other news I'm going to be going to.
[37:37.800 --> 37:39.800]  And we do have Lou Rockwell on today.
[37:39.800 --> 37:41.800]  He was on when Burma is filled in a few weeks ago.
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.800]  And I want to talk to him about what's happening with HR 1207.
[37:46.800 --> 37:53.800]  What's happening with the 212 sponsors now today, by the way.
[37:53.800 --> 37:55.800]  Sydney Sheehan is going to be in studio.
[37:55.800 --> 37:57.800]  That's always interesting and informative.
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.800]  I'm gonna rock H Obama, the betrayer and the 2 party systems.
[38:01.800 --> 38:03.800]  She calls the twins.
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.800]  I twins a twin, but you can still dress them up in different outfits.
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.800]  Oh, look, this trend, you know, this little twins in a fake right wing leader, Hozen.
[38:13.800 --> 38:20.800]  This little twins in a fake liberal to two still twins still the same DNA same creature.
[38:20.800 --> 38:29.080]  Basically, a few slight differences.
[38:29.080 --> 38:30.080]  So that's coming up.
[38:30.080 --> 38:33.920]  Let me just try to succinctly right now because I go off into all the evidence and history
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.320]  and kind of go into the whole paradigm of information and how governments operate with
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.480]  problem-reaction solution.
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.400]  Let me just boil this down simply and succinctly.
[38:45.400 --> 38:53.640]  These throughout history stage terror attacks as a pretext to take their indigenous populations,
[38:53.640 --> 38:56.040]  liberties, and freedoms and attacks them and control them.
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.640]  They'll say, oh, we're only taking everybody's rights to fight this evil group, but it's
[38:59.640 --> 39:06.120]  normally a minority because instinctively the Germans or the Russians or the American
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.280]  people, the Native Americans, they will buy into it because instinctively we're tribal
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.000]  and we're designed that when the war chief says we're going to oppress that neighbor or
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.960]  take that neighbor's land, besides they attacked us so we have an excuse to do it, people will
[39:20.960 --> 39:26.720]  then get in line and get behind it and dehumanize the enemy.
[39:26.720 --> 39:32.880]  And the argument by the sociologist and the planners at the global level is nature's hard
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.480]  and so what if we don't dominate and enslave our neighbors, they'll dominate and enslave
[39:36.480 --> 39:47.600]  us and hence all the problems in the world are caused.
[39:47.600 --> 39:53.360]  But my ancestors were usurpers and your ancestors were usurpers, I don't care if you're black,
[39:53.360 --> 39:56.880]  white, Native American, you don't think Native Americans weren't always usurping each other
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.400]  in the neighboring tribe?
[40:00.400 --> 40:08.240]  This is the nature of man and the founders truly took us in a new direction in 1775 when
[40:08.240 --> 40:13.400]  they said we must tie up the tidal forces of avarice and greed and tribal aggression
[40:13.400 --> 40:19.520]  of humans and put it into a republic and divide the powers against each other to create a
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.920]  safe zone for individual liberty to grow because the individual is always oppressed by the
[40:24.920 --> 40:33.760]  dominant wars of the elites and they're seeking for greater power so we tie the powers and
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.200]  set the powers balanced against each other and have a rule of law for the average person
[40:39.200 --> 40:46.600]  so that ideas and art and literature can rise and have a true final flowering of the last
[40:46.600 --> 40:56.880]  renaissance and that is the system and it is not perfect in that man is not perfect
[40:56.880 --> 41:04.720]  but it advances towards a perfect design, a perfect model.
[41:04.720 --> 41:14.640]  It is truly divinely inspired, it was Providence, I've read the great philosophers, the great
[41:14.640 --> 41:21.960]  literature and I will tell you that the great great philosophers held not a candle to many
[41:21.960 --> 41:24.440]  of the philosophers of the founding of this nation.
[41:24.440 --> 41:35.400]  These were mighty men of true intellectual strength.
[41:35.400 --> 41:40.640]  The way they would turn down power and even kingship, few can do that because when you're
[41:40.640 --> 41:44.560]  offered the kingship you think well I'm good you know I'll do this for everybody's better
[41:44.560 --> 41:45.560]  man.
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.400]  I'll have a strong hand to make sure that everybody's taken care of but it always leads
[41:50.400 --> 41:56.320]  even if you have a good king to his rotten son or his son's rotten son or his son's
[41:56.320 --> 42:02.920]  rotten daughter getting into control and the court sycophants that develop around that
[42:02.920 --> 42:08.680]  basic human psychology we must embrace the founding fathers but not just the constitution
[42:08.680 --> 42:17.000]  bill of rights that is tainted because of the arguments of lesser men and politics to
[42:17.000 --> 42:26.120]  come to an agreement but the writings of the founders, the discussions, the debates, Thomas
[42:26.120 --> 42:39.840]  Jefferson, John Adams, Sam Adams, Patrick Henry, Payne, George Washington, all of them
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.000]  you get a different view a different idea but of the same spirit like the same light
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.040]  shining through a slightly different colored stained glass window, works of art and honor
[42:52.040 --> 43:00.920]  and strength and will, I said I'd make it simple but freedom is not simple, ideas are
[43:00.920 --> 43:07.600]  not simple, true ideas, true deep ideas are indescribable in an hour or a month or a year,
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.400]  it must be learned, it must be felt, it must be lived, it must be experienced, that's why
[43:15.400 --> 43:20.400]  to have true knowledge you need to be older, that's why even if you're very intelligent
[43:20.400 --> 43:30.440]  and cunning you have to develop the experiences in life to truly become knowledgeable.
[43:30.440 --> 43:38.600]  And as one begins to gain knowledge one begins to see how little they truly know as the world
[43:38.600 --> 43:46.800]  like a trillion kaleidoscopes in all its beauty and horror and majesty spins and wheels around
[43:46.800 --> 43:57.920]  us in infinite possibilities.
[43:57.920 --> 44:04.320]  Now I will simplify, foreign offshore banks wish to conquer the United States and fully
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.480]  conquer Europe and the rest of the planet.
[44:06.480 --> 44:11.880]  They financially control almost every nation on the world but a handful of quote rogue nations
[44:11.880 --> 44:15.840]  that do not have private global essential banks over them.
[44:15.840 --> 44:21.480]  They are bankrupting us by design, they have staged repeated terror attacks in the last
[44:21.480 --> 44:29.640]  30 years and provocateur other attacks to create a paramilitary slash intelligence oppression
[44:29.640 --> 44:38.600]  system in the United States nexused into world law, guilty until proven innocent in a surveillance
[44:38.600 --> 44:48.400]  worldwide casual society grid, a technological enslavement panopticon.
[44:48.400 --> 44:55.920]  They have elicited Iraqi intelligent agents who are CIA operatives to stage terror attacks
[44:55.920 --> 45:03.160]  and blame it on foreign Middle Eastern nations and claim a nexus between militias and then
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.600]  white supremacists thus demonizing militias.
[45:07.600 --> 45:12.800]  The entire Homeland Security apparatus has been built since the early 1990s when Bill
[45:12.800 --> 45:16.880]  Clinton called it Homeland Security and when it was set up at Northcom, that's on record,
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.840]  it was not set up in 2002, 2003.
[45:21.840 --> 45:26.320]  They have built it and designed it and trained the police and military and you're all listening,
[45:26.320 --> 45:33.480]  you know this is true, those of you in this, that veterans and gun owners and conservatives
[45:33.480 --> 45:38.600]  and libertarians and anti-federal reserve people as the Mayak reports all over the country
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.280]  not just in Missouri, I told you that was a state copy of a federal report and a month
[45:43.280 --> 45:46.320]  later the federal master report came out.
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.360]  I'd already seen many versions of that and we'd publish them in the past and it wouldn't
[45:50.360 --> 45:51.520]  get attention.
[45:51.520 --> 45:56.240]  We got big enough because of you taking action to break through the matrix wall and punch
[45:56.240 --> 46:00.120]  it into the mainstream.
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.880]  But just because we blew through the enemy's armor in the Info War didn't mean the shell
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.880]  exploded properly on the inside and only damaged the enemy.
[46:08.880 --> 46:14.760]  We're trying to warn the people this whole apparatus has been set up for you.
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.720]  The business owner, the land owner, the good person, the person that raises their children
[46:18.720 --> 46:25.720]  lovingly, the homeschooler, you are the target and you are in the documents.
[46:25.720 --> 46:29.200]  Now notice those documents talk about people that don't like the federal reserve and how
[46:29.200 --> 46:34.560]  the Army was spying on Ron Paul in Houston last year and on me last year that's in Obama
[46:34.560 --> 46:37.880]  deception in Dallas.
[46:37.880 --> 46:42.320]  The Army saying don't identify yourself as Army personnel, the terrorists may try to
[46:42.320 --> 46:45.280]  kill you.
[46:45.280 --> 46:53.040]  They won't give me my FBI file, ladies and gentlemen, they declare national security.
[46:53.040 --> 46:56.560]  The only reason I'm still alive is because I don't go out a lot and do a lot of it because
[46:56.560 --> 47:07.360]  I'm a somewhat moral person, according to new order standards, extremely moral, monk-like
[47:07.360 --> 47:22.720]  in that I am dedicated, I am clean, believe me, they've tried.
[47:22.720 --> 47:29.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are going to stage terror attacks in this country and mass shootings.
[47:29.800 --> 47:35.880]  In fact, I predicted months ago that it was going to be mass shootings tied to anti-federal
[47:35.880 --> 47:37.320]  reserve groups.
[47:37.320 --> 47:43.640]  Notice this happened right when the Federal Reserve has 212 sponsors against it and CBS
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.640]  News, in fact, I forgot to print this, print me CBS News, we link to it up on, there's a
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.200]  video clip too, up on theprisonplanet.com, Steve Watson did, CBS News, Fed says audit
[47:53.200 --> 47:57.360]  will destroy Federal Reserve, which is true, but they're saying you can't audit us, it
[47:57.360 --> 48:00.320]  will destroy us and then society will collapse.
[48:00.320 --> 48:06.240]  Remember October 3rd, give us unlimited political power, unlimited political funds, no oversight,
[48:06.240 --> 48:10.440]  no one can question the bailout and we'll stop the depression that's coming next week
[48:10.440 --> 48:12.840]  and what happened, things got worse.
[48:12.840 --> 48:17.520]  And now they say give us more power or things will get even worse.
[48:17.520 --> 48:20.800]  And now they come out on TV and say no one's allowed to audit us, we're above the law and
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.480]  hundreds of billions of dollars are missing, trillions of dollars are missing, the media
[48:24.480 --> 48:30.480]  is saying hundreds of billions, 360 billion now, it's really trillions.
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.080]  Total criminality, trillions missing from the Pentagon, total criminals, they're so criminal
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.160]  the VA hospitals are literally crumbling, sewage all over the floors, they make them
[48:40.160 --> 48:45.000]  on the C-130s over to Iraq, defecate in buckets, the chairs are collapsing, meanwhile the officers
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.080]  are in pleasure planes with pleasure rooms in their own beds and offices with their secretaries
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.480]  in the news.
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.240]  See the globalists think they're in control, but it's actually falling apart, it's all
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.280]  just rotting, it's unbelievable, Rome is collapsing, ladies and gentlemen and the elites even
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.360]  know that, but they can't help it, they're all running off to offshore islands with their
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.600]  own private security firms, I mean they have, they are just stealing everything even nailed
[49:09.600 --> 49:12.240]  down.
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.040]  And they know they've got to complete this robbery, complete this third world implosion
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.360]  of the United States and the western world, from Iceland to France, from Germany to the
[49:21.360 --> 49:29.840]  United States, from Australia to New Zealand, from Argentina to the Turks and Caicos, it
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.000]  is the collapse of any free society.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.920]  And the process, just like World War II was messy for the globalists financing all sides,
[49:38.920 --> 49:42.960]  this is going to be a messy process for them, but they are, they engineered the implosion,
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.160]  it's now even out of their control and they are going to ride the tiger, ride the wave,
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.960]  ride the lightning.
[49:49.960 --> 49:56.120]  And the poor silly yuppies and people have no idea, gun owners, land owners, anybody
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.120]  who protests when you find out they're going to take all your pension funds, everything
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.640]  you've got, they want you domesticated, they want you totally dependent on them, that anyone
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.680]  that resists, anyone that doesn't go to the camps because society is collapsing, anybody
[50:07.680 --> 50:10.920]  that doesn't go along with it, you're going to be considered a terrorist and think, and
[50:10.920 --> 50:13.880]  the police are going to be so scared because so many of them are going to be getting killed
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.040]  that they're just going to mow whole groups of people down, Eve the Globe, they're planning
[50:17.040 --> 50:26.880]  a red level, red type purge here, a Soviet slash Maoist type purge that David Rockefeller
[50:26.880 --> 50:31.880]  Braggs about his memoirs and wrote about in the New York Times praising how he engineered
[50:31.880 --> 50:33.760]  it.
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.960]  They hate you and your family, they hate your SUVs and your pools, they hate that you're
[50:37.960 --> 50:43.840]  doing well and they're going to use on top of the police state grid, the phony environmental
[50:43.840 --> 50:52.840]  grid as big news story in Australia reports, climate cops now to be dispatched and arrest
[50:52.840 --> 50:59.920]  people for improper emissions on their cars, arrest people for fireplaces, arrest people
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.160]  for burning trash in their backyard, arrest people of a battery accidentally gets thrown
[51:03.160 --> 51:05.960]  away in the trash can and then they're telling the neighbors to search through it, so is
[51:05.960 --> 51:08.120]  England, so is Canada.
[51:08.120 --> 51:12.520]  This is a hellish tyranny with all these nobody control freaks who are brought up believing
[51:12.520 --> 51:17.720]  in socialism, they're going to be in your house, in your life, running every facet.
[51:17.720 --> 51:22.160]  This is going to be bondage when the ponytail people and the little sandals show up and
[51:22.160 --> 51:26.480]  you don't bend over, the SWAT team's five minutes behind them.
[51:26.480 --> 51:33.360]  This is going to be merciless ladies and gentlemen, merciless.
[51:33.360 --> 51:36.760]  Already in San Francisco surrounding areas they're kicking people off their old family
[51:36.760 --> 51:41.440]  land and moving in, the local environmental cops, San Francisco Chronicle admits move
[51:41.440 --> 51:44.120]  into their houses.
[51:44.120 --> 51:51.280]  This is hellish crime, this is a society of locus like criminals descending and eating

[54:13.600 --> 54:18.560]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride

[55:00.000 --> 55:15.480]  Come, you masters of war, here to build the big guns, here to build the death planes,
[55:15.480 --> 55:28.400]  here to build all the bombs, here to hide behind walls, here to hide behind discs.
[55:28.400 --> 55:40.960]  I just don't want you to know I can see through your masks, you that never done nothing, put
[55:40.960 --> 55:51.440]  the bell to destroy, you play with my world, I got your little toy.
[55:51.440 --> 55:56.160]  All right, let's break it down.
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.680]  Rules have hijacked the nation and so what they're going to do is the media is always
[56:02.680 --> 56:08.800]  going to give attention to all the white supremacists, crackpots and nuts and loons.
[56:08.800 --> 56:14.920]  Anytime somebody criticizes the Federal Reserve, the Federal documents, all of it, they try
[56:14.920 --> 56:23.080]  to tie it to that and anytime you criticize it, that's what the media then ties it to.
[56:23.080 --> 56:26.320]  So we can't ever get rid of the private bank that rules our country because they're going
[56:26.320 --> 56:27.680]  to make it about Jews.
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.120]  The media is going to advertise it and make it about that issue and so we just have to
[56:32.120 --> 56:38.200]  let the Federal Reserve do whatever it wants because Lord knows we're not any submitting.
[56:38.200 --> 56:43.320]  They just inject that in the middle of it and every time some lunatic out of 300 million
[56:43.320 --> 56:49.160]  people goes out and shoots somebody, they hype it up like it's the end of the world.
[56:49.160 --> 56:56.440]  Now, remember, Glenn Beck has been saying for years that 9-11 truthers work with white supremacists
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.360]  and are marked my words, going to get violent and we got to use the Army against them.
[57:00.360 --> 57:04.840]  Meanwhile, the actual reports say the Army is working with white supremacists in Al-Qaeda
[57:04.840 --> 57:10.960]  and the returning veterans of the number one threat.
[57:10.960 --> 57:12.320]  And so this is how they're working.
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.360]  They've been saying for years now, about two years, white Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[57:17.360 --> 57:26.920]  Why there's 6,000 to 7,000 white Al-Qaeda in the U.S. that secretly work for Al-Qaeda
[57:26.920 --> 57:28.520]  and their militia people.
[57:28.520 --> 57:33.280]  Why just look at Adam Gadan, the spokesman for Al-Qaeda, the grandson of the head of
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.600]  the ADL, former head of the ADL, who got arrested for going to mosque and beating Muslims up.
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.600]  He hated them so much and then when he was a teenager, suddenly he quit beating up Muslims.
[57:43.600 --> 57:51.960]  He suddenly became a Muslim and then the Intel Center uploads his videos with his Al-Qaeda
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.520]  watermark and the same watermark is there, is the same video layer.
[57:55.520 --> 58:02.040]  Oh, it was uploaded together, oh, I better give up my free speech because Adam Gadan
[58:02.040 --> 58:07.840]  is with Al-Qaeda, the Jewish Al-Qaeda commander.
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.680]  You can go to Herets and Jerusalem Post headlines, Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups and Adam
[58:12.680 --> 58:16.960]  staged terror attacks to end the peace process, does that mean there aren't real people killing
[58:16.960 --> 58:17.960]  and attacking?
[58:17.960 --> 58:22.400]  No, no, there's a tribal war going on there for thousands of years since the Philistines
[58:22.400 --> 58:24.480]  and David.
[58:24.480 --> 58:32.240]  But the issue here is that they're staging most of this and I'm sick of it and whether
[58:32.240 --> 58:36.520]  you're a German or Chinese or a Jew, you ought to be sick of it because I'll tell you folks,
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.960]  the average Jew sure is sick of all this and they're sick of being made the big issue in
[58:40.960 --> 58:46.480]  the media and the average white person's tired of having it, you know, the average Anglo-Saxons
[58:46.480 --> 58:52.200]  tired of being implied that every white person's a racist and I know black folks are sick of
[58:52.200 --> 58:56.520]  racist blacks running around saying racist stuff and so are Hispanics of the Mecha-Lorazza
[58:56.520 --> 59:01.880]  We're the God Race crowd, we're sick of it and the New World Order using divide and conquer
[59:01.880 --> 59:06.800]  Balkanization is using this to play each other off against each other.
[59:06.800 --> 59:11.040]  So I'm going to go over back when we get back, I do want to just let all the listeners know
[59:11.040 --> 59:15.600]  I've done 59 minutes and haven't plugged the fact that we have the 2009 money bomb going
[59:15.600 --> 59:17.800]  right now.
[59:17.800 --> 59:24.320]  Huge success, about $50,000 came in in the last week or so just because the donation
[59:24.320 --> 59:33.880]  buttons were up there, another $45,000 has come in this morning and I think we may reach
[59:33.880 --> 59:42.960]  our goal of $250,000 today, we'll see, donate at infowars.com, God bless all of you donating.
[59:42.960 --> 59:50.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:50.960 --> 59:55.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[59:55.400 --> 59:56.400]  this summer.
[59:56.400 --> 1:00:00.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:04.840]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:06.080]  allows you to have.
[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:11.240]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:15.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially
[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:17.760]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:21.320]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:25.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:29.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:34.200]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solution from Science, a long time
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:35.360]  sponsor of ours.
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:42.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:01:05.400]  doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:34.600]  All right, they've gone ahead and gone to flu level pandemic 6.
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:38.880]  Which means they can declare total global martial law of the UN once.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:41.280]  We've signed the treaties with them, it's total tyranny.
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.960]  We told you about this months ago, but here it is now finally in the Associated Press.
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:51.680]  Now they want to further federalize the entire U.S. economy, we'll get into that.
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:54.840]  It's all coming up, but I've spent the last hour, and I'm going to talk about this with
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:02:09.000]  Lou Rockwell and take some of your calls coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.760]  Jaren saw it on MSNBC this morning, I heard it on the radio, I saw it all over TV last
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:18.600]  night, and I wasn't even watching a lot of television, I just turned it on and flipped
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:23.920]  around, and then I saw the clips this morning up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, every
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:30.840]  channel, the talking point, 9-11 truthers are terrorists, 9-11 truthers attack the Holocaust
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:40.200]  Museum in D.C., and they're also adding to the disgusting toxic mix that we need to go
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:45.440]  ahead and restrict the Internet, pass hate speech, pass the cyber bullying act, if somebody
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:53.720]  says something hurt their feelings, you get arrested and federally charged with a felony.
[1:02:53.720 --> 1:03:03.600]  It is really happening, it is really unfolding.
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:07.960]  Now remember, I kept puzzling, why did they bring, because I had the L.A. Times and Washington
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:14.080]  Post, why did they bring 5,000 total Iraqi Republican Guard and put them in intelligence
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:19.680]  jobs domestically in the U.S., Bush, Sr. and Clinton, 3,000 plus under Bush, 2,000 plus
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:27.240]  under Clinton, it's over 5,000, you can pull the L.A. Times, I think total is 5,300, and
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:30.120]  then why were they with McVeigh, well then we found out other documents later that he
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:34.520]  was a government agent confirmed that the Southern Primary Law Center was running him
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:46.280]  through Mossad, I mean the facts are facts, and then why did local state police arrest
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:49.440]  Al Hussein Hussein, why were they ordered to release him by the White House International
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:04:02.360]  Security, John Doe number two, why did all of that happen?
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:09.120]  And then I began to see some of the federal reports, and so 10 years ago and since then
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:15.240]  every few months I cover this, I say folks, they are going to develop in the media that
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:20.120]  Muslim extremists work with militias and then demonize militias that are constitutional
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:25.240]  white supremacists, and when they set up their Homeland Security grid, years before Homeland
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:28.800]  Security was in the news, like we called it that because it was in government documents,
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:32.520]  they're going to have a huge secret police grid with constant bombings and terror as
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:39.080]  the pretext to drag Americans off to secret gulags, no-due process, secret arrest, snatch
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:43.240]  and grab, they tried to pass all that before, now you saw that done with the Patriot Act,
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:46.840]  the Military Commissions Act, and they said, oh, it's not for citizens, and the warrant
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:52.600]  was wired to happen, it's not for citizens, now they admit it is, and they arrest kids
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:57.400]  for phone pranking under the Patriot Act and saying no-due process, and then now all the
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:06.800]  DHS documents are public, the number one target is veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians,
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:07.800]  landowners.
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:11.240]  Well, yeah, if you're going to have a Soviet takeover, and again, it's not the Soviet you
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:16.160]  think of as well-meaning communists that screwed up, they were financed openly by the big banks
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:22.680]  in New York on record, but if revolutionaries for banks are going to take over your country,
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:28.320]  they're going to call themselves for the people and say, oh, we'll communalize, take all your
[1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:34.280]  money and we'll keep it distributed back to you, and then it all goes to offshore banks.
[1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:38.040]  They're hitting us, they're hitting us hard, listen to me, a lot of you serving them, are
[1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:42.520]  going to kill you, after they're done killing me and countless other patriots, they're going
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:48.440]  to kill you, and when you're in a forced labor camp and you got a ponytailed commie kicking
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:53.440]  your guts out, you just remember I warned you, now we can beat these people and the
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:06:00.880]  republic doesn't have to fall, I'm going to come back and go directly at Beck's throat.
[1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:04.880]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be self

[1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:20.400]  your family, in any emergency if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your

[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:38.640]  I am again calling Glenn Beck out as a government operative.
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:43.960]  I've called him out of CIA, I know it when I see it on half his episodes where he demonizes
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:47.640]  gun owners, conservatives, people fighting a new world order and tries to tie us to
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.600]  al-Qaeda and the murder of people at Jewish centers.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:10:00.840]  He has CIA operatives in black ops, in deception on the show with him and he did yesterday.
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:05.400]  This is a guy that said Ron Paul supporters, our terrorists, our dangerous, our McVeys
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:06.600]  are going to attack.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:11.360]  He's following an exact script, the script eight years before.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.760]  He started doing this two years ago.
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:16.520]  I laid out they would follow when they were really getting ready to move against the American
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:17.520]  people.
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:21.840]  You say you're al-Qaeda and after they're done torturing you for six months, you'll
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:24.400]  go on TV and say you did it.
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  Think about it.
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:29.000]  They torture people for five, six, seven years and then have kangaroo trials where they
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:34.080]  plead guilty and the people start screaming in the middle of the trial, I was tortured,
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:40.160]  I was tortured, it's all made up and they drag them out and go, oh, he was just lying.
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.320]  I mean, how ridiculous does this have to get?
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:46.400]  And then Glenn Beck comes out and says, oh, I'm going to investigate the camps.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:47.400]  I think they're real.
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:48.760]  Then he comes out and says, oh, they're all fake.
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:49.760]  It's all lies.
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:54.040]  And I specifically predicted how he would debunk by doing straw men and showing a few
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:58.600]  fake camps when the Houston Chronicle, New York Times, government admits it, purchase
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:04.520]  orders, FEMA camps built, bills introduced to make you, you know, have local control
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:07.520]  being handed over to the feds.
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.120]  And Beck says, no truth.
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:11.480]  There's nothing, no truth to any of it.
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:15.440]  We're all kooks and dangerous and has Hearst publishing the fathers of yellow journalism
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:19.680]  come on with popular mechanics and try to debunk it show after show.
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:26.400]  And then he comes out last week and says, oh, look at this video, white al-Qaeda, look,
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:34.320]  the Muslim Imam says they've got 30,000 militiamen in the United States that are going to release
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:39.160]  anthrax that al-Qaeda is going to give them and it's going to kill 300 plus thousand people.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:44.400]  I remember seeing that video months ago on neocon websites and it's some crazy loon saying
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:49.920]  if we had the militias and boy, we could do this clearly just, just, just, you know, one
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:53.480]  of tens of thousands of nutty imams out there.
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:57.880]  But by the time Beck got it, he said, I've been warning about this group.
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:02.760]  I've been warning about this unholy marriage of the militias, the white supremacist and
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:03.760]  the al-Qaeda.
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:07.000]  They're going to hit us and he's just doing fake crying.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.640]  I mean, it's obviously fake.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:13.160]  Oh, my country, I worry we got to arrest all these people.
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:18.280]  I'm 10 years ago, I'm telling you the 9-11 truthers are going to attack us.
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.040]  They're with al-Qaeda and every other show saying the same thing.
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:28.160]  Then he comes out yesterday and it's all right to talk about the Fed, but tying that in,
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:30.880]  that talking about the Fed means you want to kill Jews.
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:33.240]  See, he introduces that.
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:36.920]  You can talk about the Fed, but you can't go out and do this and these people are everywhere
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:37.920]  in the 9-11.
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:40.680]  Now, I don't have any proof of this and it's an early report and we don't know what to
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:48.320]  say about it, but he doesn't give the source, but the 9-11 truthers are praising him.
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.040]  He's a hero of 9-11 truthers.
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:55.040]  So see, all they've got to do is go find one of their people or have one of their people
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:01.920]  type on some site they like him on some message board and it's over.
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:08.800]  Kind of like with Poplowski, the shooter of the cops and within hours of him shooting
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.840]  the cops, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center have given the news media my site he
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:18.760]  visited and then it later came out weeks later, he visited thousands of sites including
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:24.080]  Fox News, but that he hated me and attacked me everywhere, but no, they said he loved
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:25.080]  me.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.200]  Then they had to print retractions.
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:32.320]  Who is a Southern Poverty Law Center thinking about?
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:36.880]  Who's the first person they're attacking when they get an opportunity?
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.520]  With the police within two hours it's already in the news, my name.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.080]  They're not attacking their precious little white supremacist compounds they run, they're
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.840]  not attacking their toothless followers that don't know they're being led by feds, they're
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:58.920]  attacking me and who do their Nazis they handle and run attacking me because they win if we
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:03.600]  descend in all this Nazism and all this Zionism and all this black liberation and all this
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:08.120]  meta-laraza garbage they want us all at each other's throats and so who are they coming
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:10.120]  after me?
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:20.000]  Look at who's under attack, big time, Bloomberg, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, all
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:28.120]  writing big fat juicy hit pieces, psychology today, the list goes on and on, I am under
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:34.400]  attack and that's good because I know I'm telling the truth, I know I'm for real, I
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:38.840]  know I've got the history and the evidence and the facts, I know our track record's
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:44.120]  real, I know I've done my duty and I know we can beat these people if you'll just grow
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:50.040]  up, man up and get focused and get serious.
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:55.240]  Here is Glenn Beck, ladies and gentlemen, with the CIA and FBI people on his show and
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:15:01.080]  look at the CIA guy, when Beck is just getting off on it, relishing it right when the Federal
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:08.640]  Reserve is about to be audited, right when it's only eight votes away, two hundred and
[1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:13.640]  twelve this morning, Ron Paul's office confirmed up on info wars.com and prisonbunna.com, just
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:20.120]  to audit the alien, foreign, wicked, private, British royalty slash Rothschild, New World
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:25.720]  Order, eugenicist bankers.
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:30.680]  They can't have us exposing them as they take over our society.
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:35.520]  They have to do this, they have to stage this type of stuff, they have to hype this type
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:42.040]  of stuff or they lose and you know what, people aren't buying it, all these hit pieces and
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:45.800]  you read the comments, people are waking up, they're getting it and ABC News and all of
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:50.880]  them are deleting the comments and MSNBC are deleting the comments as fast as they can as
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:53.000]  people aren't buying this crap.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.320]  9-11 Truth exposes government sponsored terrorism.
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:02.920]  9-11 Truth on average is more progressive or on the left of the false paradigm.
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:07.120]  They have that flavor, though they're being deprogrammed.
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.920]  They are anti-racist, they're anti-tribalism.
[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:15.000]  They don't want to kill brown Muslims, they don't want to kill anybody, they know the
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:26.080]  military industrial complex, stage the attacks, they have incredible courage.
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:27.160]  And so what does Beck do?
[1:16:27.160 --> 1:16:31.440]  He says, oh no, this is an early report and it may be wrong because there is no report
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:32.600]  saying that.
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:38.120]  He's being praised by 9-11 Truthers and I did an hour of searching last night and I
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:43.800]  found one site, Southern Property Law Center Fed saying he might have been a free republic
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:54.160]  poster that worships Israel and worships war and worships the republicans.
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:59.040]  And supposedly someone with a similar handle to him signed a petition to investigate 9-11.
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:00.880]  There's been hundreds of them.
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:03.520]  Regardless, he's also a World War II vet.
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:12.040]  You then say World War II vets, praise hero.
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.200]  Now Ashanine is that.
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:21.120]  James W. von Brun.
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:22.440]  He's a decorated World War II vet.
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:24.560]  Does that mean World War II vets praise him?
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:28.080]  He has a bigger affiliation with World War II and Korea War vets than he does with 9-11
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.080]  Truth.
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:33.480]  I mean, this is Soviet style politics where they go around and I notice daily costs and
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.480]  all the George Soros fronts and alternate and publicly run by him.
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:42.160]  They all obsess over comment boards.
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:45.840]  We ought to go post horrible things on their comment boards and then write articles about
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:51.240]  how they're bad and evil because of the views posted there and then just point out that
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:56.720]  the article is a fraud to point out that that's what they do.
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:57.720]  It isn't going to work.
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.160]  Look, the people are sick of the new world order.
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:01.840]  They're sick of these offshore banks.
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:06.120]  They're sick of your criminality and they're not buying your evil anymore.
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:07.120]  Understand that.
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.120]  Let's go ahead and play Glenn Beck.
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  Now listen carefully.
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.080]  Let's talk today about Iran as they should be.
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:15.360]  One of the, Mike, let me go to you.
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:20.160]  One of the guys, or one of the groups that I've been warning about for a very long time
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:26.120]  of these 9-11 Truthers, it is the information that we have at this point is this guy is
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:29.280]  a hero in the 9-11 Truthers community.
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:30.360]  Don't know if that's true or not.
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:34.360]  That is the early report.
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:39.040]  These are people that, I mean, it's totally fine to speak out against the Fed.
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.840]  But these are whacked out conspiracy.
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:47.000]  The government has planned 9-11, the Jews were involved, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:51.120]  And from what we have seen in early reports, this guy is being held up as somebody, they
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:54.040]  liked him because he'll actually do something about it.
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:55.040]  Yeah.
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:58.320]  You know, the unfortunately crazy hate doesn't know any bounds.
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:03.280]  So whether it's Von Brun today at the Holocaust Museum, whether it's the Muslim extremists
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:08.040]  shooting the private, the recruiting center down in Arkansas, whether it's the abortion
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:12.000]  doctor getting shot, there's something.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:17.240]  Whether these things happen in groups, whether they serve somehow in these psychopath's minds
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:23.360]  to fuel each other's actions, whether they serve somehow in these psychopath's minds
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.480]  to fuel each other's actions, problem with the 9-11 Truthers, people are horrified when
[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.560]  they see the reports after 9-11 of Muslims celebrating what happened with 9-11 overseas.
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:35.560]  Turned out that was fake.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:39.800]  And we will undoubtedly have some people in a certain segment of society looking at
[1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:42.840]  this, going, oh, yay, great, great for Von Brun.
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:48.200]  Harry, like Al Qaeda, they'd like to destroy us and they will work with anyone.
[1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:52.640]  There are also people like white supremacists or 9-11 Truthers that would also like to destroy
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:53.880]  the country.
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.240]  They'll work with anybody they can.
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:57.240]  Coming through.
[1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:58.240]  We know who you work for.
[1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:03.840]  There he is talking to a former CIA psych warfare expert, that's what that guy did.
[1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:06.580]  And notice what he semantically does.
[1:20:06.580 --> 1:20:12.560]  He implies that this Von Brun was working with some Muslim that shot somebody.
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:15.600]  And notice how he doesn't call him a Muslim killer.
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:19.280]  He calls him a Muslim extremist, which is a lesser term than he deserves for shooting
[1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:21.320]  that private.
[1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:26.240]  But see, now they can legally call you an extremist, and then now you can't sue him
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:28.600]  because you can call anybody an extremist.
[1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:29.600]  Vex an extreme liar.
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:34.120]  See, that's a semantical game, they can now call you an extremist and somebody thinks
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.240]  oh, you're being called an extremist, that means you murder people.
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:41.960]  So that's why they always call terrorists an extremist so they can then call regular
[1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:44.920]  people extremist and the connotation is terrorist.
[1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:48.000]  They're changing the way the words are used.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.920]  But by Glenn Vex logic, I could say, well, I'll cover when we get back.
[1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:55.920]  Stay with us.
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:56.920]  Wait till you hear this.
[1:20:56.920 --> 1:20:58.040]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:02.640]  The money bombs on, folks.
[1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:04.120]  Recognize that sound?
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:07.960]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:08.960]  ending up.
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:11.280]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:16.680]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:22.040]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:25.680]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:28.000]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.480]  Introducing Choose for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits,
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:35.840]  sea vegetables, and antioxidants.

[1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  Diet.
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:53.520]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:22:01.600]  1-800-210-1922 or go to orderchoose.com.
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:07.680]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:12.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:13.520]  us would like to see.
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:18.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:20.080]  of the American people.
[1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:24.400]  Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:29.520]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists, who is imposing
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:37.640]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:41.200]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:22:41.200 --> 1:22:48.120]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:56.320]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:00.840]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:05.040]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:07.560]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:12.600]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:15.640]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:19.920]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:23.840]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:27.600]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:28.960]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:33.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:44.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:48.960]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:52.040]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:56.840]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:59.840]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:04.840]  News flash.
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.720]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:13.520]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:18.080]  All experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:21.680]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:26.960]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:27.960]  food.
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  News flash.
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:35.200]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:36.200]  price.
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:37.200]  Dramatically reduced.
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.360]  So you and your family have a long term food solution.
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.240]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:47.240]  Right now.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:48.240]  Right now.
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:49.920]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:55.240]  That's survivalistseeds.com because you are almost out of time.
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:56.240]  Time.
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:57.240]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:13.000]  All right, your call is coming up.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.400]  Blue Rock, well joining us as well.
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:17.360]  I want to give you an update specifically on the money bomb and the huge success it's
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:18.360]  having.
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  I want to thank all of you out there that are donating.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.240]  It's going to really empower what we're doing.
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  So God bless you.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:24.440]  Look, the system is scared of us.
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:27.760]  They thought they'd use the internet to track and trace and surveil everybody, but it's
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:28.760]  backfired.
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:29.760]  People aren't going along with it.
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:31.600]  They're using it to communicate.
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.160]  It's destroying the mainstream media.
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:34.160]  They're collapsing.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:38.360]  So they've introduced bills to shut down free speech, to shut down the web as we know it.
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:43.800]  The New York Times is promoting ending free speech on the web, quote, gatekeeping a kindler,
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.160]  gentler, unfree web.
[1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:47.400]  All of this is happening.
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:51.360]  The feds are grabbing all these industries saying they're going to set prices, not give
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:56.600]  you money for your patents when they feel like it steal your patents whenever they want.
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:01.160]  Everything we know of that built this country is now being destroyed.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:05.480]  And Glenn Beck will come on and say, I'm fighting the New World Order and we do that by attacking
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:06.480]  Iran.
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:07.480]  I'm a patriot.
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:10.320]  I don't like the New World Order in these foreign banks.
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:14.560]  By the way, I think we should arrest anybody that criticizes the Federal Reserve.
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:18.000]  He's only does that to get your confidence to then slip the poison in.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:23.680]  Just like if you want to get really, you know, scientific with a psychology, it's all written
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:24.680]  on teleprompters.
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:28.120]  Remember, he's reading off teleprompters.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:32.040]  He's just encircled by them, just like Obama.
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:36.760]  Notice he brings in and says, we've got these right-wing extremists that want to kill Jews.
[1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:40.880]  And then we've got the Obama extremists like Reverend Wright.
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:42.200]  They're dangerous, too.
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:47.480]  He does that so the left and right both hate each other as long as he attacks both, then
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.840]  the left and right will all accept being slaves and being surveilled and that they're all
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:52.840]  terrorist.
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:55.920]  But if he just attacked the left as terrorist, they would say, oh, that's a bunch of baloney.
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:58.280]  If he just attacked the right, they'd say that was all baloney.
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:03.840]  But by him playing left, right, see, this is all scientific.
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:06.840]  And those psychwarfer experts, probably the guy who was interviewing was a guest, probably
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:07.840]  did the teleprompter work.
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.960]  I'll never forget Gore Vidal was at CNN and he, right from 9-11, he said, you know, I've
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:16.200]  been in here in these studios and there's scyop army colonels in here telling me what
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:17.200]  I can and can't say.
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:21.740]  And then it came out in mainstream news, Washington Post, but they said it was good that the army
[1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:22.920]  runs CNN.
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.360]  Of course they do.
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:30.040]  And they've dabbled with having me on a few times just to have credibility, you know,
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:31.720]  to act like they're having alternative media.
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:36.200]  But then later the higher ups tell them, no, don't have him on.
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:41.880]  This is controlled, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  This is on record.
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:47.400]  They spend tens of billions of federal money buying off reporters, putting out propaganda,
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:49.160]  paying for fake news stories.
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.680]  It's called product placement, but I call it propaganda placement.
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:28:00.960]  And so get the article, Bex, outrageous lie, racist Von Brun is hero of 9-11 truthers.
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:07.940]  That would be like if I said, now it's an unsubstantiated report and it's not clear
[1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:18.640]  yet and might not be right, but it appears that Glenn Beck is a hero to pedophiles.
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:23.440]  Now, I mean, that's not true.
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:24.440]  That's made up.
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.440]  But I mean, you could say anything.
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:29.600]  This guy has a national show with 4 million viewers every night, a radio show with about
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:35.840]  6, 7 million listeners, and he can get up there and say a whole group of people think
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:41.800]  this Von Brun is a hero.
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:49.560]  That'd be like saying Glenn Beck loves Nazis.
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:54.160]  It's not true, I don't think, but the point is, I could say, oh, there's a report unsubstantiated,
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:58.040]  but it appears that Glenn Beck likes Nazis.
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:02.840]  It's pure demonization, and he's been doing this for years getting ready for this.
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:06.000]  That's why I believe it's staged and there's a lot of evidence around that.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:09.840]  But notice how the perfect timing right when we're about to audit the Fed and the news
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:15.640]  comes out and says, we'll have a depression, the complete economy will collapse, the end
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:19.040]  of civilization is what CBS is saying.
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:21.640]  That's what the lobbyists is running around that they've hired.
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:25.960]  Oh, the world's going to end if you audit the Fed and everything, confidence will be
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:28.360]  destroyed, it's all over.
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:29.360]  And that's true.
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:31.680]  If you ever try to go out to the Fed, they're going to destroy the economy.
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:33.360]  They'll set off nukes.
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:34.960]  They run the military.
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:39.160]  Pentagon documents, British documents, say they'd use neutron bombs on us if we ever
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:45.800]  tried to take Washington or London back peacefully with a march, like V for Vendetta.
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:48.120]  That's why you've got to infiltrate government with liberty and freedom.
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:51.160]  That's why you've got to take over your counties and cities peacefully and just rebuke them
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:55.200]  at every level until no matter what they stage or what they do, everybody knows who they
[1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:59.600]  are and what they are, and you've got to have courage.
[1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:03.760]  That's how we defeat them, ladies and gentlemen, that's how we bring down the new world order.
[1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:12.160]  But I'm telling you, it's now confirmed, not just my analysis or my projection of the future,
[1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:16.560]  that they are going to say that conservative gun owners and veterans are al-Qaeda and they
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:20.560]  are going to turn this giant, most of college grads now are in Homeland Security related
[1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:21.560]  stuff.
[1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:22.560]  This is the new America.
[1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:26.600]  The Homeland Security is the Defense Department, the private defense contractors absorbing
[1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:30.960]  America, everything, it's not enough that we have the most prisons in the world or the
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:35.680]  most cameras or the most surveillance or checkpoints, they're taking everything over.
[1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:41.280]  The new economy will be the police state owned by the new world order.
[1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:42.280]  That's it, period.
[1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:45.360]  Lew Rock will come up and I'll give you an update when we get back on the money bomb.
[1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:51.720]  It is exploding, very, very exciting, we'll be right back.
[1:30:51.720 --> 1:31:01.200]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:05.440]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:10.480]  longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.880]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:20.400]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.

[1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:06.880]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:10.320]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember there's a
[1:33:10.320 --> 1:33:11.840]  learning curve.
[1:33:11.840 --> 1:33:13.880]  Experience is the best teacher but that means time.
[1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:17.200]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:19.160]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:21.960]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:25.640]  The DVD gives you a 3 hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:30.120]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:34.240]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your field work.
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:38.840]  This 3-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:40.480]  in weeks, not years.
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:45.000]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal, she's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:49.860]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[1:33:49.860 --> 1:33:50.860]  Start now.
[1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:52.360]  Knowledge is power.
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:53.360]  Better take action.
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:13.880]  I think the storm's coming.
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:20.200]  We are simulcasting now for the next 2 hours and 27 minutes at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:26.880]  We're all casting this live syndicated radio show and this radio program is exploding in
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:32.760]  popularity just as Liberty and the Love Affair with it is exploding across the planet as
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:33.760]  well.
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:37.920]  In a moment we'll talk to Lou Rockwell, former congressional chief of staff at Ron Paul and
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:40.720]  founder and chairman of the Lubig von Mies Institute.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.880]  It goes on and on so we'll be talking to him right now about the Federal Reserve, auditing
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:47.240]  the Fed, Ron Paul and so much more.
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:51.320]  On your phone calls coming up about 20 minutes, he'll be with us for 45 minutes, but I want
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:54.200]  to be clear here.
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:55.920]  I want to thank everybody.
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:58.600]  I've already done an hour and a half of the show and really haven't gotten into the money
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:34:59.600]  bomb.
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:00.680]  This is our second annual.
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:03.520]  The first one was started by listeners.
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:07.320]  We embraced it and it raised $250,000.
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:14.000]  To be technical, it was like $249,000 in change last year at the same time.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.520]  So we're having another money bomb today to expand the studio, to get more webmasters,
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:21.520]  more video editors.
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:25.120]  Instead of making two or three films a year, we want to make six films a year and I put
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:26.920]  my films out for free.
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:28.400]  And they're all the number one videos.
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:32.600]  Every one of my films is always number one for a time and are among the number one viral
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:34.000]  videos in history.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.280]  Conservatively, we've done the numbers over 200 million views of my films that we can
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:43.640]  document on YouTube and Google and the other big sites, 200 million.
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:46.120]  The Obama deception has been out for three months.
[1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:51.520]  I checked a month ago, two months in, 15 million views on YouTube, Google and a few other video
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:52.760]  sites alone.
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:57.560]  There's some with over 3 million, 2 million, 1 million per video, but it gets duplicated
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:59.240]  everywhere so you've got to go through and count them up.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  Go do it for yourself.
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:01.760]  In fact, one of my writers ought to do that.
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:05.040]  It took me 45 minutes to count up 15 million.
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:09.520]  I make a $100,000 film, release it for free because I want liberty.
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:10.880]  I want freedom.
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:14.320]  These are like self-replicating printing presses.
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:15.960]  People buy the DVDs.
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:22.240]  They get about 15,000 alone at Aristotle State University in a two-week period ahead of Obama's
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:23.240]  visit.
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  It made the newspapers.
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:25.240]  It made the radio.
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:26.240]  It made TV.
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  They were giving them out.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:28.360]  People were like, why are these DVDs everywhere?
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:29.640]  That's happening at colleges everywhere.
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:35.240]  See, we can't even count that, but it's definitely in the tens of millions of copies of my films
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:36.240]  that have been made.
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:42.680]  You know, we pioneered that 12, 13 years ago, I read about some other revolutions like 1776.
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:44.960]  Were they done that with printing presses?
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:49.640]  And though I disagree with the Ayatollahumani and don't like the things he does and believe
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:55.800]  he was somewhat CIA funded, he, that's how he came to power, was copies of cassette tapes
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:56.800]  passed on.
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.560]  Well, we're not trying to come to power.
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:01.160]  We want the Bill of Rights and Constitution to come back in.
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:02.160]  We're restorationists.
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.320]  We're fighting the revolutionary private offshore crime banking syndicates, and we'll get Lou
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:07.320]  Rockwell's.
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:08.320]  Take on that in a moment.
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:10.800]  Let me explain something here.
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:12.080]  People want us to make more films.
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:13.200]  They want us to write more stories.
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:14.680]  They want us to do more.
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:20.800]  I got 20 people here, and I spend most of my time trying to raise money, sell advertising,
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:26.240]  and sell DVDs for people that want to support us in prison-planet.tv memberships instead
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:27.440]  of fighting the New World Order.
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:32.920]  So it does help us to guarantee we can expand for the year and is just essential.
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:34.840]  The last money bomb helped us so much.
[1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:36.160]  I hope this one's bigger.
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:39.200]  The goal is $250,000.
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:40.440]  They update it every hour.
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:42.920]  It's about $90,000 right now and growing.
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:45.760]  We'll update that in the next hour again.
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:51.240]  And by midnight tonight, I would like to have reached $250,000, and we'll go to expanding
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:52.240]  our studios.
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:56.760]  We'll go to buying more equipment, hiring two video editors, another webmaster or two,
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  and just doing a lot more around here.
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:02.720]  I hate paying the tax man anyway, so we will spend all the money on the infrastructure
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.360]  right here that comes in from the money bomb.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:10.120]  So please go to infowars.com or infowarsmoneybomb.com, link through on the banners, and donate
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:11.640]  there by PayPal, by credit card.
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:16.400]  If you don't like those systems we've got, we've got Yahoo Pay on our Yahoo video and
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.960]  bookstore shopping card.
[1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:22.120]  You can also call toll-free until one o'clock tonight, central, and we're going to go ahead
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.720]  and run the money bomb until 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.760]  It really has started at 11 a.m. today.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:35.600]  And it's up to $90,000, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 is the toll-free number to call and donate
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:42.000]  $5, $10, $1,000, whatever you want, 100% of the money bomb money will go towards directly
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.480]  fighting the New World Order.
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:48.280]  So instead of having two or three films that get 30, 40 million views in the year, how
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:49.960]  about five or six?
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:55.740]  So 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, people say, oh, you shouldn't ask for money.
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:39:00.840]  That's the media trying to bully us into not having free association.
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:06.680]  You know, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and many others went to France and went to
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:12.120]  countries and would sell little American flags and trinkets and signatures to raise money
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:17.280]  and ship it back over to buy the most basic armaments in the Revolutionary War.
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:22.320]  But Ron Paul, others have to go around and campaign and raise money for their campaigns
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:23.800]  and it takes up all your time.
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:30.200]  It takes treasure and it's an enemy's siob to say that we shouldn't ask for money and
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:32.640]  we shouldn't raise money.
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:35.960]  We're not the IRS for the Private Federal Reserve coming and taking your money and then
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:40.720]  using it for fake news and buying reporters and propaganda and add council ads to join
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:45.720]  Barack Obama's private youth brigade armies and red and black uniforms now knocking on
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:49.320]  doors nationwide, people marching on TV and red and black uniforms.
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:50.520]  It's happening.
[1:39:50.520 --> 1:39:53.320]  The unthinkable is manifesting.
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:54.320]  They're using our money.
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:58.360]  George Soros spends millions putting out carbon credit, carbon tax movies about how humans
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:02.360]  have got to be gotten rid of them or evil and they're setting up climate cops.
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:08.200]  His millions though can be countered by your hundreds of thousands and I will continue to
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:11.040]  put my films out for free and if you want to buy the DVD to support us, that's great
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:12.200]  and it's the higher quality.
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:14.240]  But regardless, I know it's the biggest effect.
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:16.720]  So I'll continue to do it, but we'll put out more if you support us.
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:28.480]  So infowars.com to link through to infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-201-2244-888-2012-244 or 512-646-1776.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.720]  512-646-1776 if the numbers are busy, just please call back a few minutes later.
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:38.080]  We've got five people on the phones in there, $5, $100, whatever you can.
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:39.480]  This is the tip of the spear.
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:40.920]  We supported Ron Paul's Money Bonds.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:41.920]  People say, well, he didn't win.
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:42.920]  We failed.
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:45.320]  No, no, you see the delayed, we're about to go to Lou Rockwell.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:51.960]  The delayed response, a movement isn't born or it doesn't defeat the new order overnight.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  It takes time.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  You have to support all alternative media.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.480]  You know, in England, I got an email from a British guy, said I have to pay 165 pounds
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:40:59.480]  a year.
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:03.880]  They quell them about 250 bucks a year for a TV tax even if I don't watch TV so they
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:05.280]  can propagandize me.
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:12.000]  See, this is your kind of like your carbon offset to the mainstream media is to support
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  alternative media.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:16.320]  That means buying the books and videos off the site or buying Ron Paul's new book coming
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:19.200]  out in the Fed, whatever.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:22.840]  It's just like how people bought organic food and then it went from being hard to find
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:24.240]  to being everywhere.
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:28.160]  This is how we change society and we're in a revolution, folks, against tyranny.
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:31.200]  Lou Rockwell, thanks for holding while I put that call out for the money bomb.
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:35.800]  But can you comment about the fact that we get to be hesitant and have been buffaloed
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:39.240]  into not asking for support, but we need to learn how to do that?
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:43.160]  Well, the bad guys, of course, are all supported by the tax system.
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:45.880]  By stolen money, in other words, that's what taxes are.
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:49.840]  It's a coercive mechanism whereby people in the government get to put a gun to your head
[1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:55.640]  and say, hand us some percentage of the wall of what you've got in your wallet or otherwise
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:56.640]  we're going to send you to jail.
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:02.400]  So we're supposed to, of course, think that is a morally high-care way of getting money
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:03.840]  in the private way.
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:08.480]  So whether it's in commerce or whether it's in charities, whether it's a matter of gifts
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:14.240]  or whether you're purchasing something, this, of course, is the voluntary and the humane
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.200]  and the prosperous and the freeway to get money.
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:23.480]  So, of course, that's the way it ought to be done, not through the government mechanism.
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:24.480]  Absolutely.
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.120]  And the establishment knows that.
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:31.600]  They're scared to death that real organizations are going to get funded, that we make films
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:34.720]  and sell books that Ron Paul does that has newsletters.
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:39.960]  I mean, that is such a sigh-op to say no one who's against big government is allowed to
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:41.520]  fund their operations.
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:42.680]  What a mind game, Lou.
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:47.760]  You know, Alex, I was so glad to hear you mention Ron's forthcoming book in the Fed,
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:50.200]  which is really an extraordinary work.
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:54.200]  I mean, I want to highly, I got a chance to see a proof.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.000]  It's just an extraordinary piece of work.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:03.160]  What Ron does is he weaves history and economics and the Constitution and put it together with
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:07.880]  his own life experiences from the time he was a little boy to today on Capitol Hill
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:12.560]  and talks about money, about the Federal Reserve, about the kind of system we ought to have
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:15.080]  as versus the horrible system we do have.
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:16.320]  It's an extraordinary book.
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:20.160]  I think it's going to be a best-seller and I think it's going to really help the end
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:21.160]  of Fed movement.
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:28.440]  Well, I had Congressman Paul on yesterday graciously in his busy schedule and I made
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:34.800]  the point that even if they shoot this down and play dirty tricks and CNBC is saying Fed
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.400]  would be shut down if it were audited experts say society would collapse, they're saying,
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:40.960]  on other news programs.
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:46.000]  I mean, obviously they may pull chicanery and beat it this time, but the idea of this
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:51.960]  alien offshore above the law arrogant group that's engineered the crisis we're under,
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:57.560]  now posing as our saviors, no matter what they do, it's inexorable that their days
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:58.560]  are numbered.
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.800]  Well, you know, it's important to remember that there are many evil institutions in
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:09.480]  Washington, D.C., whether it's the IRS or the EPA or the HUD or the rest of the alphabet
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:13.560]  from hell, or the Pentagon and all the rest of them.
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:18.000]  But the worst thing in Washington, the worst operation that goes on there is the Federal
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  Reserve.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.800]  It is the Federal Reserve that makes possible this biggest government in the history of the
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:23.800]  world, the U.S.
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:27.800]  Government, it's the Federal Reserve that makes possible world wars, it's the Federal
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:31.920]  Reserve that makes possible all the crazy environmental stuff that they're engineering
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:32.920]  now.
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:35.640]  Without a Federal Reserve, they wouldn't be talking about socializing medical care.
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:42.080]  It's the brain, the heart, the stomach, everything, and the IRS is the mouth feeding
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:43.080]  it.
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:44.080]  Go ahead.
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.920]  Well, it's the Fed that makes positive this printing press, but we can think of the Fed
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:52.360]  as being nothing other than a counterfeiting press, it's like a counterfeiter in the basement
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:55.920]  in a local town hurting the local economy with its phony money.
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:01.480]  Only global, I mean it goes to a global scale, they put out trillions of dollars of money
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.880]  just created out of thin air, and of course it benefits the government itself, it benefits
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:10.480]  the big banks, the military, industrial complex, all the rest of the people associated with
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:14.920]  the Central State and Washington at the expense of the American people and really the people
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:17.400]  of the whole world end up paying for this.
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:23.880]  And it's a rip-off, it's a transfer of funds from poor people, elderly people, rural people,
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:28.800]  other groups that aren't blessed in our society, to the most powerful and the richest people
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:32.320]  connected to the government.
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:36.600]  Its predecessor was called by Andrew Jackson, the monster, and I always think that's a good
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.440]  phrase for the Federal Reserve too.
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:43.280]  I mean, it causes the business cycle, it's because of the Federal Reserve that we now
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:48.040]  have this horrific financial crisis we're in, they caused the artificial boom, they
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:54.000]  caused the housing boom, they caused the dot-com boom, they caused the Great Depression.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:59.720]  Ever since the Federal Reserve was established in 1913, it's caused a huge series of booms
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:00.720]  and busts.
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.720]  And of course you can't really tell how much poorer we are because of the Federal Reserve
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:08.480]  and its ability to pump up the government and cause these booms and busts.
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:13.800]  But we're probably two or three times poorer at a very, very conservative estimate.
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:20.080]  Every American, we would help be a much richer society if it weren't for the group of criminals
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:23.440]  called the Federal Reserve system.
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:26.720]  Absolutely.
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:33.480]  Expanding on that, you of course run the Lugavamees Institute full of top world-renowned economists,
[1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:34.480]  people that research this.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:39.080]  Just studying basic history, it's not even a hidden fact, that we didn't really have
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  a business cycle.
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:47.800]  It was explosive, 10% growth on average, completely stable money, absolute milk and honey, 4% of
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:54.320]  the world's population got half the wealth of the world, 80% of the patents, just huge
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:47:01.240]  levels of high education from homeschooling, the apple of the world's eye, then colonized
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:06.480]  by the Federal Reserve, take over in 1913, they engineered the 33 Collapse War Powers
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:07.480]  Act.
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:11.560]  They brag in IMF and World Bank documents, in 100-year-old American Banking Association
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:16.520]  documents that we have, that they love booms and busts to get you inflated and blow it
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:18.080]  out and consolidate.
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:23.600]  This is a predatory group of shysters, of magicians, engaging in scams and chicanery,
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:30.160]  who bamboozle and scam the public into getting into debt, into living in this false reality.
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:35.200]  Now we're several generations deeply under their domestication, and they are fully trying
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:40.080]  to domesticate us now, and I guess we've now reached that critical juncture, that crossroads
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:47.080]  towards great liberty or towards total tyranny, and their whole anti-patriot system, the whole
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:51.120]  Homeland Security apparatus we discover from the documents we broke is for veterans, gun
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:56.600]  owners, conservatives, Ron Paul, libertarians, yourself, myself, I mean, we now know this
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:02.840]  offshore alien corporation is setting up and preparing to make war upon the American people
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:05.640]  if we try to ever kick the bankers out or bring them to justice.
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:06.640]  Lou Rockwell.
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:11.520]  Well, Alex, you know, I think that Ron Paul ignited a prairie fire against the Federal
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:17.320]  Reserve in his presidential campaign, and I think back to his speech after the Dearborn
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.560]  in October 2007, the Dearborn Republican primary debate, he went to the University of Michigan
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.120]  afterwards, and there were about 4,000 kids in the Quad there to hear him, a lot of kids
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:32.760]  to hear a politician, we were told, and so Ron starts talking about foreign policy, about
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:37.040]  the free market, everybody's cheering him, and then all of a sudden he starts talking
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:42.880]  about monetary policy, and kids in one corner of this, of the Quad start chanting, end the
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:48.840]  Fed, end the Fed, and soon the whole 4,000 is chanting it, and some of these kids are
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:53.080]  lighting dollar bills and holding them up as if to say, here's to you, Bernanke, and
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:49:00.640]  it was an electrifying moment, and I traced the entire current, and I fed movement and
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.040]  its size, its excitement, and its possibilities to that moment in the Quad of the University
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:11.040]  of Michigan when these kids responded to Ron Paul, and I'll tell you, it bothers the Fed.
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:16.600]  There was a great article, great from, I mean, sort of the opposite, the bad article, but
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.320]  great from our standpoint, in Forbes, where they said, look, it's time for the Fed to
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:23.000]  be boring again.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.240]  People should not be interested in the Fed.
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:30.600]  They can't do their wonderful work for humanity if they're being scrutinized, so Ron Paul's
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:36.360]  bill to out of the Fed is terrible, all interest in the Fed, but except by professional economists,
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:37.360]  should be discouraged.
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:43.880]  Well, of course, if the Fed is not boring, although they like it, they think it's boring,
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:49.520]  because they're ripping us off, and Ron Paul has, is the engine of this movement that has
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:53.840]  just swept the country, and I, at the instances of all over the world, as a matter of fact,
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:59.400]  where people want to know about the Fed, want transparency, and the ones who really understand
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:03.840]  the Fed, and I want to mention a great book by Thomas Woods at the Mises Institute called
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:06.200]  Meltdown about this recent crisis.
[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:07.200]  Another great...
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:09.000]  Now, we're going to be having him on.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.920]  Yeah, no, I know that.
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:16.080]  And so, this is another great book to read, but there is a strong anti-Fed movement.
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:17.520]  It's getting stronger.
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:21.040]  Whatever these birds do in Congress is not the heart of it.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.200]  The heart of it is among the American people.
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:25.160]  They're scared at the Fed.
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:27.920]  They've hired a lobbyist to try to block Ron Paul.
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:32.680]  You have Bernanke going on 60 minutes twice, never in the history of the Fed as a Fed chairman
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:33.680]  appeared on a regular...
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:36.720]  And Lou, I want to ask you this, and I agree with you.
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:41.320]  This is going to backfire, and they've gone from their arrogant above the Congress to
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:48.000]  scared that air of invincibility, that air of arrogance, that veneer of royalty has now
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.240]  left them.
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:53.840]  People are realizing they're not invincible, so let's talk Turkey.
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:55.280]  How are they going to counter us?
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:58.680]  And their answer is, same way they got the bank or takeover, October 3rd, we're going
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:02.760]  to have a depression if you audit us, and you're white supremacist if you do.
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:08.040]  That's why they've seized on this Von Brune deranged person.
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:11.840]  You've got, in polls, the Fed is 60%, 70% unpopular.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:14.320]  I guess 70% of Americans are white supremacists.
[1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:16.720]  I think that's going to backfire on them as well.
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:21.120]  Well, I think just the fact that Americans are learning what this institution does, it's
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:26.200]  not just a name on the bill in your pocket, but it's actually the greatest ripoff engine
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:30.480]  in the history of the world working against us every day.
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:35.160]  As people get interested in it, they begin to understand it, they want to abolish it.
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:41.160]  It's unconstitutional, it's immoral, it's bad politically, it's hurtful in every
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:42.160]  way.
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:48.040]  All right, he's the head of the Lubidvangmese Institute, and he is a best-selling author
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:53.600]  in his own right, and also the former congressional chief of staff for Ron Paul, Lou Rockwell.
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:54.600]  Always love having him.
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:55.600]  Stay there, Lou.
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:59.040]  We'll be right back and talk about the game plan, how we beat the bankers, how we bring
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:01.040]  them down, how we end the Fed, whoo-ra!
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:58.320]  Go to PEPPERSPRAY.COM or call 1-800-908-908.
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:07.320]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:13.320]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:15.320]  just as well-funded.
[1:53:15.320 --> 1:53:21.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:23.320]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:26.320]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  You have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs.
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:37.320]  That's fascism.
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:39.320]  It's not about left or right.
[1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:41.320]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:48.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:54:05.320]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using Oil of Oregano,

[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:51.320]  for those that are patiently holding at 1-800-25 at 99231.
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:56.320]  Lou, I know you're trying to focus on the positive here, but I don't know what the media is doing.
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:02.320]  You have the DHS report that we broke and the MIAC report we broke and all the others.
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:06.320]  And I've been seeing these for years, just nobody would pay attention to them until now,
[1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:11.320]  where they're saying Ron Paul, conservatives, libertarians in the Fed groups,
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:17.320]  I got secret documents in the Army confirmed that the Army was spying on Ron Paul last year at the in the Fed meeting
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:24.320]  in Houston and spying on us in Dallas at our in the Fed meeting as potential terrorist.
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:26.320]  So they put this script out.
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:32.320]  I know that blew up in their face, but still this does show that they consider us to be a real threat
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:35.320]  and are trying to sick the Defense Department on us.
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:38.320]  But at the same time saying vets are the number one threat.
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:43.320]  So and all these anti-gun bills introduced and all this draconian stuff going on.
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:46.320]  I mean, this this is amazing.
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  Well, America's been unfortunately at least a soft fascist state since Franklin Roosevelt and his new deal.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:56.320]  And it's been getting worse since then.
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:00.320]  There've been stops and starts and back step forward and step backward and so forth.
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:06.320]  So yeah, we have we have again, the biggest government in the history of the world, the US government,
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:11.320]  it hates dissent. It wants all of us to be good little boys and girls, turn over our wallets,
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  turn over our children for their wars, obey them, listen to them and salute them.
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:17.320]  I mean, that's that's the way they want things.
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:22.320]  So anybody who is who is a dissident, whether from the left or the right is hated.
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:25.320]  And of course they want to, you know, they don't like us.
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:31.320]  And we can't trust obviously the mainstream media is in effect a state, a state media operation,
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:35.320]  no different from the ones in some other countries.
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:40.320]  They're giving out lies. They smear anybody who's who's opposed to the central government.
[1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:44.320]  It's Federal Reserve. It's wars. It's all over with its buying.
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:49.320]  It's welfare. It's economic transfers. It's destructionism.
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:51.320]  They're a terrible bunch in the government.
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.320]  And yeah, they don't like us saying the may, but here's the good news.
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:58.320]  Government depends on the consent of the government.
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:02.320]  They actually depend on at least the tacit consent of the people.
[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:10.320]  And if the people ever start to withdraw that consent, they get terrified and they can be brought down.
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:13.320]  You know, you mentioned the Ayatollah Khomeini a little bit ago.
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:17.320]  Obviously not exactly our cup of tea, the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:21.320]  But the way he brought down the Shah, the dictatorship, the U.S. government,
[1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:26.320]  it set up by the way in Iran, a monstrous government with horrible torture and secret police
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:33.320]  and punishing businessmen for raising prices against their horrendous paper money inflation.
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.320]  The way that the Ayatollah Khomeini brought it was changing people's minds.
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:41.320]  As you say, through these cassette tapes were an important part of it.
[1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:45.320]  They changed people's minds. And when the people of Iran withdrew their consent from the Shah,
[1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:49.320]  the whole government disappeared like a bunch of leaves in the wind.
[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:52.320]  It didn't matter yet, secret police. It didn't matter yet, vast armies.
[1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:56.320]  It's over because the number of people who are, you know, the government is a parasite.
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:02.320]  It's an economic parasite. And just so they can live in the style to which they are accustomed,
[1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:05.320]  there have to be far fewer parasites than the hosts.
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:09.320]  We hosts vastly outnumber the parasites of the government.
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:14.320]  And they know it and they fear us. And if we start to withdraw our consent,
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:18.320]  as is happening with the Federal Reserve, they are in big trouble.
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:23.320]  Absolutely. And the more they try to hide it, the more they try to abscond with the truth,
[1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:28.320]  the more it blows up in their face. I mean, coming out and building this whole control grid
[1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:34.320]  to try to block our peaceful revolution against them, that's only going to intensify the resistance.
[1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:36.320]  It only proves our point.
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:49.320]  Lou Rockwell, back in 70 Seconds, stay with us.
[2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:11.320]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:15.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:00:15.320 --> 2:00:18.320]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:21.320]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:25.320]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:30.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:36.320]  which are sometimes sponsored by ours.
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:42.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:45.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:54.320]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:01:05.320]  During war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:10.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:13.320]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:23.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  Blue Rockwell at www.bluerockwell.com.
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:34.320]  And the Von Mies Institute on Ron Paul's right hand men is joining us today.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:38.320]  For another 20 minutes or so, let's take a few calls in the next segment.
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:41.320]  Mr. Rockwell, you know, you say people are waking up to the tyranny and I agree with you.
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:45.320]  I see an awakening that's exponential, that's parabolic.
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:47.320]  But the system doesn't care.
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:50.320]  And it's got a lot of brainwashed paramilitary police on power trips.
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:51.320]  They'll do what they're told.
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:57.320]  I remember watching Governor Ridge six years ago, Homeland Security just been set up publicly.
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:00.320]  As we know, Clinton gave speeches about it in 93 and 94.
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:03.320]  How Northcom, how they wanted to set it up and have an army on the streets of America.
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:05.320]  This has all been planned bipartisan.
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:11.320]  But the key here is, he said to have a job, to have an ID card, buy and sell, total control.
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:13.320]  We're going to track and categorize everything you do.
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:18.320]  And what you see in the airports, that type of security, it's going to be in the malls,
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.320]  in the bus terminals, in the subways.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:27.320]  And now in Boston, New York, Houston, Dallas, they have these viper teams, federal marshals, others.
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  TSA, as you know, is taking over.
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.320]  And they're saying everyone in New York, everyone in Boston will now be searched.
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:41.320]  I have pass stations to run security screening test, cutting edge, passive millimeter wave technology.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:44.320]  This is the one that scans your neck and body, puts it on a hard drive.
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:45.320]  I mean, it's more human than human.
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:50.320]  I say more human, it even shows the pores on a woman's breast and your genitalia.
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:51.320]  Total humiliation.
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  People are going to march their sons and daughters through even, I guess.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:59.320]  So the feds will now have a biometric 360 scan of our body.
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:02.320]  Your comments on that, Lou Rockwell.
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  Well, you know, we have to remember that the central government is in effect a criminal gang.
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:10.320]  It lives off the theft by taxation.
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:13.320]  And it lives offline by propaganda.
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.320]  And there's no end to what they would like to do to us.
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:24.320]  So yes, this, the nude pictures of the airport and so forth, where they're all, I'm sure, yucking it up and passing things around.
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:28.320]  It's just, that's, I mean, it's a peek at what the government is like.
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:30.320]  But it's, you know, sort of think of like the mafia.
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  Only the mafia.
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:35.320]  I don't want to condemn the mafia too much because they actually provide services people want to buy.
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:38.320]  The government doesn't provide services people want to buy.
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:40.320]  That's why it wants to use force to get your money.
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:46.320]  So again, this is a bunch that thinks nothing, for example, of killing a million people in Iraq.
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:50.320]  Unfortunately, not too many Americans care about that either.
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:52.320]  They're killing people in Afghanistan.
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:56.320]  They have these 700 military bases all over the world.
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:02.320]  And, you know, it's a killing operation as well as a theft operation, the government.
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:05.320]  So I think we all have to realize that nothing is beyond them.
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:11.320]  And the only way that we have any chance of holding them back is by teaching ourselves, by learning what's going on,
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:18.320]  by reading, by watching, and by being, being observant and just becoming aware of everything.
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:20.320]  And not buying any other tricks.
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.320]  I mean, let's talk about some of the tricks because they have constant tricks.
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:29.320]  But for those that don't know, the news only shows you a still image on the screen of your genitalia and says,
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  yeah, your naked to set that precedent of humiliation, taking the shoes off as a submission ritual.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:38.320]  I read the psychological warfare documents on that that have been leaked.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.320]  It's all about training you to be a slave to answer questions to be lined up.
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:49.320]  But what they really have is a 360 naked image of you for their biometric cameras to identify you on the street.
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:50.320]  Go ahead, Lou.
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:51.320]  Well, it's true.
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:54.320]  And I, you know, that whole shoe business is, of course, ridiculous.
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:59.320]  You said, thank goodness that guy didn't, didn't try a pants bomb shoe bomb.
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:06.320]  So it's, you know, if you go to the airport, you understand exactly how the federal government would like all of society.
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:09.320]  That is, you're in a line, you're subservient.
[2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:11.320]  If you even look in the eye, you're in danger.
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:13.320]  You have to do everything they say.
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:14.320]  There's no freedom of speech.
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:16.320]  And that's all socialized.
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:17.320]  Of course, it's a socialist.
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:19.320]  It's the way communism is around.
[2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:23.320]  The TSA is a socialist operation like everything else from the federal government.
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:26.320]  The Pentagon, they're all, they, these are all socialist operations.
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:31.320]  And just as like socialism all over the world, national socialism, international socialism.
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:36.320]  This is a very crude, a very brutal bunch.
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:39.320]  And, you know, they would like us all to be their victims.
[2:05:39.320 --> 2:05:41.320]  However, we don't have to be their victim.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:47.320]  Well, what about 10th Amendment challenges to the TSA waddling around with their illegal alien screeners?
[2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:48.320]  And that's come out in the news.
[2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.320]  A lot of them are illegal aliens.
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:51.320]  Yeah, well, magnificent 10th Amendment challenges.
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:53.320]  Yeah, yeah, stay there. Lou Rockwell.
[2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:54.320]  Always amazing to talk to Lou Rockwell.
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:56.320]  Your call is coming up in a lot more.
[2:05:56.320 --> 2:05:57.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:05:57.320 --> 2:05:59.320]  The M4's Money Bomb is in full swing.
[2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:22.320]  Stay with us.
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:56.320]  Thank you.
[2:06:56.320 --> 2:07:01.320]  Thanks for watching.
