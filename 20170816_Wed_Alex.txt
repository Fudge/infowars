[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Government is the problem.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:18.000 --> 00:26.000]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:36.000 --> 00:46.000]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. We're live worldwide on this Wednesday, the 16th day of August 2017.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:49.000 --> 00:58.000]  Whenever I get really, really upset at the globalist involved in such incredible evil, and it gets me a little bit saddened or depressed to see how they're lying,
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  how they're trying to divide us in the name of unity, when I see how they're trying to kill our economy, when I see how they're trying to deceive us.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  I then see beautiful, wonderful things happen.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  Like Heather Hare, the poor young lady that died in Charlottesville last Saturday.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Her mother, Susan Brough, and her father at a big memorial service going on right now.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  And we've backed it up. It's still happening, but we've backed up to the beginning of her statements.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  We're going to have, we're going to have Heather Hare's father's statements today as well, but they're still live right now.
[01:29.000 --> 01:42.000]  And then later in the hour, I'm going to play the 20 minute press conference excerpts of it, where the media is such clear enemies of America and our recovery and of unity and just frothing liars.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  And Trump's responses are amongst the most epic I've ever seen when he takes on fake news.
[01:47.000 --> 02:02.000]  But let's go out to break with the first few minutes of just the loving words of Susan Brough, the mother of the young lady who got run over last Saturday in Charlottesville in that nightmare situation that tears the heart out of any parent.
[02:02.000 --> 02:12.000]  Because the fact that only four or five days later, she's able to come out and show so much love and humility really, really touched I know my heart and your hearts as well.
[02:12.000 --> 02:22.000]  So here is this amazing level of love calling for unity and not calling for the media to use her for hate and to use her for further division in America.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  Here is part of that statement.
[02:24.000 --> 02:37.000]  To spread, I don't want this to die. This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy. This is not the end of Heather's legacy.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  You need to find in your heart that small spark of accountability. What is there that I can do to make the world a better place?
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  What injustice do I see? And what to turn away? I don't really want to get involved in that. I don't want to speak up.
[02:55.000 --> 03:06.000]  They'll be annoyed with me. My boss might think less of me. I don't care. You poke that finger at yourself like Heather would have done and you make it happen.
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  You take that extra step. You find a way to make a difference in the world.
[03:14.000 --> 03:25.000]  My child had high school education. My child was no saint. She was hard to raise because everything was a negotiation.
[03:25.000 --> 03:34.000]  Not kidding, but you know what? She was a firm believer in whatever she believed.
[03:34.000 --> 03:46.000]  Let's do that. Let's find that spark of conviction. Let's find in ourselves that action. Let's spread this. Let's have the uncomfortable dialogue.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  It ain't easy sitting down and saying, well, why are you upset?
[03:50.000 --> 04:00.000]  It ain't easy sitting down and going, yeah, well, I think this way and I don't agree with you, but I'm going to respectfully listen to what you have to say.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  We're not going to sit around and shake hands and go kumbaya, and I'm sorry, it's not all about forgiveness.
[04:07.000 --> 04:13.000]  I know that that's not a popular trend, but the truth is we are going to have our differences.
[04:13.000 --> 04:24.000]  We are going to be angry with each other, but let's channel that anger not into hate, not into violence, not into fear,
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  but let's channel that difference, that anger into right this action.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  Right now, down the road, there's a blood drive going on in Heather's name.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  Right now, there are people who are here willing to listen to one another and talk to one another.
[04:42.000 --> 04:52.000]  Last night in New England, they had a peaceful rally in Heather's name to have some difficult dialogues.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  If you ever want to see...
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  All right, we're going to come back with more of this after the break.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  The bottom line here is the globalist.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Why is the problem, why is the need taking over?
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  What is going on? What has changed?
[05:06.000 --> 05:14.000]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  It's available at mforestore.com. We also have free shipping.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  Order $50 or more and 10% off.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  We also have auto-ship additionally on top of that.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  I want to get your reviews on here, which you have to say.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  For me, it's been a crowd.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  Myco ZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast, get it today.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Limited around, it'll be months until we get more.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  mforestore.com, foreslives.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight harder.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Look at the response we're getting.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  We were changing the world together.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  You are the mforestore. God bless you all.
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:04.000 --> 06:07.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  and winning because of your support.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  Caveman is finally back at the info war store.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  or by calling toll free triple a 253 3139.
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by EmRick's Essentials.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  Perfect for face and body.
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  This natural unscented sunscreen can be worn at all times of the day whenever you need sun protection.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  We source ingredients from nature, producing a product free of harmful chemicals and toxins.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide, which is the largest particle size used,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  and we do not use nanoparticles.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.

[08:23.000 --> 08:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 16th day of August 2017.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  I'll be riding shotgun with Owen Schreuer.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  Today I'm on the ground in Seattle, Washington.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  We'll also have Dr. Steve Pacinic popping in to look at the SIOP.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  He was the former head of SIOP operations at the State Department and the CIA.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  The SIOP, the media is running off of these race riots.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  They're trying to start around the country.
[09:01.000 --> 09:10.000]  And the teardown of historical monuments, which again is just a trigger to get people fighting with each other.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  We're going to be looking at that.
[09:11.000 --> 09:19.000]  We have an ongoing live event, a vigil with Heather Hare's mother, Susan Bro, and her father.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  Very, very powerful.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  The things they're saying will play some clips of that and some live clips.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  But the big elephant in the room as usual is Donald Trump.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  And boy, what a magnificent elephant he is.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  I watched that 20-minute press conference yesterday and I watched it again this morning.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  We're going to play basically all of it today.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  But I'm going to start about five minutes in when he goes to questions.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  And then later we're going to look at what he actually tried to say.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  Because the media wants Trump to fail.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Globalists want free market nations to fail.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  They want the social context and the social contract of a free market system to fail.
[10:01.000 --> 10:19.000]  Because globalism and technocracy and all forms of authoritarianism from crony capitalism to communism to socialism to oligarchies to, you name it, do not work one-one millionth as good as a free market system.
[10:19.000 --> 10:28.000]  We've only achieved maybe 20-30% true free market behavior at the U.S.'s peak that ended around 100 years ago.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  Where we had 10% growth rates from the time this country founded right through until the Civil War and then on after.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  Now they call 3% good.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  The globalists picked the winners and losers.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  They want a nation of renters.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  They want control.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's in their white papers.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  And here's Trump saying, 4 trillion stock market, 400 billion new jobs, million and a half new jobs, 3 million more.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Over a thousand companies moved back.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  Border more secured than ever.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  Pulled you out of unelected TPP.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Pulled you out of the carbon taxes.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Got a good Supreme Court justice in.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  Got them off the back of the Second Amendment.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  On and on and on and on and on.
[11:04.000 --> 11:14.000]  And building, if anything is true affirmative action, they are directing through federal grants and federal tax credits over 100 factories, large ones.
[11:14.000 --> 11:21.000]  And then the president's put out a list of these on White House.gov that are being built in predominantly black areas.
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  And we're talking starting $20 an hour, other jobs, $35, $40, $50 an hour.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And then they're even setting up the skilled centers for the training for the entry level.
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.000]  And so you can talk about factories where they are in the neighborhood and where they predominantly hire people out of the neighborhood after they're given the skill set to get in there.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  That is empowerment.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  That is giving people what they really want.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  All the studies show to break the back of what you call classism or tribalism.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  You always have to have upward mobility and economy, and then that unifies the people around prosperity.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  The globalists don't want unity.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  They want divide and conquer that's admitted.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  I want to play a few minutes of Heather Hare's mother, Susan Bro, who was just speaking.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  She's still speaking live.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  We have the streams on infowars.com.
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  We're live in a play a few minutes of what she said a few minutes ago where she was talking about, you know, my daughter is not a victim because she wanted to go fight.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Not violently, but fight for what she believed in.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  And so her mother is proud of her.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  This is really the essence of not being a victim.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  The globalists want to use her daughter for division, for ethnic conflict.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  The globalists want this.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  It's amazing.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  But you look at Trump's press conference and how he destroyed the fake news.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  It was so powerful.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  They said, why are people leaving the manufacturing board?
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  Because he can't get Merck under armor to move their factories back.
[12:51.000 --> 13:03.000]  He put them on the boards, hundreds of groups to give them good deals and to find out how they're getting screwed by China, India, Mexico and others to be able to have a two way street to come back.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  And then they didn't want to move back.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  He was even letting people move back 10%.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  Just he's telling Apple.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  Let me tell you something.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  You can keep your $400 billion or whatever it is you got overseas.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  You didn't pay taxes on.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  You're going to move that money back here.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  You're going to spend it here.
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  And let me tell you something too.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  You can keep your factories in China, but you're going to build some new ones here.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  You're going to give us something.
[13:23.000 --> 13:33.000]  I mean, that's somebody literally that doesn't have a globalist, elitist, blue blood attitude of screwing you over and breaking your wills in America by breaking this economy.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  That's all coming up.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  But first, let's go to a mother who's stronger than I am.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  I don't know about four or five days later after this happened to my daughters or my son.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  I think this lady is a lot more tough than I am.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  And the way she said, we appreciate what President Trump said.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  We appreciate him talking about unity.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  She said his statement was not insensitive.
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  The first statement or the second or the third, she's come out defending Trump because this lady's got a lot of class.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  And I want to hear, I haven't heard what the husband said yet or the father.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  I've heard it was powerful too, but that's coming up.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  Let's play a few minutes of her.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  We're going to carry Heather's spark through.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  So remember in your heart, if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  And I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong, don't ignore it, don't look the other way.
[14:21.000 --> 14:28.000]  You make a point to look at it and say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference?
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I got to give her up, we're going to make it count.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  All right, that's powerful.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  We're going to play extensively around the game.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  And her father, because there's the more we haven't gotten to yet.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  And here's the deal.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  I don't know her daughter, Heather Hare, but there are a lot of people that go out to these anti-racism rallies who really have seen the KKK.
[14:56.000 --> 15:06.000]  They really have seen, you know, these unsavory groups do stuff, but they've also seen Hollywood that put out about, what, 150 movies the last three years about this to really make this painful.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  The people that have, you know, hearts.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's like the reports of little kids that see the modern environmental shows where the bunnies are dying, the polar bears are drowned.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  And then they see a condo being built and they cry.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I've talked to parents where, you know, they're six-year-old cries and falls out on their knees.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  One of my daughter's friends, when they were younger, she said, yeah, no, they cry.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  She cried and said, we're killing the bunnies.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  And basically, you know, said, I want to die for the bunnies.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  And in Australia, you can Google this, ABC News Australia.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  That's the Australian Broadcasting News, not our ABC, but it's international TV.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  It was eight years ago, Paul Watson wrote about it.
[15:44.000 --> 15:53.000]  They had a video game and a cartoon for kids where you have a carbon footprint and as you live and eat food and live, it chops the heads off of bunnies and puppies and kittens.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  And then in the game, though, you commit suicide and win the game and then all the bunnies can live.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  And you just quietly go into a little room.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  You agree to commit suicide at a euthanasia center.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  And how sick is that?
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  Teaching you to kill yourself so David Rockefeller has more power, Lord Rothschild has more power.
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.000]  They're cutting off your life force and teaching you your evil so you get out of the way, but not before you're played off against each other.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  And I'm not saying that happened with Heather Hare.
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  She was there believing she was standing up against something evil.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  And there was some evil she was standing up against.
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  That's what Donald Trump said in his press conference that's coming up at the bottom of the hour that I'm going to analyze live here with Owen Schreuer,
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  because he said there were good people on the side of the left and there were good people on the side of the right.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  There were reporters.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  There were people that are interested in history.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  There were people that just came out to see what was happening.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  Yeah, our reporters were there and got attacked and the police stood down and then you had bad groups on both sides.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  But it was the group on the left that came in there with clubs and things beating people against the group that had a permit.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  Is it okay to attack a group that has a permit and have it stand down?
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  I don't care if you're the new Black Panther Party, basically a black KKK group.
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  You have a right to your rally.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  You have a right to not be attacked.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  I don't care if you're an idiot KKK group.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  You have a right to your rally.
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  The media is going to edit that all together and say that I love the KKK or I love this and that because they're liars.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  That's why MSNBC and CNN are so hated.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  I get up here to show you Washington Post where a Jewish reporter got caught staging attacks on Jewish centers and how Trump was right.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And how we've caught other Jewish groups doing.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  I'm not bashing Jews when I do that.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  George Soros is a Nazi.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  He's funding groups to go out and do this to control Jews and get them under his control for his political agenda.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Just like they're attacking other folks and other racial groups and other religious groups.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  And then the media says, oh, I'm anti-Semitic.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  That's a load of crap.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  George Soros is a listed enemy of Israel in the WikiLeaks.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  He wants its overthrow.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  I don't.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  I'm reporting the truth because they said Trump was anti-Semitic.
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.000]  When he said he thought leftists were staging attacks on Jews to say he was anti-Semitic.
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  How did Trump in his first speech to Congress earlier this year have to quote address and say he's against the attacks on Jewish centers?
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  Of course he's against the attacks on Jewish centers.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  It's like if women are getting raped.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  Do they call me up and say, Alex, to cry this woman that got raped in New York City?
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  Well, of course I'm against rape.
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  Well, it's the same thing.
[18:22.000 --> 18:31.000]  Oh, somebody's turning over Jewish headstones and putting pain on synagogues and death-threading them every day and with telephone calls.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  Is it your supporters, Trump?
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Say you're sorry.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  Trump says, I am sorry for that.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  I like Jews in Israel and I think leftists are doing this to make it look like I'm anti-Semitic.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  Oh, you're saying Jews do false flags.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  No, I'm saying leftists do it, who happen to be Jewish against other Jews to control them.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  Absolutely correct, Mr. President.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  You were proven correct yet again.
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  But again, MSNBC and CNN and George Soros, the known Nazi collaborator,
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  working to fund Palestinians to literally stab Jews to death in the streets and in their houses and our media.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  Then when a Palestinian kills three Jews in their own house a few weeks ago, it happens every day, every few days.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  They set on the news a Palestinian was shot in an apartment.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  Doesn't tell you there was pools of blood and three dead Jews or there's a suicide bombing.
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  And then they, you know, shoot somebody who was with them and they go, oh, you know, they go, oh, three Israeli police shot somebody.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  They don't tell you that the guy had a suicide bomb.
[19:30.000 --> 19:39.000]  This is how it's crazy it is where the media and Soros and all this are clearly anti-state of Israel, anti-right wing state of Israel.
[19:39.000 --> 19:46.000]  But then meanwhile, they project on everybody else where we've got to bow down that we're against blacks and we're against women and we're against gays.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  And we're, well, none of it's even true.
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.000]  We're against globalism and ending our sovereignty and being poor and being enslaved and not having religious freedom and radical, unvetted,
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  and muzzles being brought in by the millions.
[19:57.000 --> 20:10.000]  We'll be back with Elwin Shroyer, President Trump's presentation.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  Katie Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market and we've succeeded.
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  With the release of our CQB technology, we now offer the most comfortable, concealable rifle threat body armor available.

[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[21:02.000 --> 21:10.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[21:28.000 --> 21:35.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.

[23:58.000 --> 24:14.000]  We are live, my friends, on this global transmission, the Wednesday 16th of August 2017.
[24:14.000 --> 24:23.000]  We had Milo Unopolis in studio a few weeks ago, but we taped an exclusive interview that's the interview that Meg and Kelly should have done.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  We're actually asking a lot of hard questions.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  We're going to premiere that here on radio in the third hour.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  Oh, and Troy is going to be taking your phone calls in the second hour and fourth hour today.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  And Dr. Steve Pacinic is going to be popping in, but here's the bottom line.
[24:37.000 --> 24:47.000]  MSN is not real media. The very fake news of CNN and of MSNBC, and now Fox to a great extent, is globalist owned.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  They're the multinationals taking the country over.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  They're the ones exploiting our jobs.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  They're the ones that want a consolidated economy, not a growing economy.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  They're the ones that tell Africans they can't have cars and air conditioning, but it's okay because Obama's black.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  The greatest form of racism is classism.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  The greatest form of discrimination is systems that seek to make the general public poor to control them.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  It's called feudalism. It's called serfdom.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  It's been the most popular ongoing form of governance in world history.
[25:15.000 --> 25:23.000]  In fact, it was the only form of governance until about 2,200 years ago in Greece.
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  And their pure democracy was a bucket of black rocks, a bucket of white rocks.
[25:29.000 --> 25:39.000]  And if the ruling class could vote, only men that were landed and titled, they would vote with the rocks on what they were going to do, a straight up vote.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  They also voted routinely to kill people.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  So they didn't like what you said. They'd have a vote and throw it off the cliff or make a drink, a hemlock.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  So these are cold-blooded globalists that are running things.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  They're psychopaths, they're sociopaths.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  They hate the American system. They hate the largesse of it.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  They hate the freedom of the Renaissance, the spoiledness of the public.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  Maybe we don't deserve it. Maybe we're not smart enough for what Trump's trying to open the door to.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  He didn't invent this. He's trying to bring it back.
[26:03.000 --> 26:13.000]  But there are losers in this video coming up in the next segment of his press conference when he's giving you all the evidence of the uphill delivery of victory
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  and real economy for the average person and not letting rigged elites have crony capitalism and pick winners.
[26:19.000 --> 26:27.000]  And the media is just frothing like wild dogs on chains trying to get at the lion that's out there and just spewing everything.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  And he is so balanced. He's so accurate. He's so focused. He's so confident.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  It's incredible. So you ought to yourself to see what he actually said versus snippets edited together.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  Owen Troyer, you're going to be riding shotgun here today. Do you concur with my analysis or what's your break down?
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  I thought that the press conference yesterday was one of the greatest press conferences I've ever heard.
[26:49.000 --> 27:01.000]  I think it's beyond pathetic, beyond words, beyond comprehension that we can tune into mainstream media over the course of the 18 hours or whatever it is since that press conference.
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  And they still say Trump yet to denounce white supremacy, Trump yet to denounce the violence at the rallies.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  It's just cold, blooded lies, just straight up lies.
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  And what I'm hoping, and it wasn't the case if you tuned into C-SPAN today, a bunch of callers fell for it, is that America can see through the mainstream media lies.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  You would think this is as basic as it gets.
[27:26.000 --> 27:33.000]  Oh, and I totally agree. Here's the problem with C-SPAN. They now scream the calls. They ask, do you think he's a racist or do you not think he's a racist?
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  Or are you not sure? They do Republican, Democrat, independent, or they do think Trump's bad, think Trump's good, not sure.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  Okay, so you've got to basically lie on the call screen to get through.
[27:43.000 --> 27:52.000]  But absolutely, we need to get Darren McBreen or one of the people now, not tomorrow, not next week, because no one will care then, to show him denounce it on Saturday,
[27:52.000 --> 28:02.000]  show him denounce it on Monday, and then show him again denounce it on Tuesday, and show him say, I denounce it, I denounce it, I denounce racism, come together.
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.000]  Love, love, love, I denounce it, come together. But in between, show them going, he won't denounce it, he won't denounce it, he never denounced it, he still hasn't denounced it.
[28:10.000 --> 28:20.000]  And then say, oh, do you remember this? Do you remember when he said 10 years ago, I don't like David Duke just randomly when somebody brought him up?
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  Then he said it before, then he said it on the campaign. Then in one press conference, he said it like four times, and they kept saying three minutes later, you never denounced it.
[28:28.000 --> 28:36.000]  So we need to show people how they did that. Oh, and why won't you denounce rape? Why won't I denounce it? Well, we have denounced it, but we didn't do it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  The point is, it's pure dumb, dumb level to put out some moral outrage, so really stupid people in the public.
[28:43.000 --> 28:52.000]  This is really a stupid person test. Consider and feel moral outrage and call in and go, yeah, he never denounced it. How stupid do they feel?
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  Or how stupid are these people? I mean, are these the type of folks that buy powerball lotteries? And I'm not saying that you buy the lotteries for fun, you're bad.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  But if it's your business model, if it's your business plan to buy lottery tickets, taking you're going to win, is this the same type of useful idiot someone?
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.000]  I assume as much. I mean, I don't understand the type of person. You know what it is, though, Alex? I think it's that people, they don't know.
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.000]  They've never heard Trump say anything. What they do is they walk through the gym or they walk through the cafe or they walk through the restaurant and they just see the television
[29:20.000 --> 29:26.000]  and on the bottom line it says Trump yet to denounce or they have a push notification on their cell phone and it just says Trump racist.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  They don't actually know the context. They don't know the content.
[29:29.000 --> 29:37.000]  That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. You just hit it. They've been watching it in hotels and in restaurants where I am with their stuff on TV.
[29:37.000 --> 29:47.000]  It says Trump defends KKK. Trump refuses to stay no or Michael Moore says he is a Nazi. He is a racist and they just see that or they read it in the newspaper headline.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  They're not paying attention and they believe it.
[30:17.000 --> 30:21.000]  We're hosting this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  You cannot sell something unless it helps somebody and you can't support an organization that didn't fight hard.
[30:52.000 --> 31:18.000]  Look at the response we're getting. We were changing the world together. You are the info work. God bless you all.
[31:22.000 --> 31:37.000]  That's what I'm talking about and when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[31:37.000 --> 31:47.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[31:47.000 --> 31:55.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[31:55.000 --> 32:21.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infoorstore.com.
[32:21.000 --> 32:48.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. And this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:48.000 --> 32:59.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[32:59.000 --> 33:15.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:15.000 --> 33:24.000]  Alright, I'm going to skip the connection network break coming up because I want to play most of Trump's press conference, at least from the point we started taking questions.
[33:24.000 --> 33:41.000]  And then we're going to later, McGreen did put together a compilation of Trump's six minutes long disavowing David Duke, the KKK and then disavowing it again and again and again with time stamps showing how the media poses and says, why have you never?
[33:41.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's been months and months and years and years into him disavowing. And the new stuff where he where he decried Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, they don't care. They keep saying, why won't you disavow? Why won't you disavow?
[33:56.000 --> 34:04.000]  Lying to their viewers lying to you. And it's just like Owen Schreuer said earlier. This is happening is the average person is just reading notifications on their phones.
[34:04.000 --> 34:15.000]  Or they're reading Yahoo News at the restaurant or at the store or they're reading Google. That's why they hate Drudge because he could actually take what Trump really said or they hate him for wars.
[34:15.000 --> 34:24.000]  We can actually have real quotes, real video. There's a war against reality. These people are in a war against reality. This morning I was in a hotel restaurant.
[34:24.000 --> 34:35.000]  I was looking at people on their laptops. And it was headline. I was on Yahoo News. Obama, you know, concerned Trump won't decry racism.
[34:35.000 --> 34:48.000]  And I saw other headlines saying the same thing. And I'd get up to get some more coffee or whatever. And I'd walk by and read what they were reading just to see and they were just all sitting there, not even reading the actual articles.
[34:48.000 --> 34:56.000]  Because you read the articles at the bottom, they'll actually say the truth a lot of times. It's the top and the first few paragraphs are incredible.
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  They're absolutely incredible the way they deceive you. But I know as an audience, you understand that. It's just that it's getting more and more intense.
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  Now, the number one thing folks can do is understand this. We're under globalist attack. They're trying to take our sponsors are trying to shut us down.
[35:11.000 --> 35:21.000]  But because of you, we're still moving forward. And I have committed to you to bring you the very best books, films, water filtration, air filtration, non GMO heirloom seeds, you name it.
[35:21.000 --> 35:30.000]  And we have the biggest special in our history, last month's special and this month's special combined, because folks love specials.
[35:30.000 --> 35:39.000]  And because Buzzfeed tried to shut us down, send us to one of these California labs with the highest standards in the world, California standards, they failed to find any toxins, any metals.
[35:39.000 --> 35:47.000]  So they lied about us and said, oh, look, they should sell their vitamin B12 for less. But the very same site sells the best vitamin B12 out there from the studies.
[35:47.000 --> 35:58.000]  They say it's the best. They didn't know that we private labeled it and had it for $12 less. So it's just we show all that on the Buzzfeed special page, just a devastating victory against these lying failures.
[35:58.000 --> 36:05.000]  And that's what they are. They've chosen failure. They've chosen evil. They've chosen not to be productive. They've chosen to serve lies, serve corruption.
[36:05.000 --> 36:14.000]  That's fine. They've chosen their Lord and Savior. Brainforce Plus, incredible, new tropic people love it, super high powered, very, very good.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen. They take, you know, all these bad halogens, put them in the food, the water, they fill the thyroid and other glands.
[36:21.000 --> 36:31.000]  If you don't have the good, clean iodine in there, then the bad ones go in. If there's a radiation event, you get the bad iodine, the radioactive iodine, having the good iodine blocks that.
[36:31.000 --> 36:38.000]  Buzzfeed lab tested and said, it's not potassium iodide. It's not sodium iodide sold everywhere. It's just iodine.
[36:38.000 --> 36:46.000]  So they had to spin each thing. Yes. You know how hard it is to get the actual pure, deep earth type, get the DEA certifications, have it all.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  Because it is a major precursor, a lot of things. We have that Survival Shield X2, 55% off.
[36:52.000 --> 37:03.000]  Secret XII, the one they demonized, 55% off. Biotrucelinium, it is 1776. New super blue mouthwash, 11% off, 1776 with colloidal silver.
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.000]  And of course, with iodine. Amazing, true iodine. We call it true. It's our term, because it's true. That's what nascent means.
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  Everything else calls itself that. They're not. They're the potassium or other types.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  Then they're bound. Then you don't get the absorption. Silver bullet, colloidal silver, 66% off, 30 parts per million.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  Myco ZX, the antifungal, other equation of the probiotic. Caveman, amazing, turmeric, chaga, bee pollen, concentrated.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  The equivalent of, I mean, it's like chicken noodle soup squared, the amount of nutrients and how filling and how good it is for your body.
[37:37.000 --> 37:47.000]  Alexa Pure Breeze, the great air filtration, 149.96. That's got to end on Friday. They were telling me, because they are running out of those amazing ion filter,
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  carbon filter, and two other filtration systems in one unit. Some of our units are $400, $800 still. Used to be a thousand.

[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  It has been your commitment to get great products, support the infowar that is breaking the back of the globalist.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  These loser scumbags recognize it. They're hitting us with everything they got. They're hitting Trump.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  But he was so stalwart. He was so strong up there in the face of all their lies.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  I've never seen a lawyer. I've never seen me in press conferences, and I do a good job.
[38:39.000 --> 38:49.000]  I've never seen anybody slice people up, not Johnny Cochran, not F. Lee Bailey, not Barack Obama, who's a great public speaker, not Bill Clinton.
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.000]  I have not even Nigel Farage, and he's about as good as it gets. He's better than me.
[38:55.000 --> 39:08.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, he sliced them into minced meat and devastated them with pure truth, with honor, with balance, with love, with reconciliation, with unity.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  And the mother and the father of the poor lady that died, they recognize that.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  They're saying, don't use our daughter for this. She died standing up for what she believed in, but they don't care. They're still going to use her.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  Oh, and I want to start getting to this powerful press conference. We may have to go five minutes to the next hour to get to all of it.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  But I mean, it's just, I don't want to sit here and just grovel at Trump, but he deserves it.
[39:29.000 --> 39:39.000]  Uphill battle. Entity are coming after his family. Behind the scenes, I know the preachers he prays with, he really is getting, in fact, Gary Haven was going to get into it.
[39:39.000 --> 39:48.000]  He never got into it when he host on Thursday. I want him to spend 20 minutes on some of the top preachers in the country that are personal friends with Trump and their private prayer meetings,
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  because they said, no, they don't care if it gets out, actually. What Trump does behind the scenes, he wants it. He believes it. He knows it.
[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I separately have had private conversations about God with Trump. I'm not going to get into those, but he's talked about how he was always been a Christian,
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.000]  but was more focused on life as kids, his family. He just loved God. It wasn't like he was a Pharisee having to just sail on the Christian and being all fake.
[40:09.000 --> 40:18.000]  He didn't like those people. But under the attack of the campaign and what he went through and Christians loving him and laying hands on him and things that happen around the country.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  He said he never felt any energy like it. And now he's becoming a super deep Christian. And who wouldn't under the pressure he's under?
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  And then delivering on the economy. Let me tell you something. I've always been a Christian too. But going through the stuff I've been through, it gets you real close to God.
[40:34.000 --> 40:43.000]  I can feel the Holy Spirit right now. And Trump can feel it. And he's addicted. That's what God gives you when you go through persecution, folks, is you get addicted to the Holy Spirit.
[40:43.000 --> 40:51.000]  It's a good addiction. And Trump has got the Holy Fire of the Holy Spirit. Well, it's called a fire, folks. You start burning once you get it.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  I mean, you heard Pastor Brown on. I think he's coming back on what's today or tomorrow. Pastor Brown was on fire. We were finishing each other's sentences when we were on.
[41:00.000 --> 41:11.000]  He's an incredible speaker because it's the fire of God. And we were seeing that in Trump, standing against the hyenas, standing against those that want to make us poor, standing against those that are lying,
[41:11.000 --> 41:21.000]  standing against those that want to enslave us so they can control us and dictate our surrender, standing and razor blade sharp, slicing everything they said to pieces perfectly.
[41:21.000 --> 41:29.000]  I mean, I'd give him a 99.9. He barely stumbled for one half second one time as they're screaming at him and hissing and yelling.
[41:29.000 --> 41:40.000]  I mean, he was just so manly. It was so strong. It was so honorable. It's the opposite of looking at a Michael Moore or a Nancy Pelosi that makes me feel dishonored even looking at him.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  I was Troyer.
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  Well, it was one of those press conferences for me that I couldn't step away from. I couldn't turn away from. I couldn't get my ear off of.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  I had to hear the whole thing. I actually went back and listened to it again. It was so amazing.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  And what he's doing with these press conferences is he's providing an opportunity for people who actually want to get involved.
[41:59.000 --> 42:06.000]  People who actually want to be involved with taking this country back. He's giving them the opportunity to say, hey, look, I'm not perfect.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  I'm not going to be agreeing with you on everything, but we're going to make America first. We're going to come together as Americans.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  And anybody who wants to be informed knows this. So they're going to get on board and this is going to happen.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  The problem is we have LARPers out there and we have people who just read the push notifications who don't know anything.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  They don't know what's going on. You look at the video you covered where they take down the statue in North Carolina.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  And then what are these people doing? They're kicking the statue. They're spitting on the statue.
[42:31.000 --> 42:39.000]  They're punching the statue, flicking it off, an inanimate object. They've never been slaves. They've never seen slavery in America.
[42:39.000 --> 42:47.000]  They don't even understand true racism. But yet here they are in a park pretending like they've actually done something that actually defeated the slave owner.
[42:47.000 --> 42:55.000]  Look at me. I've defeated the slave owner. I've defeated racism. No, you're kicking a statue. That right there is the mindset of these people.
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.000]  So I don't know how we can get the numbers on our side, but I think we're going to find that they're on our side when we go to the polls.
[43:01.000 --> 43:09.000]  I totally agree. And that's what God always gives us is a choice, especially a great nation like this that was founded as Christian.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  We're being given a choice to turn back. We're being given a choice at prosperity. We're being given a choice to really come together.
[43:14.000 --> 43:21.000]  We're being given a real loving president who has courage, who loves God and who really wants to bring folks together.
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  And we've got a bunch of frothing evil liars at the front of the Arab Spring, globalism, world government, the breakdown of the family,
[43:28.000 --> 43:36.000]  hissing and screaming, saying, we run your lives, hyping up a bunch of well-meaning young people who think they're Captain America and are getting a chance to go fight a Nazi.
[43:36.000 --> 43:45.000]  When in reality, George Soros finances almost all of it and he is literally, according to MI6, the real character behind the modern-day specter.
[43:45.000 --> 43:54.000]  Okay, I mean, you cannot make this up. So let's start going to the press conference here. This is right after he breaks down five minutes of incredible real economic news.
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.000]  And then they say, why are people leaving the manufacturing board? Well, he answers it. It's true.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  Merck and Under Armour have been given seven months to just bring something back here.
[44:06.000 --> 44:12.000]  And he's given them all sorts of deals, opportunities, you know, to do this.
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  And our media calls that corrupt. No, that's called free market. That's called nationalism.
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  And then he says, why did you wait so long on the statement? Didn't do that?
[44:21.000 --> 44:28.000]  Again, he talks about gaslighting, how they're brainwashing people, talks about Walmart, says you missed a critical opportunity to bring the country together.
[44:28.000 --> 44:38.000]  This is Walmart with its slave factories. This is just so incredibly sick to see Chelsea Clinton sending out tweets about always be radical, always choose a side, always be aggressive.
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.000]  Basically, don't come together when they're involved in slave factories and stealing people's money and robbing Haitians.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  I mean, this is just such a sick, evil group. Always remember that. Let's start rolling the press conference.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  Why do these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council?
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.000]  Because they're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country.
[45:02.000 --> 45:10.000]  We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country.
[45:10.000 --> 45:19.000]  They're having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look at where their product is made.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  It's made outside of our country. We want products made in the country.
[45:24.000 --> 45:32.000]  Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they're leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside.
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.000]  And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  That's right. Hit pause.
[45:40.000 --> 45:49.000]  Hit pause. Back it up 10 seconds. And it's not like he's just saying that. I read the business pages. I read them online probably 45 minutes a day.
[45:49.000 --> 46:00.000]  It's one of the least areas I do study, but I study it. He's been grilling every day, calling some days 200, 300 companies, having meetings with them a couple of days a week, taking them golfing.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  The big ones. And he's gotten Chinese and Indian and Russian and Mexican companies to move here.
[46:07.000 --> 46:19.000]  Soft Bank, Japan, Mitsubishi, South Korea. And he just does it saying, listen, don't you want to have an economy long term to keep buying your stuff? You can have 50, 50 or 60, 40 even. You got to start next year.
[46:19.000 --> 46:27.000]  I want 10% of your production in the United States. That's what he tells him. And then he's got these guys on his board. He's going, look, I'm going to get you the tax break breaks everything.
[46:27.000 --> 46:35.000]  What do you have to lose? Bring the factories back. Start something here. Make something here. Make the foam that goes in the shoes. Make the fabric or something.
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  Sew it together here. You're going to do something. And he's like, why won't you do it? Because you're a globalist.
[46:41.000 --> 46:51.000]  So again, he's embarrassed them. They're economically hurting America. They're economically knowing that it's part of globalism to make us poor, to make us dependent as part of a strategic plan.
[46:51.000 --> 47:04.000]  And Trump's calling them out. So then they leave when they're the traders on, oh, look at the race stuff. He didn't decry it enough to get little cheap points when they're the ones that actually screwed you over as part of an organized plan of economic warfare
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  against everyone. Here it is.
[47:07.000 --> 47:19.000]  Outside and I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places.
[47:19.000 --> 47:30.000]  You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.
[47:30.000 --> 47:42.000]  Some are saying, oh, he doesn't like Ireland. He singled out Irish. The Irish don't get any of the money. They use this double Irish thing where they mix the money around twice so that the money gets stuck there and stays in banks.
[47:42.000 --> 47:51.000]  Nobody ever gets it with the elites. He's talking about basically offshoring money. But the media spun that that oh, he doesn't want Irish to have jobs. Let's go back to it.
[47:51.000 --> 48:10.000]  I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct. Not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.
[48:10.000 --> 48:23.000]  But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.000]  And it's a very important statement. So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.
[48:31.000 --> 48:49.000]  If you go back to my, in fact, I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. Notice how it's handwritten. As I said on, remember the Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Now here's the thing. Excuse me, excuse me.
[48:55.000 --> 49:02.000]  That's what they hate, is that's the president right there. Here's the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts.
[49:02.000 --> 49:12.000]  Back it up 10 seconds, please. That's what they hate, because that's, I've talked to folks that are around trouble all the time. He may take a few ideas, but he hand writes stuff out. Rarely he hands it off to them to go type it.
[49:12.000 --> 49:21.000]  He wrote his address to Congress. This hasn't happened in like 50, 60 years, folks. I mean, even Kennedy wasn't writing his own statements. Eisenhower was one of the last people to actually write part of his statements.
[49:21.000 --> 49:32.000]  This guy wrote his statements, and you can see it's written in marker. He sat there, watched it, tried to figure out what was going on, came out a few hours after it, wrote a statement.
[49:32.000 --> 49:40.000]  He tweeted while it was happening, instead we decry all this racism. The point is, he's the president's team. No elite wrote that. That's what the elites want control of the big American power.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  That's his big sin, is that he wrote it. He did it. He's real. Let's go back to him.
[49:47.000 --> 49:59.000]  Nice and easy. Here's the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet, as we were speaking.
[49:59.000 --> 50:10.000]  This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don't want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent.
[50:10.000 --> 50:28.000]  In fact, the young woman who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things, and I very much appreciated that.
[50:28.000 --> 50:36.000]  I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman, but her mother on Twitter thanked me for what I said.
[50:36.000 --> 50:51.000]  And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.
[50:51.000 --> 51:06.000]  They don't. They don't. How about a couple of... How about a couple of... Say it, what?
[51:06.000 --> 51:22.000]  The CEO of Walmart sent you Mr. Critical Opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you?
[51:22.000 --> 51:36.000]  We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So the head of Walmart, who I know is a very nice guy, was making a political statement.
[51:36.000 --> 51:53.000]  I mean, I do it the same way, and you know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct. And there was no way of making a correct statement that...
[51:53.000 --> 52:07.000]  You know what's crazy? If they're able to defeat Trump, we're defeating ourselves. I mean, look how God's giving us all this prosperity, all this incredible stuff, right in our face, everything coming, he wants to unlock all the gene editing, all the technology for live extension,
[52:07.000 --> 52:16.000]  that the globalists and the Democrats and Republicans don't want you under Obamacare to have access to all this advanced live extension. He wants you to have access to all of it.
[52:16.000 --> 52:28.000]  I mean, you know, his actions are incredibly real. And he's just surrounded by scum, surrounded by the swamp, and he's trying to turn the economy on for the people. It's amazing. It's just amazing.
[52:28.000 --> 52:41.000]  And then Walmart is this paragon of, oh, getting a political shot in, decrying the fake headlines that he didn't disavow when they lie and say that constantly. They're saying he didn't disavow on Monday now.
[52:41.000 --> 52:52.000]  They're saying he didn't disavow yesterday. When he said that there were people on both sides that came not looking for trouble, who had rights to assemble in America. What about that? Let's go back to the clip.
[52:52.000 --> 53:05.000]  I didn't know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts as they started coming out were very well stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful.
[53:05.000 --> 53:23.000]  You got to understand back when Trump grew up around the same time as my dad. The KKK was so uncool that when I talked about my grandfather standing up to the KKK, my dad went, well, Alex, it wasn't that hard. Everybody hated him. They were all toothless idiots.
[53:23.000 --> 53:36.000]  I mean, okay, yeah, he did, but it's like they were a joke then. The media takes these people, builds them up. Most of them are actors, and it's come out. Most of them are actors. It's totally staged.
[53:36.000 --> 53:52.000]  And the media falls into our trap when they attack me saying, oh, he says they're actors when they've been caught. So many groups out doing this. In fact, put that Charlottesville picture up about the mother and then just a photo of the KKK guys there and look closely at those photos.
[53:52.000 --> 54:04.000]  When I saw those photos, I said, is that a black guy? Because when I saw the KKK guys, it looked like they were partially African American. And that was the weird thing when I've been to these rallies is that it looks like minorities in the KKK office.
[54:04.000 --> 54:19.000]  I mean, I have video of this. This is really like they can't even get real white idiots to go do this. I want to find this guy because, oh, you know, the organizer formerly worked for Obama and worked for Black Lives Matter and worked for Occupy Wall Street and worked for the Democrats.
[54:19.000 --> 54:30.000]  But oh, now he's the leader of it. I mean, see how I'm saying they're always Democrats and just they are. I mean, look at this guy. Look at this guy. And I saw video of him. I saw him. I go, I go, dude, dude, that guy.
[54:30.000 --> 54:43.000]  I mean, that guy does not look like he's, you know, but you know, they let him in the prisons. They let, oh, because they're so lucky I'm being sarcastic. They let people whose mothers are white now.
[54:43.000 --> 54:53.000]  So if your mother is white, you can join the KKK. So you've got these self-hating people who hate their brown side. I mean, I'm proud of my Native American heritage.
[54:53.000 --> 55:03.000]  And then they, I mean, is that a Native American? A lot of the Native Americans, you know, intermarried with blacks. I mean, I don't know. It's just absolutely crazy.
[55:03.000 --> 55:13.000]  But I'm proud of the fact, you know, that I'm not completely Anglo-Saxon or whatever you call it. I'm proud of my Native American roots. But I don't know. Let's just continue here.
[55:13.000 --> 55:20.000]  We're going to go into the next segment with the Trump newscaster. He just destroys them. A real press conference facing down these liars. Here it is.
[55:20.000 --> 55:30.000]  He would have made it sooner. That would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts.
[55:30.000 --> 55:45.000]  It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly because if I would have made a fast statement and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing.
[55:45.000 --> 55:58.000]  The second statement was made after with knowledge, with great knowledge. There's still things, excuse me, there's still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  That's something we know now.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  Was this terrorism and can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist?
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  The driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  He's a loser.
[56:13.000 --> 56:25.000]  You can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That's what I'd call it.
[56:25.000 --> 56:35.000]  Because there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusably.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Cowardly thing.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that?
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  I would echo Maggie's question.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  Can you tell us broadly what you're feeling? Do you still have confidence in the state?
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  What would you say?
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  Look, I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  Hit pause again.
[56:56.000 --> 57:03.000]  He's in New Jersey. He writes it on the back of a piece of paper, his statement. Basically the same thing he said on Twitter while it was happening.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  He's the president. He's smart. He's informed.
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.000]  Bannon is doing the whole strategy of the bills and the legislation and the executive orders to turn the economy back on, because Trump agrees with it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:20.000]  In a big office they've got with white boards. That's what he does with Bannon. But Bannon doesn't tell Trump what to do.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  We're going to go to break here in a moment. Please don't forget.
[57:23.000 --> 57:32.000]  We've taken last month's special and this month's specials and combined them, calling it the BuzzFeed special, because they made me so angry at first, then it was a big joke.
[57:32.000 --> 57:38.000]  When they tested our products and found they were the cleanest out there, California standard, untold, almost no one can do it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Well, you know we're under that scrutiny, obviously, folks.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  I mean, so, you know, we go to the very best cleanest labs, best companies, get the best of private label.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  They have the top labeled B12, $35. They sell on their own operation.
[57:50.000 --> 57:57.000]  We sell it for $17.76, normally about $25. So normally it's still discounted $5, $10, but it's discounted almost $13 right now.
[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  Secret 12, available at infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  And we've got dozens and dozens of products.

[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  You owe it to yourself to support the broadcast.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Where could you fund something more vicious against the new world order with truth?
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  So, savage with the love of victory.
[58:17.000 --> 58:24.000]  Survival Shield X-2, the good halogen. Secret 12, biotrystallinium. Silver Bullet, Myco ZX, caveman.

[58:42.000 --> 58:47.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[59:17.000 --> 59:24.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[59:24.000 --> 59:32.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[59:36.000 --> 59:43.000]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free. Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  I'm too confident in myself to look down on you for what color you are to feel powerful about myself.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I already feel so successful and good. I want to empower you. I want you to empower me.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Now, if you want to run me over and slay me, I don't care what color you are, I'm coming after you.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  But we got a bunch of old white men, a bunch of old globalists wanting to get rid of the family, demonizing the free market economy.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Everything they're doing is to sabotage, to get full control. Owen Schreuer is going to be hosting the rest of the transmission while I'm out here on a work occasion on the West Coast.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  We've got so much coming up today, but let's continue with the powerful press conference where Trump just sabotaged the globalists yesterday.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Tell us broadly what you're feeling. Do you still have confidence in these?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Well, let's see. I like Mr. Bennett. He's a friend of mine.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  But Mr. Bennett came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Mr. Bennett came on very much later than that. And I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist. I can tell you that.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair person that regard.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bennett, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  You have confidence that Senator McCain has called on you to defend your national security advisor, HR McMaster, against the U.S. tax.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I did it the last time.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  And he called on it again, linking the senator McCain to the alt-right.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Senator McCain, you mean the one who voted against Obamacare?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  And he said that...
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care?
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those perpetrated...
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Let's back it up. McCain, the guy that funded the Arab Spring in Al Qaeda and ISIS, McCain of the Keating Five, the Hanoi Hilton.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  McCain just involved in helping get Obamacare passed, who is a Democrat and is the leader of the Democratic Party.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  They admit he is the highest polling member of the Democratic Party who's a male.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  The counterpart, Pocahontas, is the highest polar.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  So, I mean, he's the leader of the Democratic Party.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  That's how the Republicans have sabotaged this country.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  And we're taking back the states, we're taking back the state houses, we're taking back the systems.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  And they know it.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  That's why they're panicking and lying and trying everything they can because it's not working.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And they bring up Bannon, like his first statement was written by Bannon, and it was racist when it wasn't racist and it wasn't written by Bannon.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  Then they bring up John McCain, one of the biggest liars in the world. Here it is.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  These attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Well, I don't know, I can't tell you.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he's talking about.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Define it for me. Come on, let's go. Define it for me.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Senator McCain defined them as the same group.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Okay, what about you?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  I'm going to come back and do some more on this. This is too important, but do you understand how smart Trump is?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  We're going to play more of the clip in a minute.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  He says define alt-right for me.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Because Hillary creates the term nine and a half months ago, says it's everybody that opposes her.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  And then now that it's a new term they own, they can then attach whoever they want to it.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Oh, look, Alex Jones and Donald Trump are alt-right. That's KKK.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  They say alt-right. Then they say, oh, that's KKK.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  And then they say, oh, Stephen Bannon runs it. He's KKK. Just all made up.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  So he says, okay, you define alt-right for me.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Knowing they can't. Knowing it's a trick.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Man, he's good. Let's play another minute of this.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Come on, let's go. Define it for me.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Senator McCain defined them as the same group.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging him?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Let me ask you this. What about the fact that came charging,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Do they have any problem? I think they do.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  You know, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  All right, pause. We're going to break.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  I'm going to come back and play the rest of this. Go to Pachennik.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  He'll be with us about 45 after.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  We're going to play that compilation of where he's disavowed all this over and over again.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  We're putting new compilation on together with the latest things where they're saying he won't disavow.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  M4wars.com is the Patriot site. We now have newswars.com.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  It loads quicker on phones and things like that.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Check out newswars.com. Newswars.com has a lot of exclusive information.

[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  I want to get your reviews on here. What do you have to say?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  For me, it's been a croak.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Mycozx, antifungal, antifungus, antiease.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Get it today. Limited around. We'll be monthly.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  We'll get more.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  M4wars.com, M4wars.com.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Our AAA-2533139.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight harder.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Whoever changed the world together.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  You are the M4war. God bless you all.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  After being sold out for months,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at M4wars.com.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  When bacteria infect your gums,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  it can enter your bloodstream,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  so the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver, and more.

[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  The same team based right here in America
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  that brought you the Alexa Pure Ground Breaking Water Filtration Systems
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  your coworkers, your family, your children,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300-400.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  at infowarstore.com
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  All right, the former head of psychological operations
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  of the State Department, the Army, and other groups
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  is going to give us his expert take on the clear PSYOP.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  I mean, it's in the WikiLeaks to create racial division in America
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  and stop the plan that I don't even know who developed it.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  I remember Pechenik like 10 years ago saying
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  they're going to devolve power back to the Midwest, back to the South.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  We're going to unify everybody around free market
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  and we're going to break the back of the controlled left
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  and the Republican establishment
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  and then the EU's going to implode
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  and then we're going to have the second American Renaissance.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Well, I already kind of had that idea, but Dr. Steve Pechenik,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  obviously talking to his sources inside the government said
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  they were going to support that move.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  And that's why you see the left, the globalist,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  the Republican establishment freaking out
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  with $400 billion in new jobs, $4 trillion in the stock market,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  over a thousand new companies
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and just saying to the president,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  you're a racist, you're a racist, you're a racist.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  When he's given three press conferences
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  saying he decries racism.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  So, more of this throughout the hour.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  I'm going to get out of here and let Pechenik host
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  and take some of your calls at 800-25-99-231
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  on the events, on what you're witnessing,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  on Korea back and down.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  You got to tell you, Scousen's got some great sources, doesn't he?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Boy, I'm telling you about going back forever
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  saying that if they launched those missiles at Guam,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Trump was going to hit them.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  That's the word I got. Notice North Korea back down.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  That's what Pechenik said was probably going to happen as well.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  So, we'll talk about that as well.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  800-25-99-231, 800-25-99-231.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  But first, a great point he made.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  Okay, Thomas Jefferson called for ending slavery
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  in the first declaration, but they struck it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  He was born with slaves.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  He ended up basically marrying one of them.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  There were slaves where they traded horrible slaves.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  They traded good.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  No one's defending the institution of slavery.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  It was out of Arabia and Sudan today.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  The point was England was the first to get rid of it
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  and then would attack ships for 100 years, making it go away.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Part of our Revolutionary War and the 1812 war came,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  England was saying, you can't have slavery.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  2% of America was involved in slavery.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  It's not some guilt we all have
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  and other countries still have it going on.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  It's used to control us.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  So, they say, oh, get rid of Robert E. Lee.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  His Arlington Cemetery is where his farm was.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  He was on the Northern Army.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  He was the head of West Point.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  He didn't want to be in the war.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  But the North engaged in atrocities, so he joined it.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I'm not on the North or the South.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  It was a tragic event engineered by British intelligence
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  to break the country up if you study it.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  But why does Trump, who's a great, wonderful Yankee
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  of the classic sense, love Andrew Jackson?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  He stopped the First Civil War.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Trump is trying to bring America together
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  and stop the globalist plan for civil war.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  We'll see if Pachennik concurs with that.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Because there was a planned civil war.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Trump's fighting that globalist plan.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  We know that.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  We're going to play this clip and come out with Owen Schreuer
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  hosting with Dr. Steve Pachennik of StevePachennik.com.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Co-author with Tom Clancy, so much more.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Founder of Delta Force with General Boykin and Shoemaker.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Let's go ahead, though, and go to that clip
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  and then back to our guest host.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  You call the alt-left is the same as neo-nazis?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  Those people, all of those people, excuse me.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  I've condemned neo-nazis.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  I've condemned many different groups.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  But not all of those people were neo-nazis, believe me.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  Not all of those people were white supremacists
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  by any stretch.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Those people were also there because they wanted to protest
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  So, excuse me.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  And you take a look at some of the groups and you see,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  and you know it if you were honest reporters,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  which in many cases you're not.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  But many of those people were there to protest
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  So, this week it's Robert E. Lee.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  I wonder, is it George Washington next week
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  You know, you really do have to ask yourself,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  where does it stop?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  But they were there to protest.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  Excuse me.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  You take a look the night before.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  They were there to protest the taking down
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Infrastructure question, go ahead.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Should the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up?
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  I would say that's up to a local town, community,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  or the federal government depending on where it is located.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Are you against the confederacy?
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  You're calling the alt-left and white supremacists
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  on the same moral plane.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  What I'm saying is this, you had a group on one side
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  and you had a group on the other and they came at each other
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  and it was a horrible thing to watch.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  But there is another side.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  There was a group on this side, you can call them the left
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  and you've just called them the left,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  that came violently attacking the other group.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  On both sides, sir, you said there was hatred,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  there was violence on both sides.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  I do think there's blame, yes.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  I think there's blame on both sides.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  You look at both sides.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  I think there's blame on both sides.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And I have no doubt about it,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  and you don't have any doubt about it either.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And if you reported it accurately, you would say.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  You killed the person, Heather Huyard.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  They showed up in Charlottesville.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Excuse me.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And you had some very bad people in that group.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  I saw the same pictures as you did.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  You had people in that group that were there to protest,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  taking down to them a very, very important statue
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  George Washington was a slave owner.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Was George Washington a slave owner?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  So will George Washington now lose his status?
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Are we going to take down, excuse me,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  are we going to take down statues to George Washington?
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  How about Thomas Jefferson?
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  What do you think of Thomas Jefferson?
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  You like him?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Are we going to take down the statue?
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Because he was a major slave owner.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  Now we're going to take down his statue.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  So you know what?
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  It's fine.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  You're changing history.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  You're changing culture.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  and the white nationalists,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  because they should be condemned totally.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  and white nationalists, okay?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  but you also had troublemakers,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  and you see them come with the black outfits
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  and with the helmets and with the baseball bats.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  You had a lot of bad,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  you had a lot of bad people in the other group too.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  I just understood what you were saying.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  No.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I just understood what you were saying.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  There were people in that rally,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  and I looked the night before.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  If you look, there were people protesting very quietly,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  But you had a lot of people in that group
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  that were there to innocently protest,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  and very legally protest,
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  because, you know, I don't know if you know,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  they had a permit.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  The other group didn't have a permit.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  So, I only tell you this, there are two sides to a story.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  A horrible moment.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  But there are two sides to the country.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  Does anybody have a final?
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  It's amazing because the media
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  never gave Antifa proper credit for the violence in Charlottesville,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  the stopping of free speech in Charlottesville.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  They never gave Antifa proper credit
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  when they disrupted Trump rallies,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  when they were staging terror attacks to disrupt J-20.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  The media never gave the Democrats proper credit
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  when they had Bob Cramer, Scott Fogle, and Aaron Black
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  on the streets instigating violence.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  They never gave them any credit then.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  But now all of a sudden you'll see the media gives Antifa credit
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  as fighting racism.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  And there's a battle that they have staged for us.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  Excuse me, Steve Prochenick joins us today.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  And you've got the chessboard behind you today.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  I think that that is a very symbolic of where we stand
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  in the fight for America right now,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  how they're trying to move racism around to put us in checkmate.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Let me put it this way.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  I'm not surprised this occurred.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  This is something we talked about a year ago.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  So I said there would be groups that would be pitted against us.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  Now, who's us and who's they?
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  Number one, Richard Spencer.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  He grew up in Boston.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  His father is an ophthalmologist,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  went to all these private schools and colleges,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  never worked a day in his life.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  And he becomes, quote, the head of the Nazi party
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  or whatever you want to call it, the alternative right.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  This is a man who contrived the history that he belongs to Montana.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  I've lived in Montana.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  We don't particularly like him in Montana.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  His mother spoiled him. His father spoiled him.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  And then he creates, quote, a group.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  He's never worked a day in his life.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  He has no idea of what a daily worker's about.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  And he tried to come here, University of Florida in Gainesville.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  I stopped him and a bunch of other people stopped him.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  So we have these intellectuals on the left, so to speak,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  and on the right.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  On the left, I have a singer or a signer, a Jewish kid.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  University of Virginia.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  Both of them went to the University of Virginia.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Both intellectuals, none of them have ever been in anything
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  other than what they want, which is self-aggrandizement,
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  that increased narcissism, and make themselves prominent.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Spencer didn't do anything in his life.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  That's worthy of anything.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  He's a spoiled little brat.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  And signers a spoiled little brat who wants to go to politics
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  and prose on Connecticut Avenue and teach nonfiction.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  So you have these two spoiled little brats coming together
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  with the most ridiculous outfits I've ever seen,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  where you have fully trained and fully equipped soldiers
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  coming down with lanterns or flares as if this was a Nazi rally.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  First of all, neither one understands what the Nazi rally was about.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Secondly, most of them don't understand that Hitler
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  really had about 100,000 Jews in his army.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Now, I didn't make this up.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Hitler's two major field commanders in the Luftwaffe,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  the Blitzkrieg, were full Jews out of five.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  Hitler's right-hand man, Heidrich,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  who was in charge of the extermination of Jews,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  was a Jew from Austria.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  So history is missing in all of this.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  On the left, they forgot that they gave birth to eugenics in Germany.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  It was the left, particularly Stanford University,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  the Rockefeller University,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  and Harvard, who gave the grants and eventually went to Mengele
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  to do the eugenics experiments.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Also, it was Margaret Sanger,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  who inspired everybody to get rid of any child that was not adaptive.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  We'll be right back with more on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  control, and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  That's a tall order.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed,
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  participating whole life insurance.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  That's true.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  while you're alive.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  Get the free life insurance.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Get the free book to find out how.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  Call 702-6607000.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  Do you trust our economy?
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  How about our banking system?
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  and that when the Fed raises interest rates,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  bad things are going to happen.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401K
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  into physical gold or silver with GSI exchange.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  Call 833-GSI-Gold.

[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  and it's money you control, not the big banks.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  833-GSI-Gold.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  Ask about our bank failure survival guide
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  and learn how your qualified IRA transfer can get you $1,500

[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  GSI exchange has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Call GSI exchange.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  Call GSI exchange at 833-GSI-Gold.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  That's 833-474-4653.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  Or visit us on the web at GSI.Gold.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Those times may be near.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Free shipping is included.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  If you had purchased $100 of Bitcoin in 2010, today you'd have $2,600,000.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  While that sinks in, you now have a huge cryptocurrency opportunity
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  at below market price at a guaranteed $0.10 per coin.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Procoin, a coin publicly traded on the open market,
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  easily converted to cash available in 60 countries,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  and you'll be able to get your own currency.net.

[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Owen Schreuer, Dr. Steve Poczenik with you in this segment.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  We will be for the remainder of this hour talking about the events in Charlottesville
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  and the truth about them.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  And while we're talking about it, you might want to get to infowarstore.com
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  because we have the BuzzFeed Mega Special going on right now,

[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  which will be ending soon because we're selling out of all these products.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  So you are supporting us, you're taking advantage of the Mega Specials,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  but if you haven't yet, get to infowarstore.com as soon as possible.

[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  will be ending, infowarstore.com, BuzzFeed Mega Special, limited time, free shipping as well.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  Take advantage of all of those great offers and fund independent media
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  that gets people like Dr. Steve Pacenek on to break down the, I would say, collusion.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  I would say behind the door collusion between the mayor of Charlottesville
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  and Richard Spencer, Dr. Pacenek, where you left off.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  I would agree with you, there is a clear collusion.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Both of the men were trained in the same place as the University of Virginia.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  They're both highly educated.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  They both owe their allegiance to their specific parties.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  In the case of Spencer, he just made up some nonsensical party called the Nazis
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  or the alternative media.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  He didn't create the expression alternative media.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  Neither did Hillary. It was really created here on the Alex Jones show
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  and we did it about 12, 14 years ago where we were the new right
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  or the new Republicans because we broke away on 9-11.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  That's what nobody really understood.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  This is a still carryover in terms of the Republican Party
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  or we who were disillusioned with the Bushes
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  and others that we wanted to have our own specific party
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  and Alex was the forefront of it.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  In terms of the left, they have been pathetic.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  It's still part of the Podesta group.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  It's still part of the fascism of the left when you create a tight group
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  and they're always working to create agitation propaganda.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  That's the beginning of fascism on both sides
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  and probably the closest analogy historically to this
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  would be the Weimar Republic in the 1920s when you had the fascist left
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  and the so-called fascist right coming together
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  and in between you had this painter or theoretical painter
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  who didn't get into art school named Hitler came to power.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Now, this is highly contrived.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  Whoever is involved has to be involved with some of the elements of the FBI
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  and some of the elements of the CIA.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Why do I say that?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  Richard Spencer lives in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  He was married to a former Russian or Russian-American.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  The Russian-American turns out studied U.S. foreign policy,
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  international relations, and guess what, the Soviet Union.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  By definition, she was and still is probably the CIA.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  In return, you have Podesta group.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  You've got Singer or Signer, as he calls himself.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  He was involved in a lot of education as well,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  University of Virginia, as was Spencer.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  So both come out of the same background,
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  intellectuals, spoiled, elitists.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  None of them have ever really worked.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  One created a job and both decided to get into the business
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  of agitation propaganda.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  In turn, you have the FBI who's completely penetrated the KKK.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  There's no notion there is any KKK.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  As usual, Alex is correct.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And years ago, I remember Maurice D.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  who might have helped out about 20, 30 years ago
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  and gave him some operatives and some money to tell him to infiltrate it.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  And also, we told the FBI to get rid of the KKK.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  So the KKK doesn't exist.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And as Alex pointed out, the absurdity of having a black or brown individual
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  and the KKK makes it even more absurd.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  The fact that you have men dressed up
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  and full combat gear walking with planes is also absurd.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  So this was all highly contrived by whatever, the deep state, the FBI,
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  the agency in order to create strategic tension.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Now, Trump handled this very well.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  But the problem lies to Trump.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  It's very simply that he's answering all the questions right on the mark.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  But he's getting trapped because he picked up.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  That's Dr. Steve Prochenek.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  We'll be right back with more from him, more of the breakdown on Charlottesville
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  and your phone calls.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  This is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  You can't sell something unless it helps somebody
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  and you can't support an organization that didn't fight in order.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  We ever changed the world together.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  You are the InfoWare.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  God bless you all.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  Thank you.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Thank you.

[01:39:45.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Thank you.
