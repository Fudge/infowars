[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:46.040]  Ladies and gentlemen welcome it is Wednesday the first day of April 2009
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.640]  April Fool's Day this is a serious broadcast we will not be engaging any
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.080]  April Fool's jokes today everything you hear here will be documented and
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.720]  focused information on the New World Order what the global crime syndicate is
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.760]  up to and doing and no this is not an April Fool's joke we actually have the
[01:07.760 --> 01:14.360]  audio clip it's coming up later and culture and culture has endorsed
[01:14.360 --> 01:21.560]  Congressman Ron Paul for 2012 she says she supports him on quote every issue of
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.520]  course she and others attacked him during the campaign see this is what they
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.880]  were doing back when we could have stopped the New World Order and it could
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.000]  have been done with getting Ron Paul elected I mean if they were unable to
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.920]  assassinate him we could have pulled out of the United Nations federalized the
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.320]  federal reserve it's not federal we could have reversed all this he was
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.080]  right about it all covering the New World Order just like we were covering
[01:46.080 --> 01:52.000]  in here going off the globalist own documents and now and culture is
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.760]  endorsing Ron Paul Fox News has him on every other day CNN has him on constantly
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.520]  and they're trying to act like they're with the American people against the
[02:01.520 --> 02:06.760]  bankers when they're owned by the bankers now Glenn Beck has been doing this
[02:06.760 --> 02:09.840]  longer than Sean Hannity and others they're getting your confidence they're
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.320]  gonna drop the hammer on you see they've lost all credibility when all the
[02:14.320 --> 02:17.520]  foreign news announced that world government was being set up and that
[02:17.520 --> 02:21.040]  world government was taking over and that world currency was taking over I've
[02:21.040 --> 02:24.800]  been saying the last five six months as mainstream media has been admitting all
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.400]  this overseas I've been saying how was Sean Hannity on show after show I've
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.520]  said how was Sean Hannity how was Rush Limbaugh how was Michael Savage how are
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.840]  all of these guys gonna continue on saying none of this exist and then the
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.640]  last three months Wall Street Journal New York Times Associated Press Time
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.960]  Magazine Newsweek a bank of the world to set taxes and then carbon taxes will
[02:46.960 --> 02:51.320]  pay to them and ruling our nation and quote cracking our heads Time Magazine
[02:51.320 --> 02:55.600]  quote the article New World Order I kept saying how are they going to ignore
[02:55.600 --> 03:03.200]  this how that world government is openly emerged like a blue whale jumping out
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.800]  of the Pacific Ocean right by your canoe how are they going to ignore the
[03:08.800 --> 03:15.520]  elephant in the room and they're not going to they are not good you cannot
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.560]  ignore open world government and where are all our detractors all the New York
[03:20.560 --> 03:26.400]  Times and Washington Post and Vanity Fair articles and radar magazine hundreds
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.680]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of world publications have attacked me
[03:30.680 --> 03:38.480]  as insane I've probably been attacked by 3040 publications the last month big
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.760]  ones saying Jones is crazy he believes there's a world government and a plan
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.920]  for central banks to take over instead of a world currency I mean think about the
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.200]  magnitude I am still being attacked while the mainstream media with one hand
[03:55.200 --> 03:58.640]  admits all of this one side of their mouth and on the other side of their
[03:58.640 --> 04:02.640]  mouth still says it doesn't exist because while they admit it exists they
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.160]  wanted to credit me because we understand the full plan we have reverse
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.440]  engineered it we have read their documents we have studied them it's all I
[04:10.440 --> 04:20.200]  do it's all I do on any subject I study I study I'm a generalist do I have all
[04:20.200 --> 04:23.920]  the answers no but do I understand basic history do I understand human dynamics
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.600]  and psychology and anthropology and sociology yes I do do I constantly
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.640]  interview experts in every field across the board constantly upping my game
[04:33.640 --> 04:39.080]  constantly researching constantly debating yes that's why as all of this is
[04:39.080 --> 04:44.200]  admitted they still intensify their attack at every level from above and

[04:49.080 --> 04:54.160]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com this is being done because they know

[08:06.320 --> 08:10.080]  there's a war on for your mind
[08:11.800 --> 08:19.880]  the key leaders of the anarchist group in England are openly and publicly this
[08:19.880 --> 08:26.680]  is even the mainstream news funded by George Soros the Ford Foundation and
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.240]  others just like they funded the weathermen there's like it's now been
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.320]  declassified what was in the Associated Press last week that the simian
[08:37.320 --> 08:43.040]  ease liberation army and Patty Hurst it was all an FBI operation well obviously
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.560]  walking in you know filming with 35 millimeter you know shooting machine guns
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.880]  into the ceiling and in dancing around like movie stars in front of the film
[08:52.880 --> 08:56.480]  camera and then releasing it to the media of course we knew it was staged
[08:56.480 --> 09:02.240]  then IE folks like Tarplin others that were watching at the time it's just
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.640]  amazing and we're watching them right now over in England bash out bank windows
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.880]  and things they call it storming and I noticed I saw a photo of a cop and I
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.080]  looked at it very carefully and looked at other photos it's not blood it's paint
[09:18.080 --> 09:27.040]  he's they said they had a cop smear red paint and it's almost pink evenly on his
[09:27.040 --> 09:33.040]  face and then I saw photos of him being interviewed 30 minutes later and it
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.520]  hadn't turned brown it hadn't turned black let me give you a news flash the
[09:36.520 --> 09:43.920]  white blood cells super oxify you know they pick up all the oxygen and it
[09:43.920 --> 09:50.120]  turns brown no that blood's gonna be bright fire engine red slash pink till
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.240]  the day he washes it off with soap and water and that's what intelligence
[09:55.240 --> 10:00.680]  operations are you know at their core it's theater plastic noses fake eyebrows
[10:00.680 --> 10:08.160]  mustaches it's disgusting you see they run into problems attacking police for
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.760]  real in Seattle because the cops got mad and told the news we learn these guys
[10:11.760 --> 10:14.880]  were working for the feds and we were told to stand down when we got hit in
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.520]  the head with bottles and got our teeth knocked out or you have a grip of cops
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.880]  dressed up in Denver last year this is Denver post associated press Reuters
[10:22.880 --> 10:30.240]  it's in the Obama deception mainstream news it's actually in the Denver extra and
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.680]  the police went in and attacked other cops throwing bottles throwing rocks at
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.960]  about 20 feet away then ran up their line and beat them and the cops got mad
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.640]  about it and that's how it came out well in England they don't do it that way
[10:43.640 --> 10:49.000]  it's like professional wrestling where they just lean down got the little thing
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.160]  of red makeup and aww smear a little better maybe you get a razor blade and
[10:52.160 --> 11:00.080]  cut yourself absolutely incredible and the anarchist have signs we've got
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.040]  video and photos of it saying one world government one world currency is what
[11:04.040 --> 11:11.240]  we want funny that's exactly what the bankers inside one and so now there's
[11:11.240 --> 11:17.240]  no discussion of how they've stolen 12 plus trillion dollars you know to show
[11:17.240 --> 11:20.280]  how we're conservative
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.040]  we're going to Steve Watson in London for an update report he's been covering an
[11:25.040 --> 11:28.440]  old age right in the middle of it
[11:28.440 --> 11:36.720]  Webster Tarpley was in here Monday day and a half ago and he said 10 to 12
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.160]  trillion dollars in the bailout he said it's probably up to 12 but we have to
[11:41.160 --> 11:48.480]  be conservative I have Bloomberg today guess how much it is Bloomberg today
[11:48.480 --> 11:58.880]  yes I want to give the exact number here have it in the stack of stuff as they say

[12:55.360 --> 13:00.480]  they dressed up like anarchist and attacked other police and that was
[13:00.480 --> 13:03.680]  staged the police then grab them arrest them but the everybody noticed they have

[13:18.880 --> 13:21.640]  them and let them go and the Royal Mounted Police had to admit yeah we
[13:21.640 --> 13:28.160]  staged that that was a false flag terrorist attack ordered from the
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.800]  highest levels of government that's what a terror attack is a terror attack on
[13:32.800 --> 13:39.000]  free speech a terror attack on right of assembly they constantly do it I have

[15:03.480 --> 15:07.840]  this segment the next from Steve Watson from London writer for prison planet
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.600]  calm he had honchos info wars dot net which I by the way I think one of our
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.680]  best-looking sites is some of the most important news I don't promote that
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.640]  thing enough info wars dot net you see exclusives there at info wars dot net
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.200]  Steve you've been watching all the news watching the TV out in the streets
[15:22.200 --> 15:26.880]  watching what's happening as this goes on what is really happening over there
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.160]  in England hey Alex it's good to be back yeah I've been watching it all day
[15:32.160 --> 15:37.320]  happening a few miles from where I am I've been observing what's going on on
[15:37.320 --> 15:43.040]  various news networks over here and now what we're getting over here is over and
[15:43.040 --> 15:53.200]  over images of the same small group of people provocatory in the police as you
[15:53.200 --> 15:58.760]  mentioned there's particularly one person who seems to be at the very front of
[15:58.760 --> 16:06.400]  this with what looked like cuts to his head and blood on his face but as he
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.920]  said it kind of looked fake and then he had sort of bandages great around his
[16:11.920 --> 16:16.840]  head and he was constantly shouting at the police pushing them trying to go to
[16:16.840 --> 16:23.200]  them to react I mean to their credit the police didn't react to him one one
[16:23.200 --> 16:28.120]  police officer got hit with a projectile they still didn't react but
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.200]  there seemed to be a small group of sort of 12 to 20 provocateurs at the front
[16:34.200 --> 16:40.720]  really trying to get the police to react this all took place the most
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.840]  significant area of the protest was outside the Bank of England in the
[16:44.840 --> 16:51.520]  financial district and also what happened there was there's a branch of the
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.200]  Royal Bank of Scotland situated there for some reason all the other banks and
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.960]  shops in the area had been completely boarded up there was nobody working there
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.640]  but this one brand but the very bank that they said they were going to target in
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.320]  the last two weeks the very bank that got the biggest bailouts the bank they
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.800]  said they were going to go after that's the one that didn't board up and wasn't
[17:16.800 --> 17:21.800]  guarded yeah the Royal Bank of Scotland is one of the banks in this country that
[17:21.800 --> 17:27.200]  was bailed out so it's come under a great deal of criticism from all you know
[17:27.200 --> 17:34.480]  from all angles over the past few weeks last week the the CEO his home his
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.640]  personal home was attacked by anarchist so it was a known target for these
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.760]  people and that they went down there they basically smashed a few windows up
[17:44.760 --> 17:51.400]  got inside the reports that they were smashing up equipment inside stealing
[17:51.400 --> 17:57.560]  hard drives from the computers reports that they got into the got onto the roof
[17:57.560 --> 18:01.200]  of the building you know if you did that in the US you'd get holes put in you
[18:01.200 --> 18:08.280]  exactly and all the time this was going on the police we're just standing back
[18:08.280 --> 18:14.440]  which I find quite surprising well now Gordon Rammel come out and say this has
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.160]  been a devastating attack we must ban all free speech now and allow this to hold
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.120]  people for hundreds of days without charges is rabble who have stormed the
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.960]  bank oh yeah this went on for about 10 minutes people coming in and out of the
[18:28.960 --> 18:34.400]  building there was a quite a large contingent of police there the coverage
[18:34.400 --> 18:41.880]  was at the moment they started happening it cut to a very sort of low-tech
[18:41.880 --> 18:49.200]  internet stream camera and you couldn't really make out what was going on but
[18:49.200 --> 18:52.520]  you could make out that the windows are being smashed and there was a lot of
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.000]  police there but they weren't really doing it all those closer cameras are
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.160]  going to come out and those guys were a little big for anarchist and I was
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.000]  looking at their bearing on the video they're either I bet my bottom dollars
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.800]  some of them are going to turn out being army intelligence or police yeah it's
[19:10.800 --> 19:15.200]  got to be stressed that the majority of people there were there peacefully and
[19:15.200 --> 19:19.600]  they were you know they weren't advocating these actions it was only these
[19:19.600 --> 19:26.520]  few that had got to the front of this that were carrying it out and also at
[19:26.520 --> 19:33.060]  that point the police cordoned off the entire area they created lines and they
[19:33.060 --> 19:39.240]  were not letting you know legitimate protesters leave these protesters say
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.480]  we want to leave now please and the police are just sort of pinning them in
[19:43.480 --> 19:48.240]  and and not allowing them to spread out
[19:49.280 --> 19:54.560]  alright stay there one more second with Steve Watson from London ahead of the
[19:54.560 --> 20:01.760]  G20 starting off well kitchen off today and Obama kneeling before the Queen with
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.960]  our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens maybe right
[20:05.960 --> 20:10.880]  around the corner no one saw the financial collapse of 1929 many didn't
[20:10.880 --> 20:15.200]  make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants begging for
[20:15.200 --> 20:21.320]  food unlike 1929 we can see this collapse coming we have been warned and
[20:21.320 --> 20:25.600]  right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into
[20:25.600 --> 20:30.260]  our homes before it's too late why is the Canadian government telling their
[20:30.260 --> 20:34.200]  citizens to stock up why and why are soldiers calling home telling their
[20:34.200 --> 20:38.760]  families to get food storage supplies are running low having food storage today

[21:07.480 --> 21:13.320]  civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as
[21:13.320 --> 21:18.760]  well the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[21:18.760 --> 21:22.840]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[21:22.840 --> 21:27.520]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.120]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.560]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about
[21:37.560 --> 21:42.480]  left or right it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama

[22:16.000 --> 22:19.600]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing

[24:13.960 --> 24:21.160]  on another note Steve what do you think about Glenn back Sean Hannity all the
[24:21.160 --> 24:27.200]  Fox host I mean literally I listen to Fox TV on the radio on XM and they're all
[24:27.200 --> 24:31.080]  saying the conspiracy people are right the new world order is real global
[24:31.080 --> 24:35.440]  government's real global government rule by banks is real and now CNN's even
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.920]  started to talk about it what do you think's behind that well I mean
[24:39.920 --> 24:46.560]  everybody knows that Fox News is universally derided so you know them
[24:46.560 --> 24:53.520]  to suddenly jump on the same issue that we do is you know to the to the average
[24:53.520 --> 24:57.960]  view is gonna like you know we're saying what Fox News is saying and
[24:57.960 --> 25:01.520]  instantly that's gonna discredit everything we've been saying but we've
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.320]  been saying for you know a full decade before they've chosen to cover it I
[25:07.320 --> 25:13.560]  agree other right now the meeting between Obama and the Queen newspapers
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.520]  reporting that he's been practicing the etiquette we're gonna videotape it this
[25:17.520 --> 25:22.080]  is disgusting your take on that yeah I'm just watching the pictures now of the
[25:22.080 --> 25:28.480]  Obama arriving at Buckingham Palace I mean have you seen the report today
[25:28.480 --> 25:35.880]  about what he said about how he loved the Queen yes he said I'll quote he said
[25:35.880 --> 25:41.000]  quote there's one thing I should mention that I love about Great Britain that is
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.080]  the Queen I'm very much looking forward to meeting her for the first time later
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.880]  this evening as you might imagine Michelle has been really thinking up
[25:50.880 --> 25:54.960]  through because I think in the imagination of people throughout America
[25:54.960 --> 26:01.240]  what the Queen stands for a decency and civility what she represents that's
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.680]  very important so there you've got your president pledging allegiance to the
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.640]  Queen saying that he loves her and she stands for decency and civility which is
[26:12.640 --> 26:18.320]  quite incredible really and you know it's this rather disgustingly ironic
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.520]  because you've got the first black president and his wife saying that the
[26:24.520 --> 26:33.400]  monarchy of England one of the most xenophobic prejudice racist institutions
[26:33.400 --> 26:39.400]  rooted in segregationism you've got the your president there saying that they
[26:39.400 --> 26:44.680]  stand for decency and civility you know you've got the Queen mother quite
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.680]  famously was said to be virulently a racist you've got the Queen's husband
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.080]  Prince Philip we know all about him travels all around the world describing
[26:55.080 --> 27:02.440]  people as savages and other racists as spear throwers and that kind of thing so
[27:02.440 --> 27:08.360]  the whole thing is just tough to watch that is fairly disgusting my opinion
[27:08.360 --> 27:11.800]  well he's also it's been in the news people don't know about Philip you live
[27:11.800 --> 27:17.080]  over there so you know about the Queen's husband but for those that don't know he
[27:17.080 --> 27:21.120]  on national television repeatedly will be in a building he's obsessive compulsive
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.280]  and if one light bulbs burn out he freaks out and he said on the news it
[27:25.280 --> 27:29.560]  must be a black they must have a black in here only blacks would not screw it
[27:29.560 --> 27:34.480]  you would not have a light bulb burnt out and the Queen will not meet with
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.160]  Africans in Africa so remember what was it five six years ago was in BBC BBC
[27:39.160 --> 27:44.880]  reported on itself they had a fake movie set claiming she was in a central
[27:44.880 --> 27:50.400]  African country meeting with Africans but it was really the stars of an African
[27:50.400 --> 27:57.040]  soap opera staging a meeting with villagers on a soundstage yeah I
[27:57.040 --> 28:04.360]  mean his clearly he's his elitism his prejudice his racism is so entrenched
[28:04.360 --> 28:09.920]  that he cannot even he can't even repress it for you know in front of the
[28:09.920 --> 28:16.320]  media for a few minutes that's how deeply entrenched it is with them so you
[28:16.320 --> 28:22.960]  know to see the so-called savior of the progressive president the first black
[28:22.960 --> 28:29.400]  president having to meet with these people is is just insane well this is
[28:29.400 --> 28:36.120]  the first time a sitting president has gone to a summons he summoned him to a
[28:36.120 --> 28:41.280]  audience and then and then they admit he's been practicing his etiquette are
[28:41.280 --> 28:44.720]  they showing that you're watching the news right now are they showing him
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.560]  curtsy to her or or is there no they haven't shown the queen in meeting the
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.120]  queen yet I don't I don't know if they'll show that they've shown pictures
[28:53.120 --> 28:59.720]  inside Buckingham Palace of him sort of pulling up in his you know big armored
[28:59.720 --> 29:05.880]  vehicle and getting out and meeting sort of the Queen's dignitaries those kind of
[29:05.880 --> 29:10.040]  people and then they sort of took them inside so they haven't actually shown
[29:10.040 --> 29:17.120]  meeting the Queen yet but we'll see well you know he took his oath of office in
[29:17.120 --> 29:26.400]  secret so who knows what he'll do maybe it'll be a secret meeting but I'm I am
[29:26.400 --> 29:33.440]  watching CNN it just showed the Queen awaiting him the Queen the Queen a Queen
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.760]  ladies and gentlemen she owns half a Canada suspended its parliament
[29:37.760 --> 29:42.380]  basically when they didn't follow her orders in Canada most of Australia she
[29:42.380 --> 29:46.920]  funds giant eugenics programs it's it's just amazing Steve Watson anything else

[34:45.920 --> 34:55.520]  trillion dollars the GDP is 13 trillion so in five and a half months they have
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.840]  well they're preparing to eclipse they are they are preparing to in less than
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.520]  six months more than the entire GDP everything that goes on in the country

[35:22.560 --> 35:27.440]  be accelerating 26 trillion for the bankers
[35:27.440 --> 35:34.080]  but then they call that socialism that's not socialism that's robbery

[36:17.280 --> 36:20.240]  with the queen uh i think he's inside they don't even have
[36:20.240 --> 36:23.200]  shots of that but the cnn anchor himself is
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.200]  literally saying oh i'm so nervous i just hope this all goes well
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.200]  i'm nervous about the bowing and the prostrating before the queen
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.640]  and uh the you know the caricature guy from cnn britain's like oh don't worry
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.280]  it's going to go perfectly he's ahead of state he doesn't have to bow before her
[36:41.280 --> 36:45.520]  there's no kneeling or anything it'll go smoothly and they'll be on with a duck
[36:45.520 --> 36:51.200]  soup with a brazen sauce of plum just it's crazy but she said he did so he
[36:51.200 --> 36:55.280]  just needs to nod his head and then uh she will extend her hand you do not
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.120]  extend your hand first and then you shake it you have to do it with proper
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.640]  deference but you're not supposed to touch the queen unless she reaches out to
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.920]  touch you first that's the way it works this disgusting hereditary nazi blob
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.760]  whose husband was an open nazi and they brought their cousin Bernhardt over from
[37:11.760 --> 37:14.880]  the netherlands during world war two was an ss officer

[37:47.200 --> 37:52.640]  to revel before the queen to treat her some untouchable god creature when she
[37:52.640 --> 38:00.560]  is a disgusting disgusting wicked blob i mean hereditary scum and people say
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.640]  oh she doesn't have any power you know the three big tabloid tv production

[39:28.640 --> 39:31.920]  understand these archetypal images that's why a hundred something years ago
[39:31.920 --> 39:34.560]  the british were getting sick of them knowing that they weren't even british
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.360]  they were german the sax cobert gophus and so uh they've been in control since
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.440]  the 1740s when the british line died out they brought the german cousins in
[39:43.440 --> 39:46.720]  and so they changed it to winzer i mean the average they've done polls the
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.240]  average brit doesn't even know the real name of these dirt bags
[39:50.240 --> 39:55.520]  i mean these are dirt bag scum i mean i this is the head of the new world order

[39:59.200 --> 40:02.800]  and bringing in world government and we have to everybody stooping and bowing
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.720]  when this country was founded on disgust for royalty

[40:28.800 --> 40:32.800]  this is real in fact i even they've even made a joke about it uh
[40:32.800 --> 40:36.640]  they had that thing called mr show on hbo about eight years ago
[40:36.640 --> 40:39.840]  where they're treating a guy as royalty and they're wiping his hind inform in
[40:39.840 --> 40:42.320]  the restaurant he doesn't have to leave the table
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.560]  we ought to pull that skit up online or something but the point is
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.600]  and we've done deep research on this they still have their butts wiped for
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.920]  them now if you don't believe me you google groom of the
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.720]  stool you cannot make this up you will be reading

[41:10.560 --> 41:13.920]  depending on what it is around follows them around
[41:13.920 --> 41:17.680]  and they set up in this big cabinet and they have to fly it around with it this
[41:17.680 --> 41:20.400]  has been on the news while they fly it around they claim they stopped it in
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.800]  1906 but deeper research shows they're just very quiet about it and millions
[41:24.800 --> 41:28.080]  of pounds are spending a year to move this portable toilet around because it's
[41:28.080 --> 41:30.800]  got to be big enough she goes up on a throne

[41:53.520 --> 41:56.800]  i don't want to get into more detail but then they pick with their bare hands
[41:56.800 --> 42:00.800]  with respect and examine it and then every stool
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.680]  and every jar of urine it's not put into water that would that would defile it
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.360]  is is stored in all of the royalty stool going back
[42:09.360 --> 42:12.880]  uh over 500 years is stored another now this came from
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.680]  france and in french it's just the french version of groom of the stool
[42:17.680 --> 42:22.240]  you'll uh what's the term in french it's uh i think it's like groom of the

[47:23.120 --> 47:25.600]  were completely bankrupt to a group of criminal bankers
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.760]  that just made up all this money and then they call that free market but then if
[47:29.760 --> 47:34.160]  you want to uh fix the highways it's called socialism
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.840]  but i mean if you're against giving them the bonuses in the billions of dollars
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.160]  you're a commie pinco see see see how the fake conservative angle and then they
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.440]  have the fake liberal angle of calling him a socialist when it's not socialist
[47:45.440 --> 47:49.280]  he's the one looting for the bankers but the ones and zeros of the fraudulent
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.280]  derivatives are in the quadrillions the quadrillions i mean how are we even
[47:53.280 --> 47:56.320]  supposed to relate to this number it's it's a black hole we've always told
[47:56.320 --> 47:58.640]  people the fellow reserve designs and they do some third world countries same
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.920]  system a black hole of debt that is designed to bankrupt you
[48:03.920 --> 48:06.560]  let's call jackson in here let's have a discussion
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.400]  uh... robert jackson please come in here come in here
[48:10.400 --> 48:16.400]  uh... uh... uh... we're discussing the groom of the stool
[48:16.400 --> 48:18.960]  uh... tell the listeners this is you guys didn't believe me few months ago i
[48:18.960 --> 48:21.600]  told you about it explained to people this is real
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.520]  this is real uh... erin did extensive research right before my eyes
[48:25.520 --> 48:29.600]  we read at least ten documents in about
[48:29.600 --> 48:33.840]  ten minutes he would one after the other long reports groom of the stool
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.800]  they do it and bush has one by something tells me they all have one
[48:38.800 --> 48:41.680]  i mean i guess that's why i guess that's why they got a still trillions because
[48:41.680 --> 48:44.880]  they've got to have you know hey you know some people are used to a certain
[48:44.880 --> 48:48.000]  type of lifestyle you know groom of the stool
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.480]  they got to continue their way of life see somebody that feels like they're a
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.440]  human would want privacy and wouldn't want to humiliate somebody but also
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.960]  would want their privacy it shows how disconnected from humanity are
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.240]  that they don't even think of you as a person you're just there to groom them
[49:00.240 --> 49:03.280]  it's completely ridiculous they are these people
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.240]  but we're probably being called the weirdos we've been talking about it
[49:06.240 --> 49:09.840]  yeah yeah no it's all true it's all true if you don't believe this i would

[49:19.760 --> 49:22.800]  but then when you read deeper in the major university reports
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.080]  it's that it's a quiet thing they do it's a private goodie
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.080]  they didn't want to give that up and they have a british lord that follows them
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.600]  around wiping their hind ends and even if it is true i mean think about it went

[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:19.160]  this is a discrimination lawsuit in the making
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.000]  because there are documented cases especially in california
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  where the legal aliens are above the law they don't get arrested for no
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.920]  insurance no driver's license
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:30.800]  i saw two reports of illegal aliens cornering an attacking police in
[1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:32.200]  california yesterday
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:35.920]  where there's total breakdown of society in fact
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:39.320]  that was on drugs for mainstream news don't see it my stack so many
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:40.840]  go there and just
[1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.120]  control f
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:43.760]  police and you'll see the
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.280]  article about i'm doing that
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:48.320]  other several articles actually
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:52.120]  and in my whole point is is that it's not that all the lily aliens are evil
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  people it's that
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:56.240]  the criminal element of mexico is certainly overrepresented on the u s
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.320]  they run here when they commit murders and things
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:02:59.320]  that's been documented
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:01.440]  and they're about the law but citizens
[1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:03.240]  whether your hispanic black white
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:08.480]  are literally fed on because we are the right way ill
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:11.240]  creatures
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:14.640]  why was the right whale hunted until near extinction when only a few hundred
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:17.000]  live from tens of thousands in the seas
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.600]  it's a sweet large slow
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:22.600]  blubberous whale lots of whale oil
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:26.640]  and the whales would come up and bump the boats friendly very sweet whales
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:27.840]  but uh...
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:29.280]  and they would kill them
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:33.200]  not like a sperm well that dives deep in fights not like other whales
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:36.320]  that are hard to deal with no it was the right whale the right one in the
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:37.920]  american people have a giant
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.840]  target they say this is a schmuck
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:42.720]  this is somebody trained to put up with tyranny this is somebody that's been

[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:49.680]  this is somebody i can feed on
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.280]  and police all over the country say yeah they're not allowed to arrest illegal
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:53.240]  aliens
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:55.880]  for the things they are a citizen citizens are known
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:57.640]  as cattle
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.600]  as slaves
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:02.760]  to be fed on
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:05.200]  we are the prey of choice
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:07.040]  you know you don't see wolves
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:09.920]  trying to eat grizzly bears
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:12.200]  wolves go after deer
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:14.240]  they go after mice
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.360]  actually their main diet is rodents
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:20.560]  uh... they go after little things they can grab they don't go after porcupines
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:21.920]  they don't go after
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:23.600]  uh... poisonous toads

[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:45.520]  that in the final hour today okay let me go ahead and go over the news Prime
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:53.320]  Minister we may be forced to attack Iran this is the Jerusalem post the
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:58.160]  primary imperative of the United States and President Barack Obama is to put an
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:02.760]  end Iran's nuclear race Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before his
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:08.360]  swearing in Tuesday adding that the US failed to do so Israel might be forced
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:13.160]  to resort to a military strike on the Islamic Republic's nuclear installations
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:18.640]  and I quote to the new prime minister now in for the second time the Obama
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:23.120]  presidency has two great missions fixing the economy and preventing Iran from
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:31.000]  gaining nuclear weapons Netanyahu told the Atlantic newspaper the Iranian drive
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:36.720]  for a nuclear weapon was a hinge of history he said emphasizing that all of
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:40.960]  Western civilization was responsible for preventing an Iranian bomb after
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.560]  Israel the United States in England helped give a Q Khan laboratories in
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:49.720]  Pakistan the bomb hmm we'll get into the wider reasons they're doing this you
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:54.360]  don't want a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs Netanyahu said
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:58.200]  of the Iranian regime when the wide-eyed believer gets hold of the
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:03.280]  reins of power and the weapons of mass death then the entire world should start
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:07.040]  worrying and that is what is happening in Iran Netanyahu suggested that
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:11.480]  Israelis preemptive strikes against perceived threats were the result of
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:15.160]  the Jewish people learning from a long history of grappling against those who
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:19.000]  threatened their collective existence he cited Iranian president Mahmoud
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:25.560]  Ahmed Denizides repeated calls to wipe Israel off the map as well as a recent
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:31.720]  remark by the country supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini to the effect
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:36.160]  that Israel was a cancerous tumor however despite Iran singling out of
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:41.680]  Israel he said the rest of the world would be well advised to take the threat
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:46.440]  emanating from Tehran seriously he voiced support for Obama's strategy of
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:50.440]  engaging Iran in dialogue as long as the negotiations worked swiftly to
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:57.240]  convince Iran to relinquish its nuclear program now let's stop right there
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:02.480]  whether you're Iranian whether you're Israeli whether you're American whether
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.200]  you're German whether you're Chinese you shouldn't want an Israeli
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:14.200]  preemptive strike on the 65 million to 70 million people of Iran they have 11
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:18.120]  thousand sunburn missiles that can hit all the major ships in the Gulf they can
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:25.160]  shut down the Strait of Hormuz they will probably attack Iraq undoubtably
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:30.480]  Muslims will flare up all over the world not just Shiite but Sunni a billion
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:36.160]  100 million the West will clearly stage terror attacks as well this will
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:40.000]  widen into a police state crackdown at home so the bankers can steal what's
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:45.200]  left of the collapsing economies and the ram corporation said three months ago
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:51.560]  reported by British news and Chinese news that they want a world war three
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:56.680]  level conflict to bring in their new world order so you may be all fired up
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:00.760]  and you loved attacking Iraq twice and you love wars you love eating pizza and
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:04.720]  drinking beer while you watch shock and awe cities are blown to bits you may
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:09.400]  enjoy the destruction in Fallujah it's tribal it feels good but understand
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:16.000]  ladies and gentlemen that Iran according to CIA is seven years away from
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.240]  having a crude a bomb they don't have centrifuges that can purify it to
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:23.960]  anywhere near the level they need they don't have the delivery system to deliver
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:31.720]  weapons more than 400 miles Israel conservatively has 400 super high-tech
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:39.880]  hydrogen bombs neutron bombs you name it Israel has German made subs in the
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:46.680]  Gulf in the med they have cruise missiles they have fighter bombers they
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:52.800]  have bombers they have strategic forces with frogs and Davy Crockett small
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:59.120]  nukes just it's unbelievable anyone that dared launch anything in Israel they
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:05.640]  have anti-missile systems better than the Patriot the United States has at
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:10.440]  least five DC 10s with high-powered chemical lasers in the air at all times
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:16.040]  in the Middle East that can target missiles seconds after launch and fire a
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:27.200]  particle beam at it and destroy it before it even begins its arc downward
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:37.840]  now meanwhile you have the head of the Swiss company at the time in 1997
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:46.600]  Donald Rumsfeld ABB the company giving the nuclear technology to North Korea to
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:52.360]  successfully develop some crude a bombs you have a this is reality you have
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:14:00.280]  just Google Israel Google Britain Google U.S. help Iran's nuclear program help
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:06.320]  North Korea's nuclear program help Pakistan's nuclear program Halliburton's
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:12.680]  been involved this came out five years ago helping fund Iran with its centrifuges
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:16.640]  and Dick Cheney said this is no big deal it's just a subsidiary and the Cayman's
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:25.240]  doing it so it's like the old Western and I love the fact Google this Bill Hicks
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:31.120]  pick up the gun Bill Hicks pick up the gun I never seen him do this and when I
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:33.960]  did this about ten years ago as I've seen the same Westerns it's a classic
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:37.920]  theme in Westerns so that's Bill Hicks but he does do better than I do and it's
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:42.520]  where they throw the gun down you know that they've just said a couple
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.520]  Clint Eastwood movies you know where they got where the regulators for the
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:51.680]  railroad there's a lot of true cases of this Pinkerton men and others would
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:57.400]  would shoot you know somebody's daddy trying to sell his gold at the company
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:02.960]  store in town and then they throw a gun down at the 10 or 12 year olds feet and
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:08.560]  say go ahead kid pick up the gun pick it up I just kills your daddy and the kid
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:11.160]  will reach down for the gun and they'll fill them full of holes it's the same
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:17.800]  thing they give them the gun they go pick it up pick it up the US government
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.480]  admits they staged terror attacks with the British in 1953 and I ran to
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.240]  overthrow them they always are blowing up their airlines trying to get them to
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:27.200]  go crazy we told you this before even the New Yorker did now the White House
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:32.360]  admitted two years ago now that they are staging terror attacks inside Iran
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:37.280]  against Iranian government facilities in a pretext to get them to widen a war
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:43.760]  into the border their western border on the eastern border with Iraq so that's
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:47.520]  the facts ladies and gentlemen and they want to launch World War three and
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:50.480]  almost all the major analysts even those that are for the war admit it will
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:55.480]  turn into a theater war with multiple nations involved it will cause Pakistan
[1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:01.440]  to go into total revolt who has more than 20 nukes with delivery systems of up to
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:06.600]  2,000 kilometers what is that 1,200 1,300 miles
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:13.120]  you know on the eve of the Gulf War two it was in major newspapers but didn't
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:16.280]  get a lot of traction that in a missile test they're about to do another one
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:22.200]  North Korea fired an ICBM intercontinental ballistic missile with a
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:27.880]  dummy test Merv package multiple reentry device so one warhead in one
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:33.680]  missile nose cone has five or six smaller bombs payloads that are delivered
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:39.880]  out to other targets that way even if you shoot the missile down it pops open
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:47.360]  and fires its nukes up one missile US Mervs carry as many as 20 warheads Russian
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:53.600]  Mervs as many as 14 North Korea's testing Mervs the Chinese long march
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:56.840]  that Laurel and Hughes their Clinton and the Republicans help transfer to
[1:16:56.840 --> 1:17:00.600]  communist China why do the US government allow the transfer of Merv technology
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:07.680]  and ICBM high-tech ICBM to China they're handing out the weapons worldwide just
[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:10.920]  like the documents of a declassified they started up war with Germany in World
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.880]  War one they financed Hitler to get him into power told him they were gonna have
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:17.360]  him fight the communists told him to attack those countries and then set him
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:23.480]  up my saying Hitler's good no the point is it's a fact they financed him the
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:29.160]  Milner group Lord Milner song record mainstream history not on the history
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:35.800]  channel though but in mainline award-winning books government documents
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:43.720]  so in polls upwards of 75 percent of Iranians don't like their moolas even
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:47.840]  sure of course he says the way to go is through daytime is through working with
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:51.800]  Iran but notice when the I had told us before I meant energy had got in five
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.040]  years ago notice they let the inspectors in like no country ever did when
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:58.560]  under UN control was totally peaceful had nothing to do with nuclear weapons
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:01.720]  production the UN song record saying that Hans blicks all of them
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:07.520]  I was blicks come on in buddy back to Kim Jong-il
[1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:12.760]  Alec Baldwin very useful to me but anyways I digress into Team America
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:22.840]  America America they shouldn't be laughing about this is too serious this
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:29.960]  isn't a movie it's reality and so they've helped give them all of these weapon
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:35.360]  systems and they want to start World War three and the moolas were trying to
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:38.360]  reach out to the West and they were rebuffed and so the moolas said okay
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:46.720]  well we'll put a radical in my mood Ahmed energy and now they want war with
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:51.600]  them and this will be devastating devastating and this is allowed to
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:59.920]  happen now I'm gonna come back go to your calls and I'm gonna get into just the
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:05.800]  amazing news of the day financial rescue it's a rescue you know when this is
[1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:10.480]  saving us see that lie Bloomberg financial rescue near GDP gross domestic
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:14.680]  product but everything the company produces every year of 12.8 trillion in
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:18.320]  five and a half months of the bailout so they're on line within 12 months of
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:22.160]  the starting for to be 26 trillion and you're all gonna pay for it and the
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:25.520]  police are gonna squeeze it out of you that's why they're wearing black's mask
[1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:31.880]  now folks if we're not in Kansas anymore we're gonna get into World Bank
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:36.320]  president amidst Jennifer global government look at this headline AP

[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:53.840]  you should remember well from the land of the Pima Indian a proud and noble
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:25:00.880]  man who formed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona let's go ahead and go to your
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:05.600]  phone calls it's a thousand years of waters Chris in Iowa thanks for holding
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:17.160]  you're on the air worldwide hello Chris yeah hey buddy I couldn't hear you Alex
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:22.040]  I listen to the podcast a day late so I'm not up to what's going on for today but
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:26.040]  I wanted to call you regarding Luke and getting busted over the weekend yes
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:31.040]  application on my cell phone I push a single button turns my video camera on
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.320]  it starts streaming to the web directly in real time and it records on the web
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:38.920]  yeah there's a lot of those applications tell folks the application you're
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:44.680]  using they're free this one's called qik.com it's a it's a free service it's
[1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:49.280]  a free application downloaded my blackberry works perfect and and the
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:53.760]  gem is that you know if you know you're going into a situation like he did and
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:57.600]  you got the thing you know back up running you can have your attorney you
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:02.760]  he could call me I don't care and we can be watching this going on and when
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:06.440]  things roll out the way they do no I agree and the way to go is to have like
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.600]  three or four people together and all your cell phones going is the technology
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:14.200]  isn't a hundred percent we've tested out we've we've had problems before when
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:17.800]  we try to link it up on our sites because in thousands hit it and those
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:21.360]  services you know one a while that because you have a server to spew it out
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:25.640]  at but just to save it individually it's a great idea and I know they've been
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:31.000]  working on that we did a lot of live feeds in Denver at the DNC and tens of
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.960]  thousands would tune in there and it was just amazing but then we had MSNBC
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:40.080]  we were bullhorning Chris Matthews attack our camera and it was hooked up to a
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:44.200]  laptop to send it out in higher quality but no certainly as this technology
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:48.120]  becomes mainstream as it becomes second and third and fourth generation which
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:51.280]  already the third generation starts working better it's going to revolutionize
[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.960]  things that's why police are investing all over the world in the cell phone
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:27:00.560]  jammers at protests so they can jam that right well the thing with this is I
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:03.280]  mean I suppose with the others as well but the one thing I like about this is
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:07.840]  that as it's streaming live you can download the the the flash video to your
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.200]  computer and then upload it right away back to YouTube so that if you know a
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:14.160]  thousand people decide to hit it it's not gonna crash their service because you
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.280]  know it'll be the Google you absolutely is the model anything else Chris well
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:21.320]  that's what I was gonna say is that by the time Luke's fingerprints had gotten
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:24.880]  dry this thing could have been viral and I'm not second-guessing anybody I mean
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:27.440]  obviously but I just want to bring everybody's attention so one more time
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:32.780]  it's qik.com and then you get your own little username it's free it's
[1:27:32.780 --> 1:27:36.400]  quick as Chris I hear you he shouldn't go anywhere near Bloomberg unless he has
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:40.480]  something like that going live with a backup several of them because you know
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:44.120]  even if he gets arrested at least later it's uploaded to his computer across
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:47.720]  town or across the world and then they can't set him up great points Chris
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:51.560]  Lauren in Ohio you're on the air
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:55.600]  hey Alex how are you doing pretty good I wanted to cheer you up a little because I
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:58.880]  can hear the stress in your voices and that you're that making me crack up with
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:02.160]  the Queen stuff and I'm wondering when people are gonna stop bowing down and
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:06.120]  scraping before men now I'm gonna just real quickly do this I hear you talking
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:09.440]  about the Mexicans they're above the law it's not that the Mexicans are above
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:14.520]  the law it's that they're not under the rules codes regulations and statutes by
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.920]  virtue of their voluntary contract I agree I agree because they literally are
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:24.320]  free men and won't get the license and won't get the insurance and just thumb
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:28.720]  their nose the system's just given up because it's powerless unless you acquiesce
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.120]  and you're right that's why yeah you got it you got it and here's the thing
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:35.960]  this is the key and this is why they needed to get the Bible out of the
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:40.280]  schools and away from the children God made us human beings humorous man you
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:45.800]  know he created us out of the dirt human get it we the land is us you are
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:49.520]  guys get to you you are a king of your own land when we came here in this
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.400]  country was developed and my ancestors one of them was Raymond Demery he was
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:58.000]  aid the camp for Washington and they were here in 1739 before we even had the
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.480]  United States of America which is not even that right now but the whole point
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:08.840]  is everybody was a king your rights are on a lean able nobody can put a lean
[1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:14.360]  against your flesh because you belong to God God created the men the men and
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:20.440]  only a group of grand jurors your peers who are supposed to be in control of the
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:26.240]  court process not captured kept minions of the prosecutor and the judge only they
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:30.640]  when it's been decided with evidence and witnesses that you've hurt someone
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:36.760]  else deprive them of life liberty or happiness and then carried out violence
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:41.000]  or theft then you can be seized and put through a new process but you're
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.920]  absolutely on target Lauren and I totally agree with you anything else

[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.960]  person's born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:28.560]  jurisdiction thereof that means there are people that are not subject to the
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:32.160]  jurisdiction thereof that's where the key lies we have all the power to stop
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:36.320]  this not giving them your money stop giving it a desirable servants your
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:40.520]  beacons God said have no other gods before me and stop giving them access to
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:43.040]  your children why do you think all these people are running around and think
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:45.840]  they live in the democracy and we're spreading democracy around the world
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:49.560]  they don't even know they're supposed to live in a republic so the whole point
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:54.040]  is we've done this to ourselves by walking out from under the protection
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:59.400]  of God he told us obey me first that's why it's uncle Sam uncle Samaritan
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:03.760]  because he's not your daddy Patriot the root of that word is Patriarch the
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:07.280]  government is not your father there are a bunch of servants the Constitution in
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:11.520]  the Bill of Rights it's a body of negative law to limit the government
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:17.120]  I agree listen I've read the federalist papers the anti-federalist papers I've
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:22.600]  read the debates the it's all documented and we are a captured kept
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:28.000]  indentured slave mass and now that all over the nation they're putting in body
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.440]  scanners and they show it on the news people's naked bodies and they admit
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:34.720]  they're recording it and first let's take your shoes off and you can have
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:37.840]  water then you got to be asked questions now we got a scan your body
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.120]  they're training you how to submit to them getting in your business I appreciate
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:46.560]  your call fine points there Lauren let's talk to Frank in New York you're on the
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:52.920]  air good afternoon Alex hello this is Frank in New York listen I wanted to
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:57.720]  commend you on the Obama deception I've watched it four times it's really a
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:02.920]  masterpiece and it's one of the most interesting political documentaries
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:08.720]  and what's amazing is that the timing of this it's not one or two years into
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:14.760]  Obama's presidency but it's you know within the first six or eight weeks so
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:19.360]  congratulations on that it's not only entertaining but it's a wonderful
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:25.840]  vehicle to get people thinking you know about exactly the establishment sets
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:29.560]  out the false left and right choice which are really working on the same team
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:35.840]  everybody gets captured in that parlor theatrics or theater the show going on
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:39.680]  instead of the men behind the curtain we literally have graphics where we open
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.320]  the curtain very visually simple and show you the elite what their real
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.240]  policies are that's why the liberals and conservatives are seeing this and it's
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:54.000]  shattering their paradigms absolutely now I wanted to make a couple comments
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.840]  one when Rumsfeld was on the board of Brown bothy in Switzerland he was
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:04.560]  instrumental in getting the contract for the North Korea nuclear reactor and he
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:08.160]  received a big bonus for that and I think that should be mentioned and also the
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:13.160]  fact I did just mention that I did just mention that okay and ABB also the fact
[1:38:13.160 --> 1:38:18.880]  that sadly I may meet you in person in the FEMA camp in the next year or so but
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.400]  on a more uplifting note I think if Henry Kissinger decides to retire from
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:29.040]  Kissinger associates and since he has been knighted by the Queen they can
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:31.960]  excellent candidate for groom of the stool
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:36.560]  did you look at that were you already aware of that or did you did did you look
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:40.720]  it up when we said look it up no no no I knew of that in fact the notion of the
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:45.640]  groom of the stool actually in the United States goes back to FDR when he was
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:52.160]  very ill there was fear that a fifth column might get hold of his
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:57.240]  excrement and analyze it to understand what frame of mind or you know how how
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:01.960]  sick he was with the polio and things and it goes back Kennedy also was very
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:06.520]  concerned about that during the Cold War because you know a lot of people
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:11.680]  believed he was ill especially the Soviets and we know later that he had
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:17.000]  Addison's disease so in a sense you know it goes back at least with the
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:21.920]  American presidency through Roosevelt but it was due to the you know intense
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.200]  security during the Second World War and now Obama Bush all of them have a
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:30.600]  special they all do that absolutely and I was thinking maybe if not Kissinger
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:37.600]  maybe Bill Clinton so busy with his foundation when he decides to move into
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:41.640]  something else he might be an excellent candidate as well for that I hear you and
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.480]  I appreciate your call since a lot of you just joined us you don't know what on
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:52.200]  earth we're talking about I'll just recap briefly going back to Henry the
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:58.000]  eighth at least and then they got this from France and in the writings they
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:03.800]  reading over historical text decided to start doing it because Pharaoh's by the
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:13.880]  middle period of middle period of Egypt now going back about 2,500 years they
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:22.520]  had or more they had they were Godmen so they had someone who would lovingly pick
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:28.040]  the mucus out of their nose it's known as buggers they had someone who would do
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:32.520]  that because they're God and then someone who would groom them when they use
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:37.880]  the restroom and then examine they would have priests look at it and do
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:42.560]  portends it also cut open sheep bulls you know read their guts you hear the
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:46.200]  term reading tea leaves or they like tea leaves out or cast bones on the ground
[1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:49.560]  witch doctors and you know read the portend see what's happening in the
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:55.000]  future from that well that's what they would do with the Pharaoh's and the rest
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:00.600]  of royal houses excrement and so just to show how disgusting the Queen of England
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:07.120]  is and just how to think they're gods and in the way they humiliate people they
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:10.840]  have a groom of the stool who wipes them and everything else I was just
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:15.480]  pointing out how Obama was bowing to her on national television and then Prince
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:19.320]  Philip the Nazi who constantly badmouth black people to some human says he
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:24.720]  wants to kill him in books he writes like turn around he keeps waving at him
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:28.080]  for like 30 seconds and Obama turns around and looks and then follows the
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:31.800]  order and even see an income and look at him bossing the president around I mean
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:35.480]  people heard it I was playing it we just tuned in to see unless it faded up and
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:39.920]  it was look how he's making Obama gravel man I'm not the only one seeing this
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:46.320]  and so I said is Obama going to because it says only a top lord in England is
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:50.800]  the groom of the Queen and is he going to be her potty valet I mean that this is
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:54.800]  the larger question that we're having today when we have to discredit these
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:59.760]  people we have to show how ridiculous worshiping them is other CNN host and
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:03.480]  Fox host were like I'm so nervous it's incredible well will he do the etiquette
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:07.640]  properly will he approach her properly will he oh my gosh this moment from
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:11.520]  Mrs. Obama is the most incredible day of her life to be meeting this incredible
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:14.880]  individual in Obama's on the news saying that Google this for me I saw it up on
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:19.400]  screen Obama loves the Queen it's I love her the greatest person on earth just
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:25.440]  saving everyone this is the greatest example of humanity and grace and this
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.800]  moment to meet her this is unbelievable I've been practicing for weeks how to
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:35.320]  properly worship her grace I mean literally says a lot of that I mean
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:41.040]  it's it's just it's unspeakable this is everything our country was founded
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:47.240]  against yes here it is associated press Obama loves Queen avoids own goal on
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.880]  football whatever that means so print that for me I'll read that later let's
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.880]  continue with your calls here let's talk to Sean in Minnesota hello you're on the
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:03.200]  air Sean hey there Alex good day to you I got two things I want to bring up the
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  first thing being the you were talking earlier earlier about the scumbag cops in
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:17.280]  London pretended to be anarchists and staging false flag operations well I
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.280]  was specifically talking about Denver and and where they were caught
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:26.800]  admitted Denver post-society press they admitted and I was talking about Canada
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:29.120]  last year where they were caught doing and I'm seeing it looks like they're
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:36.720]  doing in here yes yes and I wanted this bill a myth that that a common myth that
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:42.200]  people have about anarchists I have friends who are anarchists and they do
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:49.080]  not by any means of your imagination fit that stereotypical profile that you
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:54.720]  were talking about earlier what anarchists are are are are people who
[1:43:54.720 --> 1:43:59.640]  are pro-liberty they're actually very similar no I know it would carry well
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:02.160]  listen I always get attacked for this I want to be clearly let you finish I
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:05.640]  appreciate you calling I'm always I'm talking about the anarchist at these
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:09.080]  demonstrations have been proven to be government agents over and over again
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:14.880]  confirmed in court confirmed in Seattle post-intelligence or Times of
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:20.160]  London you know I mean it's every time obviously the end and they're always
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:24.640]  actually communists the media they'll have red stars on they'll say you know
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:30.720]  where the liberation Maoist youth brigade and I've got them on video but
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:34.280]  then the news calls them anarchists they're really communist which is
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:38.800]  diametrically opposed to what real anarchists are who are like hyper super
[1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:45.360]  libertarians exactly they're pro-liberty people they believe in freedom they
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:53.640]  believe in no kind of coercion and now I forgot I lost my train my train of
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:58.640]  thought there oh yes that the second thing I wanted to get your perspective
[1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:06.920]  on is what is it about humanity Alex that makes us so dog-gone gullible that
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:12.160]  the fact that that these governments can continuously stage false flag
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:17.200]  operations and people keep falling for it no I hear you let me answer that
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:22.560]  question I appreciate your fine points look to oversimplify things actually
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:26.520]  hurts us I mean it's a cocktail of psychological programming and control
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:30.800]  mechanisms and semantical word games and playing different groups off against
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:35.240]  each other kind of this false projection on the mind this false map this false
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:39.480]  template this false paradigm this false belief system and then there's
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:42.720]  different variants of this the liberal the conservative the libertarian the
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:49.040]  fascist the communists the socialists the and then they manage these kind of
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:52.120]  stereotypes in the mind like oh that's a conspiracy theorist don't believe them
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:55.640]  that they have a UN document calling for world government automatic discredits
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:59.480]  you know it's a it's a it's a term or he's a conservative or he's a this or
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:03.760]  that it's an oversimplification is how they control us but they have a lot of
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.040]  different tricks but mainly they make you feel important mainly they make you
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:12.000]  feel threatened mainly they you know make you feel important in believing
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.320]  they're fraud you know they they pose like they're on your side or they have
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:18.680]  other tricks where they'll we're gonna get these rich elite bankers who got a
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:22.760]  hundred and sixty five million dollars in bailouts oh my gosh we're gonna bring
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:27.360]  them to justice right now we are so angry we are so upset we are gonna do
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:30.520]  something and then you find out that they have memos saying they would make
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:35.800]  that a diversion but they actually wrote the loopholes for those particular
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:45.920]  bonuses and then it's a distraction for twelve point eight to two trillion not
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:52.920]  million not billion but twelve point eight trillion Bloomberg AP Reuters
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:56.760]  today is every few months we get the new numbers first it was two point two
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:00.200]  trillion the first week then a couple months later we found out it's five and
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:03.120]  a half trillion then it's seven trillion then it's eight and a half trillion
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:11.480]  then it's ten trillion a month ago now it is eight it is twelve point eight
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:16.520]  trillion and Congress in Bloomberg and AP file suits and congressmen and
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:19.120]  senators aspirin ackee where the money goes and he goes I'm not going to tell
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:28.200]  you and they send Greenspan on TV to say none of your business I mean open
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:35.280]  stealing everything and then you got to pay taxes on it and meanwhile there's
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:38.600]  some old woman dressed up with a crown on her head with a dirty look on her
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:43.760]  face with some monkey-looking crazy Nazi husband who's like a spoiled twelve
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:49.400]  year-old riddlin had flapping his hands around bossing everyone I mean it just

[1:49:54.600 --> 1:50:00.840]  the morning today I saw a story about the anarchist activity with them hitting

[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:26.480]  point sir hello yes David you're on the air worldwide all right back to my main
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:31.880]  point I'm actually going back to one of your prior stories about the coffins in
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:37.800]  Georgia and it meant with a lot of controversy so I looked into it pulled
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.200]  an all-nighter and I actually found out your story to be true because I went to
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:46.920]  the patent website a lot of people didn't really think to do that but these
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:51.440]  coffins that are out in this middle of the field in Covington there they're
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:57.520]  miles and miles away from the storage facilities that are in Madison and I
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:01.360]  went and I found the patent where it shows a picture of how a body is placed
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:07.360]  inside of these caskets is the terminology that they use and on the
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:14.720]  website for vantage it says vaults but it wasn't ever the word vault was never
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:20.360]  mentioned in the patent itself let me let me explain something listen to this
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:26.480]  video of Houston and Phoenix and all over the country massively expanding
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:30.040]  military cemeteries putting in thousands and thousands of graves huge
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:35.200]  vaults per facility the big concrete ones that we've called the funeral
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:38.200]  director they admit they're massively expanding all over they say that's
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:42.760]  normal on the sep in the separate deal of Georgia people went and videotaped
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:47.920]  that they got the name of the company we went to the website of the big company
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.120]  and admits that over a million of these from their company alone it's a coffin
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:56.920]  liner they like put rotten dead bodies inside of them it's like a big giant
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:00.440]  plastic coffin and they've got hundreds of thousands of them stored at one place
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:03.000]  in Georgia we've people gone out and interviewed the folks that are the
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:07.400]  caretakers you can call the company we call the company that sold them it's
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:10.920]  for the Centers for Disease Control owns them is leasing that property they've
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.760]  got them all over the nation this is just one location yes they are plastic
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:19.680]  coffin liners and you can go to the company's website and buy some of you
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.480]  want to and we wrote articles about it and people live in denial and so they
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:29.720]  want to go ahead oh yeah yeah and the terminology on the website oddly enough
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:34.840]  says vaults but they're not that at all and they're even like a can be used as a
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:39.920]  cremation container because it's made of those products that doesn't pollute the
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:46.480]  environment that itself makes it an international product well good glad the
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:48.840]  government's there and we've had emergency managers on the show where
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:52.280]  they're calling County saying when we put mass graves in your county I mean this
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:56.360]  is confirmed but I mean the government cares for you sir they're giving the
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:00.280]  12.8 trillion to the foreign bankers and in raising all your taxes because they
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:06.200]  care sir the FEMA camps love you I mean the government is good everything is

[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:17.800]  these are record job losses that's how the Reuters financial rescue nears GDP
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:21.760]  gross domestic product as pledges to top 12.8 trillion I know I keep talking
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:27.560]  about that but I mean the magnitude of what's happening here is just staggering
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:32.000]  this this is approaching more than the whole country even makes of the money
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.160]  that's made the entire nation taxes to the bankers that's why they're
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.640]  announcing all these new taxes and we're rewriting the tax codes where you can't
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:43.360]  have exemptions for your house or education or anything else I mean that
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:48.600]  Obama's such a liar he said only taxes on people making over 125,000 apiece or
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:53.400]  total 250 grand a year and it's everybody just get ready everything you
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:56.560]  gots going to the bankers unless you just say look you're a pack of criminals
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:10:00.520]  we're arresting you but that won't happen I'm sure just okay slavery's what you
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:03.760]  want them fine because the world order doesn't exist right it's just all over
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:07.680]  the news now come up at the bottom of the album and play for Tommy Cryer
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:11.680]  attorney law and talk about it somewhere the the clip of Sean Hannity
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:16.480]  you have that video ready gosh the clip of Sean Hannity talking about how
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:19.720]  world government's real and how the conspiracy were right and they're all
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.840]  admitting we're right now because he now it's time to admit the world government
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:26.360]  and Fox is now going to play the part of those a little bit against it but maybe
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:30.400]  we need it but then another Murdoch on companies they're saying they're for it
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:35.520]  in Europe and then the CNN and others they're all for it so that's now are you
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:38.800]  for the world government or not for it they denied it all these years so we
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:42.720]  couldn't build a resistance against it and now and culture in fact I forgot that
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:47.680]  clip you can just Google it I had it at home I didn't bring it today and culture
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:53.800]  endorses Ron Paul 2012 get get that clip ready for ready for for later so I
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:59.120]  will be going over that it's just getting too insane now as all these years
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:02.280]  I'm this dangerous crazy and none of this exists and now oh it's all real we
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:08.880]  love you well we'll tell you what's going on behind that and then I've got a
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:13.920]  free speech issue article here this is out of Fox News they posted an
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:18.080]  associated press article on Fox News special Olympics launches campaign to
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:26.240]  ban the word retard all that means is retarded they have retardation you know
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:34.200]  that's like the word Negro now has been termed a racial slang Anglo Negro the
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:38.520]  in Europe you get arrested and this is you can Google this is a BBC headlines
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:44.560]  they arrested Robin Page we had him on the BBC presenter one man and his dog
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:48.800]  where he goes to different towns hiking each week and in interviews people and
[2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:53.200]  he gave a speech to a rural affairs group and said rural communities to serve
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:57.800]  the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals and they said we believe
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:02.280]  that word was meant to hurt feelings the scientific term scares people had a
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:06.240]  sexual homosexual so we're going to ban that word he was arrested that was in
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:11.480]  the news the BBC agreed with it said we may have to fire him this is very evil
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:16.480]  to to say the word homosexual well because some ignorant people use the
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.920]  term retard to be mean now they want to ban that but this is only to set the
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:26.600]  press the first it's you can't deny that six million Jews were killed at
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.120]  Auschwitz alone certainly Hitler was bad killed a lot of Jews a lot of other
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:33.920]  people it was in the millions there's no doubting that but see the Soviets
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:37.840]  exaggerated and said six million at Auschwitz and then it came out that
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:42.600]  well no we're not Auschwitz six million total and so that original piece of
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:47.840]  information is what caused the larger debate well you say that in most areas
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.040]  of Europe you get arrested and I mean some people serve 20 30 year sentences
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:54.560]  they've grabbed earned sundal they've grabbed a bunch of people and whether
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.720]  you love those people or hate them they have a right under free speech in any
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:02.880]  free society said but we always explain to you it's going to expand into other
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:06.760]  things and it's going to come to the United States and once that precedent
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:10.360]  set with these hate laws they can shut everything down you know I have a right
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:13.880]  to tell some Nazis saying they want to kill black people that's disgusting and
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:17.960]  wrong I have a right when we've had black Israelites call in it's a diverse
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:20.720]  group but some of them are flat out racist and saying I'm a devil man because
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:25.880]  I'm white and I could say you're an idiot racist I have my right to counter him
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:30.520]  and say he's wrong so this is very very dangerous I want to get into some of
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:35.160]  that special Olympics launches campaign to ban the word retard associated press
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:39.280]  a special Olympics launch to campaign 30 to banish the word retard as a casual
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:44.560]  insult that derives from an out of favor medical term that has long been
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:54.160]  considered inappropriate see they just make everything homosexual heterosexual
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:14:01.480]  retarded retardation can't say it people sign pledges not to use the word and
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:05.440]  students gathered to denounce its use at rallies from Florida to Alaska over the
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:09.320]  long-term organizations hope to change attitudes about people and mental
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:13.080]  disabilities who number more than 190 million worldwide according to world
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:16.480]  health organization I mean do you have some punk kids that make fun of mentally
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:21.240]  retarded children medical term who was admittedly retarded
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:27.600]  mentally disabled and then of course that word won't be acceptable either and
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:30.640]  this is all meant to make you self-censor and think about what you're saying and
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:35.040]  think about how you're bad when you're not meaning anything mean this is all
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:38.160]  part of controlling language you can try and now they're saying they want to
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:41.240]  pass laws in Europe and they're teaching us in public schools that's wrong to
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:46.280]  deny climate change global warming they call it climate denial and say it's
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:52.840]  like Holocaust denial so see they say it sounds reasonable let's ban Nazis but
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:56.720]  then they ban your group that isn't Nazi see you have to let the Nazis do what
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:00.680]  they're doing or you lose your rights and this is a it's enshrined in our
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:04.440]  Republic I remember a story in world that daily it was also in the Idaho
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:10.280]  mainstream newspapers we had the lady on and there was a black coach to the
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:18.040]  football team in front of the whole stadium and the husband of the lady was
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:23.640]  in the stands who got arrested he was there taking photos and they lost and
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:30.680]  the guy blew up and went up and started beating the photographer up you know the
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:34.160]  photographer was the wife was the husband in the stands he jumps out and the
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:39.880]  black guy says you know you do you know you dumb white person you dumb you know
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:44.480]  and calls him honky in these other names and so the guy goes and says the
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:49.480]  n-word back to him say honky back into the other and he was arrested and the
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:53.520]  police charged him with so see this is what's going on ladies it was by like
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:57.320]  choking the woman it was on the news but you know it's okay to physically assault
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:01.480]  somebody just don't use that term so this is the type of stuff we have that's
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:06.920]  going on here as they move ahead with this and of course they don't say don't
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:11.080]  take the mercury filled shots that have caused mental retardation in millions of
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:14.480]  children don't do that you know keep giving them the shots it's okay to give
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:18.120]  them HPV shot and they die you know that's okay to kill kids with the
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:22.280]  vaccines just don't once that once we brain damaged them don't don't don't
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:27.960]  talk about how the brain damaged sort of land of freedom of the brain it's all
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:31.720]  these ninnies and it's it's it's reeducation going on in the schools
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:36.800]  sensitivity training it's brainwashing it actually makes people have notice of
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:44.080]  their differences it's like you know so many of these other things they do where
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:46.880]  they tell you oh you can't have a Ron Paul sticker you may be a terrorist meant
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:50.160]  to be a chilling effect meant to always make you think about what you're doing
[2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.120]  then they tie it in with white supremacist and things this is the tactics
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:58.080]  they're using okay without further ado for the rest of the hour and we will take
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.440]  some calls later in the hour Tommy Crier throughout the 15th of this month
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:06.600]  every day or so we're gonna have guests on Joe banister treasury agent who
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:10.440]  exposed the IRS was a big scam and they tried to indict him and arrest him and
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:13.840]  he beat him in court I mean this just for speaking out they did this people in
[2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:23.640]  prison like well mr. Schiff's father you've got Peter Schiff and then he got
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:30.320]  his father in jail I for writing a book about the IRS you've got all this stuff
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:34.600]  happening we're gonna be covering that here on the show in the next few weeks
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.560]  and Tommy Crier is an attorney-in-law successfully defeated the IRS in his
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.000]  own case mr. Crier it's great to have you here with us thanks for having me on
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:47.080]  I'm always glad to be here just just briefly before we got a break tell folks
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:50.040]  about yourself the basics of your case and what we're dealing with there well
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:54.240]  basically what got me involved or tingled up with the IRS was trying to
[2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:59.520]  save a friend to a quick filing because he said there was no law making him
[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:04.960]  liable and of course having to file is tied to being liable first and I told
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:09.720]  him it had to be there well you know the rest of the story on that and once I
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:14.080]  discovered that I challenged the IRS said I'll file if and when you could show
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:18.200]  me you have a right to any my personal information and if and when you show me
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:24.040]  you have a right to any of of my personal earnings and they still haven't been able
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:28.800]  to show me that but what they decided to do was indict me they said well we don't

[2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:55.640]  and others admitting world government's real world takeover that we the cooks
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:00.880]  were right because we read documents public documents and study history we
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:06.320]  got Ann Coulter saying Ron Paul was right just amazing stuff coming up Tommy
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:11.440]  Crier you just recap your case you beat him it made him hopping mad we've got
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:14.520]  Larry Becraft and other serious constitutional lawyers like yourself
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.720]  who's been beating him successful and the reason I like to have you on in
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:21.000]  this whole series of interviews we're doing perhaps I'll have you on with Joe
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.360]  Bannister something at the same time in the next few weeks when they're on is
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:28.480]  that there's all these conspiracy cooks who really are conspiracy cooks who
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:33.120]  discredit us who tell people all these lies and trust and get people put in
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:36.800]  prison so we don't want to tell people this is like the mafia this is a big
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:40.440]  decision to decide to go up against these people it's not a battle I've
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:45.920]  chosen but I commend those that have the courage like yourself to do that just
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:51.040]  it before somebody does decide to go one-on-one see well truth attack the
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:56.480]  organization that formed up to fight this beast to do it in is a coalition
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:25:59.880]  it's not just a group of people it's a coalition of a lot of organizations
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:03.600]  working together hand-in-hand now that's what we've needed to do is to
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:07.800]  consolidate the movement instead of fighting against it with each other
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:14.000]  and it offers a lot of things that people can do that actually does more
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:19.480]  damage to the beast and beating them in court and but if they do want to go one
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:25.040]  on one with the beast they need to first go to truthattack.org and take the
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:29.120]  pre-induction physical there that tells them make sure you're fit for
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:32.760]  singular combat with this monster it's the most powerful and dangerous
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:38.080]  organization in the world and there are two sides of it they can't defend the
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.480]  lies of the mist and you know if you want to fight the lies of the mist you can do
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:47.240]  that without having to put your neck on the block now we need people like Larry
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:50.920]  McGrath up there and we need people that are out there you know willing to stand
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:55.600]  up and and do battle but we also need a lot of people out there fighting and
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:01.480]  chopping away the lies of mist that the internal revenue service uses to scam
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:08.160]  intimidate goers or just out now take by force you know the money and the
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:13.360]  property of people that aren't even liable for the income tax to begin with.
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:16.600]  Well here's two examples I want you to speak to in your case specifically
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:20.320]  we're gonna get into a bunch of other issues with Tommy Cryer gas attorney in
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:27.400]  law and it's this here's an example Congress shall make no law respecting
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:30.440]  an establishment of religion prohibiting the free exercise thereof and then it
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.440]  goes on to the press or to assemble but the government's regulating all the
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:38.680]  major religious institutions and if they don't go get a license from them
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:42.000]  they're taxed but you can make no law so they're breaking the law there well
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:45.800]  same thing with the IRS when they make you fill out those IRS forms under
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:51.200]  threat of arrest they're compelling you to violate your own Fifth Amendment to
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:55.520]  self-incrimination I mean this is with the amendment right to to be private in
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:02.960]  your effects and your personal information. So speak to that sir. Basically what
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:11.040]  they've done is they've used a tax that is intended to cover foreign commerce
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:15.680]  in other words non-resident aliens and foreign corporations doing business in
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:22.080]  the United States and they have tricked through the use of of a clever
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:27.240]  language and a very clever drafting that gives impressions you have to put
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:31.240]  two parts together to understand it they usually separate them put them in
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:39.000]  different boxes and what they've done is they have just sold to people on a rule
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:44.840]  of war instead of the rule of law and this allows them it's more about
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:50.080]  control than it is about money. Who I love that it's a rule of law you're
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:53.840]  right under the IRS system they've now set up family courts that are outside
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:57.440]  the Constitution no due process don't have juries they've set up all these
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:01.040]  other new environmental courts that so Monsanto can poison things but it's
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:04.640]  their own federal court that isn't exactly they've they they're converting
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:08.520]  the whole system from liberty to tyranny from due process to Napoleonic law
[2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:14.960]  through the envelope of the IRS fraud. Yeah exactly and they're using the
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:21.280]  network supposedly of canvassing for liability and collecting taxes in order
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:28.520]  to maintain a 24-7-365 monitoring of every one of our
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:35.040]  activities particularly our financial activity. Tommy Long said we're coming up

[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:11.680]  mean they need to see this this is everywhere why have they suddenly
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:16.520]  admitted we're right that's coming up okay Tommy Crier attorney at law beat the
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:21.120]  IRS in a nutshell boil down how you beat them with the jury that's why they
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:24.840]  want to phase those out how they drag other people into these fake IRS courts
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:28.040]  and try to get them to plea bargain without ever seeing a jury and some of
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:34.720]  the basic scams they run plea offers they did you know we didn't accept it
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:38.800]  because the whole issue was to get the issue up and even if it did you don't
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:43.920]  have to pay the ultimate price but the the jury in my case I was very
[2:34:43.920 --> 2:34:48.840]  fortunate I think I had a jury that that was very attentive and they listened
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:54.280]  and they accepted the instructions regarding willfulness and basically they
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:35:00.320]  ruled that on the basis of the verdict was that I no longer believed that I was
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:06.680]  under illegal duty to file tax returns and that was that eliminated willfulness
[2:35:06.680 --> 2:35:11.080]  on my part now they didn't have to decide what our own attacks are not they
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:14.360]  didn't have to decide whether I was required to file a return but they were
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.000]  astute enough and it's hard to find a jury like that but I was able to apparently
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:25.040]  to articulate what I had discovered and they could see where you know that was
[2:35:25.040 --> 2:35:29.800]  that was my genuine belief it's very difficult to convince jury that you
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:34.240]  believe that the earth is round when everybody knows that it's flat now what
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:39.440]  did the prosecutors do when they were defeated it did it look like they've
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:43.280]  been hit the stomach with a baseball bat well the everybody they had a whole
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:46.800]  bunch of guys from the IRS in the courtroom to hear the verdict and they
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:50.480]  just finished they evaporate I didn't nobody would solve go out they went out
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:56.120]  so fast but the prosecutor did I walked over and we show cans he was doing his
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:02.120]  job yeah we used working for his master and you know it wasn't personal with
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:08.960]  him and me and still is but he you know that they know obviously they were not
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:14.160]  happy and I'm sure that that this did come as a feather in his cap now let's
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:17.720]  talk about Joe Bannister this is a treasury agent here's DV kid on a
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:23.480]  mainstream radio show in the Bay Area of Central California San Francisco he
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  pulls over writes notes for an hour he's a disprove her he's a show she's a
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:31.920]  criminal lying about that being a agency for the private bank he does two years
[2:36:31.920 --> 2:36:34.920]  of research recapping we flew out there to interview him first week and we're
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:39.960]  proud of it he and I are so parallel Alex it's not even funny let's hear those
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:44.920]  both of us were setting out to debunk this both of us spent two years pouring
[2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:48.280]  into it to find out why it didn't take long to see that there was no liability
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:53.320]  provision but takes a long time to dig all the way back to the 13th century and
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:56.720]  all the way back forward study all the constitutional issues and authorities
[2:36:56.720 --> 2:37:02.840]  and understand why and how they did it but the issue is he was still even
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:06.720]  paying taxes for years as he went around the country exposing him because he
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:11.000]  knew how criminal they were so they still indicted him for teaching people
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:17.160]  this just like they did with mr. Schiff Irwin Schiff so I mean it's just
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:21.760]  amazing that's another example of their tyranny example of like for example you
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:26.400]  would you I was listening yet before you introduced me and you referred to the
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:30.360]  the Holocaust denial and they put people in prison for just saying there weren't
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:34.040]  6 million there were maybe 5 million or there were maybe 4 million and they're
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:37.600]  putting people in prison for saying that hey what what about the headcount
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:42.720]  maybe the headcount was wrong as if that's injuring somebody it's the same
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:47.440]  thing here if you tell the truth they're gonna lock you away or they are now
[2:37:47.440 --> 2:37:52.440]  their favorite is what they're called 6700 abusive tax shoppers if you tell
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:56.840]  people that there's no law to make some libel if you tell people that there's
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:01.200]  no basis for their treatment your gross receipts exchange for your labor any
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:05.520]  differently from what Exxon's gross receipts they don't tax them on 100%
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:12.400]  but what they take in how they tax you on 100% so it's only the profit right so
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:16.920]  the it is if you deny that then they come in and say that's an abusive tax
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:22.880]  shelter just for telling people truth and well briefly the Holocaust they put a
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:26.400]  gag order against you now is that first amendment I mean we have freedom of
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:29.880]  speech here that's what I'm trying to say is I'm not I'm not waiting into the
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:34.240]  whole Holocaust to make clearly he'll are killed don't you choose the point
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:38.240]  that you made was dead on the point exactly do we have a first amendment or
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:43.560]  not I mean I mean exactly do we have a first amendment or not we have one
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:51.080]  where we go and you know that all of this you mentioned to the 1913 1913 it
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:58.320]  this isn't just about the income tax the income tax 1913 16th amendment 17th
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:03.680]  amendment cutting the orbs off of all the states you know taking them a kick
[2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:06.640]  them out of where they had no representation in Congress anymore
[2:39:06.640 --> 2:39:14.400]  and above all the Federal Reserve Act everything works in in glove toward
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:17.760]  their siphoning off the willful middle class so we're only going to have two
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:22.800]  classes in this country we're gonna have the rich powerful ruling class and we're
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:27.080]  gonna have the peasants and by the way the ultra rich are now even robbing the
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:30.520]  new vorice while leaving their big swiss accounts alone the ultra elite
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.200]  literally are just robbing everyone including the middle class the upper
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:40.080]  middle class so no one can resist them they're using the tyranny of poverty as
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:44.120]  a control mechanism in the UN club of Rome they all brag that's their system
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:49.640]  shifting years into the those that control the private IRS here and over
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:53.000]  in England I mean they're openly announcing world government saying all
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  our money is going to be paid on interest to private banks for bailing them
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:00.800]  out if the lets people you think it's bad but they're just bailing out bailing
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:06.640]  out is and I'm adult and I'm not taking away from the sexual innuendo on this
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:10.640]  this particular analogy but what we are witnessing in front of God and
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:20.280]  everybody is a huge financial orgasm that is culminating from the
[2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:26.120]  consummation of an unholy and incestuous marriage of big money and big
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:30.560]  government and that's what you're seeing right now you're witnessing that the
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:35.600]  consummation of this marriage has been in the words for the last almost 100
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:38.800]  years yeah they're butchering us they're just stealing everything forever
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:44.240]  bankrupting it and then hoarding it all while saying quote headline you know
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:48.360]  world leaders are desperate to fix things world leaders you find the exact
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:54.160]  headline here we're trying to do something about that and if I can't
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:58.720]  mention that we've got operation stop these scheduled for this April 15th
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:04.840]  already we have stop these thought groups registered on truth tech dot org to
[2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:09.680]  cover over a thousand post offices across the country on April 15th they'll be
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:13.200]  out there with science saying what income tax truth the tech dot org they'll be
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:18.040]  handing out flyers telling people you've just been scammed once a year the
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:21.600]  government herds up all the sheep before us and they run them through the
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:25.280]  squeeze shoots and that gives us a chance to inoculate them with some truth
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.240]  that's a good analogy like they're well the elite see them as cattle so we're
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:33.840]  there trying to feed them red pills so they go from being cattle back to human
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.600]  beings now here it is desperate world leaders me on economic woes ap desperate
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:42.680]  but divided on ways to lift their nations from economic misery world leaders
[2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:47.360]  converge for an emergency summit Tuesday holding scant hopes of finding a
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:50.760]  magic bullet solution so they say it's only going to get worse and but their
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:54.240]  solution when you read further is a world government ruled by the banks that you
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:42:00.320]  pay your carbon taxes to Tommy Crier their solution is more problem you know
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:03.760]  the problem is the government and so they want to have a more problem it's
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:07.040]  kind of like when they were they were bleeding George Washington you know we
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.120]  bled him three times he just keeps getting weaker let's believe him again
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:19.160]  and and he tied you know that's what's gonna happen to us our way of life is
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:23.200]  going to die you know our freedom is already withered on the on the branch
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:30.400]  and it's falling off you know it's a it I am in a state of angst or this I have
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:38.000]  never seen American people more angst ridden more anxious more dreading or
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:43.080]  fearful than they were and I don't know if you recall this or not but at the
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:48.840]  Cuban Missile Crisis is less than I've seen people this fight this concern well
[2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:53.840]  they better be because the elite terrorized people said the markets were
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:57.320]  in trouble so we were gonna have a depression everything plunged they got
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:02.120]  unlimited money and then they hoard it and then cut off liquidity on cars loans
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:07.960]  homes everything by design and it's even coming out in the major press that
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:12.280]  they're making money off this that this is their consolidation well not only
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:16.000]  that but they're cutting they're cutting what our little take is on the
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:20.040]  share crop yes you're cropping us but they're cutting our share and the way
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:25.240]  they do it is it you know when I started working Alex the minimum wage was a
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:30.440]  dollar and sixty cents an hour now back then that dollar and sixty cents was
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:36.360]  backed up with silver still however right now people are minimum wage is 21
[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:41.960]  cents an hour people think it's five something but an FRN is only worth
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:47.280]  about four cents now let me stop there working for 21 cents an hour as opposed
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:53.120]  to $1.60 40 years ago now let me stop you take your time explain that with
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:58.200]  inflation getting paid I've seen different actuaries and numbers but
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:03.400]  what were you getting paid 40 something years ago $1.60 okay $1.60 would have
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:08.800]  been the equivalent of what about $20 an hour but yeah yeah about them if you
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:15.040]  multiply it the factor is 20 to 1 so actually back then I was making the
[2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:20.960]  equivalent today on minimum wage I was making the equivalent a day of 1.6
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:28.360]  times 20 so you're making 30 bucks I'm making 32 bucks an hour okay $32 an
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:31.920]  hour that's that's what inflation so we've had this gradual inflation that
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:35.800]  was bad enough we've really had no inflation Alice because if I've got a
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:40.600]  silver dollar in my pocket it was made in 1923 I've carried in my pocket slick
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:46.000]  as a whistle because I'll carry you for 50 years but in 1923 the day it was
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:49.680]  made it would have bought 10 loaves of bread right now you could take the same
[2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:54.680]  silver dollar probably by 15 loaves of bread no well exactly what I said
[2:44:54.680 --> 2:44:58.640]  inflation I meant the Federal Reserve private banking you know I understand
[2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:02.320]  what you mean but if we would take a look at the dollar a dollar is still
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:07.840]  we'll buy a dollars worth at least and you know what we're looking at is play
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:13.600]  money you can't inflate money that has no value all you can do is dilute it and
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:17.840]  that's what we're seeing they keep pouring water in the soup pot water in
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:21.040]  the soup pot and now you can see the bottom of the pot and they say live off
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:27.160]  of that we're like slaves that have been given out our rations and the rations
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:31.720]  keep having more water and less soup well no that's true but the bankers up
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:34.800]  front when they're first devaluing they buy real assets with the money they
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:38.520]  create a nothing and then now they're even trying to reduce the amount of
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:43.840]  reduced soup we get and that same power that you're talking about just
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:47.520]  acquired by taking over fainting made Freddie Mac just acquired more it is
[2:45:47.520 --> 2:45:54.520]  over half of America's households is that that is it just me or is this
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:46:00.120]  scary well did you see Obama sees basically General Motors he fired the
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:03.680]  director he said you're you get out of there you didn't do what I want and now
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:06.840]  he's going to have that go under government and private banking control
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:11.360]  that controls him and he's saying they may start seizing other companies not
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:17.120]  just banks so this is openly with the government acting as the thug for the
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:21.000]  bankers to just come out and grab everything exactly and what we've
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.480]  gone we're going from we've seen the transition to fascism with this
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  unholy marriage a big business a big government but now the government is
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:37.000]  starting to eat his partner and because the real master over these two is the
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:42.600]  Federal Reserve and the bankers behind it and the bankers are offshore they
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:45.800]  don't care if they destroy Europe in the United States that gives them the
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:49.120]  power they're looking at their world assets assets the hard assets you were
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:54.560]  talking about you couldn't be more correct in your analysis Alex now they
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:46:58.320]  go out and they're not dealing in dollars at devalue they're dealing in real
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:03.880]  assets and have value and yet we're out here playing with this monopoly money
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:07.680]  and say it ain't we rich we'll pay us some more you know we'll get richer
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:12.480]  exactly and they're passing the more property taxes and franchise taxes and
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:16.760]  business taxes right here in Texas and the businesses are all going out of
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:19.640]  business and the globalists openly write white paper saying we want to post
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:25.040]  industrial world where you're all poor people living in shacks and they live
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:28.280]  off on armored mountains with all the high technology and you know the high
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:33.680]  tech health care and everything this is a tool of military financial conquest they
[2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:37.760]  want to hurt you in their own documents and that's what the public has to get
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:42.040]  go ahead absolutely and that's you know a couple of weeks ago truth tech is
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:48.680]  you demand that they they adopt a true stimulus plan to re-energize the the
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:54.320]  economy by suspending the withholding collection of personal income tax my
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:58.840]  corporate is personal start allowing some of this at the rest of money earned by
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:02.880]  the households to go with those households it would it would save a lot
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:07.720]  of these foreclosures that are going on the first place but because people are
[2:48:07.720 --> 2:48:11.600]  unable to buy goods other people are going out of business or out of blues
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:15.880]  their jobs and then they can't buy goods and they can't pay for their homes you
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:20.400]  got more foreclosures more layoffs we can reverse that trend real easy just by
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:25.680]  allowing people to keep their money all these households all of these boom and
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:29.840]  then what happens whenever you've got the 30% isn't being raked off the top of
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:34.240]  every state's gross domestic product every week and that money stays into
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:40.560]  their economy and starts to bubble and simmer and produce the state revenues
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:44.880]  go up the local revenues go up they don't need to borrow and beg money for
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:48.480]  the family let me let me back you up let me back you up revenues go up on the
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:52.200]  other 80 taxes that they have but is that press release getting any coverage
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:57.560]  yeah let me back you up on that not one picked it up Kennedy cut taxes about 50
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:02.760]  percent across the board tax revenues double so they've proved it too many
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:07.920]  times Kennedy proved it didn't turn around Reagan did the same thing he
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:14.080]  proved it or to a lesser extent of George Bush the first with his lesser
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:19.680]  extent tax cut proven revenues go up but let me let me just keep backing you up
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:23.320]  here because it's all true it's about control it isn't revenues this is all
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:29.000]  fiat to them it's done to bring in control as you just said but did you see
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.840]  the Wall Street Journal all these articles analyzing what Obama said he's
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:37.560]  gonna do he is gutting the town sure you've heard this though that he's
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:41.440]  gutting the tax code to get rid of home exemptions education exemptions a tax
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:44.600]  raise on everybody
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:48.360]  well that I've heard about and I'm not at all surprised about you know you

[2:49:54.880 --> 2:50:02.000]  change man and he would change is it worth anything uh George Harp my the
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.400]  lawyer to get me into all this this trouble I was by here the other day
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:09.960]  he said I just had a terrible dilemma I said what happened George he said I got
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:14.840]  out of my car I looked down there was a penny on the ground and he said that's
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:18.360]  how stooped over to pick it up I noticed there was a beer tab laying next to it
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:25.560]  and I didn't know which one to pick up that's right because it doesn't have
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:30.080]  any copper in it well that that that aluminum beer tab is probably you know
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:37.760]  worth more to penny and these fengalis these scam artists these

[2:54:40.600 --> 2:54:44.040]  piece place to fight it you notice Beck says a restaurant Paul supporters a
[2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:47.360]  year ago they know he says he's our best friend but then Monday next Monday he's
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:51.160]  gonna discredit the FEMA camps coming up Friday I'm gonna do two hours on and

[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:04.200]  show fake news about camps and then try to just prove it that way but I wanted to
[2:55:04.200 --> 2:55:07.800]  get Tommy Crier's comments in the next five minutes after these clips here's
[2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:13.400]  in culture a few days ago on Fox News you can videos on YouTube but here's the
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:17.600]  audio talking about how she loves Ron Paul is gonna vote for him in 2012 here
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:22.560]  it is who's the leading candidate for the Republicans for 2012 I don't know is
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:26.240]  the New York Times picked him for us yet I don't know I think the last one yeah
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:30.080]  I don't know I don't see the time no thoughts no thoughts I think Ron Paul the
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.120]  war will be over and basically I agreed with Ron Paul on everything there will
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:38.880]  be so much to clean up I mean other than war we will have I think I think even
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:45.240]  Obama will be in his 80s by then you know all right that's enough of that now
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:50.520]  here's the next clip here is Dick Morris of the Clinton White House with Sean
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:57.920]  Hannity and this was what last night here it is video for folks there is a
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:56:02.220]  big thing that's gonna happen in London at this G20 and then they're hiding it
[2:56:02.220 --> 2:56:06.320]  they're camouflaging it they're not talking about it coordination of
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:11.280]  international regulation what they are going to do is to put our Fed and our
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:16.600]  SEC under the control in effect of the IMF oh come on they believe they'll do
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:20.640]  this that's what was in the draft agenda they call it coordination of
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:24.680]  regulation what it really is is putting the American economy under
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:29.400]  international regulation yeah and those people who have been yelling oh the UN
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:32.720]  is gonna take over global conspiracy theorists they consider they've been
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:37.040]  crazy but now they're right yeah well when guy it's happening when God
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:40.440]  Geithner said he would be open to the idea of a global currency last second
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:45.640]  yeah those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years you're not
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:51.160]  wrong and you know it's what they always do with these conferences is they have
[2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:54.920]  this the center show is here and the side show they don't want you to pay
[2:56:54.920 --> 2:56:59.360]  attention to the center show is the size of the stimulus package the real show
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:03.840]  is international regulation of the financial institutions which is going
[2:57:03.840 --> 2:57:08.120]  to happen under the IMF control and remember the IMF is run by Europeans
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.200]  the World Bank by Americans all right now the last clip here's Michael Savage
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:17.720]  two weeks ago the government staging terror attacks here it is at very soon
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:23.360]  Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag Reichstag fire I
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:27.520]  don't know what form it will take but I believe that once the minions are seen
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:32.280]  for what they are Raman Manuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:36.280]  this country of some kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:40.400]  Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War when civil civilian suspects were
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:44.640]  arrested without warrant I will tell you as I sit here I fear that every night as
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:48.960]  I go to sleep I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:54.360]  control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth
[2:57:54.360 --> 2:58:00.080]  now now why are they doing this because they've lost all credibility they said
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:03.400]  none of this existed for all these years now it's all over the news this is
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:07.840]  being set up it's all over TV but the news is telling you it's good so they
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:10.480]  have to play the part of the anti-establishment oh now we're against
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:14.000]  it and I agree I've been saying for months that Obama's gonna stage a big
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:17.760]  terror attack because his agenda is already strong and I predicted that
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:21.600]  months ago so Tommy Crier back in 70 seconds final five minute comments from

[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:18.800]  huge that's what would you have out there on the market they deal in
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:23.000]  entertainment now the fact that they are coming out saying these things mean
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:28.080]  that they're beginning to recognize that we have grown to the point to where we
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:32.520]  are an appreciable segment of the audience so they're having to give us
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:38.320]  some of our flavor of candy now these guys don't care they are part of the
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:43.920]  problem and but the fact that they are speaking to us as though they do is an
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:48.040]  indication I think that we're growing to the point to where we're coming in
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:54.240]  undeniable segment of the world reality very astute they're having to respond
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:59.120]  because we are becoming the majority they have to they have to respond because
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:03.200]  we have become a significant enough portion of society that we become a
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:07.480]  market now that's that's all we are you know that that's what it's to the
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:11.600]  government or the mainstream media or to the banking industry or to the you know
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:17.800]  to big business we are nothing but but cattle that to be you know milk to be
[3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:25.200]  slaughtered to to be exploited and they are seeing now that we are a market and
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:30.000]  that to me is an encouraging thing not because they have admitted or anything
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:33.400]  because they don't they're sitting here like you said they're talking about this
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:39.120]  as though it's a good thing it's not a good thing and so you know this this
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:45.120]  business of pandering is all that we ever see from the so-called conservative
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:51.400]  you know if you ever heard Hannity or you ever heard Limbaugh or you ever heard
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:59.240]  even Dick Morris or or any of these others talk about doing something about
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:03.360]  it it's all just say don't kill us so fast don't kill us oh you're doing it
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:08.160]  too quick oh there's a week it shouldn't be happening but they never talk about
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:12.400]  going back getting any of our freedom back to it but all they're doing is
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:17.200]  giving us of that illusion that we have a voice out there well it's more than
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:20.400]  that the voices of with the entertainers the voices with the truth
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:24.760]  tellers like you and like me and like like a joe banister to get up there
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:29.680]  and say this is a true folks well more than that and I agree with the point
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:33.880]  you made and that's certainly part of it we've made those points it's also the
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.520]  fact that they see we're growing so fast that they understand they could lose
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:40.480]  this thing so they're hedging their bets and on top of this they see our growth
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:43.760]  rate and I say we're probably the biggest one group out there people don't
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:47.040]  trust the government know about the new order we're you mean it's mainstream
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.640]  now but also they want to get our confidence they can slip poison in
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:56.280]  that's what Beck does he'll say one week I'm gonna cover the FEMA covers he goes
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:03:59.120]  oh I found out they're not real we're gonna debunk them when it's in the
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:02.200]  mainstream you know Associated Press they built the FEMA camps for the people
[3:04:02.200 --> 3:04:05.920]  absolutely you know just like the New York Times recently ran I met that guy
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:11.960]  he was wanting to do a story on us what he was going to do was a good job he
[3:04:11.960 --> 3:04:17.720]  was going to disembowel the movement he was an interloper and you know that I
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:20.440]  didn't give him anything I just walked away said if you really want to know
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:22.960]  here's the truth if you want to know anything more about coming back and
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:27.280]  they were coming back they don't want to know the truth they just want story
[3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:32.320]  they're entertainers you know now you know that's why we've got to get to the
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:36.400]  people and say here's where your your answers lie your answers lie in the
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:39.960]  truth all right Thomas take stay with us a few more minutes because I want to

[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:26.760]  camp news and I can't give you much of the details because they want me to because
[3:08:26.760 --> 3:08:32.280]  it could alert folks to who they are but I'm allowed to put these photos up on
[3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:42.680]  the web this is not Georgia this is the fellow the truck driver picking up the
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:47.280]  FEMA coffins they've got these in Colorado Georgia Michigan Texas
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:51.640]  California picking them up at the factory and we know the company I mean
[3:08:51.640 --> 3:08:55.360]  it's admitted these are mass coffins for CDC and delivering them to another
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:00.280]  location and that's all I'm allowed to tell you but you know what go ahead and
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:05.800]  give these to Tim or one of the guys in the back have the guys scan these in
[3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:10.920]  don't have Rob do or Jason do it because they're busy making a video map of the
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:16.440]  one of the big FEMA facilities and then the the tent cities where they're
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:19.920]  forcing them out to the FEMA facility so that this all dovetails it's coming up

[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:43.600]  then took him to another facility and it's outside it's not Georgia and that's
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:46.720]  all we can say I'm gonna see if I get the truck driver to come on and say more
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:53.080]  but he didn't want to so I'm Tommy Cryer I mean it's like a war room in here
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:56.680]  every day there's just so much happening yeah yeah and it's accelerating
[3:09:56.680 --> 3:10:01.720]  and that's why we have to accelerate you know that's why we have to go through
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:06.880]  the tech has a comprehensive plan we need funding for a lot of it but you'll
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:11.200]  that we don't we can't implement yet but we've got a lot going on we've got

[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:56.360]  easy to break our fingers but when you roll them up into a fist it gets long
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:00.120]  is it hard to break thing break them but you can start breaking things with
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:04.440]  that fist and I've never seen the kind of activity that we've seen this year
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:08.800]  truth attack has gotten a huge response from across the freedom movement not

[3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:08.800]  globalist we're having huge success everybody should be more positive and
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:11.800]  this is a big part of the solution let's take three calls that are
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:14.720]  specifically for you then I'll get everybody else. Mark in Texas thanks
[3:13:14.720 --> 3:13:18.640]  for holding on the air with Tommy Cryer who beat the IRS go ahead. Hey Mr.
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:22.360]  Cryer and Mr. Jones or Alex thank you for your time I'm glad to be with y'all
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:30.400]  and I have a book from a fellow back in 1960s his name is Norman F. Dacey he was
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:36.760]  a probate a will in the States person he was helping people in the he just
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:44.640]  exposed the whole corrupt system of the judges lawyers the whole and his
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:48.880]  statement in the beginning of his second chapter of calling probate the ugly
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:55.240]  side he said well unto you lawyers you have taken away to not in yourselves and
[3:13:55.240 --> 3:14:02.920]  then that we're entering in you hindered and I I saw that the first
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:07.120]  paragraph it says in most areas of this country the probate probate procedure
[3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:11.760]  they scandal a form of tribute levied by the legal profession upon the estates
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:15.400]  of its victims both living and dead and it mentioned many of people that were
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:19.120]  kids that were disabled in these corrupt people were just constantly taking
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:23.800]  their money and I haven't researched all of this significantly my expertise is
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:28.080]  in the natural health field for about 20 years and that's what reason was my
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:31.080]  original call but when I noted that y'all were talking about this when I got
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:35.400]  little bits of the of the call when I went I had my other line I figured well
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:39.760]  I'd ask a question and see what the fellow here had thought about and I had
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:45.480]  one other okay well I'm gonna let you go a lot of time but specifically Mr.
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:50.440]  Crier yes you know they have this estate tax and they have the probate and the
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:54.320]  lawyers have the time end up in the state as well stealing all the money
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:59.600]  well not exactly you could make a case for that because you take
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:06.200]  exceptions I've probably handled 400 maybe even 500 estates with the course of
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:11.560]  my career and they've always gone through smoothly and nominally at a
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.720]  nominally expense and without any siphoning off the courts aren't doing
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:21.800]  anything but maybe a hundred or two dollars for profiling fees attorneys
[3:15:21.800 --> 3:15:25.160]  don't charge that much for an estate just but I have seen the horror stories
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:29.720]  no in my family story because there are there are abusive and predatory
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:34.400]  attorneys out there and that we do have with respect to larger states we have a
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:39.360]  very abusive and predatory government but I do want to warn people I do want to
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:44.200]  warn people one of the most predatory groups I've seen per capita is the fake
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:50.560]  patriots that are out there I call them patriot mythology and be crap is covered
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:54.200]  as maybe you can briefly mention it per capita the most abusive thing I've
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:15:57.240]  seen they will sit there and tell people they're setting them up a trust and
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:00.560]  steal their property and I'm telling you I mean there's a folks we tell you the
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:06.160]  most dangerous thing out there is is the fake patriot movement these quote you
[3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:10.200]  know they're usually they're not lawyers go ahead yeah yeah and their lawyer one
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:14.560]  of these are they they call themselves late lawyers one guy does and I'm just
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:17.960]  clearly doesn't wish he was smart enough to have been a brain surgeon I'll only
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:23.400]  operate on my friends just on weekends but the you know there's a lot of that
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:27.840]  and I think a lot of it too originates with the government because they're the
[3:16:27.840 --> 3:16:32.680]  only ones that benefit from this for those things and you've got a lot of
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:37.600]  people out there that are PAY patriots that are in it for the business and
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:43.200]  matter of fact those will resist those those of us who are actually trying to
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:49.040]  to stop you know this because they feed off of it folks I could name you the
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:52.400]  same thing though how parades with with a lot of guys out there telling so-called
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:57.440]  insurance and trust to avoid the horrors of probate and if they're to
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:01.960]  charging people six ten fifteen thousand dollars to avoid a seven hundred fifty
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:05.040]  dollar probate yeah I agree folks watch out any
[3:17:05.040 --> 3:17:08.960]  charlton that says I'll get you out of taxes you know let me be the trustee of
[3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:12.680]  the trust or my friend I have watched him and I've warned people in Austin they
[3:17:12.680 --> 3:17:16.680]  never listen they get ripped off and these people all hate me boy you wouldn't
[3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:19.880]  believe how much they hate me but I will not sit here and watch their criminal
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:24.240]  activity let's go ahead and talk to Taylor in Florida Taylor on the air with

[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:52.840]  is I really have a question my question is what we really need to do first of
[3:17:52.840 --> 3:17:58.480]  all is the spread of information is going like people people are definitely
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:03.340]  being coming to where the scary thing is about it though is that who has the
[3:18:03.340 --> 3:18:09.760]  mass control of of the knowledge of the popular opinion of the of the world view
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:14.360]  of what's going on is now starting to catch on and like it like what Alex
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:21.400]  has been talking about and they have at this point if people don't quit being
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:24.680]  scared of talking about it because the thing is people are weak but people are
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:29.120]  two people want to live their lives that's right and the Trojan horses I
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:32.600]  appreciate your call Glenn Beck and others they're going to falsely lead

[3:18:36.840 --> 3:18:42.000]  that they they want to lead us up and what it's misdirection and disinformation
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:47.400]  and what they're doing is keeping us off the real track and basically you know
[3:18:47.400 --> 3:18:51.000]  what truth attack is doing on the consolidation point at the color mate
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:55.800]  is that we're not trying to to to take over any movement or anything all we're
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:18:59.720]  doing is saying we're the cavalry support us and what we do is take the
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:03.640]  offensive step and our object is to take the government put it back in his box

[3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:03.360]  all right you want to go first or not to fill him in okay well we we land in in
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:08.880]  Long Beach and we stayed there the night we got in kind of late and the next
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:12.600]  morning we went to just go shoot some shots and check out a park that was near
[3:26:12.600 --> 3:26:15.800]  where we were that supposedly has a lot of homeless to try to find out you know
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:20.240]  the tent city areas around there and so we wake up and we're shooting stuff we
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:24.840]  hear these cadences and marchings and and we look over and it's these these
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:30.160]  group of youths and white t-shirts and shorts and they were being bused in by
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:34.320]  the sheriff's department and they were doing exercises and and Tyler's three
[3:26:34.320 --> 3:26:39.080]  bus loads of people plus their other vans and sheriff's police cars it was all
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:43.280]  sheriff's department was this I haven't even heard of this well yeah there's so
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:46.040]  much to see I mean that was the first thing we saw and we got up the next
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:49.480]  morning youth brigade thing that's I mean it's something like that footage of
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:52.960]  that oh yeah we have lots of footage of this insanity and and so and then we
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:56.080]  even brought the cameras over and you know I set it down and pretend like it
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:59.520]  wasn't on aimed at right at the guy said hey you know we're just from Austin
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:03.080]  Texas right here shooting some footage you know what's going on and and he kind
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:08.120]  of laid it out it's it it's a program that where the sheriff's it's sort of
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:11.320]  their youth outreach to for people who want to go into law enforcement try to
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:14.040]  convince people to go into law enforcement they bring them out there on
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:19.720]  Saturdays and they do marches and and cadences and exercises and running I
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:23.040]  guess they're running up and down the pier they're doing all kinds of stuff
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:26.080]  and that all sounds reasonable but the state's out of control sure is what
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:29.600]  Russia China everybody did they get them while they're young right right and it
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:33.040]  seems like because I had actually heard of this where I was from in Louisiana they
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:36.280]  had the same thing like it's going on everywhere it's right it's secure core
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:39.240]  but they do it locally with the federal dollars they try and warrant
[3:27:39.240 --> 3:27:43.200]  apprehension gun confiscation that's been in the news I mean these kids all look
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:45.960]  like they would be ready to follow any order they were given yeah they were
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:50.160]  very serious they were they were very serious how old were they what would you
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:54.920]  say 14 14 to maybe 17 exactly like Russia yeah I mean there it was
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:59.000]  definitely you know and they were all in March in cadence doing doing the thing
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  and it was a well-oiled machine yeah I was going to email us and tell me which
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:07.640]  one of my films is it is it police state three total enslavement or is it
[3:28:07.640 --> 3:28:11.960]  masters of terror where I have the Russian newscast in English where it
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:15.320]  goes these guys these children are ready to get tough on tax sheet shows like
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:18.840]  14-year-olds practicing karate chops with and they send them to government
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:23.080]  homes to be trained for this wow we ought to pull that up yeah I was that was a
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:26.080]  man that was just the first part of the day and then we spent the rest of the
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:31.720]  day driving around LA looking at these spots Jason's from you know LA and you
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:34.200]  know I want you to tell them a little bit about that driving around LA yeah I
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:38.680]  basically went to all the hot spots where I know there's high concentrations of
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:42.480]  homeless before we left and one of the reasons that we went to LA was because
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:48.400]  we kept hearing these stories about the homeless they're getting tickets 154
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:53.400]  dollar tickets for being on the street or not having a home illegal camping is
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:58.120]  illegal camping but the illegal aliens are left alone right right of course so
[3:28:58.120 --> 3:29:03.000]  we just went to all the hot spots where I knew that they should be and indeed we
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:07.820]  didn't see anybody on the streets so we can only suppose that they've either been
[3:29:07.820 --> 3:29:12.240]  rounded up well you said you were told by people that oh there was a camp here
[3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:15.760]  but they moved it now we found out that in the LA Times I wish we'd have this
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:21.880]  for you left that was in the new Saturday that they have one outside LA in
[3:29:21.880 --> 3:29:27.000]  Ontario and they're wearing they're wearing wristbands they're they're

[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:37.040]  you were out there about what you were seeing and witnessing a little bit but
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:39.840]  not as I mean we were trying to concentrate more on the subject matter
[3:34:39.840 --> 3:34:43.120]  and but we did shoot some stuff of us driving around that's just this film

[3:34:50.080 --> 3:34:52.480]  was so quick I didn't really give you directions yeah towards the end we
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:56.680]  started doing yeah yeah and I mean the whole trip kind of evolved as you know
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:02.440]  as we went on we finished up you know searching around LA we ran into a guy
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:06.640]  who and I think I talked to you this about on the air who's getting who's
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:10.960]  losing his small business and he had taken a second mortgage out in his home
[3:35:10.960 --> 3:35:15.480]  and he was a massage teacher he'd open up a massage school let's do it this way
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.160]  let's stop right here because I just started thinking to tape this okay start
[3:35:19.160 --> 3:35:22.160]  over you know what you did what you witnessed kind of run through it and
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:24.880]  then the key stuff they're grabbing their kids they're grabbing their cars okay
[3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:28.000]  and then the illegal aliens are by the lobby break down just everything you got
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:31.480]  the floor I'm just gonna sit back okay well that that morning we start off in
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:36.400]  Long Beach and we we witnessed the you know kind of Obama youth brigade type
[3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:42.520]  activity going on at the at the dock or at the the heart was at the wharf the
[3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:46.320]  wharf there and and that was interesting and then we kept we were driving
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:50.440]  around Long Beach and then we went into LA we went where are the places we went
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:54.600]  Jason knows LA we came we came through downtown and I took him off to see you
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:59.520]  know some of the hotbeds we went through Watts and South Central just looking
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:04.320]  around there we went downtown LA we went to the east side and looked at some
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:11.080]  murals that I've seen have seen before which pretty interesting yeah sort of
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:16.480]  anti propaganda yeah we have some crazy shots over there and then we went to we
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:20.440]  stopped by a cemetery and they're you know military cemetery and they're
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:25.240]  digging more more graves there a lot more and you know and then and then we
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:29.280]  finished up heading out into Sacramento I met this before that we met this guy
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:34.160]  Dr. John and he told us his story and and we have we'll have video of all that
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:37.640]  he made this big sign and he's actually had people coming in because of this
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:41.480]  sign and talking about the bailout in AIG coming in agreeing with him you know
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:45.320]  that Obama's not doing a good job and you know he doesn't see a lot of people
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:47.800]  and he actually voted for Obama and he you know a lot of these people that we
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:51.800]  talked to they think Obama is gonna save them they really are out of touch
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:57.080]  we met a guy in Venice Beach who was you know saying the same things he thinks
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:37:00.920]  Obama's gonna do it they're aware of the corruption that's going on but they
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:05.640]  don't see the difference between Obama and you know the corruptors you know
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:09.560]  it's crazy in the same breath that they'll say something like oh I can't
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:13.400]  believe Obama did this or what about you know we we don't agree with the bail
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:17.600]  outs they'll say but Obama's gonna save us yeah I mean they just there even
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:21.000]  though they just said you know some of the things that he's doing wrong the
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:25.040]  mass brainwashing is there and then so then we went up to Sacramento we got
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:30.400]  there early in the afternoon following the map we drove around we ended up in
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:33.800]  this little neighborhood kind of a mixed used industrial neighborhood that has
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:37.800]  some you know kind of like machine shops and concrete mixing plants and stuff
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:42.480]  and then to two streets of houses really nice looking houses and middle class
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:46.160]  looking you know yeah and and then you see a bunch of people walking up this
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:49.640]  bike path and I bet that's where it is so we walked up there we just took the
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:52.160]  little camera with us the first time because we weren't sure what kind of
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:57.760]  reception we would get and you know we walk up walking around there's a ton of
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:01.880]  people up there I mean it there I mean there really are everywhere and they've
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:06.720]  created a little community if you guys want to pull up the map now this might
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:12.080]  be a good time to show the map that we have and you know they really did you
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:15.600]  could see the numbers on there the red sections are areas where there were
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:20.480]  tents the green car that's where we would park and walk up so there's a first
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:24.460]  section there called the snake pit which had about 25 people in it and 25
[3:38:24.460 --> 3:38:29.080]  tents we're counting tents not people because the numbers of people go up and
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:32.680]  down and then you walk across the train tracks and then you hit a little sliver
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:37.360]  right next to the right next to the river is a levee and then on the other
[3:38:37.360 --> 3:38:40.960]  side of the levee they're not they're not allowed to camp on the levee to the
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:44.800]  river because that's parkland and they get tickets for that so they camp on
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:49.720]  this other side and the big 85 section that is the section that even the
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:52.720]  homeless people they called it the ghetto the other ones that were there and
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:38:57.040]  they said don't go in that area at night unless you know somebody or you're with
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:01.360]  somebody and while we were there there was an actual fire that broke out in
[3:39:01.360 --> 3:39:07.040]  yeah it's hard to say that's a racial enclave there we saw we saw a mainly a
[3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:14.200]  mixture of whites and blacks in 85 yeah in there and then overall I would say
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:19.360]  it was more probably seven 70% white 30% black yeah about that and then out of
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:24.560]  that maybe another younger yeah the younger black kids lived in that area
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:27.800]  and then there but there were some white people in there and then you go where
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:31.960]  the star was as a guy that we met he actually was pulling electricity off of
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:34.600]  the radio tower and he was the only camp there that had electricity with
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:38.560]  permission from the person who owns that plot where the radio tower is see
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:42.880]  there's several corporations that own this area it's not all overlapped on
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:47.520]  top of each other there's the railroad there is smud which is the Sacramento
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:53.040]  Municipal Utilities District you know and also Parks and Recreation in
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:56.480]  recreation which owned the levy right well give us the rest of the tour but
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:00.280]  then I want to get into grabbing the kids grabbing the cars and that's the key
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:04.280]  and then what happens at this facility they are trying to make them go to right
[3:40:04.280 --> 3:40:07.720]  so there's there's a lot of facilities there actually that are there for the
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:11.960]  homeless right right across you go through the neighborhoods and cross 16th
[3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:15.600]  Street and then you have the loaves and fishes the Salvation Army the places
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:18.800]  that are set up they give these guys a hot meal you can see the fish that's
[3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:23.400]  kind of where that area is and you know they're they're allowed to get a shower
[3:40:23.400 --> 3:40:27.520]  they eat and then where the X is is actually the pickup spot for the guys
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:33.040]  where they take you to the nighttime facility that they have to be there at
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:37.600]  3 p.m. they bust them in when they get there they pad them down they wand them
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.440]  down with you know to check for stuff they look through their bags bring them
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:44.920]  in they give them one meal and then at five in the morning they wake them all
[3:40:44.920 --> 3:40:48.320]  up and bring them back out to the stream we have video of all of that taking
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:51.640]  place and actually where they take them to is this place called the Cal Expo
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:58.600]  Center and it's an old the it's a giant huge it's a state fair yeah the state
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:01.960]  fairground with a fair yeah you know it's a very big area but what they've done
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:06.800]  is converted a building right and a miniature golf course right that was
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:09.380]  also a miniature golf it's very surreal you know you have this pretty
[3:41:09.380 --> 3:41:14.080]  party building and palm trees and this miniature golf course and then people
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:18.400]  funneling in and apparently they're they're severely searched yeah they
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:20.840]  and controlled and they can't keep anything they're not allowed to really
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:24.440]  they're allowed to have bring one bag with them at the bus site where they get
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:29.040]  picked up they can park their bicycle and like one other bag of stuff so I mean
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:32.200]  if you're gonna try to better better yourself I don't see how you can do it
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:36.960]  owning two bags of articles and and a bike and not having any other possessions
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:40.040]  so they're telling me you can't live out here in the shanty town we're gonna
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:43.880]  force you into the camp you're saying the camp only holds 150 people right
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:48.440]  they have to leave at 5 a.m. be there at 3 p.m. to be bused in their search like
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:52.080]  prisoners and then it's hard to have a job during those hours right but then
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:55.680]  meanwhile there's massive harassment of those that do have cars they're trying
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:59.120]  to have a job and save money while they live in the shanty town let's let's go
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:03.160]  over the top of stuff they go through well we met a guy named Jason and one
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:06.160]  the first night we were there actually and we ended up interviewing him three
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:09.280]  times because you know for one reason or another we thought we could get a
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:13.160]  better you know sound recording of his it's chaotic out there so it's really
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:19.880]  hard to get a really windy to but so so Jason he he was had some problems and
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:23.400]  he was living he bought a Winnebago and had you know outfitted it out he had
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:28.760]  lost his job but really inexpensively and then was you know fixing it up
[3:42:28.760 --> 3:42:33.080]  spending all of his money on getting it running right and neglected to get the
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:36.640]  three four hundred dollar insurance right and he got pulled over and didn't
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:40.640]  have insurance so they pulled him out they towed it away and this is a few
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:44.720]  about seven months ago or some six weeks ago something like that it was a
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:48.600]  few it was a few weeks before yeah in January that's what it was and so that
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:51.760]  happened to him there and then I guess he'd gotten some money to go get it out
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:55.120]  and they'd already auctioned it off so within two weeks they had sold all of
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:57.760]  his possessions I know there's laws I think you're supposed to have a few
[3:42:57.760 --> 3:43:00.800]  months before they do that yeah I mean apparently they probably just thought
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:03.760]  they could pull one over on this guy and and you know when you don't have a
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:07.520]  network of anything it's it's really easy to get taken advantage of and it
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:10.400]  wasn't just a vehicle that had a few of his things I mean this never
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:14.960]  bago had his entire life and yeah he said there were computers a DVD player
[3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:17.520]  you know everything that you would have and the police wouldn't let him have
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:22.120]  that no they took it all and not only not only that well they took all of his
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:25.160]  stuff they left him on the side of the road startovers we're taping for the
[3:43:25.160 --> 3:43:30.840]  film go ahead okay let's go ahead Jason so yeah we we meet Jason and he's
[3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:35.520]  telling us his story about you know fixing up this win a bago being unable
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:39.280]  to afford the insurance so he was driving around it was about a month after he got
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:44.680]  it and driving around without insurance got pulled over the police had this whole
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:48.120]  rigamarole where you know they were playing good cop bad cop one guy was
[3:43:48.120 --> 3:43:52.440]  saying oh yeah we're not going to to tow you away and then finally in the end
[3:43:52.440 --> 3:43:56.120]  that it came out that yes they were going to take all of his stuff they were
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:44:00.600]  going to tow him and leave him on the side of the road with the clothes on his
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:05.160]  back with the clothes on his back can I drop you somewhere no the clothes on
[3:44:05.160 --> 3:44:08.960]  your back just fend for yourself and so somehow he ends up in tent city and he'd
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:13.880]  been living there for a while and he lived with this one guy who the guy had
[3:44:13.880 --> 3:44:17.120]  the electricity was live with him for a while and then he moved into another tent
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:22.720]  and he's you know this guy used to be a sales manager for a floor tile and
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:27.880]  adhesive company yeah the reason this is so important is that here's a guy who
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:31.320]  was lower middle class yeah he gets down as luck he tries to get a win a bago to
[3:44:31.320 --> 3:44:34.400]  live in to get a lower grade job and build money back up to get on his feet
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:37.480]  sure this happened to tens of millions of our ancestors many of them still
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:40.880]  living in the Great Depression now Greg Sirath that movies based on real
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:43.720]  things that happen it's even worse seven million starved death according to
[3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:48.320]  major university studies and that was when 90% of us were self-sufficient so a
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:51.800]  large portion of those that weren't died and they wouldn't arrest you for trying
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:54.960]  to pull off the road or live in you know the bushes somewhere in a tent as long
[3:44:54.960 --> 3:44:58.520]  as you were nonviolent they did have bonus marchers who've been living for
[3:44:58.520 --> 3:45:07.320]  years in DC that they then sent in Eisenhower as a young captain and the
[3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:11.640]  colonel of course the World War one hero was MacArthur and they wrote him down
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:14.960]  shot him killed him to get rid of that shanty town because they were there
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:18.240]  saying we were promised our bonuses so this has happened a few times before but
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:23.120]  the issue here is in the police come grab his home and his equipment his
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:27.480]  computers everything he's got won't let him have it and then take it away and
[3:45:27.480 --> 3:45:31.400]  now he's just completely blown away and pretty much and and he had gone into the
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:36.040]  shelters he had and he was you know with a smile on his face he was explaining
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:39.760]  how they search him and how they they wand him down and pat him down and that
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:43.120]  it's for his safety and this and that we met another and to them the same being
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:46.640]  treated like this is is completely pedestrian now yeah yeah they seem to
[3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:49.880]  not not you know they think it's for their safety we met another guy a
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:53.880]  younger a black gentleman who was getting ready to get on the bus and go
[3:45:53.880 --> 3:45:56.240]  there and we're asking him you know why do you why do you do it he's like well
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:45:59.240]  it's safe he's like I don't go to that tent city because it's dangerous so they've
[3:45:59.240 --> 3:46:02.360]  they've told him that it's dangerous over there meanwhile we're walking around
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:07.200]  there at 11 11 30 at night after after interviewing people and you know we
[3:46:07.200 --> 3:46:10.160]  never got attacked we never got I never felt threatened in any way while we were
[3:46:10.160 --> 3:46:13.440]  there well statistically take the super done they made people high and dry go to
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:16.480]  it right and then didn't give them any aid they were rapes and murders as the
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:20.440]  police stood down and as this gets worse and worse this is gonna exacerbate now
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:26.280]  guys I just I am do a story I want you to put up on screen it's LA times
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:33.720]  headline because this is separate this is the LA times this weekend this is the
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:39.880]  headline is Ontario residents only at tent city and since they've changed the
[3:46:39.880 --> 3:46:42.480]  headline that's where it was a headline about wristbands that's how I was able
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:46.960]  to pull this up and it says in here they take their children CPS them they take
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:52.480]  their dogs and they in this article they take their cars and RVs wow and so yeah
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:56.000]  it's in this story I want to put it up on screen so this is happening everywhere
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:59.840]  specifically what are the stories you heard about taking children one lady we
[3:46:59.840 --> 3:47:03.840]  interviewed the last day we were there she hadn't had her dog and you know a lot
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:07.560]  of this is like kind of afterthought oh my kids got taken away and you know and
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:10.880]  it was because her mom they got her mom to testify against yeah there's there's
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:15.080]  various stories but the the main one that I kept hearing was turning
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:20.400]  state grandparents yeah against their children right and then taking away those
[3:47:20.400 --> 3:47:24.520]  you know the grandchildren thinking that they're going to get the grandchildren
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:28.760]  but then they just end up going into the system right how that propaganda works
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:32.760]  I've noticed in all these different sitcoms and TV shows and dramas the
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:37.160]  grandparents call the CPS and they show you on TV every night on different
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:41.280]  shows I mean it's everywhere yeah and that's one microcosm example is law and
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:45.040]  order type shows they show that exactly like oh call the police your neighbor we
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:47.520]  saw they had a gun in their house when most places in the country of guns on
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:50.880]  illegal it's all based in New York or something you know in the drama and so
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:53.560]  they think oh I'm gonna get the grandkids you know my daughter's a drunk or
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:47:57.080]  whatever and then no no no the state supposed supposed to give it to family
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:00.120]  know they're gonna get more money keeping an institutionalized so folks need
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:03.840]  to know that isn't how this is gonna work yeah they're gonna get shamed and
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:07.920]  you know they're at least four or five stories that we talked to with women who
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:12.040]  they had their kids and or or you know they were taken away or their their
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:17.800]  grandkids had been taken away and you know it's really sad it was a really sad
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:21.640]  place to be and it's it's sad because you see these people trying to make a
[3:48:21.640 --> 3:48:25.640]  community for themselves and and doing the best they have and you know they're
[3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:29.640]  just being given the run around and they're really that area there's really
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:33.000]  nothing going on there there's no they're not building other than there was
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:36.200]  some construction on the back part but it used to be the city dump back in the
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:41.160]  20s and 30s so the issue is the issue is it's gonna get worse and worse now
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:44.400]  they've announced FEMA camps for the homeless where you'll basically be
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:49.040]  prisoners right and you're not allowed to be on the streets so and when you were
[3:48:49.040 --> 3:48:52.040]  in LA you said you talked to folks where there was a shanty town at this park but
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:55.600]  now they came and took them away and then we have the LA Times want to put it
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:49:00.840]  on screen for folks watching you know Google Ontario residents only a tent
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:05.200]  city this is the LA Times you scroll down to the bottom of the first page it's a
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:09.640]  multi-part story it'll talk about how they take their dogs take their children
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:14.760]  take their cars and they're using the cars to get to jobs yeah most people
[3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:18.240]  had apartments or homes lost their job they're trying to build up money and
[3:49:18.240 --> 3:49:21.640]  then they say in here I'm trying to get back on my feet I was a month away from
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:26.000]  being able to get an apartment and now I'm destroyed yeah see so so it's right
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:29.240]  there in the article for anybody that wants to go read it they're kidnapping
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:32.880]  their children they're taking their dogs they're there but the key to all of this
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:36.840]  you said they folks brought this up when you asked them and so I want to go back
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:39.680]  over that now that because this is important they're pointing out the
[3:49:39.680 --> 3:49:43.280]  illegal aliens they cannot have driver's license they cannot have insurance the
[3:49:43.280 --> 3:49:45.960]  police are in the news all the time saying if we arrest and the judges just
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:50.040]  let them go but they know citizens are in the system they'll put up with it and
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:54.760]  so that was a legal alien they wouldn't impound with no insurance that that
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:00.960]  when a bago so talk about that right well they have I imagine that well they
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:04.920]  had let's see who's one thing we didn't we did notice is that there were no
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:09.520]  Hispanics in this I didn't see any Hispanics there's a couple non-whites
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:14.160]  non-blacks they're kind of you know and maybe Pacific Islander Pacific Islander
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:18.200]  type but there was no illegal aliens around and we actually didn't see too
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:22.080]  many in that area at all that's because illegal aliens come from a real third
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:25.640]  world country and Americans in a few years will know how to live they live
[3:50:25.640 --> 3:50:29.480]  in 1015 to a house they don't pay any taxes none of the system and a lot of
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:32.360]  them go and get on welfare so that's why they're driving brand new cars around
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:36.560]  because and then they save enough money to buy houses right so they know what
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:40.880]  they're doing but cattle Americans don't stay there only in the show with this
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:44.320]  and then what they have in part to tomorrow or something at the end of the
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:48.320]  last hour because I want to fully debrief you guys mean we sent reporters

[3:53:10.560 --> 3:53:13.920]  called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:17.760]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and
[3:53:17.760 --> 3:53:20.880]  like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
