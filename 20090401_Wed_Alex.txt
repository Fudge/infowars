[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.670]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:17.014]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:21.076]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.549]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.350]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.491]  It is Wednesday, the first day of April 2009, April Fool's Day.
[00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.491]  This is a serious broadcast.
[00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.792]  We will not be engaging in any April Fool's jokes today.
[00:00:53.792 --> 00:01:02.914]  Everything you hear here will be documented and focused information on the New World Order and what the Global Crime Syndicate is up to and doing.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.082]  And no, this is not an April Fool's joke.
[00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.383]  We actually have the audio clip.
[00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:10.084]  It's coming up later.
[00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.405]  Ann Coulter.
[00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:16.368]  Ann Coulter has endorsed Congressman Ron Paul for 2012.
[00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:21.572]  She says she supports him on, quote, every issue.
[00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:24.113]  Of course, she and others attacked him during the campaign.
[00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:30.658]  See, this is what they were doing back when we could have stopped the New World Order and it could have been done with getting Ron Paul elected.
[00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.557]  I mean, if they were unable to assassinate him.
[00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:41.219]  We could have pulled out of the United Nations, federalized the Federal Reserve, it's not federal.
[00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.139]  We could have reversed all this.
[00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:48.361]  He was right about it all, covering the New World Order just like we were covering it here, going off the globalist-owned documents.
[00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.424]  And now Ann Coulter is endorsing Ron Paul.
[00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:56.227]  Fox News has him on every other day.
[00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:57.848]  CNN has him on constantly.
[00:01:57.848 --> 00:02:05.494]  And they're trying to act like they're with the American people against the bankers when they're owned by the bankers.
[00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:08.176]  Now, Glenn Beck has been doing this longer than Sean Hannity and others.
[00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:09.738]  They're getting your confidence.
[00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:10.939]  They're going to drop the hammer on you.
[00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:13.822]  See, they've lost all credibility.
[00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:28.507]  When all the foreign news announced that world government was being set up, and that world government was taking over, and that world currency was taking over, I've been saying the last five, six months as mainstream media has been admitting all this overseas, I've been saying, how is Sean Hannity?
[00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:30.468]  On show after show, I've said, how is Sean Hannity?
[00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:31.708]  How is Rush Limbaugh?
[00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.289]  How is Michael Savage?
[00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.710]  How are all of these guys going to continue on saying none of this exists?
[00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:52.867]  And then the last three months, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Associated Press, Time Magazine, Newsweek, a bank of the world to set taxes, and carbon taxes will pay to them, and ruling our nation, and quote, cracking our heads, Time Magazine quote in the article, New World Order.
[00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.050]  I kept saying, how are they going to ignore this?
[00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.394]  How that world government is openly emerged?
[00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:05.698]  Like a blue whale jumping out of the Pacific Ocean right by your canoe.
[00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.323]  How are they going to ignore the elephant in the room?
[00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.145]  And they're not going to.
[00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:14.865]  They are not going to.
[00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:17.507]  You cannot ignore open world government.
[00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:19.889]  And where are all our detractors?
[00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.014]  All the New York Times and Washington Post and Vanity Fair articles and Radar Magazine.
[00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:32.419]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of world publications have attacked me as insane.
[00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:48.970]  I've probably been attacked by 30, 40 publications the last month, big ones, saying Jones is crazy, he believes there's a world government and a plan for central banks to take over and set up a world currency.
[00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.611]  I mean, think about the magnitude.
[00:03:50.611 --> 00:04:00.314]  I am still being attacked while the mainstream media with one hand admits all of this, one side of their mouth, and on the other side of their mouth still says it doesn't exist because
[00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:06.611]  While they admit it exists, they want to discredit me because we understand the full plan.
[00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:07.832]  We have reverse engineered it.
[00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:08.953]  We have read their documents.
[00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:09.814]  We have studied them.
[00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:13.698]  It's all I do.
[00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:14.819]  It's all I do.
[00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:19.700]  On any subject, I study, I study, I'm a generalist.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.861]  Do I have all the answers?
[00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:21.061]  No.
[00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:22.722]  But do I understand basic history?
[00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:26.945]  Do I understand human dynamics and psychology and anthropology and sociology?
[00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:27.806]  Yes, I do.
[00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:36.352]  Do I constantly interview experts in every field across the board, constantly upping my game, constantly researching, constantly debating?
[00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:37.112]  Yes.
[00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:39.514]  That's why, as all of this is admitted,
[00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:45.348]  They still intensify their attack at every level from above and below.
[00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.410]  Pressure from below, pressure from above.
[00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.975]  Intensifying their attack on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:51.975 --> 00:05:00.724]  This is being done because they know we have the formula in the InfoWar to defeat them.
[00:05:00.724 --> 00:05:03.327]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.274]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:11.057]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:17.643]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:22.847]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:29.573]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:30.954]  Need something more?
[00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:34.917]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:43.224]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:47.568]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.529]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.731]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.288 --> 00:06:19.773]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.755]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:24.216]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:37.427]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:39.088]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.088 --> 00:06:40.449]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:47.836]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:56.105]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.687]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.687 --> 00:06:58.889]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:09.134]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:14.257]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[00:07:14.257 --> 00:07:15.118]  and Canada.
[00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:21.643]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:25.606]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:07:25.606 --> 00:07:28.047]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:06.024]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:08.306]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:28.289]  The key leaders of the anarchist group in England are openly and publicly, this is even in mainstream news, funded by George Soros, the Ford Foundation, and others.
[00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:31.270]  Just like they funded the Weathermen.
[00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:41.232]  Just like it's now been declassified, what was in the Associated Press last week, that the Simeonese Liberation Army and Patty Hearst, it was all an FBI operation.
[00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:55.275]  Well, obviously, walking in, you know, filming with 35mm, you know, shooting machine guns into the ceiling, and dancing around like movie stars in front of the film camera, and then releasing it to the media.
[00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:58.318]  Of course, we knew it was staged then, i.e.
[00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:01.902]  folks like Tarpley and others that were watching it at the time.
[00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:02.943]  It's just amazing.
[00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:11.004]  And we're watching them right now over in England bash out bank windows and things, they call it storming.
[00:09:11.004 --> 00:09:19.271]  And I noticed, I saw a photo of a cop and I looked at it very carefully and I looked at other photos, it's not blood, it's paint.
[00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:27.498]  They had a cop smear red paint and it's almost pink, evenly on his face.
[00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:34.467]  And then I saw photos of him being interviewed 30 minutes later and it hadn't turned brown.
[00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:35.367]  It hadn't turned black.
[00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.448]  Let me give you a news flash.
[00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:45.053]  The white blood cells super oxify, you know, they pick up all the oxygen and it turns brown.
[00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:52.877]  No, that blood's gonna be bright fire engine red slash pink till the day he washes it off with soap and water.
[00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:56.144]  And that's what intelligence operations are.
[00:09:56.144 --> 00:09:58.727]  You know, at their core, it's theater.
[00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:02.550]  Plastic noses, fake eyebrows, mustaches.
[00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.691]  It's disgusting.
[00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:11.136]  You see, they run into problems attacking police for real in Seattle, because the cops got mad and told the news.
[00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:17.321]  We learned these guys were working for the Feds, and we were told to stand down, and we got hit in the head with bottles and got our teeth knocked out.
[00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:20.844]  Or, you have a group of cops dressed up in Denver last year.
[00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:23.327]  This is Denver Post, Associated Press, Reuters.
[00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:25.188]  It's in the Obama Deception, mainstream news.
[00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:28.111]  It's actually in the Denver Extra.
[00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:39.068]  And the police went in and attacked other cops, throwing bottles, throwing rocks at about 20 feet away, then ran up their line and beat them.
[00:10:39.068 --> 00:10:42.330]  And the cops got mad about it, and that's how it came out.
[00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.072]  Well, in England, they don't do it that way.
[00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:53.559]  It's like professional wrestling, where they just lean down, got the little thing of red makeup, and, oh, smear a little bit, or maybe even get a razor blade and cut yourself.
[00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.260]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:10:57.597 --> 00:11:05.283]  And the anarchists have signs, we've got video and photos of it saying, one world government, one world currency is what we want.
[00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:10.566]  Funny, that's exactly what the bankers inside want.
[00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:16.771]  And so now there's no discussion of how they've stolen 12 plus trillion dollars.
[00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:21.895]  You know, to show how we're conservative.
[00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:24.416]  We're going to Steve Watson in London for an update report.
[00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.498]  He's been covering it all day, he's right in the middle of it.
[00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:39.495]  Webster Tarpley was in here Monday, a day and a half ago, and he said ten to twelve trillion dollars in the bailout.
[00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:42.296]  He said it's probably up to twelve, but we have to be conservative.
[00:11:42.296 --> 00:11:45.138]  I have Bloomberg today.
[00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.539]  Guess how much it is.
[00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:50.861]  Bloomberg today.
[00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:51.141]  Guess.
[00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:54.843]  I want to give the exact number here.
[00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:58.865]  I have it in a stack of stuff, as they say.
[00:11:58.865 --> 00:11:59.285]  Where is it?
[00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:04.884]  Okay, $12.8 trillion.
[00:12:04.884 --> 00:12:10.187]  Financial rescue nears GDP as pledges top $12.8 trillion.
[00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:12.648]  So it's, uh, we were saying $10 trillion?
[00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:13.949]  I'm sorry.
[00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:17.991]  It's $2.8 trillion worse than we said.
[00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:25.335]  $2.8 trillion.
[00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:27.396]  And we always get this number a month late.
[00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:29.177]  This is numbers from early February.
[00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:31.941]  Excuse me, late February.
[00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:35.303]  We're already into April.
[00:12:35.303 --> 00:12:36.483]  Oh, time is flying.
[00:12:36.483 --> 00:12:39.224]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Steve Watson and then I got all this news.
[00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:46.067]  It's just, it's amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:59.033]  The Toronto Star, the National Post, they all reported, the Royal Mounted Police admitted last year, they dressed up like anarchists and attacked other police.
[00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:00.826]  And that was staged.
[00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:02.887]  The police didn't grab them, arrest them.
[00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:04.447]  Everybody noticed they had the same boots on.
[00:13:04.447 --> 00:13:05.587]  They were big guys.
[00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:07.308]  The same boots as the police.
[00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:09.368]  Same logo.
[00:13:09.368 --> 00:13:12.429]  Little yellow symbol on the heel.
[00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:19.631]  And so then the photographers got around to the protest line and noticed they took them back behind and released them and let them go.
[00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:22.851]  And the Royal Mounted Police had to admit, yeah, we staged that.
[00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:29.493]  That was a false flag terrorist attack ordered from the highest levels of government.
[00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:34.794]  That's what a terror attack is, a terror attack on free speech.
[00:13:34.794 --> 00:13:36.655]  A terror attack on the right of assembly.
[00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:38.775]  They constantly do it.
[00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:48.399]  I have been in the middle of the Austin Police Department trying it when the Fortune 500 was here ten years ago.
[00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.180]  One has to see it to believe it.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.881]  I have experienced it.
[00:13:54.093 --> 00:13:55.094]  Come on, let's riot!
[00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:55.875]  Let's do something!
[00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:57.036]  Oh, start shoving on people!
[00:13:57.036 --> 00:14:11.433]  It's two giant, 6'5", 6'6", guys in ski masks, and a real anarchist weighs about 110 pounds, has zits all over them, they're on methamphetamine, and they're always led by, you know, foundation handlers.
[00:14:12.543 --> 00:14:17.706]  Who are wearing the garb, but they're always openly Marxist, and they'll say, get back Jones, we'll soon kill you.
[00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:18.547]  That happened in Austin.
[00:14:18.547 --> 00:14:19.307]  I was like, these are cops.
[00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:24.851]  He's like, that's right, they work with us, and we're taking America over, and one thing we do, you're dead!
[00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:28.913]  He thought he intimidated me, some little pot-bellied, red-bearded commie.
[00:14:28.913 --> 00:14:33.016]  And I said, well go ahead and take your best shot, commie.
[00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:35.628]  So let me explain how this works.
[00:14:35.628 --> 00:14:42.393]  The bankers, the police, and the dirtbag anarchists, they work for the government, period.
[00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:43.194]  Period.
[00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:55.023]  They got some meth head, drug addict coke head on LSD, you know, trust fund kids that hate their mommy and their daddy, and hate mommy and daddy's BMW, and hate the mansion they grew up in?
[00:14:55.023 --> 00:14:55.564]  Absolutely.
[00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:57.645]  Do they have stupid idiots being used?
[00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:58.506]  Absolutely.
[00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:00.548]  But the commanders of this are the government.
[00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:02.549]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:15:02.549 --> 00:15:06.771]  We'll get a ten minute report this segment and the next from Steve Watson from London.
[00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.312]  Writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:12.374]  He head honchos InfoWars.net, which by the way I think is one of our best looking sites.
[00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:14.055]  It has some of the most important news.
[00:15:14.055 --> 00:15:15.475]  I don't promote that thing enough.
[00:15:15.475 --> 00:15:16.536]  InfoWars.net.
[00:15:16.536 --> 00:15:19.257]  You see exclusives there at InfoWars.net.
[00:15:19.257 --> 00:15:25.660]  Steve, you've been watching all the news, watching the TV, out in the streets watching what's happening as this goes on.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.861]  What is really happening over there in England?
[00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:30.022]  Hey Alex, it's good to be back.
[00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:32.787]  Uh, yeah, I've been watching it all day.
[00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:35.609]  Um, happening a few miles from where I am.
[00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:40.512]  I've been observing what's going on on various news networks over here.
[00:15:40.512 --> 00:15:52.659]  And, uh, what we're getting over here is over and over images of the same small group of people, uh, provocateur-ing the police.
[00:15:52.659 --> 00:16:00.103]  Um, as you mentioned, there's particularly one person who seems to be at the very front of this with, uh,
[00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:07.775]  What looked like cuts to his head and, um, blood on his face, but as you said, it kind of looked fake.
[00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:18.780]  And then he had sort of bandages draped around his head and he was constantly shouting at the police, pushing them, trying to goad them to react.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.682]  Uh, I mean, to their credit, the police didn't react to him.
[00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:26.784]  One, one police officer got hit with a projectile.
[00:16:26.784 --> 00:16:29.866]  They still didn't react, but there seemed to be a small group of
[00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:39.190]  Sort of 12 to 20 provocateurs at the front really trying to get the police to react.
[00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:47.936]  If this all took place, the most significant area of the protest was outside the Bank of England in the financial district.
[00:16:47.936 --> 00:16:55.282]  And also what happened there was there's a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland situated there.
[00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:58.805]  For some reason, all the other banks and shops in the area had
[00:16:59.864 --> 00:17:07.867]  The Royal Bank of Scotland is one of the banks in this country that was bailed out, so it's come under a great deal of criticism from all
[00:17:27.011 --> 00:17:29.492]  You know, from all angles over the past few weeks.
[00:17:29.492 --> 00:17:37.614]  Last week, the CEO, his home, his personal home was attacked by anarchists.
[00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:45.696]  So it was a known target for these people and they went down there and they basically smashed a few windows up, got inside.
[00:17:45.696 --> 00:17:54.018]  There were reports that they were smashing up equipment inside, stealing hard drives from the computers.
[00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:55.017]  We're
[00:18:11.502 --> 00:18:12.142]  That's surprising.
[00:18:12.142 --> 00:18:21.167]  Well now Gordon Brown will come out and say, this has been a devastating attack, we must ban all free speech now and allow this to hold people for hundreds of days without charges.
[00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:25.149]  These rabble have stormed the bank.
[00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:27.770]  Yeah, this went on for about ten minutes.
[00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.571]  People coming in and out of the building.
[00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:33.733]  There was quite a large contingent of police there.
[00:18:33.733 --> 00:18:40.216]  The coverage was, at the moment this started happening, it cut to a very sort of
[00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:45.632]  Low tech, internet stream camera.
[00:18:45.632 --> 00:18:49.094]  And you couldn't really make out what was going on.
[00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:55.458]  But you could make out that the windows were being smashed and there was a lot of police there but they weren't really doing anything to stop it.
[00:18:55.458 --> 00:19:03.483]  Well all those closer cameras are going to come out and those guys were a little big for anarchists and I was looking at their bearing on the video.
[00:19:03.483 --> 00:19:08.767]  They're either, I bet my bottom dollar some of them are going to turn out being army intelligence or police.
[00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:18.994]  Yeah, and it's got to be stressed that the majority of people there were there peacefully and they were, you know, they weren't advocating these actions.
[00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:24.817]  It was only these few that had got to the front of this that were carrying it out.
[00:19:24.817 --> 00:19:31.841]  And also, at that point, the police cordoned off the entire area.
[00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:36.583]  They created lines and they were not letting, you know, legitimate protesters leave.
[00:19:38.363 --> 00:19:41.706]  These protesters are saying, we want to leave now, please.
[00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:50.173]  And the police are just sort of penning them in and not allowing them to spread out.
[00:19:50.173 --> 00:19:51.835]  All right, stay there.
[00:19:51.835 --> 00:19:58.080]  One more segment with Steve Watson from London, ahead of the big G20 starting off, well, kicking off today.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.802]  Obama kneeling before the Queen.
[00:20:01.687 --> 00:20:07.191]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:10.212]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:20:10.212 --> 00:20:15.616]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:20:16.417 --> 00:20:20.080]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.362]  We have been warned.
[00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:27.647]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:20:27.647 --> 00:20:28.388]  Too late.
[00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:31.591]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:32.031]  Why?
[00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:35.795]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:44.052]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:52.920]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.600]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.521]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:56.783]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:21:04.218 --> 00:21:06.842]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.842 --> 00:21:13.873]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.412 --> 00:21:20.995]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.995 --> 00:21:22.975]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.975 --> 00:21:25.476]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.476 --> 00:21:37.061]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.721]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:40.082]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.569 --> 00:21:47.474]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:57.322]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.322 --> 00:22:00.424]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:06.629]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:15.219]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:20.808]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:22:21.112 --> 00:22:23.372]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:23.372 --> 00:22:28.453]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:33.674]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.674 --> 00:22:38.015]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.015 --> 00:22:39.115]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.115 --> 00:22:43.616]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.616 --> 00:22:45.016]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.502 --> 00:22:51.507]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.507 --> 00:22:53.289]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:53.510]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.194 --> 00:23:01.335]  Spring is here.
[00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:02.276]  Growing season.
[00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:04.478]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:23:04.478 --> 00:23:06.199]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:07.180]  Think about it.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.264]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:15.007]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:23:15.007 --> 00:23:16.909]  The country is running out of food.
[00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:19.431]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:31.945]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:34.548]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[00:23:34.568 --> 00:23:34.988]  I think so.
[00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:17.211]  On another note, Steve, what do you think about...
[00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:36.317]  Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, all the Fox hosts, I mean literally, I listen to Fox TV on the radio, on XM, and they're all saying the conspiracy people are right, the New World Order's real, global government's real, global government ruled by banks is real, and now CNN's even started to talk about it.
[00:24:36.317 --> 00:24:38.938]  What do you think's behind that?
[00:24:38.938 --> 00:24:47.602]  Well, I mean everybody knows that Fox News is universally derided, so, you know, for them to suddenly jump
[00:24:48.624 --> 00:25:06.569]  On the same issue that we do is, you know, to the average viewer it's going to look like, you know, we're saying what Fox News is saying and instantly that's going to discredit everything we've been saying that we've been saying for, you know, a full decade before they've chosen to cover it.
[00:25:08.047 --> 00:25:10.027]  I agree.
[00:25:10.027 --> 00:25:15.688]  Right now, the meeting between Obama and the Queen, newspapers reporting that he's been practicing the etiquette.
[00:25:15.688 --> 00:25:17.429]  We're going to videotape it.
[00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:18.349]  This is disgusting.
[00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:20.009]  Your take on that?
[00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:26.730]  Yeah, I'm just watching the pictures now of Obama arriving at Buckingham Palace.
[00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.291]  I mean, have you seen the report today about what he said about how he loved the Queen?
[00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:32.931]  Yes.
[00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:35.892]  He said, I'll quote, he said,
[00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:40.686]  Quote, there's one thing I should mention that I love about Great Britain.
[00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:41.586]  That is the Queen.
[00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:43.026]  Ugh.
[00:25:43.026 --> 00:25:47.367]  I'm very much looking forward to meeting her for the first time later this evening.
[00:25:47.367 --> 00:25:51.708]  As you might imagine, Michelle has been really thinking that through.
[00:25:51.708 --> 00:26:03.030]  Because I think, in the imagination of people throughout America, what the Queen stands for, her decency and her civility, what she represents, that's very important.
[00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.630]  So there you've got your President
[00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:08.910]  Pledging allegiance to the Queen, saying that he loves her.
[00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.272]  And she stands for decency and civility.
[00:26:12.272 --> 00:26:14.194]  Which is quite incredible, really.
[00:26:14.194 --> 00:26:33.449]  And, you know, it's rather disgustingly ironic, because you've got the first black president and his wife saying that the monarchy of England, one of the most xenophobic, prejudiced, racist institutions, um,
[00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:37.313]  Rooted in segregationism.
[00:26:37.313 --> 00:26:41.716]  You've got your president there saying that they stand for decency and civility.
[00:26:41.716 --> 00:26:49.462]  You know, you've got the Queen Mother, quite famously, was said to be virulently a racist.
[00:26:49.462 --> 00:27:02.331]  You've got the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, we know all about him, travels all around the world describing people as savages and other races as spear throwers and that kind of thing.
[00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:02.471]  So,
[00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:08.317]  The whole thing is just... to have to watch that is fairly disgusting in my opinion.
[00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:19.906]  But for those that don't know, he on national television repeatedly will be in a building.
[00:27:19.906 --> 00:27:23.809]  He's obsessive, compulsive, and if one lightbulb is burnt out, he freaks out.
[00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:26.390]  And he said on the news, it must be a black.
[00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.171]  They must have a black in here.
[00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:32.854]  Only blacks would not have a lightbulb burnt out.
[00:27:32.854 --> 00:27:35.816]  And the Queen will not meet with Africans in Africa.
[00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:37.357]  So remember, what was it, five, six years ago?
[00:27:37.357 --> 00:27:38.938]  It was in BBC.
[00:27:38.938 --> 00:27:40.259]  BBC reported on itself.
[00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:42.221]  They had a fake movie set
[00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:56.432]  Claiming she was in a Central African country meeting with Africans, but it was really the stars of an African soap opera staging a meeting with villagers on a soundstage.
[00:27:56.432 --> 00:28:11.320]  Yeah, I mean, clearly his elitism, his prejudice, his racism is so entrenched that he cannot even, he can't even repress it for, you know, in front of the media for a few minutes.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:11.740]  That's how
[00:28:12.728 --> 00:28:15.669]  That's how deeply entrenched it is with them.
[00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:28.314]  So to see the so-called saviour of the progressive president, the first black president, having to meet with these people is just insane.
[00:28:28.971 --> 00:28:33.133]  Well, this is the first time a sitting president has gone to a summons.
[00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:37.936]  She summoned him to a, uh, audience.
[00:28:37.936 --> 00:28:40.998]  And then, and then they admit he's been practicing his etiquette.
[00:28:40.998 --> 00:28:43.519]  Uh, are they showing that you're watching the news right now?
[00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:47.381]  Are they showing him curtsy to her or, or is there?
[00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:50.022]  They haven't shown the queen meeting the queen yet.
[00:28:50.022 --> 00:28:58.407]  I don't, I don't know if they'll show that they've shown pictures inside Buckingham palace of him sort of pulling up in his, you know,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.602]  Well, you know, he took his oath of office in secret, so...
[00:29:22.702 --> 00:29:23.843]  Who knows what he'll do.
[00:29:23.843 --> 00:29:30.166]  Maybe it'll be a secret meeting, but I'm... I am watching CNN and it just showed the Queen awaiting him.
[00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.106]  Ah, the Queen!
[00:29:31.106 --> 00:29:32.487]  The Queen!
[00:29:32.487 --> 00:29:35.209]  A Queen, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:29:35.209 --> 00:29:36.669]  She owns half of Canada.
[00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:40.371]  Suspended its Parliament, basically, when they didn't follow her orders in Canada.
[00:29:40.371 --> 00:29:42.272]  Most of Australia.
[00:29:42.272 --> 00:29:44.353]  She funds giant eugenics programs.
[00:29:44.353 --> 00:29:45.874]  It's just amazing.
[00:29:45.874 --> 00:29:46.975]  Steve Watson, anything else?
[00:29:48.516 --> 00:29:50.016]  No, I've got it next minute.
[00:29:50.016 --> 00:29:51.217]  Thank you, Steve.
[00:29:51.217 --> 00:29:52.597]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.597 --> 00:29:55.138]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.138 --> 00:30:00.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.880]  You worry.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.961]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:30:03.961 --> 00:30:06.601]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:30:06.601 --> 00:30:08.382]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:30:12.005 --> 00:30:12.665]  We're good to go!
[00:30:39.815 --> 00:30:44.636]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.

[00:30:57.879 --> 00:31:01.240]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.481]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:13.155]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:19.659]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:21.641]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:24.083]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:34.991]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.265 --> 00:31:38.946]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:40.786]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.786 --> 00:31:47.709]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:55.972 --> 00:31:57.532]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.532 --> 00:31:58.733]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:11.217]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:32:11.217 --> 00:32:12.639]  Garden in a can!

[00:32:33.858 --> 00:32:34.578]  Fresh.
[00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:35.439]  Healthy.

[00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:18.271]  Yeah, during the breaks, we were watching CNN and Fox on two different TV sets and it's just worshipping the Queen.
[00:33:18.271 --> 00:33:20.693]  Oh my gosh, the greatest day of Obama's life.
[00:33:20.693 --> 00:33:21.914]  Will he handle it?
[00:33:21.914 --> 00:33:24.535]  Coming before the grace, the power.
[00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:28.198]  And they cut to the guy on CNN, that guy with the corny voice.
[00:33:28.198 --> 00:33:32.061]  Let me tell you what's on the menu, the dark lemon soup.
[00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:34.963]  So we're going to be talking about it up there in Dixis, but out there monitoring it.
[00:33:35.623 --> 00:33:39.504]  Then I'm going to get into all this news and tell you about the guests that are coming up today.
[00:33:39.504 --> 00:33:43.786]  Prime Minister, the newly sworn in, officially the new Prime Minister for the second time.
[00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.746]  That's Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:49.887]  Jerusalem Post headline, we may be forced to attack Iran.
[00:33:49.887 --> 00:33:51.908]  Yes, and kick off World War III.
[00:33:51.908 --> 00:33:53.869]  You like the depression so far?
[00:33:53.869 --> 00:33:56.269]  Well, get ready for even more if they do that.
[00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.930]  Also, U.S.
[00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:58.650]  private sector access 742,000 jobs in March.
[00:34:02.065 --> 00:34:17.624]  It was 600-and-something thousand in February, and 500-and-something thousand in January, and 500-and-something thousand in December, and 400-and-something thousand in November, and 400-and-something thousand in the month before that.
[00:34:17.624 --> 00:34:20.948]  I mean, we're talking millions and millions of jobs being lost here.
[00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.410]  Job losses in the U.S.
[00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:29.892]  private sector accelerated in March, more than economists' expectations, according to a report by ADP Employer Services on Wednesday.
[00:34:29.892 --> 00:34:31.493]  So we'll go over that.
[00:34:31.493 --> 00:34:37.095]  Also, political environment, Madoff Industries.
[00:34:37.095 --> 00:34:39.015]  We're going to talk about what's happening with Madoff.
[00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:41.676]  Financial rescue nears GDP.
[00:34:41.676 --> 00:34:43.377]  That's gross domestic product.
[00:34:43.377 --> 00:34:44.457]  Pledges top $12.8 trillion.
[00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.038]  The GDP is 13 trill.
[00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:54.335]  So in five and a half months, they have...
[00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:58.553]  Well, they're preparing to eclipse.
[00:34:58.553 --> 00:35:08.620]  They are preparing to, in less than six months, more than the entire GDP, everything that goes on in the country, in an entire year.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.261]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:21.868]  They're on line right now, in a year since the banker takeover October 3rd, to have double the GDP, $26 trillion, if this continues.
[00:35:21.868 --> 00:35:23.930]  And it only appears to be accelerating.
[00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.511]  $26 trillion for the bankers!
[00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:31.478]  But then they call that socialism.
[00:35:31.478 --> 00:35:32.480]  That's not socialism.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.282]  That's robbery.
[00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:36.865]  So we'll go over that report also.
[00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:43.446]  We've got a bunch of news articles about how we must reduce world population.
[00:35:43.446 --> 00:35:44.486]  That is coming up.
[00:35:44.486 --> 00:35:47.867]  World Bank President admits agenda for global government.
[00:35:47.867 --> 00:35:53.869]  Bilderberg elitist Zolik calls for IMF, World Trade Organization and World Bank to regulate national policy.
[00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:57.190]  That's Paul Joseph Watson linking to mainstream news in Europe.
[00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:03.431]  Openly, they're openly announcing world government right now.
[00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:04.972]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:07.912]  In just a few moments.
[00:36:07.912 --> 00:36:12.254]  But Aaron, during the break you were literally ranting how disgusting it was.
[00:36:12.254 --> 00:36:13.514]  Repeat that for the listeners.
[00:36:13.514 --> 00:36:15.115]  Oh, it's absolutely disgusting.
[00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:18.896]  They're gearing up for Obama to meet with the Queen.
[00:36:18.896 --> 00:36:19.776]  I think he's inside.
[00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:21.057]  They don't even have shots of that.
[00:36:21.057 --> 00:36:25.338]  But the CNN anchor himself is literally saying, oh, I'm so nervous.
[00:36:25.338 --> 00:36:27.399]  I just hope this all goes well.
[00:36:27.399 --> 00:36:31.481]  I'm nervous about the bowing and the prostrating before the Queen.
[00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:35.542]  And the, you know, the caricature guy from CNN Britain's like, oh,
[00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:38.242]  Don't worry, it's going to go perfectly.
[00:36:38.242 --> 00:36:41.463]  He's ahead of state, he doesn't have to bow before her.
[00:36:41.463 --> 00:36:43.103]  There's no kneeling or anything.
[00:36:43.103 --> 00:36:49.804]  It'll go smoothly and they'll be armed with a duck soup with a brazen sauce of plum.
[00:36:49.804 --> 00:36:50.285]  It's crazy.
[00:36:50.285 --> 00:36:55.085]  But you said he did, so he just needs to nod his head and then she will extend her hand.
[00:36:55.085 --> 00:36:57.766]  You do not extend your hand first and then you shake it.
[00:36:57.766 --> 00:36:59.886]  You have to do it with proper deference.
[00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:03.687]  But you're not supposed to touch the Queen unless she reaches out to touch you first.
[00:37:03.687 --> 00:37:04.587]  That's the way it works.
[00:37:04.727 --> 00:37:15.012]  This disgusting, hereditary Nazi blob, whose husband was an open Nazi, and they brought their cousin Bernhardt over from the Netherlands during World War II, was an SS officer.
[00:37:15.012 --> 00:37:21.354]  These people write the Royal Commission on Population saying exterminate blacks, Latin Americans, and Asians.
[00:37:21.354 --> 00:37:23.295]  They openly fund eugenics.
[00:37:23.295 --> 00:37:26.077]  He openly says kill 80% of the world population.
[00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:30.999]  Prince Philip's son, Prince Charles, is running around saying get rid of the third world.
[00:37:31.539 --> 00:37:38.082]  And meanwhile the third world erects statues to him, like in Brazil, where he's a god-like angel over the earth.
[00:37:38.082 --> 00:37:40.784]  Him standing on the earth as God.
[00:37:40.784 --> 00:37:44.185]  Oh yes, kill us and inject us with the vaccines.
[00:37:44.185 --> 00:37:51.389]  Yeah, but here CNN is conditioning Americans to revel before the Queen to treat her as some untouchable God creature.
[00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:57.660]  When she is a disgusting, disgusting, wicked blob.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.220]  I mean, hereditary scum.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.801]  And people say, oh, she doesn't have any power.
[00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:18.386]  You know, the three big tabloid TV production studios in England that make the money off the inside videos of their palaces and what they do for the anglophobes out there.
[00:38:18.386 --> 00:38:20.227]  It's disgusting to us.
[00:38:20.227 --> 00:38:21.127]  We're so sick of the
[00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:35.069]  British royalty, but for the Anglophiles, the worshippers, you're a Frenchphile if you worship the French, you're an Anglophile if you worship the British.
[00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:43.977]  This British worship is all over America from our media the last hundred years, and most old women have teacups with the Queen, and they sit around and love the Queen, and there's all these
[00:38:44.657 --> 00:38:56.328]  A&E shows and Discovery and History Channel shows and made-for-TV movies and big film productions about how great the Queen is, how she loves everybody, when she is a wicked piece of trash.
[00:38:56.328 --> 00:39:01.112]  And then meanwhile, last year, they're going to remove Harper because he's doing a bunch of New World Order stuff.
[00:39:01.112 --> 00:39:02.433]  The Parliament votes to remove him.
[00:39:02.433 --> 00:39:03.714]  That's how a parliamentary system works.
[00:39:04.735 --> 00:39:05.916]  But Alex, that's just on paper.
[00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:06.497]  It doesn't mean anything.
[00:39:06.497 --> 00:39:08.018]  You don't have to bow before the Queen.
[00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:08.299]  That's right.
[00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:09.520]  She just owns most of the world.
[00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:21.692]  Yeah.
[00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.312]  And it's just sick.
[00:39:22.312 --> 00:39:26.996]  They roll this British caricature guy out every single time to play up the pomp and circumstance.
[00:39:26.996 --> 00:39:30.758]  Well, they also, uh, you know, they understand these archetypal images.
[00:39:30.758 --> 00:39:34.661]  That's why a hundred and something years ago, the British were getting sick of them, knowing that they weren't even British.
[00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:35.782]  They were German.
[00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:37.624]  The Saxe-Coburg-Gothas.
[00:39:37.624 --> 00:39:41.787]  And so, uh, they've been in control since the 1740s, when the British line died out.
[00:39:41.787 --> 00:39:43.648]  They brought the German cousins in.
[00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:45.129]  And so they changed it to Windsor.
[00:39:45.129 --> 00:39:49.813]  I mean, the average, they've done polls, the average Brit doesn't even know the real name of these dirtbags.
[00:39:50.413 --> 00:39:53.654]  I mean, these are dirtbag scum.
[00:39:53.654 --> 00:39:55.615]  I mean, this is the head of the New World Order.
[00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:57.236]  These are the eugenicists.
[00:39:57.236 --> 00:40:00.878]  These are the people bankrupting our economy and bringing in world government.
[00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:10.882]  And we have everybody stooping and bowing when this country was founded on disgust for royalty, disgust for these people who had everything handed to them, and everyone kissing their butt.
[00:40:10.882 --> 00:40:12.123]  And you know, I'll tell the story right now.
[00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:16.608]  If you don't believe me, get a pen and paper out.
[00:40:16.608 --> 00:40:25.802]  I'm going to tell this right now not to be gross or not to be silly or not to be Python-esque or not to be, you know, Saturday Night Live.
[00:40:25.802 --> 00:40:27.224]  This is real.
[00:40:28.956 --> 00:40:29.637]  This is real.
[00:40:29.637 --> 00:40:33.019]  In fact, they even made a joke about it.
[00:40:33.019 --> 00:40:40.425]  They had that thing called Mr. Show on HBO about eight years ago, where they're treating a guy as royalty and they're wiping his hind end for him in the restaurant.
[00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.546]  He doesn't have to leave the table.
[00:40:42.546 --> 00:40:44.368]  We ought to pull that skit up online or something.
[00:40:44.368 --> 00:40:48.250]  But the point is, and we've done deep research on this,
[00:40:49.522 --> 00:40:52.505]  They still have their butts wiped for them.
[00:40:52.505 --> 00:40:56.670]  Now, if you don't believe me, you Google, Groom of the Stool.
[00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.851]  You cannot make this up.
[00:40:57.851 --> 00:41:03.897]  You will be reading mainstream university websites, mainstream news articles.
[00:41:03.897 --> 00:41:07.741]  It's called the Groom of the Stool.
[00:41:07.741 --> 00:41:11.725]  And a British Lord follows the Queen or King, depending on what it is around,
[00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:17.611]  Follows them around, and they sit up in this big cabinet, and they have to fly it around with her.
[00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:19.452]  This has been on the news, this is why they fly it around.
[00:41:19.452 --> 00:41:28.961]  They claim they stopped it in 1906, but deeper research shows they're just very quiet about it, and millions of pounds are spent a year to move this portable toilet around, because it's got to be big enough.
[00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:32.103]  She goes up on a throne and craps.
[00:41:32.103 --> 00:41:33.665]  I'm sorry, this is real, folks.
[00:41:33.665 --> 00:41:35.646]  I'm not... Groom with a stool, Google it.
[00:41:35.646 --> 00:41:38.169]  And they wipe her fat butt.
[00:41:39.193 --> 00:41:40.194]  Aaron Dykes.
[00:41:40.194 --> 00:41:42.495]  And that's not some lowly chimney sweep either.
[00:41:42.495 --> 00:41:46.818]  That's, in the British hierarchy, that's a lordly high up position, right?
[00:41:46.818 --> 00:41:49.360]  It has to be one of the top lords.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.642]  This is the most coveted position.
[00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.003]  See, it's all about worshipping.
[00:41:53.003 --> 00:41:59.807]  And then, I don't want to get into more detail, but then they pick with their bare hands, with respect, and examine it, and then every stool
[00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:06.675]  And every jar of urine that's not put into water, that would defile it, is stored.
[00:42:06.675 --> 00:42:11.541]  And all of the royalty stool going back over 500 years is stored.
[00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:18.429]  Now this came from France, and in French, it's just the French version of Groom of the Stool.
[00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:19.611]  What's the term in French?
[00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:22.993]  I think it's like Grom of the Stool.
[00:42:22.993 --> 00:42:25.074]  It's a slight translation, I don't know.
[00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:35.538]  Yeah, so this disgusting bucket of pus, this maggot-ridden Nazi piece of filth gets up there every day and people wipe her disgusting hind in.
[00:42:35.538 --> 00:42:37.900]  I mean, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:44.362]  And they're funding abortion worldwide, they're funding eugenics worldwide, they are just the enemy of all free humanity.
[00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:44.903]  And they have these
[00:42:47.217 --> 00:42:54.383]  Little parentages they hand out where millions of people in England have their homes, everything paid for by her.
[00:42:54.383 --> 00:42:56.065]  I mean, you think they have palaces?
[00:42:56.065 --> 00:42:59.188]  They have palaces that are hundreds of square miles in some cases.
[00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:03.692]  They have palaces that are whole cities with armored compounds behind them.
[00:43:03.692 --> 00:43:06.194]  And it's just amazing.
[00:43:06.194 --> 00:43:07.655]  I mean, this is filth.
[00:43:07.655 --> 00:43:08.936]  This is the New World Order.
[00:43:11.425 --> 00:43:16.970]  It's very strange to me, but our own presidents have their stool guarded by national security forces.
[00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.530]  That's right.
[00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:18.631]  We did a deeper study.
[00:43:18.631 --> 00:43:21.134]  George Bush, he reincorporated Grim in the stool.
[00:43:21.134 --> 00:43:26.118]  Because it can also be used to examine medical weaknesses.
[00:43:26.118 --> 00:43:27.339]  He has a special toilet.
[00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:29.681]  Don't believe me, just type president has portable toilet.
[00:43:30.502 --> 00:43:33.343]  And he's got to have it carted around.
[00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:37.504]  In fact, when he's at big global summits, they have to cart it around behind him.
[00:43:37.504 --> 00:43:39.305]  State secrets of the stool.
[00:43:39.305 --> 00:43:40.825]  Well, it's all about worshipping them.
[00:43:40.825 --> 00:43:43.186]  Just, oh, even, you know.
[00:43:43.186 --> 00:43:43.586]  You know what?
[00:43:43.586 --> 00:43:47.107]  I think some listeners probably don't believe us.
[00:43:47.107 --> 00:43:48.527]  I've looked it up, too, as you know.
[00:43:48.527 --> 00:43:49.628]  Grim of the stool.
[00:43:49.628 --> 00:43:52.649]  Remember when I first told you a few months ago and you guys didn't believe it and you Googled it?
[00:43:52.649 --> 00:43:53.349]  It's strange, yeah.
[00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.991]  And then I told you Bush had one, you didn't believe it?
[00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:58.512]  And then it was Associated Press?
[00:43:58.512 --> 00:43:59.672]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:59.672 --> 00:44:02.093]  It goes back to Edward VIII, right?
[00:44:02.093 --> 00:44:02.634]  Yeah.
[00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:03.934]  Yeah.
[00:44:03.934 --> 00:44:06.175]  And he had a pus sucker also, right?
[00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:08.096]  No, no, no, that's Henry VIII you're thinking of.
[00:44:08.096 --> 00:44:08.856]  Pardon me.
[00:44:08.856 --> 00:44:18.581]  Edward VIII was the, uh... Anyways, the point is, is, yes, they had, uh... Well, their pus was so holy, it came out of their festering wounds, it had to be sucked.
[00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:30.958]  Oh, there they are, there's the demonic, there is the top Nazi in the world, the Queen, with the second Nazi, Prince Philip, who just literally raves and hates blacks.
[00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:36.823]  And there they are, talking to this filth.
[00:44:36.823 --> 00:44:38.745]  Oh my God, this is too disgusting.
[00:44:38.745 --> 00:44:41.147]  Fade up the disgusting audio for me.
[00:44:41.147 --> 00:44:43.829]  Fade it up immediately.
[00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:46.671]  We don't have that piped in?
[00:44:46.671 --> 00:44:47.011]  Here it is.
[00:44:49.744 --> 00:44:52.826]  Photos are being taken of this demonic filth.
[00:44:52.826 --> 00:44:53.466]  That was okay.
[00:44:53.466 --> 00:44:56.548]  I don't know if I like the duke telling the president, hey, turn around, buddy, turn around.
[00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:57.648]  Yeah, yeah, like that.
[00:44:57.648 --> 00:44:59.369]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:59.369 --> 00:44:59.970]  Honestly.
[00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:03.809]  That bothered me a little bit there, but it was okay, wasn't it?
[00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:04.450]  Exactly!
[00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.011]  He was like, I was about to say it!
[00:45:06.011 --> 00:45:07.752]  Shoo, little black man!
[00:45:07.752 --> 00:45:08.552]  Shoo!
[00:45:08.552 --> 00:45:10.653]  Groom my stool!
[00:45:10.653 --> 00:45:14.175]  Groom it all, yes!
[00:45:14.175 --> 00:45:15.596]  Wipe five times!
[00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:23.005]  I can, I can, uh, sigh of relief there.
[00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:23.826]  Uh, we've been talking.
[00:45:23.826 --> 00:45:24.946]  Grooming!
[00:45:24.946 --> 00:45:25.967]  Grooming!
[00:45:25.967 --> 00:45:34.674]  I just, I just want them to be comfortable and the whole thing to go well and, and the American president and Michelle is looking terrific and I just, alright, so that's behind us.
[00:45:34.674 --> 00:45:36.335]  Let us talk about the start of this.
[00:45:36.335 --> 00:45:37.036]  See, no, stop, stop.
[00:45:37.036 --> 00:45:38.157]  We've been watching all morning.
[00:45:38.157 --> 00:45:39.558]  He's the first guy to not grovel.
[00:45:39.558 --> 00:45:40.198]  You know why?
[00:45:40.198 --> 00:45:41.359]  He's black.
[00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.760]  And he saw what that was.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.462]  I mean, that was like Slave Masters.
[00:45:44.462 --> 00:45:46.203]  Well, this was the guy groveling before.
[00:45:46.463 --> 00:45:51.552]  Exactly, the body, well he was just groveling, the body language was... You wretched knave!
[00:45:51.552 --> 00:45:54.877]  He literally starts bossing him, turn around filth!
[00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.740]  Oh god, you piece of trash!
[00:45:59.827 --> 00:46:03.631]  The CNN guy has completely invested himself in the Obama visit with the Queen.
[00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:08.295]  He's been fretting about it for a minute.
[00:46:08.295 --> 00:46:09.276]  Well, how's it gonna go?
[00:46:09.276 --> 00:46:10.317]  I hope it goes well.
[00:46:10.317 --> 00:46:11.598]  I hope it doesn't shake wrong.
[00:46:11.598 --> 00:46:14.000]  Will he groom it correctly?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.262]  He gets to handle it!
[00:46:15.262 --> 00:46:17.624]  Obama gets to handle the poop!
[00:46:19.995 --> 00:46:22.296]  I'm sorry, it's too ridiculous!
[00:46:22.296 --> 00:46:23.717]  I can't handle it anymore!
[00:46:23.717 --> 00:46:24.717]  Arrest them all!
[00:46:24.717 --> 00:46:25.758]  Arrest her!
[00:46:25.758 --> 00:46:26.478]  Arrest them!
[00:46:26.478 --> 00:46:27.939]  Arrest the criminals!
[00:46:27.939 --> 00:46:29.980]  This is the banking scum!
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.482]  Instead, $12.8 trillion in five and a half months stolen.
[00:46:33.482 --> 00:46:34.482]  Not enough for them!
[00:46:34.482 --> 00:46:37.684]  Aaron, I'm out of control.
[00:46:37.684 --> 00:46:39.865]  You know I really hate Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:46:39.865 --> 00:46:42.206]  Oh, I know.
[00:46:42.206 --> 00:46:42.926]  I know.
[00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:47.389]  But what they're part of... We have a name for it around here when one uses the... It's Queen Elizabeth II due to the...
[00:46:48.618 --> 00:46:49.178]  Anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:46:49.178 --> 00:46:50.139]  Go ahead.
[00:46:50.139 --> 00:46:52.021]  No other radio covers Groom of the Stool.
[00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:55.584]  This is the only place.
[00:46:55.584 --> 00:46:56.805]  We're not trying to be a comedy.
[00:46:56.805 --> 00:46:58.166]  It's just reality.
[00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:01.809]  I have to... Oh, here's Joe Biden with some groveling.
[00:47:01.809 --> 00:47:03.270]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.632]  This is unbelievable.
[00:47:05.632 --> 00:47:06.973]  Oh, protesters in Twitter.
[00:47:06.973 --> 00:47:08.514]  We've got to shut the Internet down.
[00:47:08.514 --> 00:47:09.635]  It's so dangerous.
[00:47:09.635 --> 00:47:11.677]  Oh, no.
[00:47:11.677 --> 00:47:12.617]  I'm out of control, Aaron.
[00:47:12.617 --> 00:47:14.439]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:47:14.439 --> 00:47:17.021]  Can you believe $12.8 trillion is the latest number?
[00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:19.672]  It's off the charts.
[00:47:19.672 --> 00:47:21.813]  It really doesn't even resonate almost.
[00:47:21.813 --> 00:47:23.113]  I mean, they've stolen everything.
[00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:27.775]  We're completely bankrupt to a group of criminal bankers that just made up all this money.
[00:47:27.775 --> 00:47:29.496]  And then they call that free market.
[00:47:29.496 --> 00:47:33.538]  But then if you want to fix the highways, it's called socialism.
[00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:39.919]  I mean, if you're against giving them the bonuses in the billions of dollars, you're a commie pinko.
[00:47:39.919 --> 00:47:45.561]  See how the fake conservative angle, and then they have the fake liberal angle of calling him a socialist when it's not socialist?
[00:47:45.561 --> 00:47:47.501]  He's the one looting for the bankers!
[00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:51.642]  But the ones and zeros of the fraudulent derivatives are in the quadrillions?
[00:47:51.642 --> 00:47:52.643]  The quadrillions?
[00:47:52.643 --> 00:47:54.743]  I mean, how are we even supposed to relate to this number?
[00:47:54.743 --> 00:47:56.003]  It's a black hole.
[00:47:56.003 --> 00:48:01.905]  We've always told people the Federal Reserve designs, and they do this in third world countries, same system, a black hole of debt that is designed to bankrupt you.
[00:48:04.053 --> 00:48:06.955]  Let's call Jacobson in here, let's have a discussion.
[00:48:06.955 --> 00:48:09.436]  Rob Jacobson, please come in here.
[00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:13.919]  Come in here.
[00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:16.901]  We're discussing the Groom of the Stool.
[00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:20.063]  Tell the listeners, you guys didn't believe me a few months ago, I told you about it.
[00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.704]  Explain to people this is real.
[00:48:21.704 --> 00:48:22.425]  This is real.
[00:48:22.425 --> 00:48:25.767]  Aaron did extensive research right before my eyes.
[00:48:25.767 --> 00:48:30.170]  We read at least ten documents in about ten minutes.
[00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:30.987]  He
[00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:49.412]  They gotta continue their way of life.
[00:48:49.412 --> 00:48:54.736]  But see somebody that feels like they're a human would want privacy and wouldn't want to humiliate somebody but also would want their privacy.
[00:48:54.736 --> 00:48:58.980]  It shows how disconnected from humanity they are that they don't even think of you as a person.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.161]  You're just there to groom them.
[00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:01.422]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:03.369]  There are these people.
[00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:06.310]  But we're probably being called the weirdos for even talking about it.
[00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:06.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:07.911]  No, it's all true.
[00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:08.891]  It's all true.
[00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:14.073]  If you don't believe this, I would definitely recommend everybody look it up because it's very entertaining reading.
[00:49:14.073 --> 00:49:16.373]  You'll have a good time checking it out.
[00:49:16.373 --> 00:49:19.934]  Well, the disgusting thing is they supposedly got rid of it in what, 1906?
[00:49:19.934 --> 00:49:24.696]  But then when you read deeper into major university reports, it's a quiet thing they do.
[00:49:24.696 --> 00:49:26.196]  It's a private goody.
[00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.937]  They didn't want to give that up.
[00:49:27.937 --> 00:49:31.498]  And they have a British lord that follows them around, wiping their hind ends.
[00:49:31.598 --> 00:49:33.419]  I mean, even if it is true, I mean, think about it.
[00:49:33.419 --> 00:49:36.760]  It went on till, just publicly, till 1906.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.480]  What are they doing?
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.661]  You know, groom of the stool?
[00:49:38.661 --> 00:49:43.022]  That means somebody in 1906 admittedly had a groom of the stool.
[00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:43.602]  Admittedly.
[00:49:43.602 --> 00:49:44.603]  Like, out in the open.
[00:49:47.199 --> 00:49:49.379]  Point is, it shows how high and lofty they are.
[00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:51.640]  Yeah, I mean, they have to be going nuts.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.700]  It's a separated caste of society.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.141]  They're like the Brahmin class of British.
[00:49:56.141 --> 00:50:05.983]  I wonder if there's like a bus of Groom of the Stool that goes into Bilderberg, like some, one of those, like security vans, like, here they come.
[00:50:05.983 --> 00:50:08.123]  Oh yeah, no, the Dutch royalty have grooms.
[00:50:08.123 --> 00:50:09.103]  We looked that up.
[00:50:09.103 --> 00:50:10.984]  Right there, it's one of those people coming out.
[00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:13.064]  Queen Beatrix is the groom, right there.
[00:50:13.684 --> 00:50:14.625]  Oh, they're back on!
[00:50:14.625 --> 00:50:15.446]  Fade them up, fade them up.
[00:50:15.446 --> 00:50:18.190]  Here he is talking to the degenerate scum.
[00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.011]  Hold on, I'm gonna go check.
[00:50:19.011 --> 00:50:26.199]  There you go.
[00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:29.203]  Good, we got out of it before the duke did the whole... Turn around for the cameras, turn around.
[00:50:30.406 --> 00:50:36.429]  The President, the First Lady, meeting with the Queen Elizabeth II just moments ago elsewhere in London.
[00:50:36.429 --> 00:50:38.391]  Boy, protesters.
[00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:40.872]  Really paralyzing parts of the city today.
[00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:44.794]  Thousands of people converging on the city's financial districts as well as the U.S.
[00:50:44.794 --> 00:50:44.994]  Embassy.
[00:50:44.994 --> 00:50:53.599]  Alright folks, we're going to come back and I'm going to quit talking about the degenerate Queen and get into how they're raping you financially and the FEMA camps for you and your family.
[00:50:53.599 --> 00:50:58.601]  So, I'm Alex Jones, this is the one, the only, GCN Radio Network, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:00.865 --> 00:51:04.387]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:51:04.387 --> 00:51:06.308]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:51:06.308 --> 00:51:11.851]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:19.895]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:51:19.895 --> 00:51:26.578]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical
[00:51:26.638 --> 00:51:27.079]  I think so.
[00:51:43.399 --> 00:51:44.519]  Save your money.
[00:51:44.519 --> 00:51:45.820]  Save the environment.

[00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:48.141]  That's r-charge.com.

[00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:49.361]  That's 989-637-4179.
[00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:50.542]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:52.102]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.082]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.082 --> 00:52:14.066]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.668 --> 00:52:21.255]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.255 --> 00:52:23.237]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.237 --> 00:52:25.740]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:36.692]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.296 --> 00:52:38.977]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.977 --> 00:52:40.839]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:47.744]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.744 --> 00:52:56.011]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.011 --> 00:52:57.592]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.592 --> 00:52:58.773]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.646 --> 00:53:01.947]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.947 --> 00:53:07.551]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:12.554]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.554 --> 00:53:18.137]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:18.137 --> 00:53:23.361]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:25.242]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:53:25.666 --> 00:53:30.470]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:31.591]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:34.353]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:38.276]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:38.276 --> 00:53:41.478]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:41.478 --> 00:53:43.680]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.641]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:45.041]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:45.942]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:53:55.018 --> 00:53:55.659]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.683 --> 00:54:10.824]  This is for you, you disgusting witch!
[00:54:10.824 --> 00:54:12.685]  That's right, you disgusting piece of trash!
[00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:55.820]  We looked down the river and we see the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[00:54:58.773 --> 00:55:01.455]  Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise.
[00:55:01.455 --> 00:55:04.338]  If we didn't fire muskets till we looked them in the eye.
[00:55:04.338 --> 00:55:06.840]  We held our fire till we saved their faces well.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.962]  Then we opened up our swirl guns and really gave them well.
[00:55:09.962 --> 00:55:13.285]  We fired our guns and the British kept on coming.
[00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:15.767]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:55:15.767 --> 00:55:18.809]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[00:55:18.809 --> 00:55:21.231]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:24.374]  Your entire heritage is about hating loyalty.
[00:55:29.207 --> 00:55:34.014]  That's what this country is all about, is human liberty and dignity.
[00:55:34.014 --> 00:55:38.682]  Not worshipping these greedy, murderous pieces of filth.
[00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:41.310]  Weirdo!
[00:56:04.821 --> 00:56:15.113]  They ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[00:56:23.926 --> 00:56:39.076]  Absolutely amazing to watch the President bowing and worshipping to Prince Philip and the disgusting Queen, the she-devil, and to see him then going, turn around, turn around!
[00:56:39.076 --> 00:56:47.942]  He's literally like waving his hand for 30 seconds and Obama turns around and goes, okay, black in here, get him out!
[00:56:47.942 --> 00:56:49.323]  Get him out of here!
[00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:52.425]  And even CNN pointed it out.
[00:56:52.425 --> 00:56:58.688]  I was about to say something, and I was like, oh, the listeners can't see this that we're watching, so I won't say it, and then he said it for me.
[00:56:58.688 --> 00:57:04.611]  Finally, someone not worshipping these racist creatures.
[00:57:04.611 --> 00:57:06.452]  Oh, but the Queen doesn't have any power.
[00:57:06.452 --> 00:57:07.533]  No!
[00:57:07.533 --> 00:57:10.174]  And they just literally own half the planet.
[00:57:10.174 --> 00:57:11.135]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:57:11.135 --> 00:57:13.416]  I'm going to go through all the serious news and cut it out.
[00:57:13.416 --> 00:57:16.858]  It's just, it's a little tough for me to take, so I've got to have some comic relief here.
[00:57:16.858 --> 00:57:20.400]  By the way, that's not an April Fool's joke about
[00:57:22.267 --> 00:57:23.969]  The Disgusting Practices of Royalty.
[00:57:23.969 --> 00:57:26.991]  If you just Google that term, you'll find out we're telling you the truth.
[00:57:26.991 --> 00:57:39.422]  It's in the Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, university sites, books about the royals, and it just gets more insane and more disgusting from there.
[00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:45.908]  And they think they're God, they think that you work for them, they think that you've got to
[00:57:48.297 --> 00:57:51.920]  Go along with whatever they want, you just gotta get out of the way with eugenics and die.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:58.826]  In fact, that's in the news today, and this is coming up later in the next hour.
[00:57:58.826 --> 00:58:05.252]  This is out of the British Broadcasting Company, BBC.
[00:58:05.252 --> 00:58:07.273]  Earth population exceeds limits.
[00:58:07.273 --> 00:58:12.578]  There are already too many people living on Earth, according to one of the most influential scientific advisors in the U.S.
[00:58:12.578 --> 00:58:14.680]  government, Nina
[00:58:17.145 --> 00:58:22.469]  Fedorov told BBC One Planet Program that humans have exceeded the Earth's limits of sustainability.
[00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:26.091]  They said that in the Greek times, they said that in the times of Malthus in the 1750s.
[00:58:26.091 --> 00:58:32.836]  That dovetails with UK population must fall 30 million, must be forcibly cut by half, the times of London.
[00:58:32.836 --> 00:58:38.960]  This and a lot more straight ahead as we launch our number two on April 1st.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:44.184]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.492 --> 00:58:47.654]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.369]  We're good.
[00:59:23.763 --> 00:59:24.243]  I think so.
[00:59:53.402 --> 00:59:55.803]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.803 --> 01:00:05.188]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:06.488]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.488 --> 01:00:08.269]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.269 --> 01:00:10.030]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.591]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:13.172]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:17.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:19.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:22.577]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:25.419]  All right, here's the deal.
[01:00:25.419 --> 01:00:27.661]  We're going to cover news, and there's a lot of it.
[01:00:27.661 --> 01:00:30.343]  It's a big news day.
[01:00:30.343 --> 01:00:35.266]  G20, what's happening with the economy, the police state.
[01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:39.669]  Israel saying they may go ahead and strike Iran, the new Prime Minister.
[01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:42.490]  Part deuce for the second time.
[01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.292]  Netanyahu says they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[01:00:45.612 --> 01:01:10.963]  Go over the repercussions of that, and open phones in this hour, also open phones next hour when Tommy Cryer, Esquire, attorney-in-law who successfully defeated the IRS and helped others defeat them on the unconstitutionality of their operations, we're going to be doing interviews almost every day up until Tax Day the 15th about the criminal nature of the private run-for-profit Internal Revenue Service.
[01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:12.833]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:20.056]  And then in the final hour of the transmission, Rob Dew and Jason Douglas have returned in the a.m.
[01:01:20.056 --> 01:01:20.416]  hours.
[01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:29.839]  They got in about one o'clock in the morning last night from California and their four-day trip there from Southern California up until Central, North Central up in
[01:01:30.879 --> 01:01:41.306]  Sacramento, where CPS is kidnapping the people in the tent city's children, kidnapping their children out of their mobile homes, seizing mobile homes, stealing them, auctioning them.
[01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:44.588]  They don't have their papers in order, but the illegal aliens are above the law and don't have to.
[01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:55.375]  That is going to be a very important report, and they're lining up some of the people in the shantytowns being forced out now by Schwarzenegger to a FEMA camp, literal FEMA camp with their prisoners, basically.
[01:01:55.375 --> 01:02:00.299]  That is coming up in the final hour, or T-minus two hours from now.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.585]  They will be in studio with us and we're going to have some people from the shantytowns there.
[01:02:05.585 --> 01:02:08.669]  We need to get some political attention on this and say, look,
[01:02:09.907 --> 01:02:13.789]  Stop kidnapping the homeless people's children, their animals.
[01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:16.511]  Stop stealing their vehicles when they don't have insurance.
[01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:24.235]  This is a discrimination lawsuit in the making, because there are documented cases, especially in California, where the illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:02:24.235 --> 01:02:27.037]  They don't get arrested for no insurance, no driver's license.
[01:02:27.037 --> 01:02:34.221]  I saw two reports of illegal aliens cornering and attacking police in California yesterday, where there's total breakdown of society.
[01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:34.541]  In fact,
[01:02:35.933 --> 01:02:37.675]  That was on Drudge from Mainstream News.
[01:02:37.675 --> 01:02:38.657]  I don't see it in my stack.
[01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:44.785]  Somebody go there and just CTRL-F police and you'll see the article about them doing that.
[01:02:46.254 --> 01:02:47.535]  There are several articles, actually.
[01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:52.557]  And my whole point is that it's not that all the illegal aliens are evil people.
[01:02:52.557 --> 01:02:56.279]  It's that the criminal element of Mexico is certainly over-represented down in the U.S.
[01:02:56.279 --> 01:02:58.300]  They run here when they commit murders and things.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.321]  That's been documented.
[01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:00.201]  And then they're above the law.
[01:03:00.201 --> 01:03:08.886]  But citizens, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, are literally fed on because we are the right whale of creatures.
[01:03:11.294 --> 01:03:17.096]  Why was the right whale hunted until near extinction when only a few hundred live from tens of thousands in the seas?
[01:03:17.096 --> 01:03:22.699]  It's a sweet, large, slow, blubberous whale with lots of whale oil.
[01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:29.301]  And the whales would come up and bump the boats, friendly, very sweet whales, and they would kill them.
[01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:32.223]  Not like a sperm whale that dives deep and fights, not like other whales.
[01:03:33.206 --> 01:03:34.306]  that are hard to deal with.
[01:03:34.306 --> 01:03:36.207]  No, it was the right whale, the right one.
[01:03:36.207 --> 01:03:38.307]  And the American people have a giant target.
[01:03:38.307 --> 01:03:39.828]  They say, this is a schmuck.
[01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:41.928]  This is somebody trained to put up with tyranny.
[01:03:41.928 --> 01:03:45.749]  This is somebody that's been drinking fluoride their whole life and is brain damaged and submissive.
[01:03:45.749 --> 01:03:49.730]  This is somebody I can feed on.
[01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:54.571]  And police all over the country say, yeah, they're not allowed to arrest illegal aliens for the things they arrest citizens.
[01:03:54.571 --> 01:04:00.633]  Citizens are known as cattle, as slaves to be fed on.
[01:04:02.796 --> 01:04:05.178]  We are the prey of choice.
[01:04:05.178 --> 01:04:10.001]  You know, you don't see wolves trying to eat grizzly bears.
[01:04:10.001 --> 01:04:12.182]  Wolves go after deer.
[01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.284]  They go after mice.
[01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:16.545]  Actually, their main diet is rodents.
[01:04:16.545 --> 01:04:18.607]  They go after little things they can grab.
[01:04:18.607 --> 01:04:20.528]  They don't go after porcupines.
[01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:23.570]  They don't go after poisonous toads.
[01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:24.931]  They don't go after grizzly bears.
[01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:26.272]  They don't go after polar bears.
[01:04:26.272 --> 01:04:29.114]  They go after rabbits and deer.
[01:04:30.902 --> 01:04:32.723]  And sheep.
[01:04:32.723 --> 01:04:35.383]  And we are sheep.
[01:04:35.383 --> 01:04:37.424]  The illegal aliens are not to be messed with.
[01:04:37.424 --> 01:04:42.485]  They're here to bankrupt the economy, bankrupt the states, drive down the wages.
[01:04:42.485 --> 01:04:44.226]  As part of merging us in a third world.
[01:04:44.226 --> 01:04:57.089]  Only citizens are to be throttled, squeezed, dominated, bludgeoned, controlled, pushed to the edge of extinction, driven into homelessness, put in camps, their children taken, their cars seized.
[01:04:57.089 --> 01:04:59.450]  We are here to be raped by the criminal government.
[01:05:00.967 --> 01:05:07.130]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:10.752]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com can help free you from the debt trap.
[01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:15.634]  This is not a debt settlement program which has tax consequences or debt consolidation.
[01:05:15.634 --> 01:05:19.036]  With our program there are no more payments to creditors or collectors.
[01:05:19.036 --> 01:05:19.817]  We're good to go.
[01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:37.452]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:04.611 --> 01:06:07.234]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:14.262]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:21.325]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:23.367]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:25.868]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.868 --> 01:06:36.816]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.435 --> 01:06:39.117]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.117 --> 01:06:40.979]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:40.979 --> 01:06:47.886]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.886 --> 01:06:56.155]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.155 --> 01:06:57.736]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.736 --> 01:06:58.918]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.194]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:07:02.194 --> 01:07:04.618]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:07:04.618 --> 01:07:08.787]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:07:08.787 --> 01:07:10.009]  If you're a politician who votes
[01:07:16.093 --> 01:07:24.936]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:07:24.936 --> 01:07:31.318]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:07:31.318 --> 01:07:34.919]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:07:34.919 --> 01:07:39.320]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.020]  For the rest of you,
[01:07:46.144 --> 01:07:46.504]  We're good.
[01:08:01.821 --> 01:08:04.582]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:08.544]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:10.505]  Opening the phones up in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:10.505 --> 01:08:10.625]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:13.287]  We'll break down the criminal IRS next hour, then we'll go
[01:08:23.238 --> 01:08:25.079]  Okay, let me go ahead and go over the news.
[01:08:25.079 --> 01:08:26.500]  Prime Minister, we may be forced to attack Iran.
[01:08:51.104 --> 01:08:53.246]  This is the Jerusalem Post.
[01:08:53.246 --> 01:09:00.251]  The primary imperative of the United States and President Barack Obama is to put an end to Iran's nuclear race.
[01:09:00.251 --> 01:09:05.555]  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before his swearing-in Tuesday, adding that if the U.S.
[01:09:05.555 --> 01:09:14.201]  failed to do so, Israel might be forced to resort to a military strike on the Islamic Republic's nuclear installations.
[01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:16.103]  And I quote the new Prime Minister.
[01:09:16.103 --> 01:09:17.164]  Now in for the second time.
[01:09:18.246 --> 01:09:20.828]  The Obama Presidency has two great missions.
[01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:24.650]  Fixing the economy and preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons.
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:30.214]  Netanyahu told the Atlantic newspaper.
[01:09:30.214 --> 01:09:34.957]  The Iranian drive for a nuclear weapon was a hinge of history.
[01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:45.423]  He said, emphasizing that all of Western civilization was responsible for preventing an Iranian bomb after Israel, the United States and England helped give AQ Khan Laboratories in Pakistan the bomb.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.302]  We'll get into the wider reasons they're doing this.
[01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:16.870]  Preemptive strikes against perceived threats were the result of the Jewish people learning from a long history of grappling against those who threaten their collective existence.
[01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:27.521]  He cited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's repeated calls to wipe Israel off the map, as well as a recent remark by the country's Supreme Leader.
[01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:34.025]  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the effect that Israel was a cancerous tumor.
[01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:43.954]  However, despite Iran singling out of Israel, he said the rest of the world would be well advised to take the threat emanating from Tehran seriously.
[01:10:43.954 --> 01:10:54.402]  He voiced support for Obama's strategy of engaging Iran in dialogue, as long as the negotiations work swiftly to convince Iran to relinquish its nuclear program.
[01:10:54.402 --> 01:10:55.343]  Now let's stop right there.
[01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:13.576]  Whether you're Iranian, whether you're Israeli, whether you're American, whether you're German, whether you're Chinese, you shouldn't want an Israeli preemptive strike on the 65 million to 70 million people of Iran.
[01:11:13.576 --> 01:11:17.918]  They have 11,000 sunburn missiles that can hit all the major ships in the Gulf.
[01:11:17.918 --> 01:11:21.179]  They can shut down the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:11:21.179 --> 01:11:23.220]  They will probably attack Iraq.
[01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:30.051]  Undoubtedly, Muslims will flare up all over the world, not just Shiite, but Sunni.
[01:11:30.051 --> 01:11:33.393]  A billion, one hundred million.
[01:11:33.393 --> 01:11:35.914]  The West will clearly stage terror attacks as well.
[01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:43.337]  This will widen into a police state crackdown at home, so the bankers can steal what's left of the collapsing economies.
[01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:48.119]  And the Rand Corporation said three months ago, reported by British News and Chinese News,
[01:11:49.423 --> 01:11:54.385]  That they want a World War III level conflict to bring in their new world order.
[01:11:54.385 --> 01:12:04.529]  So, you may be all fired up and you loved attacking Iraq twice, and you love wars, you love eating pizza and drinking beer while you watch shock and awe as cities are blown to bits.
[01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.750]  You may enjoy the destruction in Fallujah.
[01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.671]  It's tribal, it feels good.
[01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:17.254]  But understand, ladies and gentlemen, that Iran, according to the CIA, is seven years away from having a crude A-bomb.
[01:12:18.206 --> 01:12:22.368]  They don't have centrifuges that can purify it to anywhere near the level they need.
[01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:26.871]  They don't have the delivery system to deliver weapons more than 400 miles.
[01:12:26.871 --> 01:12:35.935]  Israel, conservatively, has 400 super high-tech hydrogen bombs, neutron bombs, you name it.
[01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.357]  Israel has German-made subs.
[01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:56.444]  In the Gulf, in the Med, they have cruise missiles, they have fighter bombers, they have bombers, they have strategic forces with frogs and Davy Crockett, small nukes, just it's unbelievable.
[01:12:56.444 --> 01:13:01.367]  Anyone that dared launch anything in Israel, they have anti-missile systems better than the Patriot.
[01:13:04.161 --> 01:13:28.147]  The United States has at least five DC-10s with high-powered chemical lasers in the air at all times in the Middle East that can target missiles seconds after launch and fire a particle beam at it and destroy it before it even begins its arc downward.
[01:13:28.147 --> 01:13:29.687]  Now, meanwhile, you have
[01:13:31.308 --> 01:13:50.783]  The head of the Swiss company at the time, in 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, ABB, the company, giving the nuclear technology to North Korea to successfully develop some crude A-bombs.
[01:13:50.783 --> 01:13:52.624]  This is reality.
[01:13:52.624 --> 01:13:58.929]  Just Google Israel, Google Britain, Google US, help Iran's nuclear program.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.241]  Help North Korea's nuclear program.
[01:14:02.241 --> 01:14:05.741]  Help Pakistan's nuclear program.
[01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:13.623]  Halliburton's been involved, this came out five years ago, helping fund Iran with its centrifuges.
[01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:18.124]  And Dick Cheney said, this is no big deal, it's just a subsidiary, and the Cayman's doing it.
[01:14:18.124 --> 01:14:24.766]  So it's like the old Western, and I love the... In fact, Google this.
[01:14:24.766 --> 01:14:27.227]  Bill Hicks, pick up the gun.
[01:14:27.227 --> 01:14:28.087]  Bill Hicks, pick up the gun.
[01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:33.441]  I've never seen him do this, and when I did this about ten years ago, I'd seen the same Westerns.
[01:14:33.441 --> 01:14:34.682]  It's a classic theme in Westerns.
[01:14:34.682 --> 01:14:37.644]  They'll say, that's Bill Hicks, but he does do it better than I do.
[01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:49.112]  And it's where they throw the gun down, you know, they've just... It's in a couple Clint Eastwood movies, you know, where the regulators for the railroad, there was a lot of true cases of this.
[01:14:49.112 --> 01:14:58.119]  Pinkerton men and others would... would shoot, you know, somebody's daddy, trying to sell his gold at the company store in town.
[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:05.718]  And then they'd throw a gun down at the 10 or 12 year old's feet and say, go ahead kid, pick up the gun.
[01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:07.241]  Pick it up!
[01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:08.222]  I just killed your daddy.
[01:15:08.222 --> 01:15:10.786]  And the kid will reach down for the gun and they'll fill him full of holes.
[01:15:10.786 --> 01:15:11.668]  It's the same thing.
[01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:13.651]  They give them the gun, they go pick it up.
[01:15:17.076 --> 01:15:17.536]  The U.S.
[01:15:17.536 --> 01:15:21.238]  government admits they staged terror attacks with the British in 1953 in Iran to overthrow them.
[01:15:21.238 --> 01:15:24.960]  They always are blowing up their airlines trying to get them to go crazy.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:41.489]  We told you this before, even The New Yorker did, now the White House admitted it two years ago now, that they are staging terror attacks inside Iran against Iranian government facilities in a pretext to get them to widen a war into the border, their western border, on the eastern border with Iraq.
[01:15:43.513 --> 01:15:54.176]  So that's the facts, ladies and gentlemen, and they want to launch World War III, and almost all the major analysts, even those that are for the war, admit it will turn into a theater war with multiple nations involved.
[01:15:54.176 --> 01:16:03.079]  It will cause Pakistan to go into total revolt, who has more than 20 nukes with delivery systems of up to 2,000 kilometers.
[01:16:03.079 --> 01:16:03.700]  What is that, 1,200, 1,300 miles?
[01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:34.480]  You know, on the eve of the Gulf War II, it was in major newspapers, but didn't get a lot of traction, that in a missile test, they're about to do another one, North Korea fired an ICBM, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, with a dummy test MIRV package, Multiple Reentry Device, so one warhead, you know, one missile nose cone has five or six smaller bombs, payloads, that are delivered out to other targets.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.181]  That way, even if you shoot the missile down,
[01:16:39.235 --> 01:16:43.039]  It pops open and fires its nukes out.
[01:16:43.039 --> 01:16:44.661]  One missile.
[01:16:44.661 --> 01:16:45.021]  U.S.
[01:16:45.021 --> 01:16:47.083]  MIRVs carry as many as 20 warheads.
[01:16:47.083 --> 01:16:48.184]  Russian MIRVs as many as 14.
[01:16:50.799 --> 01:16:57.722]  North Korea is testing MIRVs, the Chinese Long March that Lord Allen Hughes, through Clinton and the Republicans, helped transfer to Communist China.
[01:16:57.722 --> 01:16:58.422]  Why did the U.S.
[01:16:58.422 --> 01:17:05.565]  government allow the transfer of MIRV technology, an ICBM, high-tech ICBM, to China?
[01:17:05.565 --> 01:17:09.507]  They're handing out the weapons worldwide, just like the documents have been declassified.
[01:17:09.507 --> 01:17:17.670]  They stirred up war with Germany in World War I. They financed Hitler to get him into power, told him they were going to have him fight the Communists, told him to attack those countries, and then set him up.
[01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:18.750]  Am I saying Hitler's good?
[01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.970]  No.
[01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.371]  The point is, it's a fact.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.421]  They financed him.
[01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:24.822]  The Milner Group.
[01:17:24.822 --> 01:17:26.244]  Lord Milner.
[01:17:26.244 --> 01:17:26.904]  It's on record.
[01:17:26.904 --> 01:17:28.305]  Mainstream history.
[01:17:28.305 --> 01:17:34.911]  Not on the History Channel, though, but in mainline, award-winning books.
[01:17:34.911 --> 01:17:35.852]  Government documents.
[01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:42.418]  So, in polls, upwards of 75% of Iranians don't like their mullahs.
[01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:49.095]  Even Jerome Corsi says the way to go is through detente, is through working with Iran.
[01:17:49.095 --> 01:17:55.500]  But notice when the Ayatollahs, before Ahmadinejad got in five years ago, notice they let the inspectors in like no country ever did, went under U.N.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.284]  control, was totally peaceful, had nothing to do with nuclear weapons production.
[01:17:59.284 --> 01:17:59.624]  The U.N.'
[01:17:59.604 --> 01:18:02.266]  's on record saying that, Hans Blix, all of them.
[01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:05.009]  Ah, Hans Blix.
[01:18:05.009 --> 01:18:06.570]  Come on in, buddy.
[01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:07.371]  Back to Kim Jong-il.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.181]  Alec Baldwin, very useful to me.
[01:18:10.181 --> 01:18:12.743]  But anyways, I digress into Team America.
[01:18:12.743 --> 01:18:16.365]  America!
[01:18:16.365 --> 01:18:20.608]  America!
[01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.790]  I shouldn't be laughing about all this, it's too serious.
[01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:27.993]  This isn't a movie, it's reality.
[01:18:27.993 --> 01:18:30.495]  And so they've helped give them all of these weapon systems.
[01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:37.350]  And they want to start World War III, and the Mulas were trying to reach out to the West, and they were rebuffed.
[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:45.276]  And so, the Mulas said, okay, we'll put a radical in, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:50.040]  And now, they want war with him, and this will be devastating.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.881]  Devastating, if this is allowed to happen.
[01:18:51.881 --> 01:18:57.646]  Now, I'm going to come back and go to your calls, and then I'm going to get into
[01:18:59.642 --> 01:19:01.343]  Just the amazing news of the day.
[01:19:01.343 --> 01:19:03.285]  Financial Rescue.
[01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:04.345]  It's a rescue.
[01:19:04.345 --> 01:19:06.447]  You know, this is saving us.
[01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:07.748]  See that lie?
[01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:08.308]  Bloomberg.
[01:19:08.308 --> 01:19:16.034]  Financial Rescue nears GDP, Gross Domestic Product, everything the company produces every year, of $12.8 trillion in five and a half months of the bailout.
[01:19:16.034 --> 01:19:20.477]  So they're on line within 12 months of this starting for it to be $26 trillion.
[01:19:20.477 --> 01:19:23.900]  And you're all going to pay for it, and the police are going to squeeze it out of you.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.782]  That's why they're wearing black masks now, folks.
[01:19:26.782 --> 01:19:27.903]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:19:30.776 --> 01:19:35.337]  We're going to get into World Bank President amidst the agenda for global government.
[01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.557]  Look at this headline, AP.
[01:19:36.557 --> 01:19:38.717]  Desperate world leaders meet on economic woes.
[01:19:38.717 --> 01:19:39.458]  Oh, they're desperate.
[01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.298]  They're getting their world government and all this power and stealing from us.
[01:19:42.298 --> 01:19:43.058]  Oh, it's so desperate.
[01:19:43.058 --> 01:19:46.899]  And you watch their body language, laughing, smiling, admitting this is a great opportunity.
[01:19:46.899 --> 01:19:52.160]  George Soros, who's attending, says he's having a great crisis, the culmination of his life.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.000]  Oh, it's so good bankrupting you.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.141]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[01:19:58.141 --> 01:19:59.041]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:20:00.959 --> 01:20:09.225]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:20:09.225 --> 01:20:13.788]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:20:13.788 --> 01:20:18.451]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:19.852]  It's a documented fact.
[01:20:19.892 --> 01:20:20.293]  We're good to go!
[01:20:38.795 --> 01:20:39.576]  Once a day.
[01:20:39.576 --> 01:20:43.859]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[01:20:54.627 --> 01:20:58.570]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:13.526]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.526 --> 01:21:20.028]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.028 --> 01:21:22.009]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.009 --> 01:21:24.470]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:35.355]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.657 --> 01:21:39.317]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:41.178]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:41.178 --> 01:21:48.079]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:57.922]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.922 --> 01:21:59.102]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.652 --> 01:22:01.232]  Good day.
[01:22:01.232 --> 01:22:03.054]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.054 --> 01:22:03.394]  April 1st, 2009.
[01:22:03.394 --> 01:22:04.334]  Gold opened this morning at $9.2740.
[01:22:04.334 --> 01:22:07.456]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.5411, $4.7705 for a half-ounce, and $2.3858 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:08.297]  That's $9.5411, $4.7705, and $2.3858.
[01:22:19.108 --> 01:22:24.875]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.
[01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.477]  and erasing economic borders.
[01:22:26.477 --> 01:22:33.365]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security prosperity partnership.
[01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:36.909]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:37.649]  economy.
[01:22:37.649 --> 01:22:39.832]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document
[01:22:40.072 --> 01:22:42.534]  The plan to replace the dollar with the emerald.
[01:22:42.534 --> 01:22:44.195]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[01:22:44.195 --> 01:22:45.356]  is under attack.
[01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:48.978]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[01:22:52.061 --> 01:22:52.361]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:06.064]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:14.631]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:23:14.631 --> 01:23:18.194]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:21.416]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[01:23:21.416 --> 01:23:23.918]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[01:24:41.599 --> 01:24:44.200]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.620]  Creston, Iowa, thanks for holding.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.280]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:25:11.345 --> 01:25:13.106]  Hello, Chris!
[01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:14.507]  Yeah, hey buddy, I couldn't hear you.
[01:25:14.507 --> 01:25:25.775]  Uh, Alex, I, uh, I listened to the podcast a day late, so I'm not up to what's going on for today, but I wanted to call you regarding Luke and getting busted over the weekend.
[01:25:25.775 --> 01:25:25.875]  Yes.
[01:25:25.875 --> 01:25:28.237]  I've got this application on my cell phone.
[01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:36.083]  I push a single button, turn my video camera on, it starts streaming to the web directly in real time, and it records on the web.
[01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.764]  Yeah, there's a lot of those applications.
[01:25:37.764 --> 01:25:39.265]  Tell folks the application you're using.
[01:25:40.255 --> 01:25:40.735]  They're free.
[01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.216]  This one's called QIK.com.
[01:25:43.216 --> 01:25:44.616]  It's a free service.
[01:25:44.616 --> 01:25:46.896]  It's a free application downloaded to my Blackberry.
[01:25:46.896 --> 01:25:48.437]  Works perfect.
[01:25:48.437 --> 01:25:59.739]  And the gem is that, you know, if you know you're going into a situation like he did and you got this thing, you know, back up running, you can have your attorney, you, he could call me, I don't care.
[01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:02.039]  And we can be watching this going on.
[01:26:02.039 --> 01:26:05.060]  And when things roll out the way they do... No, I agree.
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.260]  And the way to go is to have
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:06.520]  I think?
[01:26:28.855 --> 01:26:34.717]  in Denver at the DNC and tens of thousands would tune in there and it was just amazing.
[01:26:34.717 --> 01:26:42.679]  But then we had MSNBC and we were bullhorning Chris Matthews attack our camera and it was hooked up to a laptop to send it out in higher quality.
[01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:51.662]  But no, certainly as this technology becomes mainstream, as it becomes second and third and fourth generation, it's already in the third generation, starts working better, it's going to revolutionize things.
[01:26:51.662 --> 01:26:57.704]  That's why police are investing all over the world in cell phone jammers at protests so they can jam that.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.260]  Right, right.
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:15.226]  Well, the thing with this is, I mean, I suppose with the others as well, but the one thing I like about this is that as it's streaming live, you can download the flash video to your computer and then upload it right away back to YouTube so that if, you know, a thousand people decide to hit it, it's not going to crash their service because, you know, it'll be the Google YouTube.
[01:27:15.226 --> 01:27:15.966]  Absolutely!
[01:27:15.966 --> 01:27:16.646]  That is the model.
[01:27:16.646 --> 01:27:18.147]  Anything else, Chris?
[01:27:18.147 --> 01:27:23.389]  Well, that's what I was going to say, is that by the time Luke's fingerprints had gotten dry, this thing could have been viral.
[01:27:23.389 --> 01:27:24.729]  And I'm not second-guessing anybody.
[01:27:24.729 --> 01:27:26.490]  I mean, obviously, but I just want to bring everybody's attention.
[01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:32.187]  So one more time, it's QIK.com, and then you get your own little username.
[01:27:32.187 --> 01:27:33.308]  It's free, it's quick, it's easy.
[01:27:33.308 --> 01:27:34.048]  Chris, I hear you.
[01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:46.931]  He shouldn't go anywhere near Bloomberg unless he has something like that going live with a backup, several of them, because even if he gets arrested, at least later it's uploaded to his computer across town or across the world, and then they can't set him up.
[01:27:46.931 --> 01:27:48.231]  Great points, Chris.
[01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:49.992]  Lauren in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:27:52.093 --> 01:27:53.374]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:27:53.374 --> 01:27:54.075]  Pretty good.
[01:27:54.075 --> 01:28:03.364]  I wanted to cheer you up a little because I can hear the stress in your voices and that you're making me crack up with the Queen stuff and I'm wondering when people are going to stop bowing down and scraping before men.
[01:28:03.364 --> 01:28:05.366]  I'm going to just real quickly do this.
[01:28:05.366 --> 01:28:07.888]  I hear you talking about the Mexicans, they're above the law.
[01:28:07.888 --> 01:28:11.592]  It's not that the Mexicans are above the law, it's that they're not under
[01:28:17.754 --> 01:28:18.394]  I agree.
[01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:24.936]  I agree because they literally are free men and won't get the license and won't get the insurance and just thumb their nose.
[01:28:24.936 --> 01:28:29.818]  The system's just given up because it's powerless unless you acquiesce and you're right.
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:30.178]  That's why...
[01:28:31.101 --> 01:28:31.321]  Yep.
[01:28:31.321 --> 01:28:31.881]  You got it!
[01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:32.541]  You got it!
[01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:37.643]  And here's the thing, this is the key, and this is why they needed to get the Bible out of the schools and away from the children.
[01:28:37.643 --> 01:28:40.204]  God made us human beings, human man.
[01:28:40.204 --> 01:28:41.925]  You know, he created us out of the dirt.
[01:28:41.925 --> 01:28:42.985]  Human.
[01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:43.605]  Get it?
[01:28:43.605 --> 01:28:45.506]  We, the land, is us.
[01:28:45.506 --> 01:28:46.786]  You are God's gift to you.
[01:28:46.786 --> 01:28:48.387]  You are a king of your own land.
[01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:59.831]  When we came here, and this country was developed, and my ancestors, one of them was Raymond Demery, he was aide-de-camp for Washington, and they were here in 1739 before we even had the United States of America.
[01:29:00.493 --> 01:29:04.858]  Which is not even that right now, but the whole point is, everybody was a king.
[01:29:04.858 --> 01:29:07.921]  Your rights are un-alien-able.
[01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:12.805]  Nobody can put a lien against your flesh because you belong to God.
[01:29:12.805 --> 01:29:14.908]  God created the men, the men created the cross.
[01:29:14.908 --> 01:29:18.671]  And only a group of grand jurors, your peers,
[01:29:19.372 --> 01:29:25.697]  Who are supposed to be in control of the court process, not captured, kept minions of the prosecutor and the judge.
[01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:40.769]  Only they, when it's been decided with evidence and witnesses that you've hurt someone else, deprived them of life, liberty, or happiness, and carried out violence or theft, then you can be seized and put through due process.
[01:29:40.769 --> 01:29:44.151]  But you're absolutely on target, Lauren, and I totally agree with you.
[01:29:44.151 --> 01:29:44.592]  Anything else?
[01:29:47.328 --> 01:29:47.928]  Stay there.
[01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:48.468]  Stay there.
[01:29:48.468 --> 01:29:48.849]  Stay there.
[01:29:48.849 --> 01:29:49.629]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:51.409]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.409 --> 01:29:52.790]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:55.331]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.331 --> 01:30:01.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.232 --> 01:30:08.094]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[01:30:08.094 --> 01:30:09.035]  It's true.
[01:30:09.035 --> 01:30:14.616]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:14.616 --> 01:30:15.997]  Not if, but when.
[01:30:18.695 --> 01:30:22.160]  How do you folks know that I got my solar backup generator hooked up and running?
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.983]  To tell you the truth, it's awesome!
[01:30:23.983 --> 01:30:29.971]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV, and shortwave radio.
[01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:32.816]  I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid.
[01:30:32.816 --> 01:30:33.617]  Thanks for all your help!
[01:30:33.977 --> 01:30:41.422]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[01:30:41.422 --> 01:30:45.404]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[01:30:45.404 --> 01:30:47.845]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[01:30:47.845 --> 01:30:50.107]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:30:50.107 --> 01:30:52.688]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:30:52.688 --> 01:30:53.189]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.229]  877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.218 --> 01:31:07.044]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:14.052]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:21.205]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.205 --> 01:31:23.187]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.187 --> 01:31:25.689]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:37.258]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:38.940]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.301]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:40.774 --> 01:31:47.681]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:57.531 --> 01:31:58.713]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.624]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[01:32:04.624 --> 01:32:09.470]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:12.373]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[01:32:12.373 --> 01:32:16.677]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[01:32:18.319 --> 01:32:18.999]  We're good to go.
[01:32:44.036 --> 01:32:44.676]  Woah, boom, bop-a-boom!
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.023]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:19.023 --> 01:33:22.985]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:33:46.042 --> 01:33:48.045]  We were going to Justin next, but he just hung up.
[01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:50.729]  Frank, Sean, David, Taylor, many others.
[01:33:50.729 --> 01:33:50.929]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:50.929 --> 01:33:53.813]  Promise to take calls.
[01:33:53.813 --> 01:33:55.615]  But to do that, I gotta try to move through your calls.
[01:33:55.615 --> 01:33:57.358]  I got all this other news.
[01:33:57.358 --> 01:34:00.822]  And we are gonna debrief on air coming up in an hour and a half.
[01:34:03.433 --> 01:34:08.518]  The team that we sent out to the tent cities of California, it is hellish what they're doing.
[01:34:08.518 --> 01:34:14.543]  Kidnapping their children, kidnapping their animals, kidnapping their cars, their Winnebago's, auctioning them.
[01:34:14.543 --> 01:34:16.445]  Oh, you don't have insurance, your sticker isn't in.
[01:34:16.445 --> 01:34:26.253]  Just harassing them with pleasure, and then saying we're just doing our job, the illegal aliens are above the law, and literally don't have to have any driver's license, insurance, the police all over the country admit they're told just let them go.
[01:34:27.114 --> 01:34:36.950]  Now, I know a lot of you just love the illegal aliens, and you think it's wrong to criticize the fact that they're above the law, but I mean, you know, regardless, they shouldn't be doing this to citizens then.
[01:34:38.052 --> 01:34:38.632]  I mean, come on.
[01:34:38.632 --> 01:34:55.320]  I know it's fun that American citizens are seen as trash, and we've been domesticated, we've been institutionalized, we've been trained to go along with this, and the state, the criminal state, that's nothing but a conduit, a proboscis to the larger mosquito above it that is the New World Order, is feeding on the American people.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.541]  Whether you're black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[01:34:57.541 --> 01:35:00.083]  Now, finish up with your great point, Lauren in Ohio.
[01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:00.943]  You're right.
[01:35:00.943 --> 01:35:04.525]  It's because we've waived our rights in due process and been trained to acquiesce and accept it.
[01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:10.749]  that citizens are treated like third class citizens.
[01:35:10.749 --> 01:35:11.430]  Hello?
[01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:12.430]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:13.811]  Oh, you are absolutely right.
[01:35:13.811 --> 01:35:15.913]  Okay, I'm just going to go with the 14th Amendment real quick.
[01:35:15.913 --> 01:35:16.633]  Section 1.
[01:35:16.633 --> 01:35:19.395]  A person, look it up in the Black's Law Dictionary.
[01:35:19.395 --> 01:35:20.876]  It's not the same thing as a man.
[01:35:20.876 --> 01:35:21.777]  Okay?
[01:35:21.777 --> 01:35:26.360]  A person is born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.843]  That means there are people that are not subject to the jurisdiction thereof.
[01:35:29.843 --> 01:35:31.084]  That's where the key lies.
[01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:32.365]  We have all the power to stop this.
[01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:33.831]  Stop giving them your money.
[01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:37.213]  Stop giving these fallible servants your obeisance.
[01:35:37.213 --> 01:35:39.254]  God said, have no other gods before me.
[01:35:39.254 --> 01:35:41.215]  And stop giving them access to your children.
[01:35:41.215 --> 01:35:46.158]  Why do you think all these people are running around and think they live in a democracy and we're spreading democracy around the world?
[01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:48.159]  They don't even know they're supposed to live in a republic.
[01:35:48.599 --> 01:35:55.005]  So, the whole point is, is we've done this to ourselves by walking out from under the protection of God.
[01:35:55.005 --> 01:35:57.087]  He told us, obey me first.
[01:35:57.087 --> 01:36:01.171]  That's why it's Uncle Sam, Uncle Samaritan, because he's not your daddy.
[01:36:01.171 --> 01:36:03.714]  Patriot, the root of that word is patriarch.
[01:36:03.714 --> 01:36:05.416]  The government is not your father.
[01:36:05.416 --> 01:36:06.437]  They're a bunch of servants.
[01:36:06.437 --> 01:36:07.898]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights
[01:36:08.218 --> 01:36:12.720]  It's a body of negative law to limit the government.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.180]  I agree.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:19.403]  I've read the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, I've read the debates.
[01:36:19.403 --> 01:36:25.065]  It's all documented and we are a captured, kept, indentured slave mash.
[01:36:25.865 --> 01:36:32.767]  And now all over the nation they're putting in body scanners and they show it on the news, people's naked bodies, and they admit they're recording it.
[01:36:32.767 --> 01:36:36.688]  And first it's take your shoes off, then you can't have water, then you've got to be asked questions.
[01:36:36.688 --> 01:36:37.968]  Now we've got to scan your body.
[01:36:37.968 --> 01:36:41.669]  They're training you how to submit to them getting in your business.
[01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:42.609]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:42.609 --> 01:36:44.389]  Fine points there, Lauren.
[01:36:44.389 --> 01:36:46.150]  Let's talk to Frank in New York.
[01:36:46.150 --> 01:36:48.150]  You're on the air.
[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:49.731]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:36:49.731 --> 01:36:50.031]  Hello.
[01:36:50.031 --> 01:36:52.151]  This is Frank in New York.
[01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:54.632]  Listen, I wanted to commend you on the Obama deception.
[01:36:55.316 --> 01:36:56.917]  I've watched it four times.
[01:36:56.917 --> 01:37:00.199]  It's really a masterpiece.
[01:37:00.199 --> 01:37:03.561]  And it's one of the most interesting political documentaries.
[01:37:03.561 --> 01:37:10.646]  And what's amazing is that the timing of this, it's not one or two years into Obama's presidency, but it's
[01:37:11.607 --> 01:37:14.630]  You know, within the first six or eight weeks.
[01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:16.552]  So, congratulations on that.
[01:37:16.552 --> 01:37:24.361]  It's not only entertaining, but it's a wonderful vehicle to get people thinking, you know, about... Exactly.
[01:37:24.361 --> 01:37:30.047]  The establishment sets out the false left and right choice, which are really working on the same team.
[01:37:30.047 --> 01:37:31.808]  Everybody gets captured in that parlor.
[01:37:32.509 --> 01:37:33.370]  Absolutely.
[01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.712]  Now, I wanted to make a couple comments.
[01:37:55.449 --> 01:38:07.617]  When Rumsfeld was on the board of Brombovia in Switzerland, he was instrumental in getting the contract for the North Korean nuclear reactor, and he received a big bonus for that, and I think that should be mentioned.
[01:38:07.617 --> 01:38:09.578]  And also the fact that... I did just mention that.
[01:38:09.578 --> 01:38:10.639]  I did just mention that.
[01:38:10.639 --> 01:38:11.199]  Okay.
[01:38:11.199 --> 01:38:12.440]  And also... A-B-B.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:20.225]  And also the fact that, sadly, I may meet you in person at the FEMA camp in the next year or so, but on a more up-to-date
[01:38:20.712 --> 01:38:34.296]  Lifting note, I think if Henry Kissinger decides to retire from Kissinger Associates, and since he has been knighted by the Queen, he would make an excellent candidate for Groom of the Stool.
[01:38:34.296 --> 01:38:37.937]  Were you already aware of that, or did you look it up when we said look it up?
[01:38:37.937 --> 01:38:38.737]  No, no, no.
[01:38:38.737 --> 01:38:39.477]  I knew of that.
[01:38:39.477 --> 01:38:46.860]  In fact, the notion of the Groom of the Stool actually in the United States goes back to FDR when he was very ill.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.700]  There was fear that
[01:38:49.101 --> 01:38:59.828]  A fifth column might get hold of his excrement and analyze it to understand what frame of mind or, you know, how sick he was with the polio and things.
[01:38:59.828 --> 01:39:00.729]  And it goes back.
[01:39:00.729 --> 01:39:10.615]  Kennedy also was very concerned about that during the Cold War because, you know, a lot of people believed he was ill, especially the Soviets.
[01:39:10.615 --> 01:39:12.816]  And we know later that he had Addison's disease.
[01:39:12.816 --> 01:39:15.238]  So in a sense, you know, it goes back.
[01:39:16.536 --> 01:39:23.618]  At least with the American presidency through Roosevelt, but it was due to the, you know, intense security during the Second World War.
[01:39:23.618 --> 01:39:28.220]  That's right, and now Obama, Bush, all of them have a special... They all do that, absolutely.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:40.363]  And I was thinking maybe, if not Kissinger, maybe since Bill Clinton's so busy with his foundation, when he decides to move into something else, he might be an excellent candidate as well for that.
[01:39:41.155 --> 01:39:42.876]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:50.340]  Since a lot of you just joined us, you don't know what on earth we're talking about, I'll just recap briefly.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:40:05.829]  Going back to Henry VIII, at least, and they got this from France, and in the writings, they, reading over historical texts, decided to start doing it because Pharaohs, by the middle period of Egypt,
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:17.925]  Now, going back about 2,500 years, they had, or more, they had, they were God-men.
[01:40:17.925 --> 01:40:27.192]  So, they had someone who would lovingly pick the mucus out of their nose, it's known as buggers.
[01:40:27.192 --> 01:40:33.176]  They had someone who would do that because they're God, and then someone who would groom them when they used the restroom.
[01:40:34.352 --> 01:40:35.053]  And then examine.
[01:40:35.053 --> 01:40:38.396]  They would have priests look at it and do portents.
[01:40:38.396 --> 01:40:42.321]  They would also cut open sheep, bulls, you know, read their guts.
[01:40:42.321 --> 01:40:50.229]  You hear the term reading tea leaves where they lay tea leaves out or cast bones on the ground, witch doctors, and you know, read the portent, see what's happening in the future from that.
[01:40:52.363 --> 01:40:58.209]  Well, that's what they would do with the pharaohs and the rest of the royal house's excrement.
[01:40:58.209 --> 01:41:08.218]  And so just to show how disgusting the Queen of England is, and just how they think they're gods in the way they humiliate people, they have a groom of a stool.
[01:41:09.181 --> 01:41:10.521]  Who wipes them and everything else.
[01:41:10.521 --> 01:41:20.943]  I was just pointing out how Obama was bowing to her on national television, and then Prince Philip, the Nazi, who constantly bad-mouths black people, the subhuman, says he wants to kill them, in books, he writes.
[01:41:20.943 --> 01:41:23.864]  She's like, turn around, turn around!
[01:41:23.864 --> 01:41:31.645]  He keeps waving at him for like 30 seconds, and Obama turns around and looks, and then follows the order, and even CNN commented, look at him bossing the President around.
[01:41:31.645 --> 01:41:33.525]  I mean, people heard it, I was playing it.
[01:41:33.525 --> 01:41:35.366]  We just tuned in to see it, and I said, fade it up!
[01:41:35.366 --> 01:41:37.586]  And it was, look how he's making Obama grovel!
[01:41:38.266 --> 01:41:40.668]  I mean, I'm not the only one seeing this.
[01:41:40.668 --> 01:41:48.035]  And so I said, is Obama going to... Because it says only a top lord in England is the groom of the Queen.
[01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:50.137]  Is he going to be her potty valet?
[01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.780]  I mean, this is the larger question that we're having today.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.142]  We have to discredit these people.
[01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:58.745]  We have to show how ridiculous worshipping them is.
[01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:02.008]  Other CNN hosts and Fox hosts were like, I'm so nervous, it's incredible.
[01:42:02.248 --> 01:42:04.089]  Well, will he do the etiquette properly?
[01:42:04.089 --> 01:42:05.730]  Will he approach her properly?
[01:42:05.730 --> 01:42:06.051]  Will he?
[01:42:06.051 --> 01:42:17.058]  Oh my gosh, this moment from Mrs. Obama is the most incredible day of her life to be meeting this incredible individual and Obama's in the news saying, heck, Google this for me, I saw it up on screen, uh, Obama loves the Queen.
[01:42:17.058 --> 01:42:20.820]  It's I love her, the greatest person on Earth, just saving everyone.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:27.965]  This is the greatest example of humanity and grace and this moment to meet her is just unbelievable.
[01:42:27.965 --> 01:42:32.108]  I've been practicing for weeks how to properly worship her grace.
[01:42:32.408 --> 01:42:35.169]  I mean, literally says a lot of that.
[01:42:35.169 --> 01:42:39.471]  I mean, it's just, it's unspeakable.
[01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:41.612]  This is everything our country was founded against.
[01:42:41.612 --> 01:42:43.132]  Yes, here it is, Associated Press.
[01:42:43.132 --> 01:42:48.814]  Obama loves Queen, avoids own goal on football, whatever that means.
[01:42:48.814 --> 01:42:50.775]  So, print that for me, I'll read that later.
[01:42:50.775 --> 01:42:53.256]  Let's continue with your calls here.
[01:42:53.256 --> 01:42:56.177]  Let's talk to Sean in Minnesota.
[01:42:56.177 --> 01:42:57.438]  Hello, you're on the air, Sean.
[01:42:58.413 --> 01:42:59.694]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:42:59.694 --> 01:43:01.096]  Good day to you.
[01:43:01.096 --> 01:43:03.158]  I got two things I want to bring up.
[01:43:03.158 --> 01:43:10.645]  The first thing being, you were talking earlier about the scumbag cops.
[01:43:11.261 --> 01:43:17.124]  in London pretended to be anarchists and staging false flag operations.
[01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:22.806]  Well, I was specifically talking about Denver and where they were caught and admitted.
[01:43:22.806 --> 01:43:25.527]  Denver Post, Associated Press, they admitted.
[01:43:25.527 --> 01:43:28.169]  And I was talking about Canada last year where they were caught doing it.
[01:43:28.169 --> 01:43:30.770]  I'm saying it looks like they're doing it here.
[01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:31.850]  Yes, yes.
[01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:38.333]  And I wanted to dispel a myth, a common myth that people have about anarchists.
[01:43:38.937 --> 01:43:50.968]  I have friends who are anarchists, and they do not, by any means of your imagination, fit that stereotypical profile that you were talking about earlier.
[01:43:50.968 --> 01:43:56.293]  What anarchists are, are people who are pro-liberty.
[01:43:56.293 --> 01:43:59.576]  They're actually very similar to libertarians.
[01:43:59.576 --> 01:44:02.098]  Well, listen, I always get attacked for this, so I want to be clear, and I'll let you finish.
[01:44:02.098 --> 01:44:02.859]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:17.871]  I'm always, I'm talking about the anarchists at these demonstrations have been proven to be government agents over and over again confirmed in court, confirmed in Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Times of London, I mean, it's every time.
[01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:21.133]  Obviously, and they're always actually communists.
[01:44:21.133 --> 01:44:25.216]  The media, I mean, they'll have red stars on, they'll say, you know, we're the
[01:44:26.517 --> 01:44:26.757]  Exactly.
[01:44:26.757 --> 01:44:27.718]  They're pro-liberty people.
[01:44:27.718 --> 01:44:28.999]  They believe in freedom.
[01:44:28.999 --> 01:44:30.560]  They believe in no kind of coercion.
[01:44:50.853 --> 01:44:51.553]  I forgot.
[01:44:51.553 --> 01:44:54.756]  I lost my train of thought there.
[01:44:54.756 --> 01:44:56.037]  Oh, yes.
[01:44:56.037 --> 01:45:06.805]  The second thing I wanted to get your perspective on is what is it about humanity, Alex, that makes us so doggone gullible?
[01:45:06.805 --> 01:45:15.612]  That the fact that these governments can continuously stage false flag operations and people keep falling for it.
[01:45:15.612 --> 01:45:16.633]  No, I hear you.
[01:45:16.633 --> 01:45:17.594]  Let me answer that question.
[01:45:17.594 --> 01:45:18.675]  I appreciate your fine points.
[01:45:20.816 --> 01:45:23.098]  To oversimplify things actually hurts us.
[01:45:23.098 --> 01:45:31.284]  I mean, it's a cocktail of psychological programming and control mechanisms and semantical word games and playing different groups off against each other.
[01:45:31.284 --> 01:45:38.989]  Kind of this false projection on the mind, this false map, this false template, this false paradigm, this false belief system.
[01:45:38.989 --> 01:45:40.670]  And there's different variants of this.
[01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:45.394]  The liberal, the conservative, the libertarian, the fascist, the communist, the socialist, the...
[01:45:47.389 --> 01:45:51.630]  And then they manage these kind of stereotypes in the mind, like, oh, that's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:52.851]  Don't believe them if they have a U.N.
[01:45:52.851 --> 01:45:54.671]  document calling for world government.
[01:45:54.671 --> 01:45:55.792]  Automatic discredits us.
[01:45:55.792 --> 01:45:57.532]  You know, it's just a term.
[01:45:57.532 --> 01:46:00.113]  Or he's a conservative, or he's a this or that.
[01:46:00.113 --> 01:46:02.294]  It's an oversimplification is how they control us.
[01:46:03.234 --> 01:46:06.376]  But they have a lot of different tricks, but mainly they make you feel important.
[01:46:06.376 --> 01:46:07.897]  Mainly they make you feel threatened.
[01:46:07.897 --> 01:46:12.801]  Mainly they, you know, make you feel important in believing they're fraud.
[01:46:12.801 --> 01:46:15.022]  You know, they pose like they're on your side.
[01:46:15.022 --> 01:46:21.266]  Or they have other tricks where they'll, we're going to get these rich elite bankers who got $165 million in bailouts.
[01:46:21.266 --> 01:46:24.128]  Oh my gosh, we're going to bring them to justice right now.
[01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:25.149]  We are so angry.
[01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:26.090]  We are so upset.
[01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:33.957]  We are going to do something and then you find out that they have memos saying they would make that a diversion, but they actually wrote the loopholes for those particular
[01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:45.793]  Bonuses, and that it's a distraction for 12.8 trillion!
[01:46:45.793 --> 01:46:53.915]  Not million, not billion, but 12.8 trillion Bloomberg AP Reuters today.
[01:46:53.915 --> 01:46:55.836]  Because every few months we get the new numbers.
[01:46:55.836 --> 01:46:58.397]  First it was 2.2 trillion the first week.
[01:46:58.397 --> 01:47:00.177]  Then a couple months later we find out it's 5.5 trillion.
[01:47:00.177 --> 01:47:00.698]  Then it's 7 trillion.
[01:47:00.698 --> 01:47:02.078]  Then it's 8.5 trillion.
[01:47:02.078 --> 01:47:02.858]  Then it's 10 trillion a month ago.
[01:47:07.978 --> 01:47:20.621]  Now it is $12.8 trillion and Congress and Bloomberg and AP file suits and Congressmen and Senators ask Bernanke where the money goes and he goes, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:47:20.621 --> 01:47:23.861]  And they send Greenspan on TV to say, none of your business!
[01:47:23.861 --> 01:47:27.362]  Ha ha!
[01:47:27.362 --> 01:47:31.563]  I mean, open stealing everything and then you've got to pay taxes on it.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:48.899]  And meanwhile there's some old woman dressed up with a crown on her head with a dirty look on her face with some monkey-looking crazy Nazi husband who looks like a spoiled 12-year-old Ritalin head, flapping his hands around bossing everyone.
[01:47:48.899 --> 01:47:51.222]  I mean, it just, it's, it's, and waving.
[01:47:52.284 --> 01:47:58.849]  With his hand out, you know, his hand straight out with his fingers waving like Obama bossing him around on television.
[01:47:58.849 --> 01:48:00.990]  And it's like, oh how wonderful!
[01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:02.771]  It's disgusting!
[01:48:02.771 --> 01:48:19.603]  Some murderous mafia chief who breeds all these little Nazi children up there perching on top of us with their pot belly and we're all running around worshipping her and it's so anti-American, so anti-freedom, it makes me literally nauseous to look at that crone.
[01:48:23.286 --> 01:48:27.849]  It's disgusting!
[01:48:27.849 --> 01:48:31.292]  And she's got all these PR firms out there to sell you how good she is.
[01:48:31.292 --> 01:48:34.514]  They write all these books and ledgers and fund extermination.
[01:48:34.514 --> 01:48:46.362]  The Royal Commission on Population, 1948, diagrams the entire eugenics program against Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and the extermination programs, and the one-child policy, and it's all over British News today, and U.S.
[01:48:46.362 --> 01:48:48.003]  News as they announce they want it for the U.S.
[01:48:48.003 --> 01:48:49.324]  and England and Europe.
[01:48:49.324 --> 01:48:51.446]  Where they're gonna tax you if you have more than one child.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.102]  Turn up this... So you put CNN on screen.
[01:48:56.102 --> 01:48:56.542]  It doesn't matter.
[01:48:56.542 --> 01:48:59.945]  We'll get to it later.
[01:48:59.945 --> 01:49:01.766]  Yeah, they're hiking all these new taxes.
[01:49:01.766 --> 01:49:03.627]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:03.627 --> 01:49:04.808]  They claim it's for health care.
[01:49:04.808 --> 01:49:06.969]  Total lies.
[01:49:06.969 --> 01:49:09.011]  So all going right into the bankers' coffers.
[01:49:09.011 --> 01:49:10.812]  They're raising taxes on every front.
[01:49:10.812 --> 01:49:14.794]  $12.8 trillion.
[01:49:14.794 --> 01:49:19.378]  And I've got to look at this monkey in a royal outfit with diamonds all over.
[01:49:19.378 --> 01:49:21.599]  I mean, it's an old gorilla.
[01:49:21.599 --> 01:49:22.860]  An albino gorilla.
[01:49:26.087 --> 01:49:28.208]  These people are so stupid!
[01:49:28.208 --> 01:49:34.530]  These elitists have all these smart people working for them that uphold the whole system, but these bumbling idiots don't even know how to wipe their own behinds, literally.
[01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:36.911]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:49:36.911 --> 01:49:38.492]  Sean, I didn't talk to him.
[01:49:38.492 --> 01:49:39.732]  David in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:49:39.732 --> 01:49:43.794]  Uh, yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[01:49:43.794 --> 01:49:45.234]  I'm just sick of these Royals.
[01:49:45.234 --> 01:49:46.455]  They make me want to throw up.
[01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:47.595]  Hereditary rulers?
[01:49:47.595 --> 01:49:49.596]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:49:49.596 --> 01:49:52.957]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I hear you there.
[01:49:52.957 --> 01:49:55.398]  Before I begin, about 1am in the morning today,
[01:49:55.999 --> 01:50:07.445]  I saw a story about the anarchist activity with them hitting people and stuff, and I had even commented that that seems like just classic brown shirt activity.
[01:50:07.445 --> 01:50:12.507]  Oh, I had anarchists come up and bump into me and try to start fights, and they'd always have a news camera nearby.
[01:50:12.507 --> 01:50:18.571]  They were working with the news media, and they came up and shouted, kill Michelle Malkin, to set me up, and then laughed about it and left with her.
[01:50:18.571 --> 01:50:20.752]  These people are sick.
[01:50:20.752 --> 01:50:23.213]  Oh yeah, and half of them aren't even anarchists, they're just
[01:50:24.022 --> 01:50:26.723]  Agents that go out there and try to make everyone else look bad.
[01:50:26.723 --> 01:50:28.123]  Most of them are police informants.
[01:50:28.123 --> 01:50:28.663]  It's come out.
[01:50:28.663 --> 01:50:33.405]  It's confirmed.
[01:50:33.405 --> 01:50:33.785]  Stay there.
[01:50:33.785 --> 01:50:34.765]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:50:34.765 --> 01:50:36.126]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:50:36.126 --> 01:50:40.767]  Then we've got Taylor, Kent, Laura and others.
[01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.607]  We're going to get Tommy Cryer on about 15 after.
[01:50:46.826 --> 01:50:48.687]  In the hour after that, I want everybody to tune in.
[01:50:48.687 --> 01:50:54.931]  I want you to hear what's happening to the people that have been kicked out of their homes, their apartments, who are trying to work just to get another apartment.
[01:50:54.931 --> 01:50:56.092]  They're not going to let them do that.
[01:50:56.092 --> 01:50:57.312]  They're going to take them to a FEMA camp.
[01:50:57.312 --> 01:50:57.873]  They already are.
[01:50:57.873 --> 01:50:58.773]  They're taking their children.
[01:50:58.773 --> 01:50:59.594]  They're taking their cars.
[01:50:59.594 --> 01:51:05.397]  Stay with us.
[01:51:05.397 --> 01:51:06.558]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[01:51:06.946 --> 01:51:11.890]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:18.115]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[01:51:18.115 --> 01:51:20.777]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[01:51:20.777 --> 01:51:23.739]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[01:51:23.739 --> 01:51:27.342]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you!
[01:51:28.286 --> 01:51:29.307]  Not.
[01:51:29.307 --> 01:51:34.109]  Get the T. Change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy.

[01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:07.755]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.755 --> 01:52:13.020]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.627 --> 01:52:20.108]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.108 --> 01:52:22.089]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.089 --> 01:52:24.549]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.549 --> 01:52:37.732]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.732 --> 01:52:39.413]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.413 --> 01:52:40.773]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.269 --> 01:52:48.176]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.176 --> 01:52:56.445]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.445 --> 01:52:58.026]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.026 --> 01:52:59.228]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.647 --> 01:53:07.830]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:14.253]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:53:14.253 --> 01:53:19.976]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:53:19.976 --> 01:53:22.417]  Starve or surrender.
[01:53:22.417 --> 01:53:26.759]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:53:26.759 --> 01:53:27.640]  What then?
[01:53:30.353 --> 01:53:33.435]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:53:33.435 --> 01:53:37.779]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[01:53:37.779 --> 01:53:40.641]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[01:53:40.641 --> 01:53:47.866]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[01:53:47.866 --> 01:53:49.768]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:49.768 --> 01:53:55.192]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.

[01:53:57.894 --> 01:53:58.694]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:54:02.153 --> 01:54:06.418]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the second segment of the next hour at 8 after.
[01:54:06.418 --> 01:54:10.182]  That's right, we do that first five minutes for stations that don't want to carry news.
[01:54:12.978 --> 01:54:16.539]  Continuing with your phone calls, I did want to put a plug in.
[01:54:16.539 --> 01:54:18.239]  I've been already two hours and I've plugged it.
[01:54:18.239 --> 01:54:22.321]  The Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen, the Obama deception.
[01:54:22.321 --> 01:54:24.281]  I'm telling you, it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[01:54:24.281 --> 01:54:26.682]  It shows how the bankers are setting up world government.
[01:54:26.682 --> 01:54:35.004]  Now Fox News, CNN, I'm going to cover that next hour, are admitting world government's being set up, world tax, but most of them are saying it's a good idea.
[01:54:36.365 --> 01:54:47.038]  So now your friends, your family, your neighbors that laughed at you can say, look, you can pull up a YouTube clip of Sean Hannity or any of these guys, CNN host too, admitting it all and say, now do you want the rest of the story?
[01:54:47.038 --> 01:54:53.205]  Do you want to see all the documents, the video clips, Kissinger admitting that they're going to use Obama to set up the New World Order, what the New World Order is,
[01:54:53.966 --> 01:54:56.867]  This is why they stole the $12.8 trillion.
[01:54:56.867 --> 01:54:58.387]  They're going to take that out of you in taxes.
[01:54:58.387 --> 01:55:01.348]  You think you're mad now losing your job or getting pay cuts, folks?
[01:55:01.348 --> 01:55:02.729]  It's only begun!
[01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:04.409]  And we cover their entire agenda.
[01:55:04.409 --> 01:55:07.270]  This is the one film to show anybody to wake them up.
[01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:08.870]  I'm telling you, people always keep saying, what's the one film?
[01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:09.530]  What's the one film?
[01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:11.031]  We made the one film.
[01:55:13.427 --> 01:55:16.750]  This is the one to expose the one.
[01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:19.152]  This is the Obama deception.
[01:55:19.152 --> 01:55:21.434]  The mask comes off, tyranny gets a facelift.
[01:55:21.434 --> 01:55:22.856]  It's Barack Obama.
[01:55:22.856 --> 01:55:26.779]  They put a black face on the New World Order as KRS-One says in the film.
[01:55:26.779 --> 01:55:27.180]  Get it?
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:33.786]  The hard copy DVD in the highest quality with all the extras and a nice color cover package to give friends and family so they'll watch it.
[01:55:34.326 --> 01:55:38.509]  Infowars.com to secure online safe shopping cart or bookstore or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:38.509 --> 01:55:38.849]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:55:49.933 --> 01:56:00.619]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:00.619 --> 01:56:11.245]  And you can watch it and download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, and you get the live TV show we do here for two hours every day, sometimes three or four hours, sometimes we do the whole show.
[01:56:11.245 --> 01:56:16.168]  Jason Burmas, all three hours, nine to midnight, PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcast with the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:18.246 --> 01:56:22.308]  So go get a membership there today and get all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, so much more.
[01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:23.629]  Five years coming up in April.
[01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:24.489]  I guess it is April now.
[01:56:24.489 --> 01:56:25.230]  It's almost five years.
[01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:26.370]  It was like April 10th or something.
[01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:28.351]  I forget that we launched it five years ago.
[01:56:28.351 --> 01:56:29.812]  So prisonplanet.tv.
[01:56:29.812 --> 01:56:35.215]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about that makes this show possible is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:40.066]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[01:56:40.066 --> 01:56:43.931]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest-operating storable foods company in the country.
[01:56:43.931 --> 01:56:47.055]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years.
[01:56:47.055 --> 01:56:50.660]  With the looming food shortages in the current economy, it is imperative that you make sure you
[01:56:51.621 --> 01:56:55.044]  And your family are prepared with non-GMO, good, clean, storable foods.
[01:56:55.044 --> 01:57:01.429]  I was on CNBC last night and saw the headline about how farmers just aren't putting in crops because they don't have credit and everything's breaking down.
[01:57:01.429 --> 01:57:02.690]  There will be a food shortage.
[01:57:02.690 --> 01:57:05.011]  Regardless of these crazy times, get prepared.
[01:57:05.011 --> 01:57:09.435]  eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or give them a call, get a free catalog.
[01:57:09.735 --> 01:57:10.135]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:10.135 --> 01:57:10.375]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:10.375 --> 01:57:19.561]  And one other sponsor I'll just go ahead and tell you about is Survivalist Seeds.
[01:57:19.561 --> 01:57:23.124]  SurvivalistSeeds, one word, dot com.
[01:57:23.124 --> 01:57:28.047]  Now you can grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free of the New World Order.
[01:57:28.047 --> 01:57:35.171]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced the price of their heirloom seeds at www.survivalistseeds.com.
[01:57:35.171 --> 01:57:35.912]  They now sell
[01:57:36.312 --> 01:57:36.732]  We're good.
[01:57:58.906 --> 01:58:03.228]  Seeds.com is how you survive the world economic collapse.
[01:58:03.228 --> 01:58:06.690]  Yeah, you need seeds, firearms, gold, silver, storable food.
[01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:08.231]  You are nuts!
[01:58:08.231 --> 01:58:09.311]  Nuts, nuts, nuts.
[01:58:09.311 --> 01:58:10.892]  And by the way, later in the next hour I'm going to talk about this.
[01:58:10.892 --> 01:58:16.014]  I have a lot of employees going to deposit their checks at their own banks, like Chase.
[01:58:16.014 --> 01:58:21.017]  And then, you know, they deposit a couple thousand dollar paycheck and they say, okay, I want a thousand of that out.
[01:58:21.017 --> 01:58:25.059]  And they even have already a thousand in their bank account because they want to go to a local coin shop or something.
[01:58:25.059 --> 01:58:26.439]  That's what happened yesterday to Rob.
[01:58:26.439 --> 01:58:27.780]  And they just go, no, you can't have your money.
[01:58:29.494 --> 01:58:31.616]  Even though they have it, and they go, I want to wire it out.
[01:58:31.616 --> 01:58:33.737]  No, the wire is broken.
[01:58:33.737 --> 01:58:35.058]  We're getting reports of this everywhere.
[01:58:35.058 --> 01:58:36.439]  Are you getting reports of this?
[01:58:36.439 --> 01:58:39.281]  Your call straight ahead as we start the third hour!
[01:58:39.281 --> 01:58:46.886]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.101 --> 01:58:52.782]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.782 --> 01:58:57.543]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.543 --> 01:59:00.484]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.484 --> 01:59:03.545]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.545 --> 01:59:08.247]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.427 --> 01:59:08.827]  We're good to go.
[01:59:28.263 --> 01:59:34.528]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.528 --> 01:59:38.130]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.

[01:59:39.651 --> 01:59:40.172]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.172 --> 01:59:41.533]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.877 --> 01:59:56.279]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.279 --> 02:00:05.505]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.505 --> 02:00:06.806]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.806 --> 02:00:08.587]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.587 --> 02:00:10.348]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.348 --> 02:00:11.929]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.929 --> 02:00:12.850]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:17.673]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.673 --> 02:00:21.736]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:27.099]  Alright, I'm all over the map, taking some more calls right now.
[02:00:27.099 --> 02:00:30.640]  Tommy Cryer, attorney-in-law, actually beat the IRS himself.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.982]  He's helped others beat the criminal organizations.
[02:00:32.982 --> 02:00:40.066]  Coming up in about 15 minutes, then we've got eyewitnesses to the tent cities, the CPS grabbing their children, joining us in studio.
[02:00:43.177 --> 02:00:52.399]  And there's a ton of other news coming up, more on the President bowing to the Queen, and then the being ordered around by Prince Philip, who hates black people on record on national television.
[02:00:52.399 --> 02:00:54.119]  CNN even commented on it.
[02:00:54.119 --> 02:00:56.100]  I mean, the humiliation of this nation never ends.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:59.600]  $12.8 trillion stolen by the bankers, that's the latest numbers.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.501]  That's $200 billion short of the entire GDP of the nation, 13 trillion.
[02:01:04.501 --> 02:01:07.262]  That's six months into the robbery.
[02:01:08.945 --> 02:01:10.846]  I mean, you gotta laugh or you'll cry, folks.
[02:01:10.846 --> 02:01:13.127]  It's just so ridiculous how criminal these people are.
[02:01:13.127 --> 02:01:16.208]  And the yuppies are still sucking their thumbs, acting cool.
[02:01:16.208 --> 02:01:17.468]  Let's go ahead and go back to David.
[02:01:17.468 --> 02:01:20.770]  You wanted to finish your point, sir.
[02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:21.470]  Hello?
[02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:24.851]  Yes, David, you were on the air worldwide.
[02:01:24.851 --> 02:01:27.553]  Alright, back to my main point.
[02:01:27.553 --> 02:01:33.195]  I'm actually going back to one of your prior stories about the coffins in Georgia.
[02:01:33.195 --> 02:01:38.537]  And it met with a lot of controversy, so I looked into it, pulled an all-nighter,
[02:01:38.945 --> 02:01:43.388]  And I actually found out your story to be true because I went to the patent website.
[02:01:43.388 --> 02:01:45.970]  A lot of people didn't really think to do that.
[02:01:45.970 --> 02:01:57.378]  But these coffins that are out in this middle of the field in Covington, they're miles and miles away from the storage facilities that are in Madison.
[02:01:57.378 --> 02:02:05.323]  And I went and I found the patent where it shows a picture of how a body is placed inside of these caskets is the terminology that they use.
[02:02:07.196 --> 02:02:16.424]  On the website for Vantage, it says vaults, but the word vault was never mentioned in the patent itself.
[02:02:19.691 --> 02:02:33.134]  Listeners send us video of Houston and Phoenix and all over the country massively expanding military cemeteries, putting in thousands and thousands of graves, huge vaults per facility.
[02:02:33.134 --> 02:02:35.535]  The big concrete ones that we've called the funeral director.
[02:02:35.535 --> 02:02:37.756]  They admit they're massively expanding all over.
[02:02:37.756 --> 02:02:38.956]  They say that's normal.
[02:02:38.956 --> 02:02:43.017]  On the separate deal of Georgia, people went and videotaped that.
[02:02:43.017 --> 02:02:44.237]  They got the name of the company.
[02:02:44.237 --> 02:02:47.058]  We went to the website of the big company.
[02:02:48.806 --> 02:02:52.532]  It admits that over a million of these from their company alone, it's a coffin liner.
[02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:54.514]  They like put rotten dead bodies inside of them.
[02:02:56.186 --> 02:03:01.110]  It's like a big giant plastic coffin, and they've got hundreds of thousands of them stored at one place in Georgia.
[02:03:01.110 --> 02:03:04.273]  People have gone out and interviewed the folks that are the caretakers.
[02:03:04.273 --> 02:03:05.354]  You can call the company.
[02:03:05.354 --> 02:03:07.295]  We called the company that sold them.
[02:03:07.295 --> 02:03:10.818]  It is for the Centers for Disease Control, owns them, is leasing that property.
[02:03:10.818 --> 02:03:11.999]  They've got them all over the nation.
[02:03:11.999 --> 02:03:13.561]  This is just one location.
[02:03:13.561 --> 02:03:20.607]  Yes, they are plastic coffin liners, and you can go to the company's website and buy some if you want to.
[02:03:20.607 --> 02:03:24.290]  And we wrote articles about it, and people live in denial, and so if they want to, go ahead.
[02:03:26.002 --> 02:03:44.750]  Oh yeah, yeah, and the terminology on the website, oddly enough, says vaults, but they're not that at all, and they're even, like, can be used as a cremation container, because it's made of those products that doesn't pollute the environment, and that itself makes it an international product.
[02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.410]  Well, good.
[02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:47.151]  I'm glad the government's there.
[02:03:47.151 --> 02:03:52.012]  I mean, we've had emergency managers on the show where they're calling counties, saying, well, we put mass graves in your county.
[02:03:52.012 --> 02:03:52.973]  I mean, this is confirmed.
[02:03:53.874 --> 02:03:55.795]  But I mean, the government cares for you, sir.
[02:03:55.795 --> 02:04:02.200]  They're giving the $12.8 trillion to the foreign bankers and raising all your taxes because they care, sir.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.801]  The FEMA camps love you.
[02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:05.762]  I mean, the government is good.
[02:04:05.762 --> 02:04:12.026]  Everything is fine, okay?
[02:04:12.026 --> 02:04:18.110]  And listen, Glenn, back next Monday, I've been so busy I haven't gotten time.
[02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:20.772]  I've done the research over and over again, but I want to do a two-hour presentation.
[02:04:20.772 --> 02:04:21.613]  By the way, Friday!
[02:04:22.876 --> 02:04:28.238]  Friday from noon to two, the middle two hours of the show.
[02:04:28.238 --> 02:04:44.966]  I'm going to do a two hour, live at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the radio, with video clips, documents, Miami Herald, Associated Press, Reuters, Houston Chronicle, Army documents, Congressional hearings, at the FEMA Camp Surreal, ahead of Beck
[02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:51.797]  Back on Monday is having popular mechanics on to debunk that they exist.
[02:04:51.797 --> 02:04:55.721]  So we're going to launch a preemptive strike in the InfoWars.
[02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:59.686]  All of you, once it goes viral on the web, we're going to write articles at the website.
[02:04:59.686 --> 02:05:00.226]  InfoWars.
[02:05:01.027 --> 02:05:08.371]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:12.913]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:05:12.913 --> 02:05:18.536]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:05:18.536 --> 02:05:25.599]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.

[02:05:31.443 --> 02:05:37.306]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:05:37.306 --> 02:05:42.750]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[02:05:53.196 --> 02:05:57.378]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.819 --> 02:06:13.703]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.703 --> 02:06:20.207]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.207 --> 02:06:22.168]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.168 --> 02:06:24.630]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.630 --> 02:06:35.377]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.825 --> 02:06:39.487]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.487 --> 02:06:41.349]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.349 --> 02:06:48.256]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.256 --> 02:06:56.525]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.525 --> 02:06:58.106]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.106 --> 02:06:59.288]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.730 --> 02:07:04.471]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[02:07:04.471 --> 02:07:08.911]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:13.232]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[02:07:13.232 --> 02:07:15.413]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[02:07:15.413 --> 02:07:20.193]  The Paclite is powered by a 9 volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[02:07:20.193 --> 02:07:27.095]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[02:07:27.095 --> 02:07:28.295]  One Florida customer says,
[02:07:28.775 --> 02:07:37.381]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[02:07:37.381 --> 02:07:42.044]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[02:07:42.044 --> 02:07:45.386]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.

[02:07:58.935 --> 02:08:05.959]  4448.
[02:08:05.959 --> 02:08:07.259]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.259 --> 02:08:09.020]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:10.781]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.781 --> 02:08:12.361]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.361 --> 02:08:13.942]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.942 --> 02:08:18.104]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.104 --> 02:08:20.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:08:21.349 --> 02:08:30.452]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.452 --> 02:08:40.534]  We are now simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the next hour and 51 minutes that we have left in transmission.
[02:08:40.534 --> 02:08:41.735]  Here's some of the headlines.
[02:08:41.735 --> 02:08:43.275]  Obama loves the Queen!
[02:08:43.275 --> 02:08:46.656]  This is so disgusting.
[02:08:46.656 --> 02:08:49.477]  I'm going to be covering this coming up in the next hour.
[02:08:51.678 --> 02:09:00.081]  Also, the Israelis' new Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for the second time back in power, says we may be forced to attack Iran.
[02:09:00.081 --> 02:09:02.582]  That's out of the Jerusalem Post.
[02:09:02.582 --> 02:09:02.882]  U.S.
[02:09:02.882 --> 02:09:04.522]  private sector access 742,000 jobs in the month of March.
[02:09:07.363 --> 02:09:09.905]  It was six hundred and something thousand the month before that.
[02:09:09.905 --> 02:09:11.267]  Five hundred and something thousand before that.
[02:09:11.267 --> 02:09:13.048]  Four hundred and something thousand the month before that.
[02:09:13.048 --> 02:09:14.289]  These are record job losses.
[02:09:14.289 --> 02:09:15.891]  That's out of Reuters.
[02:09:15.891 --> 02:09:21.196]  Financial rescue nears GDP, gross domestic product, as pledges the top 12.8 trillion.
[02:09:21.196 --> 02:09:27.021]  I know I keep talking about that, but I mean the magnitude of what's happening here is just staggering.
[02:09:28.897 --> 02:09:32.541]  This is approaching more than the whole country even makes of the money that's made.
[02:09:32.541 --> 02:09:35.785]  The entire nation taxes to the bankers.
[02:09:35.785 --> 02:09:41.831]  That's why they're announcing all these new taxes and we're rewriting the tax codes where you can't have exemptions for your house or education or anything else.
[02:09:42.955 --> 02:09:45.638]  I mean, Obama's such a liar.
[02:09:45.638 --> 02:09:51.003]  He said only taxes on people making over $125,000 apiece are totaled $250,000 a year.
[02:09:51.003 --> 02:09:51.964]  And it's everybody.
[02:09:51.964 --> 02:09:52.845]  Just get ready.
[02:09:52.845 --> 02:09:57.809]  Everything you got's going to the bankers, unless you just say, look, you're a pack of criminals, we're arresting you.
[02:09:57.809 --> 02:09:59.551]  But that won't happen, I'm sure.
[02:09:59.551 --> 02:10:01.553]  Okay, slavery's what you want then, fine.
[02:10:01.553 --> 02:10:03.235]  Because the world order doesn't exist, right?
[02:10:03.235 --> 02:10:04.256]  It's just all over the news now.
[02:10:05.814 --> 02:10:10.278]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play it for Tommy Cryer, attorney at law, and talk about it some with him.
[02:10:10.278 --> 02:10:13.861]  The clip of Sean Hannity, you have that video ready, guys?
[02:10:13.861 --> 02:10:19.385]  The clip of Sean Hannity talking about how world government's real, and how the conspiracy people were right.
[02:10:19.385 --> 02:10:23.609]  And they're all admitting we're right now, because see, now it's time to admit the world government.
[02:10:23.609 --> 02:10:26.872]  And Fox is now going to play the part of those a little bit against it, but maybe we need it.
[02:10:28.186 --> 02:10:32.208]  But then other Murdoch-owned companies, they're saying they're for it in Europe.
[02:10:32.208 --> 02:10:34.429]  And then the CNN and others, they're all for it.
[02:10:34.429 --> 02:10:37.310]  So that's now, are you for the world government or not for it?
[02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:40.971]  They denied it all these years so we couldn't build a resistance against it.
[02:10:40.971 --> 02:10:43.773]  And now Ann Coulter, in fact I forgot that clip.
[02:10:43.773 --> 02:10:47.194]  You can just Google it, I had it at home but I didn't bring it today.
[02:10:47.194 --> 02:10:49.555]  Ann Coulter endorses Ron Paul 2012.
[02:10:49.555 --> 02:10:51.176]  Get that clip ready for later.
[02:10:53.453 --> 02:10:55.754]  So, we'll be going over that.
[02:10:55.754 --> 02:10:58.496]  It's just getting too insane now.
[02:10:58.496 --> 02:11:02.198]  As all these years, I'm this dangerous crazy and none of this exists, and now, oh, it's all real!
[02:11:02.198 --> 02:11:04.279]  We love you!
[02:11:04.279 --> 02:11:08.361]  We'll tell you what's going on behind that.
[02:11:08.361 --> 02:11:11.142]  And then I've got a free speech issue article here.
[02:11:11.142 --> 02:11:12.743]  This is out of Fox News.
[02:11:12.743 --> 02:11:16.245]  Well, they posted an Associated Press article on Fox News.
[02:11:16.245 --> 02:11:19.267]  Special Olympics launches campaign to ban the word retard.
[02:11:20.410 --> 02:11:22.912]  All that means is retarded.
[02:11:22.912 --> 02:11:24.392]  They have retardation.
[02:11:24.392 --> 02:11:32.057]  That's like the word Negro now has been termed a racial slang.
[02:11:32.057 --> 02:11:33.118]  Anglo-Negro.
[02:11:34.574 --> 02:11:36.456]  In Europe, you get arrested.
[02:11:36.456 --> 02:11:37.217]  You can Google this.
[02:11:37.217 --> 02:11:38.899]  This is the BBC headlines.
[02:11:38.899 --> 02:11:40.501]  They arrested Robin Page.
[02:11:40.501 --> 02:11:41.362]  We had him on.
[02:11:41.362 --> 02:11:48.810]  The BBC presenter, one man and his dog, where he goes to different towns hiking each week and interviews people.
[02:11:48.810 --> 02:11:51.113]  He gave a speech to a rural affairs group and said,
[02:11:52.034 --> 02:11:56.556]  Rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[02:11:56.556 --> 02:11:59.957]  And they said, we believe that word was meant to hurt feelings.
[02:11:59.957 --> 02:12:03.598]  The scientific term scares people, heterosexual, homosexual.
[02:12:03.598 --> 02:12:04.959]  So we're going to ban that word.
[02:12:04.959 --> 02:12:05.899]  And he was arrested.
[02:12:05.899 --> 02:12:07.759]  That was in the news.
[02:12:07.759 --> 02:12:10.100]  The BBC agreed with it and said we may have to fire him.
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:13.882]  This is very evil to say the word homosexual.
[02:12:13.882 --> 02:12:17.723]  Well, because some ignorant people use the term retard to be mean.
[02:12:19.789 --> 02:12:22.271]  Now they want to ban that, but this is only to set the precedent.
[02:12:22.271 --> 02:12:27.836]  First, you can't deny that six million Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone.
[02:12:27.836 --> 02:12:30.598]  Certainly Hitler was bad, killed a lot of Jews, a lot of other people.
[02:12:30.598 --> 02:12:32.959]  It was in the millions, there's no doubting that.
[02:12:32.959 --> 02:12:36.983]  But see, the Soviets exaggerated and said six million at Auschwitz.
[02:12:36.983 --> 02:12:40.065]  And then it came out that, well, no, not Auschwitz, six million total.
[02:12:40.065 --> 02:12:45.149]  And so that original piece of information is what caused the larger debate.
[02:12:46.496 --> 02:12:51.958]  Well, you say that in most areas of Europe, you get arrested, and I mean, some people serve 20, 30 year sentences.
[02:12:51.958 --> 02:12:54.239]  They've grabbed Ernst Zundel, they've grabbed a bunch of other people.
[02:12:54.239 --> 02:12:59.901]  And whether you love those people or hate them, they have a right under free speech in any free society to say that.
[02:12:59.901 --> 02:13:04.803]  But we always explain to you, it's going to expand into other things, and it's going to come to the United States.
[02:13:05.763 --> 02:13:09.244]  And once that precedent's set with these hate laws, they can shut everything down.
[02:13:09.244 --> 02:13:14.466]  You know, I have a right to tell some Nazis saying they want to kill black people that that's disgusting and wrong.
[02:13:14.466 --> 02:13:21.349]  I have a right when we've had black Israelites call in, and it's a diverse group, but some of them are flat out racist, and saying I'm a devil man because I'm white.
[02:13:21.349 --> 02:13:24.090]  And I can say you're an idiot racist.
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.651]  I have my right to counter him and say he's wrong.
[02:13:28.208 --> 02:13:29.428]  So this is very, very dangerous.
[02:13:29.428 --> 02:13:30.789]  I want to get into some of that.
[02:13:30.789 --> 02:13:34.490]  Special Olympics launches campaign to ban the word retard.
[02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:47.154]  Associated Press, the Special Olympics launched a campaign Thursday to banish the word retard as a casual insult that derives from an out-of-favor medical term that has long been considered inappropriate.
[02:13:47.154 --> 02:13:56.137]  See, they just make everything homosexual, heterosexual, retarded, retardation.
[02:13:56.137 --> 02:13:56.657]  Can't say it.
[02:13:58.390 --> 02:14:05.214]  People signed pledges not to use the word, and students gathered to denounce its use at rallies from Florida to Alaska.
[02:14:05.214 --> 02:14:14.059]  Over the long term, organizations hope to change attitudes about people and mental disabilities who number more than 190 million worldwide, according to World Health Organization.
[02:14:14.059 --> 02:14:17.701]  I mean, do you have some punk kids that make fun of mentally retarded children?
[02:14:17.701 --> 02:14:18.322]  Medical term.
[02:14:18.322 --> 02:14:21.844]  Ooh, I said mentally retarded.
[02:14:21.844 --> 02:14:22.844]  Mentally disabled.
[02:14:22.844 --> 02:14:25.246]  And then, of course, that word won't be acceptable either.
[02:14:27.472 --> 02:14:34.579]  And this is all meant to make you self-censor and think about what you're saying and think about how you're bad when you're not meaning anything mean.
[02:14:34.579 --> 02:14:36.521]  This is all part of controlling language.
[02:14:36.521 --> 02:14:43.888]  And now they're saying they want to pass laws in Europe and they're teaching this in public schools that it's wrong to deny climate change, global warming.
[02:14:43.888 --> 02:14:47.512]  They call it climate denial and say it's like holocaust denial.
[02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:50.414]  So see, they say it sounds reasonable.
[02:14:50.414 --> 02:14:51.415]  Let's ban Nazis.
[02:14:52.739 --> 02:14:54.800]  But then they ban your group that isn't Nazi.
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:58.881]  See, you have to let the Nazis do what they're doing or you lose your rights.
[02:14:58.881 --> 02:15:01.442]  And this is enshrined in our Republic.
[02:15:01.442 --> 02:15:03.262]  I remember a story in World Net Daily.
[02:15:03.262 --> 02:15:06.083]  It was also in the Idaho mainstream newspapers.
[02:15:06.083 --> 02:15:08.964]  We had the lady on.
[02:15:08.964 --> 02:15:13.785]  And there was a black coach of the football team in front of the whole stadium.
[02:15:13.785 --> 02:15:19.107]  And the husband of the lady who was in the stands who got arrested
[02:15:20.279 --> 02:15:27.821]  He was there taking photos and they lost and the guy blew up and went up and started beating the photographer up.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:33.021]  No, the photographer was the wife, it was the husband in the stands.
[02:15:33.021 --> 02:15:47.763]  He jumps out, and the black guy says, uh, you know, you dumb white person, you dumb, uh, you know, and calls him honky and these other names, and so the guy goes and says the n-word back to him, so I can say honky, but I can't say the other.
[02:15:47.763 --> 02:15:51.144]  And he was arrested, and the police charged him with it.
[02:15:51.144 --> 02:15:53.004]  So see, this is what's going on, ladies.
[02:15:53.004 --> 02:15:55.744]  He was, by the way, choking the woman, it was on the news.
[02:15:55.744 --> 02:15:58.465]  But, you know, it's okay to physically assault somebody, just don't use that term.
[02:15:59.890 --> 02:16:05.912]  So this is the type of stuff we have that's going on here as they move ahead with this.
[02:16:05.912 --> 02:16:11.773]  And of course, they don't say don't take the mercury-filled shots that have caused mental retardation in millions of children.
[02:16:11.773 --> 02:16:12.794]  Don't do that.
[02:16:12.794 --> 02:16:13.954]  Keep giving them the shots.
[02:16:13.954 --> 02:16:16.115]  It's okay to give them HPV shot and they die.
[02:16:16.115 --> 02:16:19.036]  That's okay to kill kids with the vaccines.
[02:16:19.036 --> 02:16:23.597]  Just don't, once we brain damaged them, don't talk about how they're brain damaged.
[02:16:26.701 --> 02:16:28.962]  Instead of Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, it's all these ninnies.
[02:16:28.962 --> 02:16:32.462]  And it's re-education going on in the schools.
[02:16:32.462 --> 02:16:33.243]  Sensitivity training.
[02:16:33.243 --> 02:16:34.363]  It's brainwashing.
[02:16:34.363 --> 02:16:38.644]  It actually makes people have notice of their differences.
[02:16:38.644 --> 02:16:43.965]  It's like, you know, so many of these other things they do.
[02:16:43.965 --> 02:16:46.726]  Where they tell you, oh, you can't have a Ron Paul sticker, you may be a terrorist.
[02:16:46.726 --> 02:16:48.306]  Meant to be a chilling effect.
[02:16:48.306 --> 02:16:50.506]  Meant to always make you think about what you're doing.
[02:16:50.506 --> 02:16:52.387]  Then they tie it in with white supremacist and things.
[02:16:53.373 --> 02:16:54.654]  This is the tactics they're using.
[02:16:54.654 --> 02:17:05.004]  Okay, without further ado, for the rest of the hour, and we will take some calls later in the hour, Tommy Cryer, throughout the 15th of this month, every day or so, we're going to have guests on.
[02:17:05.004 --> 02:17:11.250]  Joe Bannister, Treasury agent who exposed the IRS was a big scam, and they tried to indict him and arrest him, and he beat him in court.
[02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:13.473]  I mean, just for speaking out, they did this.
[02:17:13.473 --> 02:17:15.535]  People in prison, like
[02:17:19.124 --> 02:17:29.390]  Well, Mr. Schiff's father, you've got Peter Schiff, and then you've got his father in jail, for writing a book about the IRS.
[02:17:29.390 --> 02:17:30.811]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[02:17:30.811 --> 02:17:35.314]  We're going to be covering that here on the show in the next few weeks.
[02:17:35.314 --> 02:17:39.537]  And Tommy Cryer is an attorney at law who has successfully defeated the IRS in his own case.
[02:17:39.537 --> 02:17:41.618]  Mr. Cryer, it's great to have you here with us.
[02:17:41.618 --> 02:17:43.139]  Thanks, Alec, for having me on.
[02:17:43.139 --> 02:17:44.700]  I'm always glad to be here.
[02:17:45.570 --> 02:17:49.872]  Just briefly, before we go to break, tell folks about yourself, the basics of your case, and what we're dealing with here.
[02:17:49.872 --> 02:18:04.358]  Well, basically what got me involved or tangled up with the IRS was trying to save a friend who had quit filing because he said there was no law making him liable, and of course, having to file is tied to being liable first.
[02:18:04.358 --> 02:18:06.119]  And I told him it had to be there.
[02:18:06.119 --> 02:18:07.920]  Well, you know the rest of the story on that.
[02:18:09.325 --> 02:18:12.146]  And once I discovered that, I challenged the IRS.
[02:18:12.146 --> 02:18:22.609]  I said, I'll file if and when you can show me you have a right to any of my personal information, and if and when you show me you have a right to any of my personal earnings.
[02:18:22.609 --> 02:18:27.790]  And they still haven't been able to show me any of that, but what they decided to do was indict me.
[02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:33.811]  They said, well, we don't have any right, but we've got might, and we're going to show you our muscle.
[02:18:33.811 --> 02:18:35.812]  And in this one instance,
[02:18:36.713 --> 02:18:39.155]  I want to break down what the IRS really is.
[02:18:39.155 --> 02:18:41.956]  We didn't have this thing until 1913.
[02:18:41.956 --> 02:18:43.177]  And we built our country without it.
[02:19:04.679 --> 02:19:12.663]  And now it openly works for foreign banks that have stolen $12.8 trillion from the American people in less than six months.
[02:19:12.663 --> 02:19:13.924]  Yeah.
[02:19:13.924 --> 02:19:22.368]  And that's before you start applying any directional, you know, reserve impact.
[02:19:22.368 --> 02:19:26.730]  Now, you know, that's a lot of water in the soup pot.
[02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:33.233]  And so what does that do to working American families whose money is being watered down?
[02:19:33.957 --> 02:19:37.540]  And they're having trouble making ends meet as it is.
[02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:43.386]  And then you throw all of that extra water in the pot and then say, now try to make a living off of this watery soup.
[02:19:43.386 --> 02:19:45.348]  Yeah, we're going to talk about your IRS case.
[02:19:45.348 --> 02:19:49.712]  What's, you know, the fight to expose these collection agency from the private Federal Reserve.
[02:19:49.712 --> 02:19:51.473]  That's who you write your check to, the private Fed.
[02:19:51.473 --> 02:19:53.115]  It's so sick.
[02:19:53.115 --> 02:19:55.957]  Only the gullible people would buy this.
[02:19:55.957 --> 02:19:57.199]  But folks are starting to wake up.
[02:19:57.199 --> 02:19:58.480]  Tommy Cryer, stay there, my friend.

[02:21:07.552 --> 02:21:15.136]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.136 --> 02:21:21.719]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.719 --> 02:21:23.700]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:26.221]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.221 --> 02:21:37.166]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.779 --> 02:21:39.440]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.301]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.301 --> 02:21:48.226]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.226 --> 02:21:56.471]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.471 --> 02:21:58.052]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.052 --> 02:22:01.054]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.054 --> 02:22:07.258]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:15.823]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.823 --> 02:22:24.006]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:24.006 --> 02:22:29.089]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.089 --> 02:22:33.731]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.306 --> 02:22:38.647]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[02:22:38.647 --> 02:22:39.747]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.747 --> 02:22:44.248]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:22:49.149 --> 02:22:52.150]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:22:53.911 --> 02:22:54.151]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.138 --> 02:23:05.203]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[02:23:05.203 --> 02:23:07.106]  You are not alone.
[02:23:07.106 --> 02:23:09.970]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[02:23:09.970 --> 02:23:15.036]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[02:23:15.036 --> 02:23:16.779]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[02:23:17.159 --> 02:23:17.659]  I don't know.
[02:23:37.247 --> 02:23:46.415]  Restulex will help ease and comfort your restless legs within 24 hours and will allow you to go back to your regular routine without discomfort or embarrassment.

[02:24:08.793 --> 02:24:13.656]  You know we've been having a lot of false attacks and just the most outrageous lies you can imagine made up about us lately.
[02:24:13.656 --> 02:24:19.479]  There's people that are getting so upset by our success and it's given us record internet audience.
[02:24:19.479 --> 02:24:21.841]  We're hitting records we've never hit before.
[02:24:21.841 --> 02:24:26.643]  So I guess all weapons formed against us will be turned into blessings as they say.
[02:24:26.643 --> 02:24:29.065]  Ha ha!
[02:24:30.805 --> 02:24:33.467]  Come on, come on, come on, baby!
[02:24:33.467 --> 02:24:37.069]  Come on, come on, come on!
[02:24:37.069 --> 02:24:42.612]  I got you in a stranglehold, baby!
[02:24:42.612 --> 02:24:43.733]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:24:43.733 --> 02:24:45.494]  A huge news blitz next hour.
[02:24:45.494 --> 02:24:47.576]  I'm going to go through it all.
[02:24:47.576 --> 02:24:49.237]  Next segment, I'm going to play some short clips.
[02:24:50.314 --> 02:25:00.806]  Of Sean Hannity and others admitting world government is real, world takeover, that we the kooks were right, because we read documents, public documents, and study history.
[02:25:00.806 --> 02:25:04.611]  We got Ann Coulter saying Ron Paul was right.
[02:25:04.611 --> 02:25:06.132]  Just amazing stuff coming up.
[02:25:06.132 --> 02:25:08.836]  Tommy Cryer, just recap your case.
[02:25:08.836 --> 02:25:10.477]  You beat him, it made him hopping mad.
[02:25:11.218 --> 02:25:16.260]  We've got Larry Becraft and other serious constitutional lawyers like yourself who's been beating him successful.
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:33.505]  And the reason I like to have you on in this whole series of interviews we're doing, perhaps I'll have you on with Joe Bannister or something at the same time in the next few weeks when they're on, is that there's all these conspiracy kooks, who really are conspiracy kooks, who discredit us, who tell people all these lies and trust and get people put in prison.
[02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:39.687]  So, we don't want to tell people, this is like the Mafia, this is a big decision to decide to go up against these people.
[02:25:39.687 --> 02:25:45.709]  It's not a battle I've chosen, but I commend those that have the courage like yourself to do that.
[02:25:45.709 --> 02:25:56.553]  Jesse, before somebody does decide to go one-on-one, see, Truth Attack, the organization I formed to fight this beast and to do it in, is a coalition.
[02:25:56.553 --> 02:26:01.435]  It's not just a group of people, it's a coalition of a lot of organizations working together hand-in-hand now.
[02:26:02.156 --> 02:26:08.782]  That's what we need to do is to consolidate the movement instead of fighting against and with each other.
[02:26:08.782 --> 02:26:18.090]  And it offers a lot of things that people can do that actually does more damage to the beast than beating him in court.
[02:26:18.090 --> 02:26:26.657]  But if they do want to go one-on-one with the beast, they need to first go to TruthAttack.org and take the pre-induction physical there.
[02:26:27.247 --> 02:26:27.787]  We're good to go.
[02:26:52.082 --> 02:26:54.923]  Well, here's two examples I want you to speak to in your case specifically.
[02:26:54.923 --> 02:26:59.264]  We're going to get into a bunch of other issues with Tommy Cryer, our guest, attorney-at-law.
[02:27:21.843 --> 02:27:25.147]  And it's this.
[02:27:25.147 --> 02:27:25.888]  Here's an example.
[02:27:25.888 --> 02:27:30.072]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:27:30.072 --> 02:27:31.814]  And then it goes on to the presser to assemble.
[02:27:32.782 --> 02:27:40.944]  But the government's regulating all the major religious institutions, and if they don't go get a license from them, they're taxed, but you can make no law.
[02:27:40.944 --> 02:27:41.865]  So they're breaking the law there.
[02:27:41.865 --> 02:27:43.165]  Well, same thing with the IRS.
[02:27:43.165 --> 02:27:52.528]  When they make you fill out those IRS forms under threat of arrest, they're compelling you to violate your own Fifth Amendment to self-incrimination.
[02:27:52.528 --> 02:28:00.210]  And your Fourth Amendment right to be private in your personal information.
[02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:01.150]  So speak to that, sir.
[02:28:02.048 --> 02:28:11.818]  Basically, what they've done is they've used a tax that is intended to cover foreign commerce.
[02:28:11.818 --> 02:28:20.106]  In other words, non-resident aliens and foreign corporations doing business in the United States, and they have tricked, through the use of
[02:28:21.842 --> 02:28:25.344]  Clever language and very clever drafting.
[02:28:25.344 --> 02:28:26.264]  It gives impressions.
[02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:29.146]  You have to put two parts together to understand it.
[02:28:29.146 --> 02:28:32.948]  They usually separate them, put them in different boxes.
[02:28:32.948 --> 02:28:42.412]  And what they've done is they have just sold people on a rule of law instead of the rule of law.
[02:28:42.412 --> 02:28:44.273]  And this allows them.
[02:28:44.273 --> 02:28:47.235]  It's more about control than it is about money even.
[02:28:47.891 --> 02:28:48.591]  I love that!
[02:28:48.591 --> 02:28:49.612]  It's a rule of law.
[02:28:49.612 --> 02:28:50.452]  You're right.
[02:28:50.452 --> 02:28:56.715]  Under the IRS system, they've now set up family courts that are outside the Constitution, no due process, don't have juries.
[02:28:56.715 --> 02:29:03.079]  They've set up all these other new environmental courts so Monsanto can poison things, but it's their own federal court that isn't exactly.
[02:29:03.079 --> 02:29:12.383]  They're converting the whole system from liberty to tyranny, from due process to Napoleonic law, through the envelope of the IRS fraud.
[02:29:12.383 --> 02:29:14.144]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:14.144 --> 02:29:15.545]  And they're using the network
[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:20.270]  Supposedly, you're canvassing for liability and collecting taxes.
[02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:29.777]  In order to maintain a 24-7, 365 monitoring of every one of our activities.
[02:29:29.777 --> 02:29:31.518]  Particularly our financial activities.
[02:29:51.712 --> 02:29:54.714]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.714 --> 02:30:01.638]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.638 --> 02:30:02.999]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[02:30:02.999 --> 02:30:09.584]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[02:30:09.584 --> 02:30:11.425]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[02:30:16.326 --> 02:30:25.731]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[02:30:25.731 --> 02:30:32.115]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:32.115 --> 02:30:35.716]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[02:30:35.716 --> 02:30:39.859]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:46.886 --> 02:30:49.829]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.112 --> 02:31:13.994]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.994 --> 02:31:20.496]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.496 --> 02:31:22.477]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.477 --> 02:31:24.917]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:24.917 --> 02:31:35.821]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.118 --> 02:31:39.780]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.641]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:48.547]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:48.547 --> 02:31:56.814]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:56.814 --> 02:31:58.396]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.396 --> 02:31:59.597]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.548 --> 02:32:06.070]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:11.172]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:32:11.172 --> 02:32:12.673]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:12.673 --> 02:32:16.274]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:32:16.274 --> 02:32:21.697]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:32:21.697 --> 02:32:27.459]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:32:27.799 --> 02:32:30.300]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:32.841]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:32:36.462 --> 02:32:37.642]  No animal testing.
[02:32:37.642 --> 02:32:38.983]  I use them and love them.
[02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.883]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:32:40.883 --> 02:32:42.284]  And I save big time.
[02:32:42.284 --> 02:32:43.524]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:32:43.524 --> 02:32:43.764]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:32:53.767 --> 02:32:56.450]  Again that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:33:21.365 --> 02:33:23.348]  No, I've played some of these clips, but not all of them.
[02:33:23.348 --> 02:33:24.409]  I want to play three clips.
[02:33:24.409 --> 02:33:30.918]  Michael Savage saying he believes Obama will stage a massive terror attack on the United States and bring in martial law.
[02:33:30.918 --> 02:33:32.561]  Absolutely accurate.
[02:33:32.561 --> 02:33:34.483]  Suddenly he's saying we're right.
[02:33:34.483 --> 02:33:37.507]  Fox News saying they're setting up global government, global currency.
[02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:41.630]  Sean Hannity, unbelievable.
[02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:44.830]  We got Ann Coulter endorsing Ron Paul for 2012 as president.
[02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:45.791]  What is going on here?
[02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:47.891]  We're going to cover that a little bit later.
[02:33:47.891 --> 02:33:51.192]  So call everybody you know, tell them to tune in on the local AM or FM affiliate you're listening to.
[02:33:51.192 --> 02:33:52.892]  It does come up in about 10 minutes.
[02:33:52.892 --> 02:33:55.813]  Tell them to listen on the internet at infowars.com.
[02:33:55.813 --> 02:33:56.973]  I want folks to hear this.
[02:33:56.973 --> 02:34:00.274]  Call your mainline neocon friends that tell you you're a kook right now.
[02:34:01.494 --> 02:34:02.154]  Tell them to tune in.
[02:34:02.154 --> 02:34:04.056]  They go to Infowars.com, click on there.
[02:34:04.056 --> 02:34:05.577]  No matter where they are, they've got internet.
[02:34:05.577 --> 02:34:07.918]  They can listen on their cell phone at Flycast.
[02:34:07.918 --> 02:34:09.799]  And tell them, I mean, they need to see this.
[02:34:09.799 --> 02:34:10.900]  This is everywhere.
[02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:13.261]  Why have they suddenly admitted we're right?
[02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:13.922]  That's coming up.
[02:34:13.922 --> 02:34:17.524]  Okay, Tommy Cryer, attorney at law, beat the IRS.
[02:34:17.524 --> 02:34:20.866]  In a nutshell, boil down how you beat them with the jury.
[02:34:20.866 --> 02:34:22.727]  That's why they want to phase those out.
[02:34:22.727 --> 02:34:27.690]  How they drag other people into these fake IRS courts and try to get them to plea bargain without ever seeing a jury.
[02:34:27.690 --> 02:34:29.191]  And some of the basic scams they run.
[02:34:31.172 --> 02:34:31.933]  I don't know.
[02:34:31.933 --> 02:34:33.674]  I don't know.
[02:35:00.075 --> 02:35:08.380]  I was under a legal duty to file tax returns, and that eliminated willfulness on my part.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.962]  Now, they didn't have to decide whether I owed a tax or not.
[02:35:10.962 --> 02:35:15.425]  They didn't have to decide whether I was required to file a return, but they were astute enough.
[02:35:15.425 --> 02:35:26.932]  It's hard to find a jury like that, but I was able, apparently, to articulate what I had discovered, and they could see where that was my genuine belief.
[02:35:26.932 --> 02:35:28.773]  It's very difficult to convince a jury.
[02:35:29.552 --> 02:35:33.874]  That you believe that the earth is round when everybody knows that it's flat.
[02:35:33.874 --> 02:35:38.315]  Now what did the prosecutors do when they were defeated?
[02:35:38.315 --> 02:35:41.337]  Did it look like they had been hit in the stomach with a baseball bat?
[02:35:41.337 --> 02:35:46.618]  Well, everybody, they had a whole bunch of guys from the IRS in the courtroom to hear the verdict.
[02:35:46.618 --> 02:35:47.819]  And they just vanished.
[02:35:47.819 --> 02:35:49.139]  They evaporated.
[02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:50.180]  Nobody even saw them go out.
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:52.021]  They went out so fast.
[02:35:52.021 --> 02:35:53.321]  But the prosecutor did.
[02:35:53.321 --> 02:35:55.622]  I walked over and we shook hands.
[02:35:55.622 --> 02:35:57.062]  He was doing his job.
[02:35:57.062 --> 02:35:58.463]  He was working for his master.
[02:35:59.375 --> 02:36:00.737]  I don't think so.
[02:36:13.911 --> 02:36:15.352]  Now let's talk about Joe Bannister.
[02:36:15.352 --> 02:36:16.453]  This is a treasury agent.
[02:36:16.453 --> 02:36:23.418]  Here's DB Kidd on a mainstream radio show in the Bay Area of Central California, San Francisco.
[02:36:23.418 --> 02:36:25.800]  He pulls over, writes notes for an hour.
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:26.861]  He's going to disprove her.
[02:36:26.861 --> 02:36:31.204]  He's going to show she's a criminal, lying about it being a collection agency for the private bank.
[02:36:31.204 --> 02:36:32.625]  He does two years of research.
[02:36:32.625 --> 02:36:34.506]  Recapping, we flew out there to interview him first.
[02:36:34.506 --> 02:36:35.587]  We're proud of him.
[02:36:35.587 --> 02:36:39.830]  He and I are so parallel, Alex, it's not even funny.
[02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:42.012]  Both of us were setting out to debunk this.
[02:36:42.572 --> 02:36:46.174]  Both of us spent two years pouring into it to find out why.
[02:36:46.174 --> 02:36:59.780]  It didn't take long to see that there was no liability provision, but it takes a long time to dig all the way back to the 13th century and all the way back forward and study all the constitutional issues and authorities and understand why and how they did it.
[02:37:00.543 --> 02:37:07.809]  But the issue is, he was still even paying taxes for years as he went around the country exposing them, because he knew how criminal they were.
[02:37:07.809 --> 02:37:16.215]  So they still indicted him for teaching people this, just like they did with Mr. Schiff, Erwin Schiff.
[02:37:16.215 --> 02:37:17.916]  So, I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:37:17.916 --> 02:37:19.858]  That's another example of their tyranny.
[02:37:19.858 --> 02:37:24.742]  Another example, like for example, I was listening in before you introduced me.
[02:37:25.422 --> 02:37:37.664]  And you referred to the Holocaust denial, and they put people in prison for just saying there weren't six million, there were maybe five million, or there were maybe four million, and they're putting people in prison for saying that, hey, what about the head count?
[02:37:37.664 --> 02:37:42.245]  Maybe the head count was wrong, as if that's injuring somebody.
[02:37:42.245 --> 02:37:43.325]  It's the same thing here.
[02:37:43.325 --> 02:37:49.826]  If you tell the truth, they're going to lock you away, or now their favorite is what they call 6,700 abusive tax shelters.
[02:37:53.584 --> 02:37:55.185]  That there's no law that makes them liable.
[02:37:55.185 --> 02:38:09.690]  If you tell people that there's no basis for their treating your gross receipts in exchange for your labor any differently from Exxon's gross receipts, they don't tax them on 100% of what they take in, how they tax you on 100%.
[02:38:09.690 --> 02:38:12.291]  So, it's only the profit, right?
[02:38:12.291 --> 02:38:18.594]  So, if you deny that, then they come in and say, that's an abusive tax shelter just for telling people the truth.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:22.540]  Well, briefly back to the Holocaust thing.
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:24.281]  They put a gag order against you.
[02:38:24.281 --> 02:38:25.461]  Now, is that First Amendment?
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:26.861]  I mean, do we have freedom of speech here?
[02:38:26.861 --> 02:38:30.862]  Well, that's what I'm trying to say is, I'm not wading into the whole Holocaust debate.
[02:38:30.862 --> 02:38:33.903]  Clearly Hitler killed a bunch of Jews.
[02:38:33.903 --> 02:38:36.443]  The point that you made was dead on.
[02:38:36.443 --> 02:38:36.943]  Exactly!
[02:38:36.943 --> 02:38:38.843]  Do we have a First Amendment or not?
[02:38:38.843 --> 02:38:40.224]  I mean, exactly.
[02:38:40.224 --> 02:38:42.944]  Do we have a First Amendment or not?
[02:38:42.944 --> 02:38:43.704]  We have one.
[02:38:43.704 --> 02:38:44.485]  Where does it go?
[02:38:47.279 --> 02:38:48.640]  All of this, you mentioned too, the 1913.
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:53.983]  1913, this isn't just about the income tax.
[02:38:53.983 --> 02:39:02.768]  The income tax of 1913, 16th Amendment, 17th Amendment, cutting the arms off of all the states.
[02:39:02.768 --> 02:39:07.771]  You know, kicking them out where they had no representation in Congress anymore.
[02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:11.773]  And, above all, the Federal Reserve Act.
[02:39:11.773 --> 02:39:13.654]  Everything works hand in glove.
[02:39:14.198 --> 02:39:16.784]  They're siphoning off the wealth of the middle class.
[02:39:16.784 --> 02:39:19.570]  We're only going to have two classes in this country.
[02:39:19.570 --> 02:39:23.658]  We're going to have the rich, powerful ruling class and we're going to have the peasants.
[02:39:24.352 --> 02:39:29.854]  And by the way, the ultra-rich are now even robbing the nouveau riche while leaving their big Swiss accounts alone.
[02:39:29.854 --> 02:39:37.076]  The ultra-elite literally are just robbing everyone, including the middle class, the upper middle class, so no one can resist them.
[02:39:37.076 --> 02:39:42.697]  They're using the tyranny of poverty as a control mechanism in the UN Club of Rome.
[02:39:42.697 --> 02:39:45.218]  They all brag that's their system, shifting gears into the...
[02:39:45.778 --> 02:39:58.022]  Those that control the private IRS here and over in England, I mean, they're openly announcing world government saying all our money is going to be paid on interest to private banks for bailing them out.
[02:39:58.022 --> 02:40:00.523]  People, you think it's bad?
[02:40:00.523 --> 02:40:13.787]  Bailing out is, and I'm not taking away from the sexual on this particular analogy, but what we are witnessing in front of God and everybody is a huge
[02:40:15.749 --> 02:40:16.970]  I've got a question for you.
[02:40:36.124 --> 02:40:37.084]  Yeah, they're butchering us.
[02:40:37.084 --> 02:40:46.768]  They're just stealing everything forever, bankrupting it, and then hoarding it all, while saying, quote, headline, uh, you know, world leaders are desperate to fix things.
[02:40:46.768 --> 02:40:47.669]  World leaders.
[02:40:47.669 --> 02:40:49.909]  He found the exact headline, uh, here.
[02:40:49.909 --> 02:40:52.991]  Uh... Well, we're trying to do something about that.
[02:40:52.991 --> 02:40:59.353]  And, uh, if I can mention that we've got Operation Stop Thieves scheduled for, uh, this April 15th.
[02:40:59.353 --> 02:41:04.095]  Already, we have Stop Thieves, uh, groups registered on TruthDetect.org.
[02:41:04.716 --> 02:41:05.277]  We're good to go.
[02:41:26.252 --> 02:41:27.153]  That's a good analogy.
[02:41:27.153 --> 02:41:34.318]  Well, the elites see them as cattle, so we're there trying to feed them red pills so they go from being cattle back to human beings.
[02:41:34.318 --> 02:41:35.499]  Now, here it is.
[02:41:35.499 --> 02:41:39.162]  Desperate world leaders meet on Economic Woes AP.
[02:41:39.162 --> 02:41:46.648]  Desperate but divided on ways to lift their nations from economic misery, world leaders converge for an emergency summit Tuesday holding scant hopes of
[02:41:46.988 --> 02:41:48.609]  Finding a magic bullet solution.
[02:41:48.609 --> 02:41:50.490]  See, they say it's only going to get worse.
[02:41:50.490 --> 02:41:57.593]  But their solution, when you read further, is a world government ruled by the banks that you pay your carbon taxes to, Tommy Cryer.
[02:41:57.593 --> 02:42:00.175]  Their solution is more problem.
[02:42:00.175 --> 02:42:02.036]  You know, the problem is the government.
[02:42:02.036 --> 02:42:03.637]  And so they want to have more problem.
[02:42:03.637 --> 02:42:06.678]  It's kind of like when they were bleeding George Washington.
[02:42:06.678 --> 02:42:09.260]  You know, we've bled him three times and he just keeps getting weaker.
[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:11.901]  Let's bleed him again.
[02:42:11.901 --> 02:42:12.941]  And he died.
[02:42:16.533 --> 02:42:18.434]  You know that's what's going to happen to us.
[02:42:18.434 --> 02:42:20.876]  Our way of life is going to die.
[02:42:20.876 --> 02:42:25.580]  Our freedom is already withered on the branch and it's falling off.
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:37.389]  I'm in a state of angst over this and I have never seen the American people more angst ridden, more anxious, more dreading.
[02:42:38.524 --> 02:42:47.729]  I don't know if you recall this or not, but the Cuban Missile Crisis is the last time I've seen people this frightened, this concerned.
[02:42:48.749 --> 02:42:55.775]  Well, they better be, because the elite terrorized people, said the markets were in trouble, said we were going to have a depression.
[02:42:55.775 --> 02:42:57.056]  Everything plunged.
[02:42:57.056 --> 02:43:05.103]  They got unlimited money, and then they hoard it, and then cut off liquidity on cars, loans, homes, everything, by design.
[02:43:05.103 --> 02:43:10.928]  And it's even coming out in the major press that they're making money off this, that this is their consolidation.
[02:43:11.803 --> 02:43:17.184]  Well, not only that, but they're cutting what our little take is on the share crop.
[02:43:17.184 --> 02:43:19.765]  They're share cropping us, but they're cutting our share.
[02:43:19.765 --> 02:43:27.486]  And the way they do it is, when I started working, Alex, the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour.
[02:43:27.486 --> 02:43:32.627]  Now, back then, that $1.60 was backed up with silver still.
[02:43:32.627 --> 02:43:36.008]  However, right now, people's minimum wage is $0.21 an hour.
[02:43:39.301 --> 02:43:43.743]  People think it's 5 something, but an FRN is only worth about 4 cents.
[02:43:43.743 --> 02:43:46.105]  They're working for 21 cents an hour, as opposed to $1.60 40 years ago. $1.60.
[02:44:06.776 --> 02:44:08.577]  Yeah, about now.
[02:44:08.577 --> 02:44:13.180]  If you multiply it, the factor is 20 to 1.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:18.543]  So actually, back then I was making the equivalent today on minimum wage.
[02:44:18.543 --> 02:44:20.223]  I was making the equivalent today of 1.6 times 20.
[02:44:20.223 --> 02:44:21.964]  So you're making 30 bucks?
[02:44:21.964 --> 02:44:23.885]  I'm making 32 bucks an hour.
[02:44:27.111 --> 02:44:29.273]  Okay, $32 an hour.
[02:44:29.273 --> 02:44:32.935]  That's what inflation, so we've had this gradual inflation that was bad enough.
[02:44:32.935 --> 02:44:37.118]  We've really had no inflation, Alex, because I've got a silver dollar in my pocket.
[02:44:37.118 --> 02:44:39.180]  It was minted in 1923.
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:43.763]  I've carried it in my pocket as slick as a whistle, because I've carried it for 50 years.
[02:44:43.763 --> 02:44:48.386]  But, in 1923, the day it was minted, it would have bought 10 loaves of bread.
[02:44:48.386 --> 02:44:52.289]  Right now, you could take that same silver dollar and probably buy 15 loaves of bread.
[02:44:53.447 --> 02:44:54.967]  No, exactly what I said.
[02:44:54.967 --> 02:44:58.148]  Inflation, I meant the Federal Reserve Private Banking Unit.
[02:44:58.148 --> 02:45:05.930]  I understand what you mean, but if we would take a look at the dollar, a dollar is still, by a dollar's worth, at least.
[02:45:05.930 --> 02:45:08.810]  And, you know, what we're looking at is play money.
[02:45:08.810 --> 02:45:11.791]  You can't inflate money that has no value.
[02:45:11.791 --> 02:45:14.251]  All you can do is dilute it.
[02:45:14.251 --> 02:45:15.312]  And that's what we're seeing.
[02:45:15.312 --> 02:45:21.433]  They keep pouring water in the soup pot, water in the soup pot, and now you can see the bottom of the pot, and they're saying live off of that.
[02:45:23.197 --> 02:45:30.082]  We're like slaves that have been given out our rations, and the rations keep having more water and less soup.
[02:45:30.082 --> 02:45:40.951]  Well, no, that's true, but the bankers up front, when they're first devaluing, they buy real assets with the money they create out of nothing, and then now they're even trying to reduce the amount of reduced soup we get.
[02:45:40.951 --> 02:45:50.458]  And that same power that you're talking about, just acquired by taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, just acquired mortgages over half of America's households.
[02:45:53.166 --> 02:45:55.407]  Is it just me or is this scary?
[02:45:55.407 --> 02:45:59.347]  Well, did you see Obama seize basically General Motors?
[02:45:59.347 --> 02:46:00.708]  He fired the director.
[02:46:00.708 --> 02:46:02.228]  He said, you get out of there.
[02:46:02.228 --> 02:46:03.408]  You didn't do what I want.
[02:46:03.408 --> 02:46:08.829]  And now he's going to have that go under government and private banking control that controls him.
[02:46:08.829 --> 02:46:12.070]  And he's saying they may start seizing other companies, not just banks.
[02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:19.151]  So this is openly with the government acting as the thug for the bankers to just come out and grab everything.
[02:46:19.591 --> 02:46:40.398]  Exactly, and what we're going from, we've seen the transition of fascism with this unholy marriage of big business and big government, but now big government is starting to eat its partner, because the real master over these two is the Federal Reserve, and the bankers behind it.
[02:46:40.871 --> 02:46:42.472]  And the bankers are offshore.
[02:46:42.472 --> 02:46:45.054]  They don't care if they destroy Europe and the United States.
[02:46:45.054 --> 02:46:46.215]  That gives them the power.
[02:46:46.215 --> 02:46:50.719]  They're looking at their world assets, the hard assets you were talking about.
[02:46:50.719 --> 02:46:54.422]  You couldn't be more correct in your analysis, Alex.
[02:46:54.422 --> 02:46:57.444]  They go out and they're not dealing in dollars that devalue.
[02:46:57.444 --> 02:47:01.327]  They're dealing in real assets that have value.
[02:47:01.327 --> 02:47:05.930]  And yet we're out here playing with this monopoly money and saying, ain't we rich?
[02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:06.871]  We'll print us some more.
[02:47:06.871 --> 02:47:07.652]  You know, we'll get richer.
[02:47:08.337 --> 02:47:09.418]  Exactly.
[02:47:09.418 --> 02:47:29.531]  And they're passing the more property taxes and franchise taxes and business taxes right here in Texas and the businesses are all going out of business and the globalists openly write white papers saying we want a post-industrial world where you're all poor people living in shacks and they live off on armored mountains with all the high technology and you know the high-tech health care and everything.
[02:47:29.531 --> 02:47:33.634]  This is a tool of military financial conquest.
[02:47:33.634 --> 02:47:37.897]  They want to hurt you in their own documents and that's what the public has to get.
[02:47:37.897 --> 02:47:38.157]  Go ahead.
[02:47:38.437 --> 02:47:39.117]  Absolutely.
[02:47:39.117 --> 02:47:54.246]  A couple of weeks ago, Truth In Tech issued a demand that they adopt a true stimulus plan to re-energize the economy by suspending the withholding and collection of the personal income tax.
[02:47:54.246 --> 02:47:56.027]  Like corporate, just personal.
[02:47:56.027 --> 02:48:01.550]  Start allowing some of the rest of the money earned by the households to go into those households.
[02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:05.992]  It would save a lot of these foreclosures that are going on in the first place.
[02:48:06.570 --> 02:48:15.816]  But because people are unable to buy goods, other people are going out of business or losing their jobs, and then they can't buy goods, and they can't pay for their homes.
[02:48:15.816 --> 02:48:18.538]  You've got more foreclosures, more layoffs.
[02:48:18.538 --> 02:48:22.881]  Well, you can reverse that trend real easy just by allowing people to keep their money.
[02:48:22.881 --> 02:48:27.725]  All these households, all of these boom, and then what happens whenever you've got the 30%?
[02:48:27.725 --> 02:48:32.308]  Is it being raked off the top of every state's gross domestic product every week?
[02:48:33.177 --> 02:48:33.498]  I think so.
[02:48:41.593 --> 02:48:42.973]  The local revenues go up.
[02:48:42.973 --> 02:48:45.514]  They don't need to borrow and pay money for the federal government.
[02:48:45.514 --> 02:48:46.534]  Yeah, let me back you up.
[02:48:46.534 --> 02:48:47.315]  Let me back you up.
[02:48:47.315 --> 02:48:50.296]  The federal revenues go up on the other 80 taxes that they have.
[02:48:50.296 --> 02:48:52.676]  But is that press release getting any coverage?
[02:48:52.676 --> 02:48:53.937]  Yeah, let me back you up on that.
[02:48:53.937 --> 02:48:54.537]  Not one.
[02:48:54.537 --> 02:48:55.877]  Not one picked it up.
[02:48:55.877 --> 02:48:58.938]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50% across the board.
[02:48:58.938 --> 02:49:01.799]  Tax revenues doubled.
[02:49:01.799 --> 02:49:03.500]  They've proved it too many times.
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:06.060]  Kennedy proved it.
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:06.780]  Didn't turn around.
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:07.821]  Reagan did the same thing.
[02:49:07.821 --> 02:49:08.341]  He proved it.
[02:49:09.911 --> 02:49:16.555]  To a lesser extent, George Bush I, with his lesser extent tax cut, proved it.
[02:49:16.555 --> 02:49:17.816]  Revenues go up.
[02:49:17.816 --> 02:49:21.378]  But let me just keep backing you up here because it's all true.
[02:49:21.378 --> 02:49:22.279]  It's about control.
[02:49:22.279 --> 02:49:22.999]  It isn't revenues.
[02:49:22.999 --> 02:49:25.681]  This is all fiat to them.
[02:49:25.681 --> 02:49:28.382]  It's done to bring in control, as you just said.
[02:49:28.382 --> 02:49:32.185]  But did you see the Wall Street Journal and all these articles analyzing what Obama said he's going to do?
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:34.341]  Well, I haven't seen that, I'm sorry.
[02:49:34.341 --> 02:49:34.901]  Mm-hmm.
[02:49:34.901 --> 02:49:36.263]  Well, that I've heard about.
[02:49:36.263 --> 02:49:37.143]  And I'm not at all surprised about.
[02:49:37.143 --> 02:49:38.104]  You know, you promised change, remember?
[02:49:38.104 --> 02:49:39.445]  Well, that's what we're going to have left.
[02:49:55.666 --> 02:49:57.928]  We're good to go.
[02:50:24.465 --> 02:50:26.693]  That's right, because it doesn't have any copper in it.
[02:50:26.693 --> 02:50:30.908]  Well, that aluminum beer tab is probably worth more than a penny.
[02:50:35.563 --> 02:50:41.267]  And these Svengali's, these scam artists, these magicians, just expand their scam every day.
[02:50:41.267 --> 02:50:44.489]  Just looting, controlling, it's all about domestication.
[02:50:44.489 --> 02:50:47.590]  We're going to come back, play these clips, keep Tommy about five minutes to the next hour.
[02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:52.794]  I want to get his take on why the establishment's coming out and admitting everything they're doing to us.
[02:50:52.794 --> 02:50:55.335]  Well, it's because they think it's too late for us, folks.
[02:50:55.335 --> 02:50:57.457]  They think they got us by the short hairs.
[02:50:57.457 --> 02:50:58.657]  Tommy Cryer's our guest.
[02:50:58.657 --> 02:51:00.198]  Infowars.com.
[02:51:00.198 --> 02:51:00.618]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:03.711]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:51:03.711 --> 02:51:10.674]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:51:10.674 --> 02:51:19.057]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:19.057 --> 02:51:24.800]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:26.801]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:26.801 --> 02:51:28.982]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:28.982 --> 02:51:33.524]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:33.524 --> 02:51:35.745]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:35.745 --> 02:51:43.609]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:52:01.665 --> 02:52:06.910]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.466 --> 02:52:15.028]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.028 --> 02:52:21.629]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.629 --> 02:52:23.590]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:26.110]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:37.033]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.674 --> 02:52:39.355]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.355 --> 02:52:41.197]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.197 --> 02:52:48.122]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:57.950]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.950 --> 02:53:00.953]  The people strike back.
[02:53:00.953 --> 02:53:03.234]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[02:53:03.234 --> 02:53:04.936]  It's time to think outside the box.
[02:53:05.373 --> 02:53:07.355]  How about starting your own garden?
[02:53:07.355 --> 02:53:09.597]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[02:54:05.441 --> 02:54:07.402]  You know, I could have Tommy Crowder on for 10 hours.
[02:54:07.402 --> 02:54:09.282]  There's so many points he makes, so many things he does.
[02:54:09.282 --> 02:54:11.023]  We'll have him back on and he'll do it in the near future.
[02:54:11.023 --> 02:54:16.944]  We'll also plug, before he leaves us in about 10 minutes, how he can get involved in his truth attack all over the country.
[02:54:16.944 --> 02:54:17.905]  Others are doing this as well.
[02:54:17.905 --> 02:54:20.745]  Just getting out there, educating the sheeple.
[02:54:20.745 --> 02:54:22.746]  Okay, I want to go ahead and play this clip.
[02:54:22.746 --> 02:54:28.848]  And boy, as Strange Days have found us, they've been giving the talking orders with Glenn Beck, O'Reilly, all of them.
[02:54:32.542 --> 02:54:36.123]  Yes, the new world order is real.
[02:54:36.123 --> 02:54:37.504]  Yes, they're taking over.
[02:54:37.504 --> 02:54:39.084]  Because they've lost all credibility.
[02:54:39.084 --> 02:54:42.065]  And now it's going to be their set piece place to fight it.
[02:54:42.065 --> 02:54:44.346]  Then you notice Beck says a restaurant Paul Sporters a year ago.
[02:54:44.346 --> 02:54:45.867]  Then now he says he's our best friend.
[02:54:45.867 --> 02:54:48.888]  But then Monday, next Monday, he's going to discredit the FEMA camps.
[02:54:49.568 --> 02:54:54.872]  Coming up Friday, I'm going to do two hours on it and show you all the documents and video clips and show you how their attack's going to work as well.
[02:54:54.872 --> 02:54:56.973]  Not just the proof, but how they're going to attack Monday.
[02:54:56.973 --> 02:54:58.194]  And watch, I'll be right.
[02:54:58.194 --> 02:54:59.255]  I understand their operations.
[02:54:59.255 --> 02:55:00.236]  It'll be straw men.
[02:55:00.236 --> 02:55:03.278]  They'll show fake news about camps and then try to disprove it that way.
[02:55:03.278 --> 02:55:07.561]  But I wanted to get Tommy Cryer's comments in the next five minutes after these clips.
[02:55:07.561 --> 02:55:11.643]  Here's Ann Coulter a few days ago on Fox News.
[02:55:11.643 --> 02:55:17.047]  You can get videos on YouTube, but here's the audio talking about how she loves Ron Paul and is going to vote for him in 2012.
[02:55:17.047 --> 02:55:17.367]  Here it is.
[02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:20.552]  Who's the leading candidate for the Republicans for 2012?
[02:55:20.552 --> 02:55:22.474]  Um, I don't know.
[02:55:22.474 --> 02:55:24.176]  Has the New York Times picked him for us yet?
[02:55:24.176 --> 02:55:24.596]  I don't know.
[02:55:24.596 --> 02:55:26.078]  I keep hearing... He picked the last one.
[02:55:26.078 --> 02:55:26.919]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:55:26.919 --> 02:55:27.800]  I didn't see the Times today.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:28.420]  No thoughts?
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:28.881]  No thoughts?
[02:55:28.881 --> 02:55:30.002]  Um, I think Ron Paul.
[02:55:30.002 --> 02:55:31.684]  The war will be over.
[02:55:31.684 --> 02:55:33.886]  And basically, I agreed with Ron Paul on everything.
[02:55:33.886 --> 02:55:35.207]  There will be so much to clean up.
[02:55:35.207 --> 02:55:41.273]  I mean, other than war, we will have... I think even Obama... But Ron Paul will be in his 80s by then.
[02:55:42.059 --> 02:55:42.680]  You know.
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:45.163]  Alright, that's enough of that.
[02:55:45.163 --> 02:55:46.825]  Now here's the next clip.
[02:55:46.825 --> 02:55:54.435]  Here is Dick Morris of the Clinton White House with Sean Hannity and this was last night.
[02:55:54.435 --> 02:55:54.816]  Here it is.
[02:55:57.174 --> 02:56:05.363]  There is a big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20, and then they're hiding it, they're camouflaging it, they're not talking about it.
[02:56:05.363 --> 02:56:08.306]  Coordination of international regulation.
[02:56:08.306 --> 02:56:15.374]  What they are going to do is to put our Fed and our SEC under the control, in effect, of the IMF.
[02:56:15.374 --> 02:56:16.796]  Oh come on, you believe they'll do this?
[02:56:17.076 --> 02:56:19.018]  That's what was in the draft agenda.
[02:56:19.018 --> 02:56:21.780]  They call it coordination of regulation.
[02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:26.543]  What it really is, is putting the American economy under international regulation.
[02:56:26.543 --> 02:56:31.167]  And those people who have been yelling, oh the UN's going to take over, global government.
[02:56:31.167 --> 02:56:32.388]  Conspiracy theorists.
[02:56:32.388 --> 02:56:35.971]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[02:56:35.971 --> 02:56:36.671]  It's happening.
[02:56:36.671 --> 02:56:40.354]  When Geithner said he would be opening the idea of a global currency last week.
[02:56:41.375 --> 02:56:45.378]  Those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years.
[02:56:45.378 --> 02:56:45.959]  You're not wrong.
[02:56:45.959 --> 02:56:46.559]  You're not wrong.
[02:56:46.559 --> 02:56:55.526]  And you know, what they always do at these conferences is they have the center show is here, and the side show they don't want you to pay attention to.
[02:56:55.526 --> 02:56:58.748]  The center show is the size of the stimulus package.
[02:56:58.748 --> 02:57:06.034]  The real show is international regulation of the financial institutions, which is going to happen under the IMF control.
[02:57:06.034 --> 02:57:09.536]  And remember, the IMF is run by Europeans, the World Bank by Americans.
[02:57:10.976 --> 02:57:12.357]  Now, the last clip.
[02:57:12.357 --> 02:57:15.580]  Here's Michael Savage two weeks ago, the government staging terror attacks.
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:16.741]  Here it is.
[02:57:16.741 --> 02:57:23.808]  Very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[02:57:23.808 --> 02:57:33.517]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind.
[02:57:34.182 --> 02:57:42.227]  And they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[02:57:42.227 --> 02:57:45.870]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[02:57:45.870 --> 02:57:53.415]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on Earth.
[02:57:56.182 --> 02:57:58.263]  Now, why are they doing this?
[02:57:58.263 --> 02:57:59.783]  Because they've lost all credibility.
[02:57:59.783 --> 02:58:01.824]  They said none of this existed for all these years.
[02:58:01.824 --> 02:58:04.526]  Now it's all over the news this is being set up.
[02:58:04.526 --> 02:58:07.147]  It's all over TV, but the news is telling you it's good.
[02:58:07.147 --> 02:58:10.569]  So they have to play the part of the anti-establishment, oh now we're against it.
[02:58:11.309 --> 02:58:11.849]  And I agree.
[02:58:11.849 --> 02:58:17.172]  I've been saying for months that Obama's going to stage a big terror attack because his agenda is already stalling.
[02:58:17.172 --> 02:58:18.752]  And I predicted that months ago.
[02:58:18.752 --> 02:58:20.353]  So, Tommy Cryer, back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:20.353 --> 02:58:21.733]  Final five-minute comments from you.
[02:58:21.733 --> 02:58:25.135]  You'll have the floor on this and then plug into your big events that are coming up.
[02:58:25.135 --> 02:58:26.335]  We appreciate you joining us.
[02:58:26.335 --> 02:58:28.336]  I want to get you on with Joe Bannister.
[02:58:28.336 --> 02:58:31.137]  That's a good idea to have you guys on for like an hour and a half, so you have plenty of time.
[02:58:31.137 --> 02:58:32.898]  But I wanted to get this in for everybody.
[02:58:32.898 --> 02:58:36.620]  So, your conservative friends that deny this, you know, we're not conspiracy nuts.
[02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:37.700]  We read the documents.
[02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:38.721]  We were right.
[02:58:38.721 --> 02:58:39.401]  You were wrong.
[02:58:42.904 --> 02:58:46.305]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:40.617 --> 02:59:42.398]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.207 --> 02:59:56.590]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.590 --> 02:59:59.312]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:09.292 --> 03:00:19.198]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know we broke the secret MIAC report to make international news about them saying Ron Paul supporters, people that talk about the banks are terrorists, people that talk about the New World Order, it doesn't exist.
[03:00:19.198 --> 03:00:25.422]  I've got photos of the coffin, plastic coffin factory spewing out new coffins.
[03:00:25.422 --> 03:00:30.306]  This just came in from a truck driver picking them up to bring them to a FEMA camp.
[03:00:30.306 --> 03:00:32.327]  I have the letter right here.
[03:00:32.327 --> 03:00:38.251]  I'm not going to tell you what state.
[03:00:40.533 --> 03:00:43.454]  This is unbelievable.
[03:00:43.454 --> 03:00:46.135]  This is the type of stuff that just pours in.
[03:00:46.135 --> 03:00:47.635]  These are confirmed plastic coffins.
[03:00:47.635 --> 03:00:53.177]  You know, I may keep Tommy five minutes into the next hour, I mean, into the next segment, because I want to get to Mark, Taylor, and Mike.
[03:00:53.177 --> 03:00:54.357]  We'll see if we can do that.
[03:00:54.357 --> 03:00:57.558]  Mr. Cryer, you just heard all those clips where they're now admitting all this.
[03:00:57.558 --> 03:00:59.639]  Well, before they said we were dangerous terrorists.
[03:00:59.639 --> 03:01:03.340]  Sean Hannity, about five years ago, said, arrest anybody that talks about this.
[03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:04.660]  Why are they having to admit it now?
[03:01:05.484 --> 03:01:09.267]  I don't think that they are admitting it for the purposes of truth or not.
[03:01:09.267 --> 03:01:14.711]  You have to remember that these people are not... You deal in the truth.
[03:01:14.711 --> 03:01:18.333]  That's what you have out there on the market.
[03:01:18.333 --> 03:01:20.035]  They deal in entertainment.
[03:01:20.035 --> 03:01:30.922]  Now, the fact that they are coming out and saying these things means that they're beginning to recognize that we have grown to the point to where we are an appreciable segment of the audience.
[03:01:30.922 --> 03:01:34.325]  So they're having to give us some of our flavor of candy.
[03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:37.438]  Now, these guys don't care.
[03:01:37.438 --> 03:01:39.759]  They are part of the problem.
[03:01:39.759 --> 03:01:52.304]  But the fact that they are speaking to us as though they do is an indication, I think, that we're growing to the point to where we're becoming an undeniable segment of the world, the reality.
[03:01:52.304 --> 03:01:53.204]  Very astute.
[03:01:53.204 --> 03:01:56.965]  They're having to respond because we are becoming the majority.
[03:01:56.965 --> 03:02:03.668]  They have to respond because we have become a significant enough portion of society that we've become a market.
[03:02:04.642 --> 03:02:06.203]  Now that's all we are.
[03:02:06.203 --> 03:02:22.310]  Whether it's to the government or the mainstream media or to the banking industry or to big business, we are nothing but cattle to be milked, to be slaughtered, to be exploited.
[03:02:22.310 --> 03:02:25.011]  And they are seeing now that we are a market.
[03:02:25.535 --> 03:02:31.339]  And that to me is an encouraging thing, not because they have admitted or anything, because they don't.
[03:02:31.339 --> 03:02:35.603]  They're sitting here, like you said, they're talking about this as though it's a good thing.
[03:02:35.603 --> 03:02:37.264]  It's not a good thing.
[03:02:37.264 --> 03:02:45.670]  And so, you know, this business of pandering is all that we ever see from the so-called conservative.
[03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:51.495]  You know, have you ever heard Hannity or have you ever heard Limbaugh or have you ever heard
[03:02:52.142 --> 03:02:52.982]  We're good to go.
[03:03:11.663 --> 03:03:17.989]  All they're doing is giving us an illusion that we have a voice out there.
[03:03:17.989 --> 03:03:19.451]  The voice isn't with the entertainers.
[03:03:19.451 --> 03:03:25.516]  The voice is with the truth tellers like you and like me and like Joe Bannister to get up there and say,
[03:03:27.025 --> 03:03:33.250]  Well, more than that, and I agree with the points you made, and that's certainly part of it, we've made those points.
[03:03:33.250 --> 03:03:39.054]  It's also the fact that they see we're growing so fast that they understand they could lose this thing, so they're hedging their bets.
[03:03:39.054 --> 03:03:45.779]  And on top of that, because they see our growth rate, and I say we're probably the biggest one group out there, people that don't trust the government know about the New World Order.
[03:03:45.779 --> 03:03:47.280]  I mean, it's mainstream now.
[03:03:48.081 --> 03:03:49.222]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:03:49.222 --> 03:03:51.564]  Just like the New York Times piece that recently ran.
[03:03:51.564 --> 03:03:52.325]  I met that guy.
[03:03:52.325 --> 03:03:54.667]  He was wanting to do a story on us.
[03:03:54.667 --> 03:03:56.108]  What he was wanting to do was a gut-slash job.
[03:03:56.108 --> 03:03:57.369]  He was wanting to disembowel the movement.
[03:03:57.369 --> 03:03:58.630]  He was an interloper.
[03:04:16.588 --> 03:04:17.169]  I don't know.
[03:04:29.867 --> 03:04:35.591]  You know, that's why we've got to get to the people and say, here's where your answers lie.
[03:04:35.591 --> 03:04:36.692]  Your answers lie in the truth.
[03:05:01.928 --> 03:05:05.449]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:05:05.449 --> 03:05:10.851]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:05:10.851 --> 03:05:15.993]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:05:15.993 --> 03:05:27.118]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:05:27.518 --> 03:05:33.300]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:39.563]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:05:39.563 --> 03:05:40.603]  What about you?
[03:05:40.603 --> 03:05:47.026]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[03:05:47.026 --> 03:05:49.167]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[03:05:52.523 --> 03:05:56.326]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:07.575]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.575 --> 03:06:14.561]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.129 --> 03:06:21.715]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.715 --> 03:06:23.697]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.697 --> 03:06:26.199]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.199 --> 03:06:37.789]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:37.789 --> 03:06:39.451]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.451 --> 03:06:40.812]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.306 --> 03:06:48.213]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.213 --> 03:06:56.482]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.482 --> 03:06:58.063]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.063 --> 03:06:59.225]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.374 --> 03:07:04.818]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:07:04.818 --> 03:07:09.082]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:07:09.082 --> 03:07:17.050]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:07:17.310 --> 03:07:17.750]  We're good to go.
[03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:54.172]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:54.172 --> 03:07:56.172]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.789 --> 03:08:20.171]  Well, we've got 52 minutes left in this broadcast today.
[03:08:20.171 --> 03:08:33.497]  I have breaking FEMA camp news and I can't give you much of the details because they don't want me to because it could alert folks to who they are, but I'm allowed to put these photos up on the web.
[03:08:33.497 --> 03:08:36.178]  This is not Georgia.
[03:08:36.178 --> 03:08:40.180]  This is the fellow, the truck driver,
[03:08:41.906 --> 03:08:44.887]  Picking up the FEMA coffins.
[03:08:44.887 --> 03:08:49.150]  They've got these in Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Texas, California.
[03:08:49.150 --> 03:08:50.390]  Picking them up at the factory.
[03:08:50.390 --> 03:08:51.491]  And we know the company.
[03:08:51.491 --> 03:08:54.352]  I mean, it's admitted these are mass coffins for CDC.
[03:08:54.352 --> 03:08:57.354]  And delivering them to another location.
[03:08:57.354 --> 03:08:58.494]  And that's all I'm allowed to tell you.
[03:08:58.494 --> 03:08:59.815]  But, you know what?
[03:08:59.815 --> 03:09:04.277]  Go ahead and give these to Tim or one of the guys in the back.
[03:09:04.277 --> 03:09:05.918]  Have the guys scan these in.
[03:09:05.918 --> 03:09:09.380]  Don't have Rob do it or Jason do it because they're busy making a video map.
[03:09:10.567 --> 03:09:19.454]  of the one of the big FEMA facilities and then the tent cities where they're forcing them out to the FEMA facility so that this all dovetails.
[03:09:19.454 --> 03:09:22.736]  It's coming up at the next segment in about 15 minutes.
[03:09:22.736 --> 03:09:23.857]  They'll be with us till the end of the show.
[03:09:23.857 --> 03:09:24.898]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[03:09:24.898 --> 03:09:26.659]  We're going to Mark Taylor and Mike right now.
[03:09:26.659 --> 03:09:28.480]  Just so much is breaking so fast.
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:38.208]  Give that to Aaron Dykes and then just tell him to post it and he'll hear me talk about it but just basically a truck driver went and picked them up at the factory making them
[03:09:39.508 --> 03:09:40.329]  Yeah.
[03:09:40.329 --> 03:09:41.650]  Yeah, and it's accelerating.
[03:09:41.650 --> 03:09:42.851]  And that's why we have to accelerate.
[03:09:59.321 --> 03:10:04.205]  You know, that's why we have to... Truth Attack has a comprehensive plan.
[03:10:04.205 --> 03:10:10.850]  We need funding for a lot of it, but we can't implement it yet, but we've got a lot going on.
[03:10:10.850 --> 03:10:15.553]  We've managed to finally pick up Liberty Works Radio Network.
[03:10:15.553 --> 03:10:20.937]  It'll be kicking on mid-April already, going on air.
[03:10:20.937 --> 03:10:24.580]  I want to personally, by the way, invite InfoWars and you, Alex,
[03:10:25.399 --> 03:10:28.741]  Yes sir, but it's coming up, it's going to be all true liberty.
[03:10:28.741 --> 03:10:30.983]  It's not going to be entertainment, it's going to be truth.
[03:10:30.983 --> 03:10:35.026]  And it's going to have every sector of the freedom movement will be represented.
[03:10:48.223 --> 03:11:04.427]  On that, it's coming up, we're going on the air, and I can't say exactly where just yet, because the last time we had something lined up, the government stepped in, and the two stations we had, we were going to acquire, ran for the tall grass.
[03:11:04.427 --> 03:11:09.248]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, with Kottmeyer... The deal in the middle, it was ready to be signed, and they packed off without reason.
[03:11:09.248 --> 03:11:10.748]  Yeah, well, Kottmeyer's the real deal.
[03:11:10.748 --> 03:11:14.509]  He got me on, at the height of it, 20 stations, and I mean big ones.
[03:11:14.989 --> 03:11:26.118]  You know, Kyle Meyers has been working very hard on this for the last year and a half, two years, trying to revive the network, and we're going to fire it up April 15th.
[03:11:26.118 --> 03:11:27.679]  It's going to be absolutely fantastic.
[03:11:27.679 --> 03:11:35.025]  Truth Attack will have a drive-time show every afternoon of the week, and there'll be a lot of other entertainment TV kids going to be on there.
[03:11:35.025 --> 03:11:37.287]  You know how wonderful she is.
[03:11:37.287 --> 03:11:41.290]  And it wouldn't be a bad thing for Alex Jones to be on that network, too.
[03:11:41.809 --> 03:11:46.574]  Well, I know Ted's always happy to do that, so I'm sure if you call Ted, he'll be happy to have the show carried out.
[03:11:46.574 --> 03:11:51.579]  For once, the Freedom Movement is starting to act together and fold those fingers up into a fist.
[03:11:51.579 --> 03:12:01.309]  You know, it's been easy to break our fingers, but when you roll them up into a fist, not only is it hard to break them, but you can start breaking things with that fist.
[03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:04.112]  And I've never seen the kind of activity that we've seen this year.
[03:12:05.247 --> 03:12:08.688]  Truth Attack has gotten a huge response from across the freedom movement.
[03:12:08.688 --> 03:12:15.571]  Not just tax honesty issues people, but libertarian people, constitutional party people, education people.
[03:12:15.571 --> 03:12:19.752]  They all see the value in cutting off the roots of the truth security.
[03:12:19.752 --> 03:12:20.072]  Absolutely.
[03:12:20.072 --> 03:12:21.512]  Tommy, we're almost out of time.
[03:12:21.512 --> 03:12:22.333]  Fire out the website again.
[03:12:22.333 --> 03:12:23.513]  We're going to take three calls.
[03:12:23.513 --> 03:12:31.976]  It's truthattack.org and you can get on there, register for Operation Stop Thief and receive your free backpack and free signs if you can get in this week.
[03:12:33.093 --> 03:12:36.975]  Next week we won't be able to send out anything but the materials packages.
[03:12:36.975 --> 03:12:39.276]  But it's all free.
[03:12:39.276 --> 03:12:42.058]  We supply the science.
[03:12:42.058 --> 03:12:45.499]  We ship them.
[03:12:45.499 --> 03:12:46.280]  Absolutely.
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:47.881]  And they have a blast, Alex.
[03:12:47.881 --> 03:12:51.142]  I mean, these guys write back and they're talking about how much fun they're having.
[03:12:51.142 --> 03:12:52.483]  It's fun to fight back!
[03:12:52.483 --> 03:12:54.484]  It's fun to stand up!
[03:12:54.484 --> 03:12:56.065]  We push it in the instructions.
[03:12:56.485 --> 03:13:01.747]  We're not freedom fighters, we're freedom lovers, and we're celebrating because this is a big step forward.
[03:13:01.747 --> 03:13:04.589]  Hey, we get to be part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:13:04.589 --> 03:13:06.410]  We don't have a choice, we gotta fight the globalists.
[03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:10.211]  We're having huge success, everybody should be more positive, and this is a big part of the solution.
[03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:13.553]  Let's take three calls that are specifically for you, then I'll get to everybody else.
[03:13:13.553 --> 03:13:16.774]  Mark in Texas, thanks for holding on the air with Tommy Cryer, who beat the IRS.
[03:13:16.774 --> 03:13:18.215]  Go ahead.
[03:13:18.215 --> 03:13:21.516]  Hey, Mr. Cryer and Mr. Jones, or Alex, thank you for your time.
[03:13:21.516 --> 03:13:22.397]  I'm glad to be with y'all.
[03:13:23.780 --> 03:13:27.422]  I have a book from a fellow back in the 1960s.
[03:13:27.422 --> 03:13:30.124]  His name is Norman F. Dacey.
[03:13:30.124 --> 03:13:34.366]  He was a probate, a will and estates person.
[03:13:34.366 --> 03:13:52.636]  He was helping people and he just exposed the whole corrupt system of the judges, lawyers, the whole... and his statement in the beginning of his second chapter of calling probate the ugly side, he said, woe unto you lawyers if you have taken away the
[03:13:53.976 --> 03:13:57.879]  Not in yourselves, and them that were entering in, you hindered.
[03:13:57.879 --> 03:14:13.913]  And I saw that the first paragraph, it says, in most areas of this country, the probate procedure is a scandal, a form of tribute levied by the legal profession upon the estates of its victims, both living and dead.
[03:14:13.913 --> 03:14:19.598]  And it mentioned many of people that were kids that were disabled, and these corrupt people were just constantly taking their money.
[03:14:20.370 --> 03:14:22.871]  And I haven't researched all of this significantly.
[03:14:22.871 --> 03:14:28.772]  My expertise is in the natural health field for about 20 years, and that was the reason for my original call.
[03:14:28.772 --> 03:14:39.456]  But when I noted that y'all were talking about this, when I got little bits of the call, when I had my other line, I figured, well, I'd ask a question and see what this fellow here had thought about.
[03:14:39.456 --> 03:14:40.236]  And I had one other
[03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:42.261]  Well, not exactly.
[03:14:42.261 --> 03:14:43.943]  You could make a case for that because you could take exceptions.
[03:15:00.828 --> 03:15:15.433]  I've probably handled 400, maybe even 500 estates over the course of my career, and they've always gone through smoothly and at a nominal expense, without any siphoning off.
[03:15:16.817 --> 03:15:21.440]  The courts aren't doing anything but maybe a hundred or two dollars for filing fees.
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:23.762]  Attorneys don't charge that much for an estate.
[03:15:23.762 --> 03:15:25.463]  But I have seen the horror stories, don't I?
[03:15:25.463 --> 03:15:31.287]  My family's... There are horror stories because there are abusive and predatory attorneys out there.
[03:15:31.287 --> 03:15:36.911]  And we do have, with respect to larger estates, we have a very abusive and predatory government out there.
[03:15:36.911 --> 03:15:38.993]  But I do want to warn people.
[03:15:38.993 --> 03:15:40.514]  I do want to warn people.
[03:15:40.514 --> 03:15:43.496]  One of the most predatory groups I've seen per capita is the fake
[03:15:44.780 --> 03:16:07.805]  uh... patriots that are out there i call a patriot mythology and b-crap discoveries maybe can briefly mention it per capita of the most abusive thing i've seen they will sit there and tell people they're setting up a trust and steal their property and i'm telling you i mean there's a folks we take the most dangerous thing out there is is the fake patriot movement uh... these uh... quote you know they're using their lawyers
[03:16:09.005 --> 03:16:12.887]  Yeah, they're lawyer wannabes, or they call themselves lay lawyers.
[03:16:12.887 --> 03:16:13.607]  One guy does.
[03:16:13.607 --> 03:16:17.388]  I'm just glad he doesn't wish he was smart enough to have been a brain surgeon.
[03:16:17.388 --> 03:16:20.830]  I only operate on my friends just on weekends.
[03:16:20.830 --> 03:16:31.033]  But there's a lot of that, and I think a lot of it, too, originates with the government, because they're the only ones that benefit from this, from those things.
[03:16:31.033 --> 03:16:35.235]  And you've got a lot of people out there that are PAY Patriots.
[03:16:36.024 --> 03:16:36.584]  We're good to go.
[03:17:03.274 --> 03:17:03.914]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:17:03.914 --> 03:17:04.995]  Folks, watch out.
[03:17:04.995 --> 03:17:10.517]  Any charlatan that says, I'll get you out of taxes, you know, let me be the trustee of the trust or my friend.
[03:17:10.517 --> 03:17:12.597]  I have watched him and I've warned people in Austin.
[03:17:12.597 --> 03:17:13.418]  They never listen.
[03:17:13.418 --> 03:17:14.658]  They get ripped off.
[03:17:14.658 --> 03:17:16.099]  And these people all hate me.
[03:17:16.099 --> 03:17:18.319]  Boy, you wouldn't believe how much they hate me.
[03:17:18.319 --> 03:17:20.960]  But I will not sit here and watch their criminal activity.
[03:17:20.960 --> 03:17:23.461]  Let's go ahead and talk to Taylor in Florida.
[03:17:23.461 --> 03:17:24.602]  Taylor, you're on the air with our guest.
[03:17:24.602 --> 03:17:24.882]  Go ahead.
[03:17:26.992 --> 03:17:27.672]  Hi, Alex.
[03:17:27.672 --> 03:17:28.933]  Thanks for having me, man.
[03:17:28.933 --> 03:17:34.775]  First of all, I'd like to say thank you for everything that you've been doing, everything that you do for your job on a daily basis.
[03:17:34.775 --> 03:17:40.057]  You're a brave American who stands for everything Americans should.
[03:17:40.057 --> 03:17:41.738]  Second of all, thank you, Tommy.
[03:17:41.738 --> 03:17:45.879]  I really agree with what you're saying about the Consolidate.
[03:17:45.879 --> 03:17:51.321]  What we really need to do right now is... I really have a question.
[03:17:51.321 --> 03:17:55.823]  My question is, what we really need to do, first of all, is the spread of information is going.
[03:17:57.374 --> 03:17:59.596]  People are definitely becoming aware.
[03:17:59.596 --> 03:18:16.128]  The scary thing about it, though, is that who has the mass control of the knowledge, of the popular opinion, of the worldview, of what's going on, is now starting to catch on, like what Alex has been talking about.
[03:18:16.128 --> 03:18:19.390]  And they have, at this point, if people don't
[03:18:20.928 --> 03:18:26.151]  Quit being scared of talking about it, because the thing is, people are awake, but people want to live their lives.
[03:18:26.151 --> 03:18:34.616]  That's right, and the Trojan Horses, I appreciate your call, Glenn Beck and others, they're going to falsely lead people into a false patriot movement.
[03:18:34.616 --> 03:18:36.037]  Do you agree, Tommy Cryer?
[03:18:36.037 --> 03:18:36.637]  I do agree.
[03:18:36.637 --> 03:18:39.439]  I think that they want to lead us off.
[03:18:39.439 --> 03:18:42.701]  It's misdirection and disinformation.
[03:18:42.701 --> 03:18:44.922]  And what they're doing is keeping us off the real track.
[03:18:47.845 --> 03:18:55.572]  What Truth Attack is doing on the consolidation point that the caller made is that we're not trying to take over any movement or anything.
[03:18:55.572 --> 03:19:03.661]  All we're doing is saying we're the cavalry, support us, and what we do is take the offensive step and our object is to take the government and put it back in its box.
[03:19:04.501 --> 03:19:05.962]  One tentacle at a time.
[03:19:05.962 --> 03:19:07.443]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:19:07.443 --> 03:19:07.883]  Anytime.
[03:19:28.837 --> 03:19:29.137]  You bet.
[03:19:29.137 --> 03:19:30.318]  Good to have you here with us today.
[03:19:30.318 --> 03:19:31.380]  I appreciate that.
[03:19:31.380 --> 03:19:40.368]  Okay, we're going to break and then coming up I'm going to get into the shantytowns all over the country that they're shutting down, grabbing their children, grabbing...
[03:19:41.451 --> 03:19:44.674]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:20:05.253 --> 03:20:12.280]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:20:12.280 --> 03:20:17.085]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:20:17.085 --> 03:20:26.635]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:20:27.082 --> 03:20:37.132]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:20:37.132 --> 03:20:45.060]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115, to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:20:45.060 --> 03:20:47.943]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[03:20:48.443 --> 03:20:51.224]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[03:20:51.224 --> 03:21:02.210]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[03:21:02.210 --> 03:21:08.232]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.232 --> 03:21:13.555]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.105 --> 03:21:20.608]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.608 --> 03:21:22.588]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.588 --> 03:21:25.029]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.029 --> 03:21:38.235]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.235 --> 03:21:39.895]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.895 --> 03:21:41.276]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.747 --> 03:21:48.653]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.653 --> 03:21:56.920]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:21:58.502]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.502 --> 03:21:59.683]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.454 --> 03:22:02.936]  So you want to stop smoking.
[03:22:02.936 --> 03:22:04.197]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[03:22:04.197 --> 03:22:07.080]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[03:22:07.080 --> 03:22:11.083]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[03:22:11.083 --> 03:22:14.847]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[03:22:14.847 --> 03:22:16.869]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[03:22:16.869 --> 03:22:20.753]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[03:22:21.153 --> 03:22:28.241]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[03:22:28.241 --> 03:22:36.270]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.950]  I'm good.
[03:23:01.704 --> 03:23:07.206]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:23:07.206 --> 03:23:08.006]  and the world.
[03:23:08.006 --> 03:23:11.867]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:23:11.867 --> 03:23:18.370]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:23:18.370 --> 03:23:20.390]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:23:20.390 --> 03:23:28.333]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[03:23:28.613 --> 03:23:33.318]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[03:23:33.318 --> 03:23:39.143]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[03:23:39.143 --> 03:23:41.306]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[03:23:41.306 --> 03:23:43.568]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[03:23:43.888 --> 03:23:44.308]  We're good to go.
[03:24:12.580 --> 03:24:16.575]  We're good.
[03:24:25.908 --> 03:24:28.469]  I've got Rob Due and Jason Douglas out there.
[03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:32.571]  They're so busy trying to make a map of the shantytowns that they're not in here.
[03:24:32.571 --> 03:24:34.932]  But here they come.
[03:24:34.932 --> 03:24:37.813]  Guys, we need to get you on air because the show doesn't have much time left here.
[03:24:37.813 --> 03:24:40.395]  We've got about 35 minutes of broadcast time left.
[03:24:40.395 --> 03:24:45.237]  Ah, yes, there's Rob Due coming in here and getting in studio with us right now.
[03:24:45.237 --> 03:24:46.197]  You don't even need headphones.
[03:24:46.197 --> 03:24:48.158]  We're not going to be taking calls.
[03:24:48.158 --> 03:24:52.380]  I want to get both of your reports on what happened.
[03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:53.881]  Where is Jason Douglas?
[03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:54.461]  He's on his way.
[03:24:55.643 --> 03:24:56.444]  He's on his way, sorry.
[03:25:05.287 --> 03:25:08.029]  I want to commend you both on air for the great job you've done.
[03:25:08.029 --> 03:25:08.650]  Well, thank you.
[03:25:08.650 --> 03:25:10.431]  We were working on a map.
[03:25:10.431 --> 03:25:16.116]  We went to Google Maps and downloaded a satellite image, which Hugh should be pulling up any time now.
[03:25:16.116 --> 03:25:17.437]  Yeah, well, during another break we can show it.
[03:25:17.437 --> 03:25:23.282]  It'll kind of explain the vastness of the area that we were looking at.
[03:25:23.282 --> 03:25:30.489]  It's a large area, and then there's some areas that are really concentrated and some areas that were sparsely populated with tents.
[03:25:31.589 --> 03:25:33.431]  Well, I want to start from the beginning.
[03:25:33.431 --> 03:25:36.533]  We're not going to be taking any calls, so we don't even need those.
[03:25:36.533 --> 03:25:38.155]  But that's fine.
[03:25:38.155 --> 03:25:40.917]  Let's go ahead and start over with you guys here.
[03:25:40.917 --> 03:25:43.899]  I have folks that work here in the office, do a great job.
[03:25:43.899 --> 03:25:45.661]  We have Rob Dew, and of course Jason Douglas.
[03:25:45.661 --> 03:25:52.366]  I sent you guys last Friday out to California, started in Southern California, San Diego, LA, moved up to Sacramento.
[03:25:52.366 --> 03:25:57.890]  And for the listeners out there tuning in, tell the story, tell folks what you witnessed, what happened.
[03:25:57.890 --> 03:25:58.671]  Alright.
[03:25:58.671 --> 03:25:59.252]  You want to go first?
[03:26:00.391 --> 03:26:01.172]  Fill him in.
[03:26:01.172 --> 03:26:18.484]  Okay, well, we land in Long Beach and we stayed there the night, we got in kind of late, and the next morning we went to just go shoot some shots and check out a park that was near where we were that supposedly has a lot of homeless to try to find out, you know, the tent city areas around there.
[03:26:18.484 --> 03:26:27.650]  And so we wake up and we're shooting stuff and we hear these cadences and marchings and we look over and it's this group of youths in white t-shirts and shorts and
[03:26:29.011 --> 03:26:33.933]  They were being bused in by the Sheriff's Department and they were doing exercises and talking.
[03:26:33.933 --> 03:26:38.794]  There was three busloads of people, plus there were other vans and Sheriff's Police cars.
[03:26:38.794 --> 03:26:40.475]  It was all Sheriff's Department stuff.
[03:26:40.475 --> 03:26:41.015]  What was this?
[03:26:41.015 --> 03:26:41.815]  I haven't even heard of this.
[03:26:41.815 --> 03:26:43.876]  Well, yeah, there was so much to see.
[03:26:43.876 --> 03:26:46.176]  I mean, that was the first thing we saw when we got up the next morning.
[03:26:46.176 --> 03:26:47.657]  Some type of youth brigade thing.
[03:26:47.657 --> 03:26:49.017]  I mean, it's something like that.
[03:26:49.017 --> 03:26:49.777]  Did you get footage of that?
[03:26:49.777 --> 03:26:50.918]  Oh yeah, we have lots of footage of that.
[03:26:50.918 --> 03:26:51.698]  What is this insanity?
[03:26:51.738 --> 03:26:52.959]  We're good to go.
[03:27:22.058 --> 03:27:23.139]  They were doing all kinds of stuff.
[03:27:23.139 --> 03:27:25.400]  And that all sounds reasonable, but the state's out of control.
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:25.700]  Sure.
[03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:27.321]  This is what Russia, China, everybody did.
[03:27:27.321 --> 03:27:28.601]  They get them while they're young.
[03:27:28.601 --> 03:27:29.382]  Right, right.
[03:27:29.382 --> 03:27:34.284]  And it seems like, because I had actually heard of this where I was from in Louisiana, they had the same thing like this.
[03:27:34.284 --> 03:27:34.984]  No, it's going on everywhere.
[03:27:34.984 --> 03:27:38.386]  It's Secure Corps, but they do it locally with the federal dollars.
[03:27:38.386 --> 03:27:41.327]  They trade them in warrant apprehension, gun confiscation.
[03:27:41.327 --> 03:27:42.148]  That's been in the news.
[03:27:42.148 --> 03:27:45.449]  I mean, these kids all look like they would be ready to follow any order they were given.
[03:27:45.449 --> 03:27:45.769]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:27:45.769 --> 03:27:46.750]  They were very serious.
[03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:48.130]  They were very serious.
[03:27:48.130 --> 03:27:48.791]  How old were they?
[03:27:49.751 --> 03:27:51.073]  Uh, what would you say, 14 to 17?
[03:27:51.073 --> 03:27:52.555]  14 to maybe 17, yeah.
[03:27:52.555 --> 03:27:53.876]  Exactly like Russia.
[03:27:53.876 --> 03:27:54.296]  Yeah.
[03:27:54.296 --> 03:27:59.162]  I mean, it was definitely, you know, and they were all in March, in cadence, doing the thing.
[03:27:59.162 --> 03:28:00.463]  It was a well-oiled machine.
[03:28:00.463 --> 03:28:00.784]  Yeah.
[03:28:00.784 --> 03:28:04.208]  Hey, will somebody email us and tell me which one of my films is it?
[03:28:05.546 --> 03:28:15.078]  Is it police state, three total enslavement, or is it masters of terror, where I have the Russian newscast in English, where it goes, these guys, these children are ready to get tough on tax cheats.
[03:28:15.078 --> 03:28:20.085]  Shows like 14 year olds practicing karate chops, and they send them to government homes to be trained for this.
[03:28:20.085 --> 03:28:20.365]  Wow.
[03:28:20.365 --> 03:28:21.307]  We ought to pull that up.
[03:28:21.787 --> 03:28:23.348]  Yeah, that was amazing.
[03:28:23.348 --> 03:28:28.491]  That was just the first part of the day and then we spent the rest of the day driving around L.A.
[03:28:28.491 --> 03:28:29.611]  looking at these spots.
[03:28:29.611 --> 03:28:31.352]  Jason's from, you know, L.A.
[03:28:31.352 --> 03:28:34.074]  and, you know, why don't you tell them a little bit about that, driving around L.A.?
[03:28:34.074 --> 03:28:42.058]  Yeah, I basically went to all the hot spots where I know there's high concentrations of homeless before we left and one of the reasons that we went to L.A.
[03:28:42.058 --> 03:28:44.280]  was because we kept hearing these stories about
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:52.527]  Um, the homeless there getting tickets, $154 tickets for being on the street or not having a home.
[03:28:52.527 --> 03:28:53.868]  Illegal camping is what they were doing.
[03:28:53.868 --> 03:28:54.569]  Illegal camping.
[03:28:54.569 --> 03:28:56.471]  But the illegal aliens are left alone.
[03:28:56.471 --> 03:28:58.052]  Right, right, of course.
[03:28:58.052 --> 03:29:08.482]  So, um, we just went to all the hotspots where I knew that they should be, and indeed, we didn't see anybody on the street, so we can only suppose that they've either been rounded up,
[03:29:09.451 --> 03:29:12.893]  Well, you said you were told by people that, oh, there was a camp here, but they moved it.
[03:29:12.893 --> 03:29:13.013]  Right.
[03:29:13.013 --> 03:29:21.859]  And now we found out in the LA Times, I wish we'd have had this before you left, that was in the news Saturday, that they have one outside LA.
[03:29:21.859 --> 03:29:22.520]  In Ontario.
[03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:22.960]  In Ontario.
[03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:26.903]  And they're wearing wristbands.
[03:29:26.903 --> 03:29:29.184]  They're taking their children, taking their Winnebago's.
[03:29:29.184 --> 03:29:31.526]  Then you got the same news report when you were up in Sacramento.
[03:29:31.526 --> 03:29:32.066]  Eyewitnesses.
[03:29:32.066 --> 03:29:33.087]  Stay there, guys.
[03:29:33.087 --> 03:29:34.828]  I just want to say, super job.
[03:29:34.828 --> 03:29:38.410]  I don't even know if the time we have left on the show will be enough to debrief you on this and all you saw.
[03:29:39.591 --> 03:29:43.655]  I want you to go through it all in detail as fast as possible.
[03:29:43.655 --> 03:29:46.418]  Let me get back with Jason Douglas and Rob Duke.
[03:29:46.418 --> 03:29:47.840]  Great Info Warriors here on the team.
[03:29:47.840 --> 03:29:51.924]  We're introducing everybody today.
[03:29:51.924 --> 03:29:53.305]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.305 --> 03:29:54.907]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.907 --> 03:29:58.531]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.664 --> 03:30:03.345]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:30:03.345 --> 03:30:05.087]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:30:05.087 --> 03:30:07.769]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:30:07.769 --> 03:30:12.913]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:30:12.913 --> 03:30:16.096]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:30:16.096 --> 03:30:19.579]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[03:30:20.006 --> 03:30:32.557]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:30:32.557 --> 03:30:34.879]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:30:34.879 --> 03:30:36.281]  I use one every day.
[03:30:36.281 --> 03:30:38.743]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:30:39.103 --> 03:30:43.546]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.913 --> 03:31:15.475]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.475 --> 03:31:22.076]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.076 --> 03:31:24.036]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.036 --> 03:31:26.557]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.557 --> 03:31:37.339]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.115 --> 03:31:39.796]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.796 --> 03:31:41.657]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.657 --> 03:31:48.562]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.562 --> 03:31:56.827]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.827 --> 03:31:58.408]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.408 --> 03:31:59.589]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.727 --> 03:32:05.228]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:32:05.228 --> 03:32:10.630]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:15.792]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:32:15.792 --> 03:32:26.916]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:32:27.316 --> 03:32:33.082]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:32:33.082 --> 03:32:39.368]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:32:39.368 --> 03:32:40.389]  What about you?
[03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:42.331]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[03:32:42.331 --> 03:32:46.835]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:33:12.987 --> 03:33:14.048]  We are back live.
[03:33:14.048 --> 03:33:20.510]  By the end of the show today, it's going up on InfoWars.com, another exclusive.
[03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:21.091]  We'll tell you
[03:33:22.208 --> 03:33:24.529]  It's Alabama and surrounding states.
[03:33:24.529 --> 03:33:29.910]  Going to the factory that makes the admitted plastic coffins for the CDC.
[03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:32.711]  They're putting all over the 50 states.
[03:33:32.711 --> 03:33:39.013]  Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Michigan.
[03:33:39.013 --> 03:33:40.674]  And these are brand new coffins.
[03:33:41.914 --> 03:33:47.899]  Being made and being shipped off the government holding facilities and fields all over the country.
[03:33:47.899 --> 03:33:52.003]  And those photos, new ones with all the other mass graves and other coffin videos.
[03:33:52.003 --> 03:33:53.844]  And Aaron's listening right now as he uploads all this.
[03:33:53.844 --> 03:33:54.505]  Doing a great job.
[03:33:54.505 --> 03:33:57.708]  Aaron, add a link for people who've written past stories.
[03:33:57.708 --> 03:33:59.349]  Say, here's the company that sold the coffins.
[03:33:59.349 --> 03:34:00.090]  They admit it.
[03:34:00.090 --> 03:34:01.771]  It's for the CDC and a mass plague.
[03:34:02.645 --> 03:34:11.371]  And then maybe put a link in there from the Real Newscaster, a new story where we had the emergency manager on, talking about how the feds told him get ready for mass graves outside Chicago.
[03:34:11.371 --> 03:34:12.511]  Okay, I'm going to shop about that.
[03:34:12.511 --> 03:34:16.834]  It'll be up on Infowars.com a few minutes after the show ends or so.
[03:34:16.834 --> 03:34:18.295]  I'm going to get there in time to get all this up.
[03:34:18.295 --> 03:34:20.877]  He's in there scanning like 20 photos.
[03:34:20.877 --> 03:34:22.658]  We're allowed to post the photos that were sent to us.
[03:34:22.658 --> 03:34:26.060]  It pretty much shows you it's Alabama, so we'll just say that.
[03:34:26.060 --> 03:34:28.342]  But the truck driver doesn't want much more than that said.
[03:34:28.342 --> 03:34:30.103]  Okay, gentlemen, I'm going to try to sit here and shut up.
[03:34:30.103 --> 03:34:31.664]  We're also taping for the film because I want to
[03:34:32.524 --> 03:34:36.386]  Did you guys interview each other while you were out there about what you were seeing and witnessing?
[03:34:36.386 --> 03:34:42.329]  A little bit, but not as... I mean, we were trying to concentrate more on the subject matter, but we did shoot some stuff of us driving around.
[03:34:42.329 --> 03:34:46.871]  Yeah, it's just this film's going to be cinema verite with no voiceover, but that's great.
[03:34:46.871 --> 03:34:47.831]  We'll interview you here.
[03:34:47.831 --> 03:34:51.793]  It's just better in the field, but I didn't give you... it was so quick, I didn't really give you directions.
[03:34:51.793 --> 03:34:53.174]  Towards the end, we started doing that.
[03:34:53.334 --> 03:34:58.138]  Yeah, and I mean, the whole trip kind of evolved as we went on.
[03:34:58.138 --> 03:35:01.241]  We finished up searching around LA.
[03:35:01.241 --> 03:35:13.691]  We ran into a guy who, and I think I talked to you about this on the air, who was losing his small business and he had taken a second mortgage out on his home and he was a massage teacher.
[03:35:13.691 --> 03:35:14.852]  He had opened up a massage school.
[03:35:14.852 --> 03:35:15.592]  Well, let's do it this way.
[03:35:15.592 --> 03:35:18.115]  Let's stop right here because I just started thinking to tape this.
[03:35:18.915 --> 03:35:26.540]  Start over, you know, what you did, what you witnessed, kind of run through it, and then the key stuff, they're grabbing their kids, they're grabbing their cars, and then the illegal aliens are above the lobby.
[03:35:26.540 --> 03:35:27.781]  Break down just everything.
[03:35:27.781 --> 03:35:29.342]  You got the floor, I'm just going to sit back.
[03:35:29.342 --> 03:35:42.450]  Okay, well, that morning we started off in Long Beach and we witnessed the, you know, kind of Obama Youth Brigade type activity going on at the dock, or at the heart, was it the wharf?
[03:35:42.450 --> 03:35:43.050]  The wharf there.
[03:35:44.651 --> 03:35:50.515]  And that was interesting, and we were driving around Long Beach, and then we went into L.A., and we went, where are the places we went?
[03:35:50.515 --> 03:35:52.236]  Jason knows L.A.
[03:35:52.236 --> 03:35:56.178]  We came through downtown, and I took him off to see some of the hotbeds.
[03:35:56.178 --> 03:36:00.021]  We went through Watts and South Central, just looking around there.
[03:36:00.021 --> 03:36:01.502]  We went downtown L.A., we went
[03:36:02.402 --> 03:36:06.667]  to the east side and looked at some murals that I've seen before.
[03:36:06.667 --> 03:36:10.851]  Pretty interesting.
[03:36:10.851 --> 03:36:13.073]  Sort of anti-propaganda.
[03:36:13.073 --> 03:36:14.614]  We have some crazy shots over there.
[03:36:14.614 --> 03:36:15.395]  Good job.
[03:36:15.395 --> 03:36:17.537]  And then we stopped by a cemetery.
[03:36:17.537 --> 03:36:20.240]  It's a military cemetery.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:21.321]  And they're digging more graves there.
[03:36:21.321 --> 03:36:21.601]  A lot more.
[03:36:24.404 --> 03:36:28.287]  You know, and then we finished up heading out into Sacramento.
[03:36:28.287 --> 03:36:34.272]  Before that, we met this guy, Dr. John, and he told us his story, and we'll have video of all that.
[03:36:34.272 --> 03:36:46.481]  He made this big sign, and he's actually had people coming in because of this sign, and talking about the bailout and AIG, coming in agreeing with him, you know, that Obama's not doing a good job, and you know, he doesn't see a lot of people, and he actually voted for Obama.
[03:36:46.561 --> 03:36:49.903]  And he, you know, a lot of these people that we talk to, they think Obama is going to save them.
[03:36:49.903 --> 03:36:52.664]  They really are out of touch.
[03:36:52.664 --> 03:36:56.866]  We met a guy in Venice Beach who was, you know, saying the same things.
[03:36:56.866 --> 03:36:58.367]  He thinks Obama's going to do it.
[03:36:58.367 --> 03:37:05.490]  They're aware of the corruption that's going on, but they don't see the difference between Obama and, you know, the corruptors.
[03:37:05.490 --> 03:37:06.171]  Well, it's crazy.
[03:37:06.171 --> 03:37:15.956]  In the same breath that they'll say something like, oh, I can't believe Obama did this, or what about, you know, we don't agree with the bailouts, they'll say, but Obama's going to save us.
[03:37:16.596 --> 03:37:17.436]  I mean, they're totally brainwashed.
[03:37:17.436 --> 03:37:20.938]  Even though they just said, you know, some of the things that he's doing wrong.
[03:37:20.938 --> 03:37:22.338]  The mass brainwashing is there.
[03:37:22.338 --> 03:37:24.839]  And then, so then we went up to Sacramento.
[03:37:24.839 --> 03:37:27.660]  We got there early in the afternoon.
[03:37:27.660 --> 03:37:29.901]  Following the map, we drove around.
[03:37:29.901 --> 03:37:40.366]  We ended up in this little neighborhood, kind of a mixed-use industrial neighborhood, that has some, you know, kind of like machine shops, some concrete mixing plants and stuff, and then two streets of houses.
[03:37:40.366 --> 03:37:42.026]  Really nice looking houses.
[03:37:42.026 --> 03:37:43.627]  Middle class looking, you know, yeah.
[03:37:44.347 --> 03:37:48.031]  And then you see a bunch of people walking up this bike path, and we're like, I bet that's where it is.
[03:37:48.031 --> 03:37:49.112]  So we walked up there.
[03:37:49.112 --> 03:37:53.836]  We just took the little camera with us the first time because we weren't sure what kind of reception we would get.
[03:37:53.836 --> 03:37:58.801]  And, you know, we walk up, walking around, there's a ton of people up there.
[03:37:58.801 --> 03:38:04.626]  I mean, there really are everywhere, and they've created a little community.
[03:38:04.626 --> 03:38:09.311]  If you guys want to pull up the map now, this might be a good time to show the map that we have.
[03:38:10.051 --> 03:38:13.695]  And, you know, they really did, uh, you could see the numbers on there.
[03:38:13.695 --> 03:38:16.777]  The red sections are areas where there were tents.
[03:38:16.777 --> 03:38:19.840]  Uh, the green car, that's where we would park and walk up.
[03:38:19.840 --> 03:38:24.384]  So there's a first section there called the Snake Pit, which had about 25 people in it and 25 tents.
[03:38:24.384 --> 03:38:26.286]  Uh, we're counting tents, not people.
[03:38:26.986 --> 03:38:27.186]  I think so.
[03:38:46.161 --> 03:38:51.384]  And the big 85 section, that is the section that even the homeless people, they called it the ghetto.
[03:38:51.384 --> 03:38:53.145]  The other ones that were there.
[03:38:53.145 --> 03:38:58.268]  And they said, don't go in that area at night unless you know somebody or you're with somebody.
[03:38:58.268 --> 03:39:01.350]  And while we were there, there was an actual fire that broke out.
[03:39:01.350 --> 03:39:03.692]  Is it fair to say that's a racial enclave?
[03:39:04.677 --> 03:39:08.460]  Um, we saw mainly a mixture of whites and blacks.
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:08.561]  In 85?
[03:39:08.561 --> 03:39:08.921]  Yeah, in there.
[03:39:08.921 --> 03:39:11.563]  And then overall, I would say it was more probably 70% white, 30% black.
[03:39:11.563 --> 03:39:12.564]  About that.
[03:39:12.564 --> 03:39:14.205]  And then out of that, maybe another...
[03:39:21.812 --> 03:39:27.056]  Yeah, the younger black kids lived in that area, but there were some white people in there.
[03:39:27.056 --> 03:39:34.502]  And then you go, where the star was, is a guy that we met, he actually was pulling electricity off of the radio tower, and he was the only camp there that had electricity.
[03:39:34.502 --> 03:39:38.465]  With permission from the person who owns that plot, where the radio tower is.
[03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:41.367]  See, there's several corporations that own this area.
[03:39:41.367 --> 03:39:42.108]  It's not all owned by one person.
[03:39:42.108 --> 03:39:43.569]  And they all overlap on top of each other.
[03:39:43.569 --> 03:39:44.410]  There's the railroad.
[03:39:45.100 --> 03:39:54.747]  There is SMUD, which is the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, and also Parks and Recreation, which own the levee.
[03:39:54.747 --> 03:39:55.407]  Right.
[03:39:55.407 --> 03:40:00.411]  Well, give us the rest of the tour, but then I want to get into them grabbing the kids, grabbing the cars, and that's the key.
[03:40:00.411 --> 03:40:03.873]  And then what happens at this facility they are trying to make them go to?
[03:40:04.153 --> 03:40:04.834]  Right.
[03:40:04.834 --> 03:40:09.377]  So there's a lot of facilities there, actually, that are there for the homeless.
[03:40:09.377 --> 03:40:16.222]  Right across, you go through the neighborhoods and cross 16th Street, and then you have the Loaves and Fishes, the Salvation Army, the places that are set up.
[03:40:16.222 --> 03:40:17.823]  They give these guys a hot meal.
[03:40:17.823 --> 03:40:18.643]  You can see the fish.
[03:40:18.643 --> 03:40:20.245]  That's kind of where that area is.
[03:40:21.165 --> 03:40:22.306]  I don't know.
[03:40:41.543 --> 03:40:46.624]  Um, bring them in, they give them one meal, and then at five in the morning, they wake them all up and bring them back out to the stream.
[03:40:46.624 --> 03:40:49.305]  We have video of all of that taking place.
[03:40:49.305 --> 03:40:57.186]  And actually, where they take them to is this place called the Cal Expo Center, and it's an old, it's a giant, huge event.
[03:40:57.186 --> 03:40:58.126]  It's the state fairground.
[03:40:58.126 --> 03:41:00.447]  Yeah, the state fairground with a fair, you know.
[03:41:00.447 --> 03:41:06.068]  It's a very big area, but what they've done is converted a building and a miniature golf course.
[03:41:06.308 --> 03:41:07.888]  Right, that was also a miniature golf course.
[03:41:07.888 --> 03:41:19.092]  So it's very surreal, you know, you have this guarded building and palm trees and this miniature golf course and then people funneling in and apparently they're severely searched and controlled.
[03:41:19.092 --> 03:41:24.754]  And they can't keep anything, they're allowed to bring one bag with them at the bus site where they get picked up.
[03:41:26.138 --> 03:41:26.358]  I don't
[03:41:43.994 --> 03:41:46.618]  They have to leave at 5 a.m., be there at 3 p.m.
[03:41:46.618 --> 03:41:47.820]  to be bused in.
[03:41:47.820 --> 03:41:49.602]  They're searchlight prisoners.
[03:41:49.602 --> 03:41:51.846]  And then it's hard to have a job during those hours.
[03:41:51.846 --> 03:41:55.371]  But then meanwhile, there's massive harassment of those that do have cars.
[03:41:55.371 --> 03:41:58.435]  They're trying to have a job and save money while they live in the shantytown.
[03:41:58.435 --> 03:42:00.398]  Let's go over the type of stuff they go through.
[03:42:00.838 --> 03:42:11.507]  Well, we met a guy named Jason, and the first night we were there, actually, and we ended up interviewing him three times because, you know, for one reason or another, we thought we could get a better, you know, sound recording of his interview.
[03:42:11.507 --> 03:42:13.689]  Yeah, it's chaotic out there, so it's really hard to get a good interview.
[03:42:13.689 --> 03:42:15.110]  It's really windy, too.
[03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:16.992]  But, so, Jason, he was...
[03:42:18.956 --> 03:42:23.279]  Had some problems and he was living, he bought a Winnebago and had, you know, outfitted it out.
[03:42:23.279 --> 03:42:24.260]  He had lost his job.
[03:42:24.260 --> 03:42:31.425]  He bought it really inexpensively and then was, you know, fixing it up, spending all of his money on getting it running.
[03:42:31.425 --> 03:42:32.106]  Right.
[03:42:32.106 --> 03:42:34.928]  And neglected to get the three, four hundred dollar insurance.
[03:42:34.928 --> 03:42:35.468]  Right.
[03:42:35.468 --> 03:42:37.289]  And he got pulled over and didn't have insurance.
[03:42:37.289 --> 03:42:38.630]  So they pulled him out.
[03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:39.711]  They towed it away.
[03:42:39.711 --> 03:42:44.275]  And this is a few, about seven months ago or something, six weeks ago, something like that.
[03:42:44.275 --> 03:42:45.996]  It was a few, it was a few weeks before.
[03:42:45.996 --> 03:42:46.616]  Yeah, in January.
[03:42:46.616 --> 03:42:47.117]  That's what it was.
[03:42:47.877 --> 03:42:53.779]  And so that happened to him there, and then I guess he'd gotten some money to go get it out, and they'd already auctioned it off.
[03:42:53.779 --> 03:42:55.880]  So within two weeks, they had sold all of his possessions off.
[03:42:55.880 --> 03:42:56.760]  I know there's laws.
[03:42:56.760 --> 03:42:58.941]  I think you're supposed to have a few months before they do that.
[03:42:58.941 --> 03:43:06.964]  Yeah, I mean, apparently they probably just thought they could pull one over on this guy, and you know, when you don't have a network of anything, it's real easy to get taken advantage of.
[03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:09.630]  And it wasn't just a vehicle that had a few of his things.
[03:43:09.630 --> 03:43:12.291]  I mean, this owner, Vago, had his entire life in it.
[03:43:12.291 --> 03:43:12.591]  Yeah.
[03:43:12.591 --> 03:43:16.633]  He said there were computers, a DVD player, you know, everything that you would have in your home.
[03:43:16.633 --> 03:43:17.874]  And the police wouldn't let him have that.
[03:43:17.874 --> 03:43:20.055]  No, they took it all.
[03:43:20.055 --> 03:43:22.536]  Not only that, they took all of his stuff.
[03:43:22.536 --> 03:43:24.057]  They left him on the side of the road.
[03:43:24.057 --> 03:43:24.677]  Now, start over.
[03:43:24.677 --> 03:43:25.397]  We're taping for the film.
[03:43:25.397 --> 03:43:25.697]  Go ahead.
[03:43:25.697 --> 03:43:26.458]  Okay.
[03:43:26.458 --> 03:43:26.758]  Go ahead.
[03:43:27.558 --> 03:43:28.318]  I'm Jason.
[03:43:28.318 --> 03:43:37.120]  So yeah, we meet Jason and he's telling us his story about, you know, fixing up this Winnebago, being unable to afford the insurance.
[03:43:37.120 --> 03:43:43.681]  So he was driving around, it was about a month after he got it, and driving around without insurance, got pulled over.
[03:43:43.681 --> 03:43:47.621]  The police had this whole rigmarole where, you know, they were playing good cop, bad cop.
[03:43:47.621 --> 03:43:51.502]  One guy was saying, oh yeah, we're not going to tow you away.
[03:43:51.502 --> 03:43:55.843]  And then finally, in the end, it came out that yes, they were going to take all of his stuff.
[03:43:55.843 --> 03:43:56.603]  They were going to
[03:43:57.236 --> 03:43:59.918]  Toe him and leave him on the side of the road.
[03:43:59.918 --> 03:44:00.899]  With the clothes on his back?
[03:44:00.899 --> 03:44:01.659]  With the clothes on his back.
[03:44:01.659 --> 03:44:02.100]  Absolutely.
[03:44:02.100 --> 03:44:03.481]  Not, can I drop you somewhere?
[03:44:03.481 --> 03:44:04.682]  No.
[03:44:04.682 --> 03:44:07.024]  The clothes on your back, just fend for yourself.
[03:44:07.024 --> 03:44:23.717]  And so somehow he ends up in Tent City and he'd been living there for a while and he lived with this one guy who, the guy had the electricity, he was living with him for a while and then he moved into another tent and he's, you know, this guy used to be a sales manager for a floor tile and adhesive company.
[03:44:23.717 --> 03:44:25.378]  Well the reason this is so important
[03:44:26.641 --> 03:44:28.942]  Is that here's a guy who was lower middle class.
[03:44:28.942 --> 03:44:29.322]  Yeah.
[03:44:29.322 --> 03:44:30.142]  He gets down on his luck.
[03:44:30.142 --> 03:44:34.503]  He tries to get a Winnebago to live in to get a lower grade job and build money back up to get on his feet.
[03:44:34.503 --> 03:44:34.823]  Sure.
[03:44:34.823 --> 03:44:38.564]  This happened to tens of millions of our ancestors, many of them still living in the Great Depression.
[03:44:38.564 --> 03:44:38.984]  Mm-hmm.
[03:44:38.984 --> 03:44:41.485]  You know, Greg Sarrath, that movie's based on real things that happened.
[03:44:41.485 --> 03:44:42.425]  It's even worse.
[03:44:42.425 --> 03:44:45.386]  Seven million starved to death according to major university studies.
[03:44:45.386 --> 03:44:48.166]  And that was when 90% of us were self-sufficient.
[03:44:48.166 --> 03:44:49.727]  So a large portion of those that weren't died.
[03:44:49.727 --> 03:44:50.007]  Yeah.
[03:44:50.649 --> 03:44:56.519]  And they wouldn't arrest you for trying to pull off the road or live in the bushes somewhere in a tent as long as you were non-violent.
[03:44:56.519 --> 03:45:01.267]  They did have bonus marchers who'd been living for years in D.C.
[03:45:01.267 --> 03:45:02.408]  that they then sent in.
[03:45:04.241 --> 03:45:11.004]  Eisenhower as a young captain and the colonel, of course, a World War I hero, was MacArthur.
[03:45:11.004 --> 03:45:14.465]  And they wrote him down, shot him, killed him to get rid of that shantytown.
[03:45:14.465 --> 03:45:16.246]  Because they were there saying, we were promised our bonuses.
[03:45:16.246 --> 03:45:18.106]  So this has happened a few times before.
[03:45:18.106 --> 03:45:27.390]  But the issue here is then the police come, grab his home and his equipment, his computers, everything he's got, won't let him have it, and then take it away.
[03:45:27.390 --> 03:45:29.410]  And now he's just completely blown away.
[03:45:29.410 --> 03:45:30.071]  Pretty much.
[03:45:30.071 --> 03:45:32.091]  And he had gone into the shelters.
[03:45:34.195 --> 03:45:41.823]  With a smile on his face, he was explaining how they search him, and how they wand him down and pat him down, and that it's for his safety, and this and that.
[03:45:41.823 --> 03:45:45.606]  And to them, being treated like this is completely pedestrian now.
[03:45:45.606 --> 03:45:49.050]  Yeah, they seem to not, you know, they think it's for their safety.
[03:45:49.050 --> 03:45:54.775]  We met another guy, a younger black gentleman, who was getting ready to get on the bus and go there, and we're asking him, you know,
[03:45:55.456 --> 03:45:55.856]  Why do you do it?
[03:45:55.856 --> 03:45:56.696]  He's like, well, it's safe.
[03:45:56.696 --> 03:45:58.937]  He's like, I don't go to that tent city because it's dangerous.
[03:45:58.937 --> 03:46:01.497]  So they've, they've told him that it's dangerous over there.
[03:46:01.497 --> 03:46:07.859]  Meanwhile, we're walking around there at 11, 1130 at night after, uh, after interviewing people and, you know, we never got attacked.
[03:46:07.859 --> 03:46:10.519]  We never got, I never felt threatened in any way while we were there.
[03:46:10.519 --> 03:46:12.160]  Well, statistically, take the Superdome.
[03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:13.960]  They made people high and dry go to it.
[03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:14.280]  Right.
[03:46:14.280 --> 03:46:15.360]  And then didn't give them any aid.
[03:46:15.360 --> 03:46:17.241]  There were rapes and murders because the police stood down.
[03:46:17.241 --> 03:46:20.341]  And as this gets worse and worse, this is going to exacerbate.
[03:46:20.341 --> 03:46:22.982]  Now, guys, I just IM'd you a story I want you to put up on screen.
[03:46:24.657 --> 03:46:31.323]  uh... it's a l a times headline because this is separate this is the l a times this weekend
[03:46:32.812 --> 03:46:38.835]  This is, the headline is, Ontario residents only at Tent City.
[03:46:38.835 --> 03:46:41.957]  And since they've changed the headline, that's where it was, the headline about wristbands.
[03:46:41.957 --> 03:46:43.878]  That's how I was able to pull this up.
[03:46:43.878 --> 03:46:50.842]  And it says in here, they take their children, CPS them, they take their dogs, and in this article, they take their cars and RVs.
[03:46:50.842 --> 03:46:51.302]  Wow.
[03:46:51.302 --> 03:46:53.343]  And so, yeah, it's in this story.
[03:46:53.343 --> 03:46:54.404]  I'm going to put it up on screen.
[03:46:54.404 --> 03:46:56.085]  So, this is happening everywhere.
[03:46:56.085 --> 03:46:58.186]  Specifically, what were the stories you heard about them taking children?
[03:46:59.020 --> 03:47:26.830]  uh... one lady we interviewed the last day we were there uh... she didn't matter dot and you know a lot of this is like an afterthought oh my kids get taken away and you know and it was because her mom they got her mom to testify against yeah there's there's various stories but that the main one that i kept hearing was turning stay grandparents yeah against their children right and then taking away those you know the grandchildren thinking that they're going to get the grandchildren but then they just end up going into the system right
[03:47:27.637 --> 03:47:37.613]  Well, how that propaganda works, I've noticed in all these different sitcoms and TV shows and dramas, the grandparents call the CPS and they show you on TV every night on different shows.
[03:47:37.613 --> 03:47:39.115]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[03:47:39.115 --> 03:47:40.838]  And that's one microcosm example.
[03:47:40.838 --> 03:47:42.841]  Those Law and Order type shows, they show that.
[03:47:43.061 --> 03:47:50.624]  Exactly, like, oh, call the police, your neighbor, we saw they had a gun in their house, when most places in the country are gunned down illegally, it's all based in New York or something, you know, in the drama.
[03:47:50.624 --> 03:48:02.047]  And so they think, oh, I'm going to get the grandkids, you know, my daughter's a drunk or whatever, and then, no, no, no, the state's supposedly going to give it to the family, no, they're going to get more money keeping it institutionalized, so folks need to know, that isn't how this is going to work.
[03:48:02.047 --> 03:48:09.330]  Yeah, they're going to get shammed, and, you know, there are at least four or five stories that we talk to with women who, they had their kids, or
[03:48:10.310 --> 03:48:15.162]  You know, they were taken away or their grandkids have been taken away and, you know...
[03:48:16.187 --> 03:48:16.988]  It's really sad.
[03:48:16.988 --> 03:48:30.656]  It was a really sad place to be and it's sad because you see these people trying to make a community for themselves and doing the best they have and you know they're just being given the run around and they're really, that area, there's really nothing going on there.
[03:48:30.656 --> 03:48:37.321]  There's no, they're not building, although there was some construction on the back part, but it used to be the city dump back in the twenties and thirties.
[03:48:37.321 --> 03:48:44.966]  And the issue is, it's going to get worse and worse and they've announced FEMA camps for the homeless where you'll basically be prisoners.
[03:48:45.786 --> 03:48:47.907]  And you're not allowed to be on the streets.
[03:48:47.907 --> 03:48:49.507]  So when you were in L.A.
[03:48:49.507 --> 03:48:50.307]  you said you talked to folks.
[03:48:50.307 --> 03:48:54.048]  Well, there was a shantytown at this park, but now they came and took them away.
[03:48:54.048 --> 03:48:55.029]  And we have the L.A.
[03:48:55.029 --> 03:48:55.269]  Times.
[03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:57.769]  I want to put it on screen for folks watching.
[03:48:57.769 --> 03:49:01.090]  You know, Google Ontario residents only at Tent City.
[03:49:01.090 --> 03:49:01.850]  This is the L.A.
[03:49:01.850 --> 03:49:02.151]  Times.
[03:49:02.151 --> 03:49:03.211]  You scroll down to the bottom.
[03:49:04.312 --> 03:49:04.452]  Yeah.
[03:49:04.452 --> 03:49:04.532]  Yeah.
[03:49:24.534 --> 03:49:28.579]  See, so it's right there in the article for anybody that wants to go read it.
[03:49:28.579 --> 03:49:30.923]  They're kidnapping their children, they're taking their dogs.
[03:49:30.923 --> 03:49:34.788]  But the key to all of this, you said folks brought this up when you asked them.
[03:49:36.158 --> 03:49:38.939]  And so I want to go back over that now, because this is important.
[03:49:38.939 --> 03:49:40.579]  They're pointing out the illegal aliens.
[03:49:40.579 --> 03:49:41.779]  They cannot have driver's licenses.
[03:49:41.779 --> 03:49:43.259]  They cannot have insurance.
[03:49:43.259 --> 03:49:46.680]  The police are in the news all the time saying, if we arrest them, the judges just let them go.
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:48.741]  But they know citizens are in the system.
[03:49:48.741 --> 03:49:50.241]  They'll put up with it.
[03:49:50.241 --> 03:49:55.882]  And so if that was an illegal alien, they wouldn't impound with no insurance that Winnebago.
[03:49:55.882 --> 03:49:57.062]  So talk about that.
[03:49:57.062 --> 03:49:57.402]  Right.
[03:49:57.402 --> 03:49:59.323]  Well, I imagine that
[03:50:00.694 --> 03:50:12.180]  Well they had, let's see who was, one thing we didn't, we did notice is that there were no Hispanics in this, I didn't see any Hispanics, there was a couple non-whites, non-blacks, they were kind of, you know.
[03:50:12.180 --> 03:50:13.420]  And maybe Pacific Islander.
[03:50:13.420 --> 03:50:19.963]  Pacific Islander type, but there was no illegal aliens around and we actually didn't see too many in that area at all.
[03:50:19.963 --> 03:50:22.605]  Well that's because illegal aliens come from a real third world country.
[03:50:23.445 --> 03:50:25.286]  And Americans in a few years will know how to live.
[03:50:25.286 --> 03:50:33.552]  They live in 10-15 to a house, they don't pay any taxes, none of the system, and a lot of them go and get on welfare, so that's why they're driving brand new cars around.
[03:50:33.552 --> 03:50:35.514]  And then they save enough money to buy houses.
[03:50:35.514 --> 03:50:35.914]  Right.
[03:50:35.914 --> 03:50:37.795]  So they know what they're doing.
[03:50:37.795 --> 03:50:39.336]  But cattle Americans don't.
[03:50:39.336 --> 03:50:39.657]  Stay there.
[03:50:39.657 --> 03:50:47.242]  I want to end the show with this, and then we'll have to have it in Part 2 tomorrow or something at the end of the last hour, because I want to fully debrief you guys.
[03:50:47.242 --> 03:50:50.004]  I mean, we sent reporters there to get you a bird's eye view.
[03:50:50.004 --> 03:50:50.864]  We have all this footage.
[03:50:50.864 --> 03:50:52.506]  It's going to be in the new Obama film.
[03:50:53.126 --> 03:51:02.291]  Don't forget Friday, I'm going to do two hours on the concentration camps, but not just that, how popular mechanics like Lynn Becker are going to try to debunk it with straw men.
[03:51:02.291 --> 03:51:10.755]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[03:51:10.755 --> 03:51:21.461]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide, and chloride toxins.
[03:51:21.721 --> 03:51:22.082]  I think so.
[03:51:36.618 --> 03:51:38.079]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:52:06.292 --> 03:52:09.113]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:09.113 --> 03:52:14.995]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.995 --> 03:52:21.497]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.497 --> 03:52:23.478]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.478 --> 03:52:25.939]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.939 --> 03:52:35.662]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[03:52:36.147 --> 03:52:39.109]  That's fascism.
[03:52:39.109 --> 03:52:40.790]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:42.651]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.651 --> 03:52:49.555]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.820 --> 03:52:59.401]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.401 --> 03:53:00.602]  The people strike back.
[03:53:02.463 --> 03:53:03.364]  Attention, gardeners!
[03:53:03.364 --> 03:53:05.965]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[03:53:05.965 --> 03:53:10.509]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:53:10.509 --> 03:53:18.714]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:53:18.714 --> 03:53:21.536]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:53:21.820 --> 03:53:29.444]  ProtoGro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[03:53:29.444 --> 03:53:35.267]  ProtoGro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[03:53:35.267 --> 03:53:41.109]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[03:53:41.109 --> 03:53:44.351]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:53:44.651 --> 03:53:48.236]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[03:53:48.236 --> 03:53:53.322]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[03:53:53.322 --> 03:53:56.206]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:53:56.206 --> 03:53:56.406]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:54:04.844 --> 03:54:05.825]  Don't worry.
[03:54:05.825 --> 03:54:07.867]  This show is documented.
[03:54:07.867 --> 03:54:11.371]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:11.371 --> 03:54:15.235]  Folks, we're almost out of time.
[03:54:15.235 --> 03:54:16.136]  I want you to get a pen and paper.
[03:54:16.136 --> 03:54:17.838]  There's some key info coming up in a moment.
[03:54:19.537 --> 03:54:24.999]  We're going to have to have you guys back here for thirty minutes or so, Amar, to finish telling the whole story of what you saw.
[03:54:24.999 --> 03:54:33.021]  You told me that without you even having to ask over the phone when I talked to you, that they were acutely aware that illegal aliens didn't get their cars taken, weren't under the same rules.
[03:54:33.021 --> 03:54:33.902]  Right.
[03:54:33.902 --> 03:54:35.642]  We spoke with a couple people.
[03:54:35.642 --> 03:54:41.484]  One guy, his name was Tigger, and then there was a lady named Cece, and that was about the same time.
[03:54:41.484 --> 03:54:45.125]  They had a little rant about how they had seen
[03:54:47.026 --> 03:55:02.685]  You know the the preferential treatment to the illegal aliens and they went into a story that you know an experience that they had but they were aware of of the way the regular citizens are treated differently than the illegal aliens and and we also met a guy who
[03:55:03.846 --> 03:55:09.187]  His name was Axel, who had been out there homeless for about 13 years or so.
[03:55:09.187 --> 03:55:12.828]  He was acutely aware of the New World Order and the banking system.
[03:55:12.828 --> 03:55:17.550]  He sounded like one of your listeners, but he had never heard of you.
[03:55:17.550 --> 03:55:18.490]  He was aware of everything.
[03:55:18.490 --> 03:55:23.211]  He was even telling us, you know, get rid of your 401k, buy gold and silver.
[03:55:23.211 --> 03:55:24.492]  He was cool enough.
[03:55:24.492 --> 03:55:25.932]  But you said he still liked Obama.
[03:55:26.872 --> 03:55:34.715]  Well, yeah, he would say, he's like, I think Obama could do a good job, I think he's gonna, I think he's gonna save us, but then he would go, but he lies about everything.
[03:55:34.715 --> 03:55:37.796]  And then he would point out the things that he had done wrong.
[03:55:37.796 --> 03:55:39.417]  He would point out all the lies that Obama did.
[03:55:39.417 --> 03:55:42.038]  And then the same breath, but I still hope, I still hope.
[03:55:42.038 --> 03:55:45.379]  Yeah, they still hope, because I think that's, you know, that's the one thing that they have on, you know.
[03:55:45.379 --> 03:55:48.881]  You guys did a fabulous job, I'm gonna have you back on at least for 30 minutes tomorrow, thank you.
[03:55:48.881 --> 03:55:54.903]  Alright, and we're gonna, we'll write an article about this that'll have everything, it'll be like the expose five page article.
[03:55:55.003 --> 03:55:57.227]  Yeah, well, a lot of folks aren't worried about it because, oh, that's not me.
[03:55:57.227 --> 03:55:58.929]  Folks, when they do the least of us, they do all of us.
[03:55:58.929 --> 03:56:00.732]  I tell you what, it's the future.
[03:56:00.732 --> 03:56:03.236]  The tent cities is where a lot of us are going to end up.
[03:56:05.023 --> 03:56:06.564]  Know your neighbor, that's all I can say.
[03:56:06.564 --> 03:56:07.945]  Yeah, it's community.
[03:56:07.945 --> 03:56:09.307]  Absolutely, my God.
[03:56:09.307 --> 03:56:14.691]  Family, that's why they've broken up family, because that's the unit that would say that the Hispanics have that, so they're not in the 10 cities.
[03:56:14.691 --> 03:56:16.693]  And that's why the establishment leaves them alone.
[03:56:16.693 --> 03:56:18.434]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[03:56:18.434 --> 03:56:23.959]  We got this big FEMA camp plastic coffin story, breaking news, up on InfoWars.com in the next 10-15 minutes.
[03:56:23.959 --> 03:56:26.020]  We couldn't get it up by the end of the show.
[03:56:26.020 --> 03:56:26.741]  But look for that.
[03:56:26.741 --> 03:56:32.545]  I covered the Queen, Obama bowing to her, them treating him like crap, even CNN admitted, get out of there!
[03:56:33.406 --> 03:56:33.887]  We're good to go.
[03:56:50.299 --> 03:56:51.680]  They are devaluing the dollar.
[03:56:51.680 --> 03:56:53.221]  They've announced they're going to kill it.
[03:56:53.221 --> 03:56:54.322]  Global currency.
[03:56:54.322 --> 03:57:02.068]  Folks, you are insane if you don't put some of your liquid assets, stocks, bonds, 401Ks, and gold and silver, and physically hold it.
[03:57:02.068 --> 03:57:05.071]  The news is admitting you should do it now, but saying buy gold stocks.
[03:57:05.071 --> 03:57:05.771]  Whatever, folks.
[03:57:05.771 --> 03:57:07.413]  You want to physically hold it.
[03:57:07.413 --> 03:57:09.154]  Ted's got an incredible deal today.
[03:57:09.154 --> 03:57:10.655]  Ted, tell folks the deal you've got.
[03:57:10.655 --> 03:57:13.938]  Yeah, right now what I have, again, I've got the British Sovereigns at 272.
[03:57:13.938 --> 03:57:16.280]  I've got the Franks at 218.
[03:57:16.280 --> 03:57:17.901]  Gold has been up as high as 935 today.
[03:57:19.803 --> 03:57:28.168]  Obviously, with the protests and everything that's going on in that G20, you know, Russia calling for gold as a back, you know, for the world currency.
[03:57:28.168 --> 03:57:31.630]  I mean, there's a lot of things to, a lot of reasons to be getting away from the U.S.
[03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:32.450]  dollar.
[03:57:32.450 --> 03:57:35.472]  But yeah, right now we have the Franks at $8.69.
[03:57:35.472 --> 03:57:38.093]  I've got a real good supply of U.S.
[03:57:38.093 --> 03:57:39.174]  Eagles now, finally.
[03:57:39.174 --> 03:57:41.715]  I've got some of these Panda coins.
[03:57:41.715 --> 03:57:44.236]  I have Pamp Swiss bars.
[03:57:44.236 --> 03:57:47.198]  I was really able to pick up a good quantity of items here.
[03:57:47.594 --> 03:57:57.921]  When the things were dipping down there at right around that 9-10 to 9-16 level and I really encourage people to get involved now because now it's just just too much trouble.
[03:57:57.921 --> 03:57:58.441]  Call us at 800-686-9000.
[03:58:01.832 --> 03:58:02.293]  2237.
[03:58:02.293 --> 03:58:02.953]  Again, it's 800-686-2237.
[03:58:02.953 --> 03:58:06.735]  They really should be getting involved.
[03:58:06.735 --> 03:58:10.217]  And folks, I procrastinate, you procrastinate.
[03:58:10.217 --> 03:58:17.561]  I've got to have some money in the bank to run this office, but then I'm always going, but they can implode any time and they're openly announcing they're going to hyperinflate and devalue.
[03:58:17.561 --> 03:58:19.802]  I mean, this is serious times we're coming into.
[03:58:19.802 --> 03:58:21.042]  Get gold and silver.
[03:58:21.042 --> 03:58:21.663]  Get prepared.
[03:58:21.663 --> 03:58:23.444]  Modest Resources, the best deals.
[03:58:23.444 --> 03:58:25.345]  Those deals he just offered are insanely good.
[03:58:25.345 --> 03:58:25.405]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:58:28.086 --> 03:58:30.388]  And they'll be there, the brokers, until midnight tonight.
[03:58:30.388 --> 03:58:33.110]  Give them a call, 800-686-237.
[03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:34.371]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[03:58:34.371 --> 03:58:35.271]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:35.271 --> 03:58:35.551]  You bet.
[03:58:35.551 --> 03:58:37.092]  Alright, we're out of here in five seconds.
[03:58:37.092 --> 03:58:38.614]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:38.614 --> 03:58:40.675]  Powerful First Hour, Infowars.com.
[03:58:40.675 --> 03:58:43.097]  God bless you.
[03:58:43.097 --> 03:58:46.619]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.701 --> 03:58:53.403]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.403 --> 03:58:58.150]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.150 --> 03:59:01.114]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.114 --> 03:59:04.158]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.158 --> 03:59:08.885]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.085 --> 03:59:10.225]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.225 --> 03:59:13.467]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.467 --> 03:59:20.449]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
