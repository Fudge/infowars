[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:02.000 --> 00:14.000]  You
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  In for wars tomorrow's news today
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  You
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.720]  The domestic war on terror is here is coming after
[01:22.800 --> 01:28.760]  Half of the country the helicopters have left Afghanistan and now they've landed here at home
[01:28.760 --> 01:36.880]  The left is hunting the right sticking them in Guantanamo Bay for American citizens leaving them there to rock
[01:36.880 --> 01:39.800]  We are dealing with an insurgency in the United States
[01:39.800 --> 01:46.480]  The terrorism for white supremacy is the most lethal threat to homeroom. I've been told that I'm a white national
[01:49.480 --> 01:52.800]  They've begun to fight a new enemy in a new war on terror
[01:56.800 --> 01:58.800]  False flags have happened in this country
[01:58.800 --> 02:05.580]  One of which may have been January 6
[02:18.200 --> 02:25.360]  Well, if you took a snapshot of the country right now here is what you'd see on the one hand you have all that war as
[02:25.360 --> 02:32.680]  The American right and the party it has consumed the Trumpist Republican Party takes aim at every civic and cultural institution
[02:33.280 --> 02:40.840]  From whether we live or die from COVID to our schools and history and democracy itself banning books senators defending Nazi salutes and
[02:41.120 --> 02:47.880]  Unhinged anti-vax protest at school boards and the most popular conservative cable news host going full Alex Jones
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.040]  Promoting a fringe conspiracy theory about the January 6 insurrection being a false flag
[02:53.040 --> 03:00.160]  So that is all happening one of the guests on Tuckum's show last night shortly after he unveiled his propaganda to rewrite the January 6
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.680]  Insurrection was Glenn Junkin the Republican candidate for governor Virginia
[03:04.920 --> 03:11.320]  The new poster child for the Republicans current twisted priority of banning books when they're not trying to reenact Fahrenheit
[03:11.520 --> 03:18.560]  451 Republicans are continuing to lose their minds over the Justice Department's effort to protect school board officials threatened with violence
[03:18.560 --> 03:25.920]  Over race conscious lessons and mass rules when you have norm core supposedly Republicans like Glenn Junkin
[03:26.320 --> 03:32.240]  Who's running in Virginia people like Ted Cruz who used to be you know, I'm a fiscal conservative that used to be his thing
[03:32.240 --> 03:34.240]  I'm a constitutional conservative, but they're now
[03:35.520 --> 03:44.000]  Normalizing and rubbing elbows with open white nationalism white replacement theory some really dangerous ideologies that are designed to whip up
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.720]  You know particularly white men and working-class white men non-college white men what we're seeing here is
[03:52.160 --> 03:58.520]  Under the guise of free speech a lot of the veneer of kind of respectability that that that mainstream
[03:59.120 --> 04:06.240]  politicians and and and mainstream news platforms carry you have actually now Holocaust minimization happening
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.280]  I used to watch some of these ISIS recruitment videos back when I would used to a day-side program
[04:12.280 --> 04:15.360]  They were very similar in that they showed lots of action
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.880]  Well, there you go, they're telling you that Tucker Carlson wants to burn books
[04:21.560 --> 04:24.800]  They're telling you he's denying the Holocaust. They're telling you that
[04:25.680 --> 04:28.200]  He's ISIS or Al Qaeda recruiting videos
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.880]  None of that was true. It was all a lie. In fact, it's the left opening the borders up to radical Islam
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.600]  It's the left that's censoring and coming everybody's speech
[04:36.600 --> 04:42.000]  Parents not wanting their schools that they pay for their quote independent school boards not wanting
[04:42.360 --> 04:48.680]  Critical race theory that white people are inherently evil taught or they don't want pedophilia taught. Oh, oh, you mean they don't want
[04:49.120 --> 04:51.620]  Child porn in the libraries. That's not book burning
[04:52.120 --> 04:57.440]  That's not letting you pervert pedophiles have accessed our children big broadcast lined up. Stay with us

[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  All right, let me just as calmly
[06:45.120 --> 06:47.120]  As I can
[06:47.120 --> 06:52.080]  As I can go over the news and the guests that we're going to have on the broadcast today
[06:53.680 --> 06:55.680]  Well look right here what I have
[06:56.240 --> 06:58.240]  doctors remember
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.840]  Now
[07:01.840 --> 07:04.240]  Nobody is too young for a heart attack
[07:05.680 --> 07:10.000]  These ads are being run on tv radio print on the sides of buses
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.720]  In texas in new york in pennsylvania in california and suddenly they're running in india
[07:17.440 --> 07:21.520]  and australia and the uk and germany and everywhere
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.600]  Just like drag queen story times suddenly started five years ago all around the world funded by a consortium of fortune 100 corporations
[07:30.320 --> 07:32.320]  including at&t
[07:32.800 --> 07:36.960]  At&t it's out in the news today is actually going to teach all their employees in a quote
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.400]  Re-education seminars that are mandatory
[07:41.120 --> 07:47.200]  That white people are the problem and are inherently evil. I have the actual copy of the syllabus
[07:50.400 --> 07:57.280]  Yes, this is the new world order. This is the depopulation operation having us all fight and kill each other all the globalist the industrialized
[07:57.680 --> 07:59.680]  And hit us with bio weapons
[08:00.160 --> 08:03.920]  So let me just show you this little stack and we'll go into this more. This is just today
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.520]  From all over local newspapers around the country
[08:08.240 --> 08:11.040]  Doctors remember they're telling you to remember
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.600]  Nobody now suddenly
[08:14.400 --> 08:16.400]  Is too young for a heart attack
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.360]  They say suddenly above 12 year olds have all been having heart attacks all over the western world
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.160]  And they say we don't know why and mpr stories and abc stories and these others just say it's just a new thing
[08:28.240 --> 08:31.360]  Just get used to oh and strokes and blood clots in the lungs
[08:31.360 --> 08:34.400]  But no one knows what it is
[08:36.640 --> 08:42.400]  And if you say what it is from the cdc's own documents last October saying get ready for more heart attacks and blood clots and strokes
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.240]  From the shots
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.000]  Well, you get censored and the head of youtube has been bragging and I have a clip
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.840]  Saying hey, we censored over a million videos
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.600]  These people made a little bit of a cry a little bit of a yell a little bit of a hey my mom dad my brother died
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.160]  My sister died my child died. Hey, they had to cut my leg off. Hey, I had a stroke. Hey, I was in great shape
[09:02.400 --> 09:05.920]  I was 20 years old my job. Let me take a shot and then I had a heart attack
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.760]  Hey, you try to talk about it. Well on any platform instagram you name it you get banned
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.520]  Like the young man the doctor said at college athlete had the microcarditis can't can't play sports anymore
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.640]  They told him yeah, the uh Pfizer shot made you have a heart attack and uh
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.800]  The un was in well, it was three weeks ago. The un was in yahoo news
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.320]  The un it said the un is the fact checker. It runs the facebook instagram fact check
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.440]  He had four and a half million views talking about it. Sure. We caught he after we took him down for it
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.640]  He got his doctor to go public and say it was caused by the vaccine
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.040]  But that was banned too and we're just not gonna let you scare people even of what you said was true
[09:45.600 --> 09:46.720]  We're the un
[09:46.720 --> 09:49.200]  We're in charge of america
[09:49.200 --> 09:56.720]  And yes, there's a lot of top doctors coming out saying they pull a healthy children from school before giving them a covid vaccine
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.880]  But they're rolling ahead with the five and ups. So so just suddenly
[10:01.840 --> 10:05.120]  When I've got the articles here and the screenshots from around the world
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.840]  When I see a screenshot of it, I just don't believe it. I went and followed it through on all these and these are indeed everywhere in fact
[10:12.800 --> 10:16.720]  Friend of mine sent me a text from Dallas and it's on the side of the buses there
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.920]  But here it is doctors remember now. Nobody's too young for a heart attack. Wow
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.400]  It's a new and improved wonderful thing. And what do they report all over the western world?
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.080]  Massive increases in heart attacks and blood clots in the young
[10:31.200 --> 10:32.320]  Oh
[10:32.320 --> 10:38.320]  Spotted in Whitby on Durham transit. Are they normalizing this?
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.720]  What's to come and it says kids have strokes too
[10:42.720 --> 10:45.840]  Know the warning signs. Yeah
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.640]  Oh, hey, look at this guy though. Everything's okay. This is the times of india biggest publication in the second most popular country in the world
[10:53.680 --> 10:59.360]  Puneet Raj Kamar very popular a list movie star over there in bollywood
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.280]  He got his first dose of the covid-19 vaccine and then he got his second one recently and hey, he's he's doing fine folks
[11:07.280 --> 11:12.320]  Oh now he died of a heart attack yet, uh, 46 years old
[11:13.200 --> 11:15.200]  Yesterday. Oh, oh, but hey
[11:16.400 --> 11:18.400]  Too many people right. Oh, hey
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.880]  How about that top radio host? He got the shots. He's dead of heart attack too, but that's just yesterday too, but hey, no big deal
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.600]  Radio legend dies suddenly every second shot and it goes on, but hey, let's not listen to that. That's all just anecdotal
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.960]  Let's look at this new article out from zero hedge dot com at the a advisor explains
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.760]  Why he abstained from vote on Pfizer covid-19 vaccine for kids?
[11:44.720 --> 11:46.720]  So I thought hey, I'm not want to read his open letter
[11:47.200 --> 11:49.200]  And why he said don't do it and he said well
[11:50.240 --> 11:54.160]  They don't track in this public study where they said at the board meeting
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.080]  We're going to legalize it to test it on children as guinea pigs. We'll never know if it's dangerous or not
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.480]  Remember, that's the clip we played a couple times that cue that up
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.960]  If you can a FDA board member said I'm voting. Yes, because I want to see if this hurts people or not
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.640]  Wow, what an amazing statement, but see oh when I saw that I said there's something to that. Uh-huh
[12:11.680 --> 12:15.280]  They're not tracking the children after the injections
[12:16.400 --> 12:23.120]  Even in their fake studies, they've been running. Oh, it says right here. They only follow it after the injection for three months
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.160]  As those sweet little protein crystals start nesting in the lungs and the heart and the arteries in the brain
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.160]  Yep, there it is on screen. I cue it up. Let me know when you have the audio radio play it
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.440]  I don't I don't want to just say things here on here in case new listeners are driving on the highway
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.280]  They think all this guy just says this I heard about I heard about this guy
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.240]  He's Alex Jones. He's that guy you can't trust. He's that guy that uh
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.240]  Is so incredibly deceptive
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.600]  Here is the FDA board member
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.640]  Dr. Ding dong or whatever his name here it is
[13:00.160 --> 13:02.160]  And I think what's pleased me here is that
[13:03.280 --> 13:09.200]  It is a very sort of personal choice if I had a child who had who was a transplant recipient
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.160]  I would really want to be able to use a vaccine like this and there are certainly kids who
[13:14.560 --> 13:16.560]  Probably should be vaccinated
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.320]  The question of how broad we use it though. I think it's a substantial one
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.720]  And I know it's not our question, but I and I know we're kind of pumping that uh to uh,
[13:26.720 --> 13:28.240]  ACIP
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.800]  Um, but I I do think that it's a relatively close call and as Dr.
[13:32.800 --> 13:34.400]  Liedi just said as Dr.
[13:34.400 --> 13:35.520]  Dan said
[13:35.520 --> 13:38.960]  It really is going to be a question of what the prevailing conditions are
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.360]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we're going to be able to do it
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.200]  The vaccine is unless you start giving us, you know, that's just the way it goes. That's how we found out about
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.920]  Rare complications of other vaccines
[13:54.080 --> 13:54.880]  Oh, wow
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.080]  Vaccine and I do think that we are going to I do think we should vote to approve it
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.040]  Okay, so that's dr. Eric Rubin. Thank you
[14:04.320 --> 14:06.480]  But the board member that voted against it said, uh
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.280]  That this could be dangerous and that it's not been tested properly and they're not going to even do follow-ups
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.280]  In the actual studies much less the general public, but for three months
[14:16.480 --> 14:20.320]  Kind of important little tidbit for you, but oh, let's just move on
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.480]  Yeah, so apple runs death camps. They're liberal. It's all right. So
[14:25.120 --> 14:27.120]  Pfizer's
[14:27.200 --> 14:33.440]  Advising governments to lock healthy people up during the next pandemic to quote protect them and have drones to liberate their food
[14:33.520 --> 14:35.840]  But that's okay because they're liberal, right?
[14:35.840 --> 14:40.720]  No, none of them are liberal folks. They're fascistic evil technocracy
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.080]  Taking over our planet, but how amazing is that?
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.120]  That when these people die, they don't tell you that oh, they'd had the shot first
[14:51.280 --> 14:53.600]  You got to go to their twitter to find them bragging about it
[14:55.200 --> 15:01.040]  Oh, oh and who else died the main spokesperson for vaccines in india who was 50 something years old and by the way
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.440]  Was a sports guy. He was also a movie star. He was even bigger than this last guy that died
[15:06.160 --> 15:13.040]  And he died the day after he took the shot from a big old fat juicy heart attack
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.160]  Which they tell you in the cdc's own documents. They predicted what happened last october
[15:18.800 --> 15:20.800]  Because they'd already seen what was happening in the uk
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.640]  And the british government ignored the military in their own advisory group that said jam on the brakes
[15:26.640 --> 15:31.760]  Remember the even the yahu headline was don't give this to three groups says british advisory board
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.040]  above 75
[15:35.280 --> 15:36.880]  below 16
[15:36.880 --> 15:38.800]  and pregnant but
[15:38.800 --> 15:40.800]  They're full steam ahead
[15:41.440 --> 15:46.880]  And just normalizing nasty population. All right. I haven't even scratched the surface. You think that's big
[15:48.400 --> 15:50.400]  Wait till we come back

[17:57.840 --> 18:03.760]  I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours and i'm looking at mainstream news
[18:03.760 --> 18:09.520]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.640]  That the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children
[18:15.200 --> 18:20.080]  Because he in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks
[18:21.200 --> 18:24.080]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the associated press
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.360]  It's not getting any circulation. It's not on the national news
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.680]  And it's very hard to even find on places like instagram or twitter. It's just crazy and then
[18:31.680 --> 18:37.760]  Fauci was on tv just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines. It doesn't hurt anybody
[18:38.080 --> 18:41.200]  Your conspiracy theorists if you say it it's just crazy
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.320]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems
[18:46.560 --> 18:48.960]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened
[18:49.600 --> 18:54.400]  That's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap

[20:20.000 --> 20:24.080]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[20:24.080 --> 20:32.320]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he lie from austin texas broadcasting world-wide
[20:33.040 --> 20:35.040]  It's alex jones
[20:36.480 --> 20:42.560]  So now there is a new phenomenon across the united states and in europe and australia. It's all funded by the big
[20:43.040 --> 20:45.280]  corporations have all the articles coming up next segment
[20:46.960 --> 20:50.880]  To have drag queen time in the middle schools and the high schools
[20:50.880 --> 20:54.960]  Where the young men and boys dress up as women
[20:55.760 --> 21:00.720]  And then pretend to be prostitutes having sex with male members of the staff
[21:01.680 --> 21:03.680]  While they all wear pink
[21:04.080 --> 21:06.080]  And other similar things. So
[21:06.960 --> 21:08.960]  This is what we're teaching
[21:09.120 --> 21:13.360]  Under corporate funding. This is what's going on while the communist chinese
[21:13.840 --> 21:16.480]  Fire live ammunition each other in their military drills
[21:17.120 --> 21:19.120]  That is coming up. But the reason I raise this
[21:19.120 --> 21:21.120]  And we'll get to all this coming up
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.680]  next segment
[21:23.680 --> 21:25.680]  is that
[21:26.400 --> 21:31.600]  Whether it's banners on the side of buses all over the world where the moderna fiser shots are being given
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Or whether it's pedophile storytime
[21:35.360 --> 21:39.040]  It's all the big corporations funding this chief amongst them apple and
[21:39.760 --> 21:43.680]  Other companies like at and t and again, they're in the news here today doing that
[21:43.680 --> 21:49.440]  AT&T the articles on info wars dot com teaching critical race theory and saying that quote
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.080]  Whiteness is inherently bad and that white people are the root of problems and that white americans are uniquely bad
[21:56.480 --> 21:58.080]  So that's a quote
[21:58.080 --> 22:00.080]  uniquely bad
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.400]  And I love how twitter and facebook everybody will ban you if you show the actual
[22:06.800 --> 22:09.280]  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 year olds
[22:09.280 --> 22:13.360]  Humping on may other males and and people period
[22:14.640 --> 22:17.600]  But we're supposed to blur it all out to show you what they're doing to the children like oh
[22:17.600 --> 22:22.240]  Don't show the book that the middle school has that shows children having sex with adults
[22:22.560 --> 22:26.320]  You can't show that that's child porn that can only be shown to children
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.320]  There's the article at and t's racial
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.480]  Reeducation program by the way, that's in quotes. That's their term asserts white people are the problem
[22:36.480 --> 22:39.760]  In fact, I got so many articles here. I couldn't find that in my stack a minute ago
[22:39.760 --> 22:43.440]  Well, you guys please reprint me that so I can cover it with this other stack next segment
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.440]  But I'm just mentioning now what's coming up
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.880]  Then this all dovetails together with the collapse of the border
[22:50.800 --> 22:53.200]  It's true. It's been proposed. It's in the legislation
[22:54.480 --> 22:56.480]  400
[22:56.480 --> 22:58.480]  plus if you round up
[22:58.560 --> 23:00.560]  $500,000 a piece
[23:01.280 --> 23:04.800]  For anyone who claims they were separated from their child
[23:04.800 --> 23:10.800]  Even though they're on record most the time having kidnapped children that people use to get across the border and to be turned loose in the U.S
[23:10.800 --> 23:13.600]  And then they give the children back to smugglers coyotes
[23:14.080 --> 23:16.480]  Who then bring them back into mexico over and over again?
[23:16.960 --> 23:18.960]  That's all confirmed
[23:18.960 --> 23:22.240]  But none of that gets investigated none of the child's smelling it stopped. So now
[23:22.960 --> 23:24.960]  It's being proposed
[23:24.960 --> 23:31.360]  U.S. In talks with hundreds of millions to pay hundreds of millions to families separated at border
[23:31.360 --> 23:37.280]  Wall Street Journal family members separated at border to get 400 and $50,000 under this
[23:38.160 --> 23:42.960]  Plan and if you wonder why there's giant hordes of people flooding this way, that's what's happening
[23:42.960 --> 23:44.960]  I'm gonna give you the rest of the story behind this
[23:46.080 --> 23:52.640]  Coming up as well because I haven't even scratched the surface of that for you yet
[23:52.640 --> 23:55.760]  But I will be doing it because you don't think
[23:56.320 --> 24:00.320]  They're actually giving that 450 plus thousand dollars to each one of these individuals
[24:00.320 --> 24:02.320]  No
[24:02.880 --> 24:05.360]  I know this because I've seen it in austin and san Antonio
[24:05.920 --> 24:12.080]  I'm born here in texas. I've watched this with county and city officials that have been busted and arrested for it
[24:12.240 --> 24:14.080]  That never gets much attention
[24:14.080 --> 24:16.720]  A lot of them have dungeons buried usually as basements
[24:17.360 --> 24:20.960]  Under their houses that they have actually built because they average texas houses and have basements
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.080]  Where they keep prisoners that they've smuggled in to shake more money out of their families around the country
[24:26.080 --> 24:33.600]  And what they do is while they're exploiting these people for slave labor and sweatshops is they skim the welfare
[24:33.600 --> 24:36.080]  They sign them up for about half the money they get
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.680]  And they also sign them up for tax refunds and things like that and they'll have examples of one house in austin
[24:42.320 --> 24:48.400]  Had over a billion dollars in tax refunds sent to it one year alone and no criminal investigation was launched under obama
[24:48.640 --> 24:50.640]  See I said I covered next segment. I'm doing it now
[24:50.640 --> 24:56.720]  They they use these people as cutouts as mules not to haul in heroin or fentanyl or cocaine
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.200]  But to haul in themselves to be signed up in the social safety net
[25:01.760 --> 25:03.280]  to then
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.440]  Pay that money into the democratic party and into the different criminal syndicates
[25:07.840 --> 25:10.880]  So they're not going to give $50,000 to these people
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.800]  they're going to give
[25:12.800 --> 25:15.120]  Almost $500,000 to them that is then paid
[25:15.120 --> 25:21.120]  Directly into a quote local bank and then there it disappears and the fbi will do nothing
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.240]  They are blocked from doing it. They're heavily involved a lot of them at the higher ups the low level fbi is not involved
[25:26.480 --> 25:28.480]  But the higher ups are running it
[25:29.200 --> 25:30.400]  So
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.160]  That's why you got the smugglers, you know dropping the babies over the top and doing all the rest of it
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.000]  And then they've got an id that matches that with the child later. They show up and say hey
[25:38.480 --> 25:39.520]  I want my
[25:39.520 --> 25:45.520]  $40,000 as I dropped my baby off over the thing and then you know found out where they were through the database and came back
[25:45.520 --> 25:48.000]  And got them six months later. I've been abused give me that
[25:48.640 --> 25:51.360]  Give me that half a million right now. So that's coming up next segment
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.200]  And then we've got what's happening in the economy and with the supply chain
[25:55.200 --> 25:58.320]  We've got a lot of big developments on that front. That's what I'm going to hit first
[25:59.680 --> 26:01.680]  Right now ladies and gentlemen
[26:01.920 --> 26:05.760]  when I told you 20 months ago that the shutdown of the
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.720]  Third world under an ongoing lockdown in many areas of Africa and Latin America would cause
[26:11.200 --> 26:15.520]  Hundreds of millions to start starving in the next few years hundreds of millions would then finally starve
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.120]  The last number that you and said 25 million extra died the last year and a half from the lockdown not from the virus
[26:22.240 --> 26:24.240]  Just a just a non salon 25 million
[26:25.200 --> 26:26.960]  That number is months old
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.360]  And those there's those that have the money those that are upper middle class in those countries
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.120]  Which means, you know, they make $50 a day or so not $50 a year. They're all on their way up here
[26:38.640 --> 26:42.000]  And along with criminals and rabble and people that are also handicapped
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.280]  Who want to be taken care of to weigh down the system and bankrupted according to the globalist plan
[26:47.520 --> 26:54.240]  That's why Soros has his da's all over the country releasing the armed robbers and you know that guy up by dallas
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.480]  In a liberal jurisdiction shot three people
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.360]  But I guess because they were white and he was black they released him two hours later
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.480]  They're still in the hospital and they said well, they got bullied, but it wasn't even true. He just shot three people
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.200]  That's all just to have a culture and everything just unravel and totally collapse
[27:12.480 --> 27:14.800]  So that's the current operation. That's the current plan
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.480]  That we're dealing with and so I've got a big stack of articles. I'll get to next hour
[27:21.120 --> 27:24.000]  dealing with the fact that the supply chain is totally breaking down
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.480]  And only about 80 percent of packages across the board are getting delivered right now
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.520]  There's there's there's just mass breakdowns of the drivers mass breakdowns. It's fedex amazon
[27:34.080 --> 27:36.880]  usps everything but it looks like fedex is the worst
[27:37.680 --> 27:38.640]  And this is where we are
[27:38.640 --> 27:43.520]  So it's going to just get more insane towards christmas into next year when the hospitals are full of the dead and dying
[27:43.680 --> 27:46.640]  From the vaccine reactions and the ade
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.240]  And more so I would tell you to support info wars

[29:11.840 --> 29:15.280]  They're being destroyed all the checks and balances are being annihilated
[29:15.680 --> 29:22.320]  Our borders are being destroyed our currencies being destroyed and the american people have been listed as terrorist by the rogue federal government
[29:23.040 --> 29:26.480]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening
[29:26.480 --> 29:28.240]  We have a good chance of beating these people
[29:28.240 --> 29:31.360]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it

[31:57.760 --> 32:03.280]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[32:03.920 --> 32:09.520]  And in that documentary I predicted the globalist to establish world government by releasing a virus
[32:10.480 --> 32:15.520]  Demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society
[32:16.160 --> 32:17.840]  And now they've done it
[32:17.840 --> 32:24.640]  How did I know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked
[32:25.680 --> 32:29.840]  You see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time was claus schwa
[32:30.480 --> 32:35.200]  And our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great recent
[32:35.680 --> 32:39.840]  Well, we're now living in the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.280]  None attached to the tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship no due process
[32:45.280 --> 32:47.280]  The structure of the family
[32:47.840 --> 32:54.480]  And then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poison us in the populace
[32:54.800 --> 32:57.440]  This is what info wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future
[32:57.440 --> 33:11.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[33:11.440 --> 33:41.360]  All right, I just got some new information laid on me from the world economic forum that is
[33:41.520 --> 33:46.880]  Huge and I confirmed it, but I'm going to get even more evidence of it and cover it at the start of the next hour
[33:47.280 --> 33:49.280]  I'm going to leave it at that
[33:49.920 --> 33:53.280]  But they're not just planning to put nanoparticles in the vaccines
[33:54.080 --> 33:56.080]  And we knew this for a long time
[33:56.880 --> 33:59.840]  So I'll be getting to that next hour. You can probably make a guess
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.800]  You know big gates has been developing vaccines that quote grow biological live vaccines that grow in
[34:07.440 --> 34:10.640]  strawberries that grow in cherries that grow in
[34:10.640 --> 34:12.640]  bananas
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.560]  That print me some more on that I'm going to cover that next hour because they're they're going ahead with it
[34:21.520 --> 34:28.240]  You don't just think peter dazzic wanted to spray nanoparticles in caves in china. You don't think pouts. He was going to stop there
[34:29.440 --> 34:31.600]  See people keep saying man. They've gone for broke
[34:32.080 --> 34:36.000]  The hospitals are full of people dying of heart attacks and strokes including young people that are taking the shots
[34:36.480 --> 34:38.480]  They'll never get away with this. Yeah, they will
[34:38.480 --> 34:39.760]  because
[34:39.760 --> 34:47.280]  They're going to launch something far worse and you'll forget about all this death and you'll think back on this is a very fun time
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.600]  And meanwhile they've got
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.280]  velociraptors
[34:53.280 --> 34:56.880]  In the their propaganda pieces at the UN telling you not to have children
[34:58.480 --> 35:05.520]  To save the earth do not go it do not go extinct. Do not have children. Take your shots. Do not go extinct. I love you
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.240]  It's all just surreal blurring reality with unreality
[35:11.200 --> 35:15.760]  And for people that are in a trance, they don't know what they have been hit by
[35:16.800 --> 35:18.800]  Okay
[35:19.600 --> 35:22.160]  Let's go ahead and start drilling into the next
[35:23.520 --> 35:24.880]  big
[35:24.880 --> 35:26.880]  piece of news
[35:27.840 --> 35:31.680]  That I was getting to earlier that I was alluding to
[35:31.680 --> 35:33.680]  Do
[35:33.840 --> 35:35.840]  Let's do that
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.400]  Right now and uh radio listeners are going to be spared from having to watch this
[35:41.120 --> 35:44.080]  And for for adults, uh, it's just humiliating
[35:44.640 --> 35:49.120]  It's sad to see what they've turned our young men into and what's going on around the country, but
[35:49.840 --> 35:53.840]  They are now having not just drag queen story times for your five six seven eight nine
[35:54.400 --> 35:56.400]  10 year olds at the schools in some cases
[35:56.960 --> 35:59.840]  I like the case of Denver, Colorado unannounced to the parents
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.920]  We're disgusting looking men dressed up in clown outfits
[36:05.760 --> 36:09.760]  Show up and you have your children sit on their laps while they have erections bulging in their pants
[36:10.400 --> 36:12.400]  Well, now that's not enough
[36:12.800 --> 36:15.280]  Now in Kentucky and this is happening other places
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.160]  High school principal who got lap dance from student. It's on video
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.720]  Was also fondled by boy during drag show
[36:24.720 --> 36:32.080]  Oh, that's right. Had his chest and neck and crotch grabbed like you're in the champagne room at the local
[36:32.800 --> 36:34.640]  topless bar
[36:34.640 --> 36:37.840]  You can say what you want about those places, you know, they're of age. It's it's their
[36:38.960 --> 36:40.960]  That their choice to do it
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.560]  Uh, you know, the church can tell you that's bad and it probably is instructive lifestyle sure
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.560]  But I'm not stopping people from that. That's their choice. But this is just pure evil
[36:49.200 --> 36:51.840]  And this is where it's all going and and and and then
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.160]  Uh, a a a man dresses a woman with a wig wearing a mask
[36:57.040 --> 37:01.920]  Talk about cult programming running up groping on other males other boys
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.520]  Who try to get away from it?
[37:03.520 --> 37:09.120]  So now sexual assault by a male on a male you see is cute in the gay world, right?
[37:09.440 --> 37:11.440]  That's why you have the james bond
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.320]  Actor saying I like going to gay bars because heterosexual bars are so rude and bad and full of rape
[37:16.480 --> 37:18.480]  Of course statistically it's the opposite, but
[37:19.120 --> 37:21.120]  That's that's how this
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.560]  That's how this works and then let's show the photos of the lap dances and twerking
[37:27.280 --> 37:28.960]  going on
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.960]  Also, here's some photos of that
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.160]  With uh male students with their shaved legs and everything
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.040]  Humping on the teacher and giving them a lap dance caressing their body and the
[37:42.640 --> 37:44.640]  Coach getting up and simulating
[37:45.440 --> 37:47.440]  Sex anal sex with the young man
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Who's wearing fishnet stockings
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.080]  Imagine the chai comms must really be proud of the propaganda. They put into our country. Wow
[37:54.960 --> 38:00.400]  And there's a report breaking investigation underway after kentucky high school host drag pageant
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.160]  Featuring male teens in lingerie giving lap dances to staff
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.440]  The sexualization of the children. I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual. It's wrong. Here's photos of the
[38:10.240 --> 38:17.680]  Groping of the stomach and then down to the groin area and again bumping the buttocks into
[38:17.680 --> 38:23.760]  Uh the through the pants onto the male genitals of the principal the coach
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.400]  Humping the coach
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.360]  Paul Watson did a report on it sick high school allows kids to perform lap dances for teachers
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.640]  They don't allow it. They promote it and they push it meanwhile. The real targeting is this
[38:37.680 --> 38:39.680]  This is out of k-12
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.160]  This is out of the local news several baltimore schools report zero students
[38:44.800 --> 38:46.800]  proficient in math
[38:46.800 --> 38:48.800]  After two years ago
[38:48.800 --> 38:57.040]  The state of maryland lowered its proficiency test to that of what a 80 IQ person who's instructed should be able to pass so
[38:57.920 --> 38:59.760]  There you go
[38:59.760 --> 39:05.440]  And there won't be any math training now it'll all be on critical race theory and what the evil white people did to you
[39:05.440 --> 39:08.720]  But it is evil white people and black people. It's the globalist
[39:08.720 --> 39:17.040]  Uh that are helping do this to you. So you'll be in a prison of ignorance your whole life, but oh, it gets better
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.840]  This is not the babel on bees is not the onion
[39:21.120 --> 39:28.000]  This is not a joke. It's real a lesbian dating app is being overrun by trans women and the clown world just keeps
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.520]  Us spinning and guess what they all announced they are lesbians
[39:31.840 --> 39:35.040]  It's the old joke of well, you know, I'm not against women like women. I get it. I'm a lesbian
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.000]  You know in in in my heart as well. Uh, well, this is disgusting looking men
[39:40.720 --> 39:42.880]  Dressed up in like benny hill clown outfits
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.600]  seeking relationships with women
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.840]  Uh, and these are men with their penises who want to have intercourse
[39:50.400 --> 39:55.600]  With women kind of like two women in prison can have a baby and you can go see the uh freak show. That's what it is
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.800]  In the article if you've got the nerve to actually
[39:59.760 --> 40:01.280]  Look at this
[40:01.280 --> 40:03.280]  But uh, a lot of them have beards
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.280]  A lot of them have beards
[40:05.680 --> 40:07.680]  And they are lesbians
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.200]  And they're ready. Oh, look, this is a lovely young maiden here
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.720]  For you and don't talk bad about them or you'll be taken off everywhere. You'll social. Oh, I like that
[40:16.960 --> 40:18.960]  I'll be honest with you
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.000]  I'm not usually for transvestites and stuff, but
[40:22.720 --> 40:24.720]  This one here. This is uh
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.160]  Oh, and you see the symbol they've got here. You know what that symbol is right there?
[40:29.680 --> 40:31.680]  Yeah, these symbols all mean something
[40:31.680 --> 40:33.680]  Yeah
[40:34.320 --> 40:37.600]  So, uh, there you go ladies and gentlemen, this is uh, not a joke
[40:38.320 --> 40:41.120]  This is real this is happening and we can laugh at it all day
[40:41.440 --> 40:47.600]  But it's not funny because when parents try to do something about it. This is what happens if that queue up the audio please
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.440]  Well, we don't have time now because it's the full audio is that is what the parent had to say that was quite eloquent
[40:54.480 --> 40:56.880]  And then the school board member just says f you
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.720]  And if you don't like it, we'll call the fbi in I'm not joking school board president
[41:02.960 --> 41:09.280]  Caught on hot mic saying f you to concern parent who politely tells them they don't want critical race theory or pedophilia
[41:09.600 --> 41:13.120]  Taught to their children, which is the you don't get reading writing arithmetic
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.320]  You now get uh, antifa communist tactics how to be a pedophile how to be abused by a pedophile
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.320]  And of course how to hate white people and how to commit suicide of your white
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.280]  And then of course we've got these little tidbits of news here AT&T's
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.760]  Racial reeducation program and that's a soviet term
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.400]  Back 10 years ago and we got a secret document from the army of obama setting up reeducation camps
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.160]  People thought it was fake till a year later the army released it officially said no, it's real
[41:41.360 --> 41:43.440]  And it said you'll be sent for reeducation
[41:43.440 --> 41:50.720]  That's a soviet term and AT&T's official documents republic that they're now using and it's a there's actually a directive a letter
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.120]  By the ceo saying we must admit that whites are inherently a bad group
[41:55.680 --> 42:01.280]  About a bad species of human this is truly hitlerian, you know hitler said certain groups were inherently bad
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.000]  And they're just and you're like but that's that's insane. That's the goes against all common sense
[42:06.160 --> 42:10.480]  That's the opposite of a liberal view. Yeah, the big corporations don't like liberalism
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.560]  Less taxes more personal freedom a religious freedom, you know do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody
[42:16.720 --> 42:19.200]  They're going to get rid of all that with all this extremism
[42:19.200 --> 42:25.120]  And then a real tyranny is going to be in place. This is how you discredit classical liberalism
[42:25.280 --> 42:30.400]  I'm a classical liberal 250 years ago. I'd be considered classical liberal. I agree with thomas jefferson
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.240]  Not today, man. I'm the nazi you see because I don't want to do
[42:34.800 --> 42:40.320]  Medical experiments on black children and kill them like fauci was doing into the 2000s and I got mainstream news on that

[42:43.280 --> 42:44.480]  Yeah

[47:20.800 --> 47:32.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us
[47:33.760 --> 47:36.000]  Okay, this has been talked a lot about
[47:37.440 --> 47:39.440]  In the past 25 years ago
[47:39.840 --> 47:41.840]  20 years ago on my show, but
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.720]  I have basically not talked about it in a long time and so a few weeks ago. I began to point out
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.240]  Because listeners reminded me they said, hey, have you heard about Fauci testing hiv drugs that were experimental on kids?
[47:52.640 --> 47:56.080]  Some of which didn't even have hiv and killing them and I was like, oh my gosh
[47:56.720 --> 47:58.720]  I totally forgot about that
[47:58.720 --> 48:02.720]  I mean, he's committed so many damn crimes. It's just it makes your head spin
[48:04.720 --> 48:12.720]  And so then I started digging back in to it and I mean wall street journal new york times la times time magazine newsweek
[48:12.720 --> 48:18.720]  You know back when they did some decent reportage and then I started doing more research remembering all the doctors I had on
[48:18.720 --> 48:20.720]  And it was far worse than they were saying
[48:22.720 --> 48:24.720]  I mean they would go into black families particularly
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.720]  And say again, we're going to take your seven-year-old
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.720]  If you don't give us the seven-year-old sign the papers, we're going to take the three-year-old
[48:34.720 --> 48:37.720]  And the mothers would sign them over to protect the baby
[48:37.720 --> 48:45.720]  And then it would describe how they would then kill the children and I remember reading about this one particular young boy who fought for a year before they killed him
[48:45.720 --> 48:47.720]  And he weighed
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.720]  Like some ridiculously low like 45 pounds or something when he died. He'd been like a hundred pounds and they got him
[48:52.720 --> 48:54.720]  I mean
[48:54.720 --> 49:00.720]  And then here's what happened. I went back into it. I found that same child last night and it just made me
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.720]  So angry and made me say how much of this are we going to take?
[49:05.720 --> 49:10.720]  Because now it's not just going to be poor black children and poor white children in Appalachia
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.720]  They did this to they did this to whites too anybody poor they could get they're going after all our children now
[49:15.720 --> 49:17.720]  We're going to sit here and take this
[49:18.720 --> 49:22.720]  No now they're going to blow up their own buildings their own facilities
[49:23.720 --> 49:26.720]  They'll probably bomb themselves Pfizer or something to be the victim
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.720]  We're not calling for that
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.720]  But we do want to get control of our cities and our courts and our systems like Soros has done
[49:32.720 --> 49:35.720]  We want to get back control and indict them all
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.720]  But when they come to contact tracers trying to take you away and forcefully inject you, you know at that point
[49:41.720 --> 49:45.720]  It's self-defense and and that's what's happening is they're forcing us into a fight
[49:45.720 --> 49:51.720]  So RFK jr. He's a great patriot has come out and detailed in a long report
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.720]  It's linked up on info wars calm in a kelemik green article
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.720]  But I'm just gonna play short excerpt, but there's a big report he put out and a long dissertation
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.720]  On it and I suggest you go watch it. He's just laying out the same stuff. I'm laying out
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.720]  RFK jr. Details racist and sadistic Fauci funding research on grafting
[50:12.720 --> 50:21.720]  Aborted baby scalps onto rats, but it went further including killing young children with experimental drugs knowingly
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.720]  And here's a Don Salazar article from two days ago that really needs to get out
[50:28.720 --> 50:35.720]  Not only did Fauci's niad harm dogs fostered children also died during AIDS drug research that were totally healthy
[50:39.720 --> 50:42.720]  And all I can say is this is an X level evil
[50:42.720 --> 50:46.720]  By the way, you know, Australia is the testbed of what's coming here. They admit that all you in run
[50:46.720 --> 50:52.720]  Daily Mail reports unpaid covid fines will be taken from bank accounts and homes will be seized in Queensland
[50:56.720 --> 51:03.720]  And I've got so much more here for you, but let's go ahead and play a little clip of RFK jr. Talking about this
[51:03.720 --> 51:13.720]  Billions of dollars not only on a public experiment, but many many other very almost sadistic
[51:13.720 --> 51:23.720]  Not almost, but extremely sadistic. You know what another one of the experiments that I talked about on my board
[51:23.720 --> 51:32.720]  Is that he was taking scalps from fetuses from fully dog fetuses
[51:32.720 --> 51:40.720]  And removing the scalps from the skin from the top of the heads of fetuses
[51:40.720 --> 51:50.720]  And transplanted and planning it upon to humanize rats in order to test hair
[51:50.720 --> 51:57.720]  Hair sprays and shampoos and those kind of things
[51:57.720 --> 52:05.720]  The thing I think people need to talk about think about it is they were spending millions of dollars on these experiments
[52:05.720 --> 52:12.720]  And with all of the desperate needs for public health in this country
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.720]  And all of the good that that kind of money could have done
[52:17.720 --> 52:23.720]  He shows these experiments is the best use of taxpayers of course
[52:23.720 --> 52:31.720]  And it's really kind of frightening, but those experiments are described in one of my chapters
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.720]  An early chapter which I called Dr. Fauci, Mr. Hyde
[52:37.720 --> 52:43.720]  And the much more deserving parts of that chapter are his experiments on children
[52:43.720 --> 52:54.720]  He wasn't just experimenting doing these really horrific these sadistic experiments on animals on behalf of pharmaceutical companies
[52:54.720 --> 53:02.720]  But he had also arranged to essentially take over foster care homes
[53:02.720 --> 53:11.720]  And in 70s days and including one in New York called a Incarnation House
[53:11.720 --> 53:17.720]  Where they were taking black and Hispanic children who did not have parents
[53:17.720 --> 53:26.720]  And parents had disappeared and they had taken over one foster care hospital in New York
[53:26.720 --> 53:35.720]  And essentially turned it over to the drug companies to use chemotherapy drugs on children to treat
[53:35.720 --> 53:42.720]  Allegedly HIV as it turns out many of these children did not have HIV
[53:42.720 --> 53:50.720]  And that doesn't matter because they were experimental things like AZT
[53:50.720 --> 53:55.720]  So let that sink in ladies and gentlemen, I've got a whole other stack in this area
[53:55.720 --> 54:01.720]  But I'm going to get to that later if I have time and a bunch of other deaths caused from the so-called vaccines
[54:01.720 --> 54:04.720]  I've got a big stack on that
[54:04.720 --> 54:08.720]  But I really want to get into Tucker Carlson next hour and the economy
[54:08.720 --> 54:16.720]  But you've seen the total conniption fit against Tucker Carlson for his January 6th documentary
[54:16.720 --> 54:19.720]  That he's going to spend all week on next week
[54:19.720 --> 54:24.720]  The whole week is about false flags and the FBI because they have the proof, they have the names, they know how they did it
[54:24.720 --> 54:26.720]  And it's all coming out
[54:26.720 --> 54:32.720]  And so they're calling for you to be taken off the air, CNN is, others they're calling him the new Alex Jones
[54:32.720 --> 54:34.720]  They're saying he's worse than Alex Jones
[54:34.720 --> 54:41.720]  Well, I mean, he's not worse than Alex Jones, I know he's worse for them because he's just as well-spoken, maybe better
[54:41.720 --> 54:43.720]  And he's definitely slicker
[54:43.720 --> 54:48.720]  And I love his show and yeah, he's away
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.720]  You know, Tucker doesn't shrink from the fact that he thought I was full of it 20 years ago
[54:53.720 --> 54:56.720]  And 10 years ago I thought, wow, Alex is actually right about a lot of things
[54:56.720 --> 55:02.720]  And in the last five years, you know, Tucker's told me that he understands that I'm a trailblazer
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.720]  And I understand what's going on in the world, but so did the Kissinger group tried to hire me and told me the same thing
[55:06.720 --> 55:09.720]  It's just that he's not working for Henry Kissinger either
[55:09.720 --> 55:18.720]  So I'm not trying to superimprag folks, but most people aren't nine years old reading British wartime psychological profiles on Hitler
[55:18.720 --> 55:23.720]  That's what I've been drawn to, that's what I've been drawn to fight, it's what I do, and I've been proven right
[55:23.720 --> 55:24.720]  Everybody knows it
[55:24.720 --> 55:28.720]  And so, yes, New World Order, you got a problem, you think you got rid of Alex Jones?
[55:28.720 --> 55:31.720]  Try a thousand more Alex Joneses
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.720]  Because that's how this works, and by the way, the new and improved Alex Jones
[55:35.720 --> 55:39.720]  Yes, Tucker Carlson, but it's not because he got it all from me
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.720]  It's because he finally saw it was all real, and everything I talked about happened
[55:43.720 --> 55:49.720]  He doesn't need to hear from me now anymore, he can go watch the news and see it unfolding
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.720]  And see it happening, and so no wonder Joy Reid comes out in a taxi
[55:53.720 --> 55:57.720]  And calls him the new Alex Jones, and calls him a white supremacist and a Holocaust denier
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.720]  Notice she doesn't play any clips of that, she's the one covered up for Fauci
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.720]  She's the one covered up for the real globalist supremacy
[56:05.720 --> 56:11.720]  Taking healthy black children and killing them at a pharma facility, just like they do dogs
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.720]  You're not going to hear a damn thing out of her evil mouth
[56:15.720 --> 56:19.720]  She's not evil because she's black, she's evil because she's sold out to evil
[56:19.720 --> 56:23.720]  And Fauci's not evil because he's white, he's evil because he's sold out to evil
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.720]  And it doesn't matter if it's Joy Reid or Fauci, they're our enemies
[56:27.720 --> 56:31.720]  And they hate us, and they're coming after all of us, I don't give a rat's ass what color you are
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.720]  You better wake up out there and get with the program to fight the New World Order
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.720]  And you better download Jesus Christ right now into your soul
[56:39.720 --> 56:45.720]  You better get the Holy Spirit last week, because it's on ladies and gentlemen
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.720]  World government, New World Order in our face, I'm going to break
[56:49.720 --> 56:53.720]  What I'm going to say is, I've got a lot of stuff going on, I've got a lot of irons in the fire

[58:43.720 --> 58:47.720]  Get amazing products and fund the Infowar and the fight against the Globalist
[58:47.720 --> 58:51.720]  The Globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with
[58:51.720 --> 58:55.720]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[58:55.720 --> 58:59.720]  It's all come out, and they're doing that not because we're weak, but because
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.720]  we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful
[59:03.720 --> 59:07.720]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[59:07.720 --> 59:11.720]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with
[59:11.720 --> 59:15.720]  the boy, is it true?
[59:15.720 --> 59:19.720]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[59:19.720 --> 59:23.720]  hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.720]  evil and all their cultural death because they know
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.720]  we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world
[59:31.720 --> 59:35.720]  who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars
[59:35.720 --> 59:39.720]  on the air now more than ever, because even if you don't believe in God
[59:39.720 --> 59:43.720]  what the Globalist are manifesting and setting up is J. Channing, and we are opposing
[59:43.720 --> 1:00:03.720]  the One World Government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:18.720]  Alright folks, you can analyze every little piece of this for a thousand years
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:22.720]  and get caught up in that, and we do that, it's important to understand the facets
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:26.720]  but the most important thing to do is just pull back and know
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:29.720]  the Globalists are exempt from everything they're doing to us
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.720]  and they are trying to collapse society, destroy industrial society
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:37.720]  to force de-population, and during that crisis again they're going to pose as the saviors
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.720]  for the cascading problems they themselves have created
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:48.720]  and so I want to play for you on the heels of everything we just covered
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:52.720]  a Rutgers professor, and we see this kind of stuff every few minutes now
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:56.720]  there's so many examples of this, this is not some rogue person
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:02.720]  this is the standard garbage, teaching that white people are committed to being villains
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:05.720]  we got to take these mother efforts out
[1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:10.720]  this is a professor spewing this hatred on YouTube on a show called The Root
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.720]  The Root is evil white people
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  not not evil globalists, not eugenicists, not the transhumanists, no
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:20.720]  they're the ones funding this lady, she's funded by the university
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.720]  AT&T, CNN, all the Fortune 1000 basically
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:29.720]  led by the Fortune 100 and owned by BlackRock and the Private Federal Reserve
[1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.720]  they are funding this lady
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:34.720]  remember just ten years ago it was only white professors saying whites are inherently evil
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:39.720]  we got to get rid of them, they were trying to train to finally get enough black people on board
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:41.720]  so that white folks see this and hate black people
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:44.720]  this is meant to create racism on both sides
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:48.720]  this is just dirty, nasty, evil stuff right here, here it is
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  I think that white people are committed to being villains in the aggregate, right?
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:56.720]  the real sort of issue here, you know, I've heard people sort of say it is
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.720]  one, I think that white people viscerally fear
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  it's not that white people don't know, right, what they have done
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:07.720]  they know, they fear that there is no other way to be human
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:10.720]  but the way in which they are human, which is just
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.720]  so you know, like you talk to white people and whenever you really want to have a reckoning about it
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:17.720]  they say stuff like, you know, it's just human nature
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:21.720]  if y'all had all of this power, you would have done the same thing, right?
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:24.720]  and it's like, no, that's what white humans did
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  white human beings
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:28.720]  okay, just so I can't listen to it, turn it off
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:31.720]  later I'll try to play the rest of it, but ladies and gentlemen
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:35.720]  they are inflicting and poisoning the minds of black people
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:38.720]  that pay to go to public school, private school
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:40.720]  your parents pay one way or the other through the taxes
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:43.720]  or to college to hear that
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:48.720]  oh my gosh, spaceships and airplanes and medicine and telecommunications
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  that came from white people predominantly
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  and so we can't have any part of that
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:01.720]  so this is black people thinking, I'm a victim, I can't ever own a nice house
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:04.720]  I can't have a nice car, I can't have good medicine for my children
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:07.720]  I can't go on trips, I mean, I can't own a restaurant
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:09.720]  I can't be a scientist, I can't be an error
[1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:11.720]  I mean, you're just saying this
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:15.720]  meanwhile, it's the education system that in predominantly black areas on purpose
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.720]  is designed to create zero literacy
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.720]  I showed an article out of major cities in Maryland
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  where they have zero pupils graduating from fifth grade into sixth grade
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.720]  and so on with any math proficiency
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:33.720]  zero, zero proficiency scores
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.720]  zero, passed
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.720]  and that's the academic system
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:41.720]  the same one that is putting her up there
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  saying that white people inherently are bad with some dude smiling
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:51.720]  and just like he's in Valhalla hearing this
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:54.720]  because the entire corporate system says this is right and this is true
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:56.720]  and so these idiots get to be racist
[1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  they get to go out and proselytize
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:02.720]  and get paid by big corporations and taxpayer money to act like this
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:04.720]  when if she went to Africa forever
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:07.720]  she'd come back and kiss the ground in this country
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:10.720]  and that's what happens to a lot of black folks that go to Africa and come back
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:12.720]  that's why there's a lot of Africans come here
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  and they do not like liberal, fake, leftist black Americans
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  they say, you people are crazy
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:21.720]  you have no idea how blessed you are to live in the West
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  and again, people in the West were living in caves and, you know, cuts and everything
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  before Christianity
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:32.720]  and the African countries that are Christian are doing well
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:33.720]  the ones that aren't, aren't
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:36.720]  it's Christianity that will lift us all up
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:39.720]  but you believe in it as real or an operating system
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:44.720]  like got milk, got freedom, got Christianity, you need it
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:47.720]  but instead you get this big fat witch of racism
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:49.720]  up there saying I'm inherently bad because I'm white
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.720]  you're nothing but a black Nazi
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:53.720]  burning hell you big old fat, ugly witch
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:05:01.720]  you better watch your ass around me
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:04.720]  it's now becoming accepted knowledge
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:08.720]  accepted fact that global government run by private corporations
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:12.720]  is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:13.720]  they're being destroyed
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:15.720]  all the checks and balances are being annihilated
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:17.720]  our borders are being destroyed
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:18.720]  our currency is being destroyed
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:21.720]  and the American people have been listed as terrorists
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:22.720]  by the rogue federal government
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.720]  Info Wars is going to continue to fight on
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:26.720]  and there is a big awakening happening
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:28.720]  we have a good chance of beating these people
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:29.720]  but we're not going to be able to stay on air
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:31.720]  unless you support us and you've been doing it
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.720]  so spread the word about the broadcast
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:34.720]  pray for the broadcast
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:37.720]  but also buy great products at infowarshor.com
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:39.720]  if you're shopping with the big corporations
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.720]  or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:43.720]  if you're funding us and getting great products
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  you are helping lead the war effort
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:48.720]  I cannot express to you how important it is
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.720]  to buy your products and do your Christmas shopping
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.720]  and do your Black Friday shopping at infowarshor.com
[1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:55.720]  we've got store-wide free shipping right now
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:21.720]  and double-patria points
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:29.720]  I've got no friends
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:32.720]  I've got no friends to read the papers
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.720]  they can't be seen
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:35.720]  they can't be seen
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  with me
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:37.720]  with me
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:39.720]  and I've been real
[1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:41.720]  here we are ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:42.720]  feeling me
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.720]  I've got to tell you the newspapers
[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:45.720]  and the control corporate press
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:47.720]  don't have the power anymore
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:49.720]  and so that's why they're trying to flood us
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.720]  with third world populations that come from
[1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.720]  squalor and tyranny so they won't know any better
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:56.720]  and that's why they're trying to dump people down
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:58.720]  whether they be black or white or Hispanic
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:00.720]  or Asian in the public schools
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  with numbers from across the country
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  coming in, not just Maryland
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:07.720]  of record numbers of schools where entire schools
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:11.720]  have zero passing grades in math
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:13.720]  or in English
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:18.720]  they want a tower of babel
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.720]  a tower of babel they control
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.720]  so when they carry out their planetary in-game
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  of depopulation
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.720]  no one knows what hit them
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.720]  if you are a TV viewer
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.720]  you probably notice this big mural
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.720]  this piece of art we have up here
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:36.720]  and that is a piece of art
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:38.720]  that is actually a mural
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  at the Denver International Airport
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.720]  and people ask what it means
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:45.720]  well the artist said it is a rendition
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.720]  of the Spanish Civil War
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:51.720]  and it is anti-fascist
[1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:54.720]  but if you look at what the left is actually doing today
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:55.720]  it is fascist
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  and notice the rainbow
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:59.720]  it actually uses a weapon
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:01.720]  and turned into a spike of black death
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:03.720]  that then rains down fire
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:07.720]  on men, women, and children of every race, color, and creed
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.720]  and is it that what Fauci
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:12.720]  and the New World Order and the Globalist are doing
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:19.720]  isn't Klaus Schwab a neo-fascist
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.720]  very, very interesting isn't it
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:24.720]  okay
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:26.720]  let me tell you what is coming up this hour
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:28.720]  we have a big hour lined up for you
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:30.720]  Leo Zagami the Vatican Insider
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  I used to hear Zagami 15 years ago
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:34.720]  and I thought this guy is full of crap
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:36.720]  there won't be a Jesuit Pope
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:39.720]  they won't have another Pope step down
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:42.720]  and then they'll have a new Pope at the same time
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:44.720]  moving them towards a council and not a Pope
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  and then sure enough everything he said happened
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.720]  like six, seven years later exactly as he said
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:51.720]  so I really respect him and
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:54.720]  he also took me into some castles and other crazy stuff
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  when we were out there in Italy once
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:59.720]  he's definitely an insider who exposed the system
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:02.720]  he's joining us bottom of the hour to talk about
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:05.720]  that meeting that
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:08.720]  just took place yesterday at the
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:11.720]  eternal city outside Rome, Italy
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:14.720]  so he's got some big geopolitical news for us
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:16.720]  at the bottom of the hour right now let's plow
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:18.720]  into this news
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  well here it is it's on InfoWars.com
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.720]  but we don't just ask you to believe us
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.720]  we have a copy of the bill here for you
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:26.720]  that's kind of how we do it
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  notice when Joy Reid called
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:30.720]  Tucker Carlson a white supremacist holocaust
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:33.720]  denier last night
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:36.720]  she did not show a clip of it
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:39.720]  while she covers up for Fauci doing medical experiments
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:42.720]  and killing black children that we covered earlier
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.720]  and we even showed you the proof and the articles
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  and the names and everything and we've got some more
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.720]  breaking news on that the Clintons just
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.720]  apologized for secret radiation testing
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  on fostered children that killed thousands
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:55.720]  oh that's back in the news though
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:57.720]  Clinton apologizes for radiation test
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:59.720]  experiments on children
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.720]  but we'll get to that coming up
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.720]  these are the bad guys but the mad scientists
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  that run things that's the top of the pyramid
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.720]  so let's get back to this
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:11.720]  House bill back better bill
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:13.720]  one they currently say they almost have the votes to pass
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:16.720]  has six hundred dollar IRS
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:18.720]  reporting provision it had been seven hundred dollar
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  they promised to take it out that's why you knew
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  they'd keep it in and that's two provisions
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  one of you have over ten thousand dollars of transactions
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  period a year in your account
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.720]  which the average person
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  on minimum wage makes sixteen thousand
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.720]  people on welfare make twenty thousand
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:34.720]  see how they incentivize that but everybody
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.720]  will be watched in live time no more fourth amendment
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:38.720]  to be tied to your social credit score
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:40.720]  and now it's back in the bill again
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:42.720]  House bill back better bill
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.720]  which is again another story
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:46.720]  that's the UN Klaus Schwab
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:48.720]  great reset term destroy everything
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  and then take over society
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  House bill back better bill includes
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:57.720]  six hundred dollar IRS
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  reporting provision here's the bill itself
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:04.720]  page one thousand six hundred seventy three
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:06.720]  section three four zero six
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  in the bill back better text
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  and there it is
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  right there for you on screen
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  where anybody with
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  six hundred dollar transactions
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:19.720]  will be tracked in live time
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:21.720]  by a giant computer system
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:23.720]  that's already in place already watching what you do
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.720]  they just want to get you ready for
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:27.720]  having money taken directly out of your account
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  or your house being taken or anything else
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  just like they're doing in
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.720]  Australia that I covered
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.720]  earlier for you
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:37.720]  but I'll tell you who won't be having
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:39.720]  money taken out of their bank accounts for not being
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  good little slaves
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:43.720]  here it is us in talks to pay
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:45.720]  hundreds of millions of families separated
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:47.720]  the border wall street journal biden is saying
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  he wants to pay four hundred
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:51.720]  and fifty plus thousand dollars to each
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:53.720]  person who just claims
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:55.720]  they were separated from
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:57.720]  their parents even though they had no
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:11:59.720]  ID
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.720]  they don't care if it's an hour or a day
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:03.720]  four hundred fifty thousand
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  so if you didn't think there wasn't a giant
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.720]  flood if you didn't think the
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:09.720]  Mexican border police overwhelmed by
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:11.720]  a hundred thousand from the Caribbean
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:13.720]  that came up through Mexico slamming
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  across a few days ago with hundreds of
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:17.720]  thousands more coming if you thought the Texas
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:19.720]  border totally swamped and totally collapsed
[1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:21.720]  wasn't insane enough if you thought all the
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:23.720]  tuberculosis and the rest of it pouring
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:25.720]  across the border wasn't bad enough to roll
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:27.720]  some of that footage of the border
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:29.720]  totally collapsed if you didn't think that was bad
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.720]  enough
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:33.720]  now anybody that goes to the NGOs
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:35.720]  set up by Soros that now run the border
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:37.720]  patrol and run ICE they will
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.720]  determine their lawyers will determine
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.720]  who gets four hundred fifty thousand
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:43.720]  plus dollars a piece
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:45.720]  they will then launder the majority of that money
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:47.720]  back into the NGOs and into
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:49.720]  the quote liberal lawyers
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.720]  to then
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:53.720]  fund the next phase of the invasion
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:55.720]  and the takeover
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:57.720]  so this is the purposeful
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.720]  replacement migration breaking of the southern
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:01.720]  border this is Europe was broken
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:03.720]  one hundred and ten percent
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:05.720]  organized by the UN announced prepared
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:07.720]  and this is the
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:09.720]  middle class of Mexico
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:11.720]  and Central America
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.720]  and the Caribbean coming in
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  this is the middle class also with
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.720]  some criminal smugglers and others but it is now
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  the giant
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:21.720]  exodus and by the way I don't blame these people
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:23.720]  they've been under a year and a half in fact
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:25.720]  they've done polls international news groups
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:27.720]  have done polls they say why are you coming
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:29.720]  they said I owned a business or I had a farm
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.720]  they don't let us farm they don't let us sell businesses
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:33.720]  we had to eat our livestock
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:35.720]  we are starving we have no other choice so we
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  go to the refugee center and they give us
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:39.720]  the debit card and they give us the pass
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:41.720]  and they tell us go to the north
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.720]  and this is what's going on
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:47.720]  and then I mean what did I say
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:49.720]  hundreds of times last year like I
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.720]  was a parent we got emails
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:53.720]  we got calls my family complained
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:55.720]  they said will you stop saying when the first
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  world collapses
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:13:59.720]  the third world dies will you stop saying
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:01.720]  that there'll be hundreds of millions pouring up here
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:03.720]  within a year and a half to two years and the
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:05.720]  UN will organize it and then that'll make us
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.720]  collapse we know Alex okay
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:09.720]  but no one else was saying it and now
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:11.720]  here we are
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:13.720]  people hiding in trash cans
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  people eating out of trash cans people hiding
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:17.720]  in trucks people looting and robbing
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:19.720]  and carjacking and raping
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  and it's just total collapse
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.720]  desperate desperate
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  desperate desperate people
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.720]  while they pay the average American to not work
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:29.720]  and while millions
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.720]  quit their jobs over the poison shots who are fired
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  and then the left and sorrows
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:35.720]  have the nerve to say oh it's strike tober
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.720]  people are calling for the great reset

[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:05.720]  income which once they bankrupt everybody
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:07.720]  then they give a universal income tied to the debit
