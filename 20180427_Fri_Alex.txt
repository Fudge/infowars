[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:25.000 --> 00:41.000]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, a tale of two cities.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, it's Friday the 27th day of April 2018.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours in the war room with Roger Stone
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  and the great Owen Schreuer will be coming up.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Peace is breaking out on the North Korean Peninsula.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  And I can tell you exactly why peace is breaking out.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  And I will break it down in this first hour.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  But simply put, there's a new sheriff in town
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  and the globalist with China have specifically wanted a strategy of tension
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  in the South China Sea as a pretext to move globalist forces into the area
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  and as a pretext for China to have a diversion anytime they want it.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  And Trump does not want to continue to have a strategy of patience
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  or the strategy of tension and these Machiavellian things.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  He wants stability and trade.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  And so massive pressure has been brought to bear right to the edge of a major trade war with China.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  Huge sanctions on North Korea that actually squeezed Kim Jong-un, the sickening creature.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  And he is also wanting to be on the world stage so he wants to meet with Trump.
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  And the plans and discussions have been going on for decades in the 60-plus year conflict
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  that has never been ended.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  The war is still ongoing to have a armistice turn into a peace deal
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  and then turn into a 10-year plan to begin partial reunification between the North and South.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  Now back on March 8th, I told you that.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  I was on semi-vacation in Colorado with the family.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  I called in when Owen Schreuer was hosting and I said that I have sources
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  in the State Department in Pentagon that said that this is a big victory
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  that so far they've already agreed to denuclearization, a peace deal
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  and that all of that had happened the day before in North Korea's capital
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  with the head of South Korea's intelligence and military.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  Now, weeks later, word for word, it came out what I said.
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  And it's not about tooting our horn, it's just the fact that we do have great sources
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  and we were reporting on something very, very positive that at least so far as getting to the meeting table,
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Kim Jong-un has agreed to this stuff.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  Now, you might try to weasel out of it, but can you imagine,
[03:24.000 --> 03:35.000]  it's kind of like keeping the West and Coca-Cola and blue jeans and rock and roll scorpions out of Rolling Stones, out of Russia.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  Well, imagine North Korea trying to keep millions and millions of people in the dark
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  about what planet they even live on and only a few cities even have partial electricity.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  Why would that establishment really want that?
[03:52.000 --> 04:00.000]  Why would they actually want to live like something out of the dystopic science fiction movie?
[04:00.000 --> 04:08.000]  Where they've got weapons and nukes and everything, but cannibalism was openly practiced.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  So it's communism rock bottom.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  And if you get more of the fascist model like China has, where Communist Party's still in charge,
[04:18.000 --> 04:26.000]  but they get to become billionaires, well, North Korea is going to go for that move.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Still use their people as slaves, but it's kind of like Saudi Arabia's reforms.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  Well, women can drive cars and some can go to college and you don't have to have your eyes completely covered.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  You can have a slit now.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  And it'll be the same North Korea.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  But the point is, that's still big reforms compared to where they're at.
[04:43.000 --> 04:50.000]  And Trump, and new policies has moved that there, showing that Trump has been right
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  and that Trump is really smart and that Trump is a genius.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  And he's upsetting the entire geopolitical order and it's a beautiful thing to see.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWar's life.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber,
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.000]  InfoWar's life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[05:43.000 --> 05:53.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.000]  Get away from me!
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  Get away from me!
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  InfoWar's helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is in ICE's support.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  A cozy relationship from the beginning.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed by home, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday global transmission.
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  Smiles from Kim Jong-un. That's the Drudge Report headline, No More War.
[07:50.000 --> 07:58.000]  And they are tentatively the Associated Press reports moving towards the end of the Korean War
[07:58.000 --> 08:11.000]  that never stopped, but simply got paused during the armistice of July 27th, 1953.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  And so the leaders of North and South Korea hugging.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  We have dramatic film footage if you're watching us on television of this.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  This has never happened.
[08:22.000 --> 08:33.000]  Since the Communist Chinese in 1950 sent in 4 million troops to fight alongside the North Koreans.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  Then they sent 5 million more in 1953 and overran our forces that had been beating them.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  MacArthur wanted to hit them with nuclear weapons, atomic bombs at the time.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  And he was relieved of command.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  We would have a whole different world.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  MacArthur believed it was wrong to put the Communist into China.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  It was wrong to have put Chiang Kai-shek on the island of Taiwan.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  And he wrote about it, spoke in Congress about it.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  In his farewell address, old soldiers never die, they just fade away.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  And MacArthur was right.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  We should have hit the Chinese with atomic weapons before they got them.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  We should have put a capitalist free market system in and the world would be an incredibly better place.
[09:26.000 --> 09:37.000]  But the same old globalists, the same old people kept Communist China in place
[09:37.000 --> 09:45.000]  and let them now have a $900 billion trade deficit with us every year.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  That's not even all the intellectual property they steal.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  $300 billion of that $900 billion is a very conservative number.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  They steal everything.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  And now a more pragmatic system, I guess it's all covered in the book,
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  The Undercolored Conspiracy, available at infowarestore.com.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  Now this is all unfolding.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  And you see pragmatic, reasonable action from this president.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  And I absolutely want to applaud it on every front.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  And I think it's a great thing because the globalists through China have been propping North Korea up
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  for a very, very, very long time.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  And now the meeting happened today, yesterday, in Korea Peninsula time.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  A big event.
[10:41.000 --> 10:49.000]  All of it after Trump put massive screws in last year and a half to North Korea's thumbs
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  and said the next screws are going in your head.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  You're going to have a carpet of bombs or a carpet of gold.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  Stop what you're doing.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Give it up.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then the word was they were going to hit them in March.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  U.S. was going at 100%.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  The soldiers, the airmen, the military forces were told.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  Marines were told.
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  The Navy SEALs were told, we're taking him out.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  And he got the message, didn't he?
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  So now it's not, oh, we'll agree to meet with Bill Clinton or we'll agree to meet with some president secretly.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  No, we agree to end this whole thing now.
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  And to ceremonially take plots of land from each side and put on the other for reunification.
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  Guys, will you queue up the March 8th YouTube video?
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  You can just search it.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  Kim Jong-un has already agreed to Trump's terms.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  And then I said that you would then see the meeting between the North and South,
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  that they would announce a 10-year plan to begin integration.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  And that all of that would unfold.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  This exactly as I told you because we have great sources.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  And no one has given us credit.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  I tweeted out and the bots go, oh yeah, you're a liar.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  The deal wasn't made till later.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  The head of the CIA didn't meet till later.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  Now there it is, exclusive.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  Kim Jong-un has already agreed to Trump's terms ahead of meeting.
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000]  I think it's in the computer.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's in the tricast.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  We played this about 10 times.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  We'll play it next segment.
[12:49.000 --> 12:59.000]  But the point is, is that I laid out exactly word for word what would happen in the exact order.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  Now either I'm a geopolitical genius or I was told by high-level sources that knew exactly what was going on.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  Everybody knows we have these sources.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  But let's stop in the establishment media pretending we don't.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  You guys know the truth as well.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  You decide to lie about Trump and to say he's an idiot internationally.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  He's a buffoon at business.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  He's a loser.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  He's a moron.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  He's a punk.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  He's going to kill us all.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  It's the Clintons and the globalists that gave the nuclear weapons to Kim Jong-un.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  It wasn't even the Chinese.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  You people are out of control.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  You're the ones that are dangerous.
[13:38.000 --> 13:46.000]  Oh, but they've released hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of new text messages between the FBI agent Strock and his little sweetie pie.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  And she sounds like a mentally ill basket case in my view whining and bitching.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  And I saw him on TV.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  I'm so scared.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  We're meeting with generals about how to stop him.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Oh, baby, I've got to go to this meeting.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  Oh, you have to go.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  That's dumb.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  I don't want to work.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  Now, honey, this is an important meeting about stopping Trump.
[14:10.000 --> 14:19.000]  Strock and Page text reveal they were angry in mourning over James Comey Alster.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  It's crazy.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  I mean, you're talking about, you know, they're putting in cry closets all over the country and Play-Doh and construction paper if you're upset.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  They catch people giving out cocky constitutions.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Project Veritas, others caught this on video.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  They go into the dean and say, I'm scared.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  And they go, come in here.
[14:39.000 --> 14:50.000]  We've got Play-Doh for you and little stuffed animals and people like roll around and go, oh, this is complete regression.
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  So I headlined a few years ago that 35 is the new adult.
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  I'm not Jewish, but I actually agree with Jewish views on that.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  13 years old, you treat somebody like they're an adult.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  You make them do adult chores.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  They're an adult at 13 on average.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  That doesn't mean they get to buy liquor or get married, but you start really treating them with the responsibilities.
[15:16.000 --> 15:28.000]  My dad was sent to apprentice in factories and oil rigs and offshore stuff and picking cotton, you know, just taking part in it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  The whole nine yards, so he would be rounded.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  And by the time he was 10, he'd just get on a bus and go anywhere he wanted around the country.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  By the time it was 15, he was going to UT Plan 2.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  But that's because they treated him like an adult.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  He could skin a buck, run a trot line when he was 10 years old.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  I was driving tractors and stuff when I was 10.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Once or twice I did run through the fences and things, but that's how that works.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  And when I was 10 years old, I could shoot a buck in the eye at 300 yards without the gun at rest.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  This is a money-saving message from Tax Mediation Services.

[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[19:03.000 --> 19:10.000]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[19:17.000 --> 19:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.000 --> 19:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[19:41.000 --> 19:51.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:29.000 --> 20:38.000]  When those top government envoys and the South Korean intelligence chief met with Kim Jong-un last week for four hours at dinner,
[20:38.000 --> 20:45.000]  I have from high level sources that they laid out the proposals for the North invading nuclear eyes
[20:45.000 --> 20:54.000]  to actually stop their militaristic activities, and the South also offered a plan to begin a 10-year program of reunification.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  But the Communist Party basically has to stand down and fade out and just become Robert Barrett's over the incredible wealth,
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  but their people won't be starving to death anyway.
[21:02.000 --> 21:13.000]  But it is a transfer, a segue, a stepping stone out of the most abject, hellish place in not just modern history, but in real history, many analysts believe.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Here's the statement.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  Kim Jong-un has already tacitly agreed to the terms of the Trump meeting.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  Trump's not going to go to that meeting without getting an agreement and without having it being ironclad.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  He's not going to go there and not have the victory.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Okay, so I want to explain this.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  The meeting already happened last week.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  After all the diplomatic and military pressure, and you heard it here first,
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  you'll guarantee the month or so after this happens it's going to come out that Trump already has the agreement.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Now, does that mean Kim Jong-un might not try to back out or do something?
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  Who knows?
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  But this is a big day, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.000]  The truth is the Clintons and others gave them the reactors, gave them the missile secrets to build up as a threat working with China.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  The globalists have been allied with China against America playing a double game.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  Trump is ending that double game because like you went to Saudi Arabia and said,
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  you're not going to fund ISIS anymore, you're not going to fund al-Qaeda, you're going to free women.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  And they rolled over because the U.S. and Britain had put the Saudis in power, Britain particularly.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  And then the U.S. took that roll over in the 50s, goes back to the war in Saudi Arabia.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  So where the boss?
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.000]  We had evil people in control, basically funding radical Islam and protecting it and letting it do what it did.
[22:28.000 --> 22:36.000]  Trump's pragmatist, he said, this is all over. That's why you've seen South Korea begin to roll.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  So that goes back into early March.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  And that's what I was told by sources, and that's the plan.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  And that's why we knew that it had a really good chance of being successful.
[22:48.000 --> 22:57.000]  And now you're seeing, it looks like if anything, South Korea is accelerating what I was told over a month ago.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  That the plan is accelerating.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  And you noticed about three weeks after I said all that, it came out in the news.
[23:02.000 --> 23:13.000]  Kim Jong-un and North Korea already had to agree to the framework of what they were already agreeing to ahead of the meeting with Trump and the meetings with South Korea.
[23:13.000 --> 23:24.000]  And now you see it all going forward because North Korea wants to go ahead and not be the center of embarrassing evil on the planet.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  But there it is. We want to go watch the full 10 minutes where I break it down, calling in from the road.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  Exclusive Kim Jong-un has already agreed to Trump's terms ahead of a meeting.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  Now, I don't play that to brag and say, see how smart I am.
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  I play that to show you why they hate us, why they attack us, why they demonize us.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  You know CNN has way more sources than we do.
[23:45.000 --> 23:53.000]  CNN knows they're making a real peace deal. ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, they've all tried to stop this deal.
[23:53.000 --> 24:01.000]  They all know how real it is and they're trying to sabotage it.
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  Think about that. They're trying to say Trump's doing a terrible job.
[24:06.000 --> 24:15.000]  They're trying to say he's an idiot. They're trying to make this look as bad as it can and to say that, oh, this isn't a good deal.
[24:15.000 --> 24:26.000]  And boy, Kim Jong-un's getting one over on us and Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar says that, man, Trump's worse than North Korea.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  He's an idiot. He's going to blow us all up. They just said that a week ago.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  Because they're not living on the same planet as we are.
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.000]  Now, let's move on from there. We've got a bunch of guests coming up and I've got a bunch of other news we need to hit.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  Shickening Amazon News.
[24:55.000 --> 25:06.000]  Just on every front, I was going through my financial stack of news and it's just Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, Potato Potato, Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos,
[25:06.000 --> 25:17.000]  Boost Fortune, $12 billion in a day on Amazon Search, $12 billion in a day.
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.000]  And his whole empire is based on $1.50 per package and all these other monopolies.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  He personally pays almost no tax. That was in a London Guardian yesterday.
[25:29.000 --> 25:40.000]  But just remember, he funds the foundations and the liberal groups and was one of Obama's top supporters, telling the middle class that you should have a 45% federal tax,
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  but you can't get out of it like he does.
[25:42.000 --> 25:51.000]  And all these guys look like robots. Zuckerberg, Bezos, they don't. They look like androids.
[25:51.000 --> 26:02.000]  I'm not saying they're androids, but something's going on. There's that famous photo of Zuckerberg up close where his skin almost looks green
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  and you even see how the spots on his retinas are even identical.
[26:06.000 --> 26:17.000]  Very unusual to have that on both sides of each eye identical where the spots on the surface of the colored part of the eye are the exact same.
[26:17.000 --> 26:27.000]  And then you look at Bezos, his eyes don't look normal. It's not just that one's pointing the wrong direction like he's a chameleon.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  One eye is looking that way, the other one's looking another way.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  It's that they're total psychopaths.
[26:35.000 --> 26:45.000]  They're known for hating their customers, hating their families, hating everyone, calling everyone dumb efforts and just savagely wanting every dime they can get
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  and just this will to dominate and run everybody else's lives.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  They're known for that and there are liberal gods converting everybody that you can't have a single family dwelling
[26:58.000 --> 27:09.000]  and that the average person by law should not be able to have more than 250 square feet if you're in one of their controlled cities.
[27:09.000 --> 27:20.000]  That was in the news yesterday. USA Today said it's time to get rid of single family homes. It's bad for the earth.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  He is quarterbacking.
[27:24.000 --> 27:33.000]  By the way, he puts out these photos himself in official PR releases. If you're watching on TV, these are photos Bezos puts out of himself.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  He has no idea what he looks like.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Psychopaths and sociopaths have no idea.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  And he does this fake, tick, disarming laugh.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  There's an old NBC interview where he couldn't quit doing it.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  It doesn't like 50 times in 10 minutes.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  Oh look, it's I'm Goofy and here comes Mickey Mouse.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  Minnie Mouse, a fun time, guys.
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  I'll find it during the break. It's like a 19 year old, like 1999 interview in BC with Bezos.
[28:09.000 --> 28:27.000]  I meant to play that a few weeks ago. It is just Buzzaro land.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  And he's trying to block the peace deals. And man, he wants to run your business out.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  I mean he, because he's Bezos and he deserves it. He's going on all the grocery stores and the rocket ships and everything.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  It's mine. I'm Bezos. You're going to live at 200 square feet.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  I feel big. I live on the top of a mountain and a 50,000 square foot home.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  I'm Bezos, master of the universe.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  Meanwhile, every device he puts out spies on you, Yahoo, Amazon Alexa listens to you in your house.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  Did you hear that? Three years ago.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them the library, to give them the church.

[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  The reason InfoWars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.

[31:17.000 --> 31:23.000]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good.
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[31:27.000 --> 31:35.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[31:35.000 --> 31:42.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[31:45.000 --> 31:55.000]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win, infowarslife.com.

[33:25.000 --> 33:33.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:38.000 --> 33:55.000]  We'll take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  Welcome back. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to plow into so much of the incredible news.
[34:15.000 --> 34:23.000]  A lot of it positive, a lot of it negative, a lot of it just downright insane.
[34:23.000 --> 34:35.000]  Bill Cosby convicted in sexual assault trial and I don't doubt that he did bad things and I'm not defending Bill Cosby.
[34:35.000 --> 34:48.000]  But a lot of the women are like, I was a cocktail waitress at Playboy for six years and then I went up to a hotel room with him and then I think he put something in my drink.
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.000]  And I think he probably did that and it's horrible.
[34:55.000 --> 35:02.000]  But then they tell you about it 30 years, 40 years later.
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  It's stupid.
[35:06.000 --> 35:21.000]  And why is the media bringing this up now? Because they want to drive a fissure between men and women and create a victimology in this country to put many women in the same headspace that many African Americans are.
[35:21.000 --> 35:34.000]  A victimology so they can be controlled by the whole Hillary movement that she created when she's one of the biggest abusers of women by proxy through the wars she's launched and the things she's done.
[35:34.000 --> 35:45.000]  And the radical Islamic group she's funded and the pedophiles she's represented and the pedophiles she's protected and the pedophiles that she is constantly around and vacationing with.
[35:45.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's stunning. But then that leads us to Tom Brokaw.
[35:54.000 --> 36:08.000]  And am I going to sue him? I've said I'm going to. I've already filed one suit. Others pending. They've already withdrawn the Charlottesville suit. No media coverage of that.
[36:08.000 --> 36:19.000]  Then they just like we predicted filed another fake one yesterday. No coverage of that because they don't want to go. Oh God, they had to pull the last one and file another and the lawyers have looked at it and it's just as bad.
[36:19.000 --> 36:30.000]  My lawyers just asked me please stop telling them how bad it is. Just let these things go to court. They're pretty sure the law clinic first year law students are doing these.
[36:30.000 --> 36:39.000]  I mean, when they amended it, they just cut out giant paragraphs hacked in or doesn't even make sense.
[36:39.000 --> 36:53.000]  And that's what they refiled it. It's it's it's next level defamation by proxy where you don't publish a magazine article. You don't publish a book.
[36:53.000 --> 37:05.000]  You publish a 70 page line and a deception to the media picks it up like oh it's a lawsuit. It's true like the lawsuits that Trump's a Russian agent.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  Well, if he is we need more Russian agents boy kicking the hell out of Russia cutting their energy off their energy sales surrounding them with military.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  That's that's what I tell you the Russians must be suicidal.
[37:23.000 --> 37:33.000]  So one thing Trump's doing that's really wrong is sliding towards the neocon behavior with Russia and Syria and everything along those lines North Korea things great.
[37:33.000 --> 37:44.000]  That's part of the math part of the calculus to do the thing in Syria. So Kim Jong-un knows that we speak very clearly and carry a big stick.
[37:44.000 --> 38:09.000]  But Tom Brodeca is back in the news section we cue him up calling me an unlawed racist. There's a bunch of these clubs and then we've got a new name for him because what's good for the goose is good for the gander and the stew I'm cooking in is the stew you can cook in and look him calling me a complete dedicated racist.
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's what unlawed means it means complete 100%.
[38:16.000 --> 38:29.000]  Like you could say Hitler was a unlawed anti semi. That's a fair statement to say that I'm a 100% racist.
[38:29.000 --> 38:40.000]  Is actionable is defamation even a public figure. We would win that case. But isn't he kind of winning it against himself people know that's a load and a crock.
[38:40.000 --> 38:57.000]  I mean yeah you'll find the occasional group of fascistic liberals it'll chant Nazi Nazi get out get out to myself or Milo or dump coffee on your head. They're deranged people who've chosen to never even hear me say anything racist.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  But to just say I am so they get to dehumanize me and feel good as a gang.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  Coming after me.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  But Tom Brodeca.
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  It's been accused of sexual harassment and being mean.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  To a particular woman.
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  Now who knows if this is true.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  But but but but but but she looks credible.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  We'll go to her clip in a minute we're going to first play the unlawed racist club.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  She sounds credible.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  And I know people that know Tom Brodeca and they say he is a jerk.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And the Tom Brodeca is arrogant.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  And the Tom Brodeca thinks he's God.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  Well here's the deal Tom Brodeca just like you look and behave like the crepe keeper.
[39:50.000 --> 39:59.000]  You're a perfect archetype a signpost old scarecrow pointing towards hell for mainstream media and the fact that it's dead.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  And that they've had to roll you and Dan rather out.
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.000]  And and Brian Williams you know all of you frauds with all the journalistic frauds you're well known for.
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  You just hope people forget about all the fake stories you published all the lies Brodeca all the terrible things you've done.
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  But now would it be fair to call Tom Brodeca an unlawed rapist.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  An unlawed harasser.
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.000]  You see there's no evidence of me being the racist they say I am but it's a buzzword.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  Right up there with being a child molester.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  Is Tom Brodeca a child molester.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  We know it's very popular in elite circles.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  I have no evidence he's a child molester.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  He looks like a child molester to me.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  Looks like a psychopath.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  Looks like a criminal.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Looks like a piece of felt.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  But I'm not going to say he's an unlawed rapist.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  An unlawed child molester.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  He looks like a vampire bat actually.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  He's a literal vampire bat.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  The headlines Jones claims Tom Brodeca is a literal vampire bat.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  And Hillary is literally a demon.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  But I'm just saying you know that because he wanted to teach me how to be mean.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  Well you're going to be shoveled into your old stinking grave soon.
[41:30.000 --> 41:37.000]  You lying anti-American globalist sack of crap that writes all these books by how you love our military and love this country.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  You little vampire bat.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  You little blood sucking worm.
[41:41.000 --> 41:49.000]  You'll be shoveled into your grave soon enough and metaphysically with all the other old fake rotting carcass of the mainstream media.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  You sickening degenerate maggot head.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  Are you like that?
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  You old punk.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  You old bully.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  Here let's go to his unlawed racist club.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  Here it is.
[42:01.000 --> 42:14.000]  Talk about Alex Jones for example, but the fact is that he is an unlawed racist, a man whose outs are pulling the pin on the grenade every day and he has 6 million viewers who are paying attention to him.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  And the parents at Newtown are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  They buy into what he is saying which is actually not true.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  I'm going to come back with now the allegations that he's a brutal harasser.
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  But first, we'll have this break and return.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And notice they just recycled that.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  They've got videos of me 3-4 years ago saying I believe Newtown happened.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  They don't care.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  They say he keeps bullying the parents.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  He keeps saying it didn't happen.
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  No, you're saying it along with Megan Kelly who's plunging in the ratings and is about to get her butt fired.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  What an embarrassment both of you are.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  Your expiration dates up brother.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  Not because you're old, but because you're a soulless piece of garbage.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life.
[43:03.000 --> 43:11.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[43:33.000 --> 43:41.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[43:41.000 --> 43:49.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  Use carnivore by Infowars Life.
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and secure your bottle now. That's InfowarsLife.com.
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  Thank you all for watching InfowarsLife.com.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  Thanks for the anthroplex too.
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  The super blue is awesome.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  And thank you so much Alex for the InfowarsLife products.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  They are quality.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  I can't wait to get some more.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  Absolutely.
[45:42.000 --> 45:50.000]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  If we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  Make them protest.
[46:21.000 --> 46:32.000]  Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[46:42.000 --> 46:53.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[46:53.000 --> 47:13.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  Defending the Republic.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  From enemies, foreign and domestic.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:32.000 --> 47:48.000]  Well, the vampire bat of media, Tom Brokaw, has been accused of vicious sexual harassment while at his perch.
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.000]  And he just doesn't know, doesn't know what to do.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  But we were talking about Bezos and his weird neurotic laugh that he now tries to keep under control.
[48:00.000 --> 48:11.000]  And it was funny when the stars aligned, they found a clip of him doing the neurotic laugh while talking about Tom Brokaw in between eating cockroaches.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  I'm not kidding.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  If you're watching on TV or seeing all this, let's go ahead and roll that clip from what, 1999.
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  Here it is.
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  The best-selling book at Amazon.com has been The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Do you think we're going to put that on television?
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  I don't know.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  It'll be a test of your credibility.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  Well, a while ago, I bought a few.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  The interview is 15 minutes of that and that's not even of really the crazy ones.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's really wild.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  He's hopping around like...
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  It's all a complete act.
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  Now, let's get back to Tom Brokaw saying I'm this unalloyed racist, which means total complete, 100%.
[48:53.000 --> 49:01.000]  So this vampire bat, when he's hanging upside down, crapping on America with little bits of fake news guano that are dropping on our heads,
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  he wants to cash in on veterans, cash in on the greatest generation trying to make himself that.
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  When he is an anti-American globalist that has been feeding at the throat of this country for 40 years, covering up globalism, the New World Order, all of it.
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  So this is kind of the posthumous award to this gentleman right now, Tom Brokaw.
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  Because they're all a bunch of fake news individuals and they're all politically and culturally dead.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  They just don't know it yet.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  So maybe he's not a vampire bat.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  He kind of looks like one. He's a zombie walking dead.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  Nobody gave him the memo.
[49:39.000 --> 49:46.000]  So here's the latest on the fact that some are saying, not me, that he's an unalloyed rapist.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  Here it is.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  Linda Vester.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  For a decade, I worked at NBC News as an anchor and correspondent.
[49:54.000 --> 50:02.000]  I was groped and assaulted by Tom Brokaw, then the anchor of NBC Nightly News.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  This is my story.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  I was a brand new, newly hired correspondent for NBC News for a weekend today.
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  And I was sent to Denver in August of 93 to cover the Pope's trip there.
[50:24.000 --> 50:34.000]  And while I was standing in the Denver Bureau with my back to the door, from behind me, out of nowhere,
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.000]  Tom Brokaw walked up, put his hands on my waist and tickled me all up and down my waist.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  It was physically unpleasant and humiliating.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  I jumped a foot.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Well, it paused.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  I don't want to show this because there's kids watching.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  But have you seen a vampire bat feed?
[50:52.000 --> 50:59.000]  That's they fly in from behind land and then they actually tickle with their tongue so that you don't get upset.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  And then they have a little teeth.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  They cut a ring and then a lap the blood.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  So see, he's not guilty of sexual harassment.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  I can tell you, he was trying to get some food.
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  And you know, you shouldn't deny people starving to death.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  He was hungry.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  This lady doesn't understand.
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  He was hungry.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  Show some basic respect, lady.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  Let's go back to it.
[51:24.000 --> 51:31.000]  After nightly news in the eye, he looked back at me and his jaw dropped.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  And I was hit pause.
[51:35.000 --> 51:41.000]  Because once they start salivating to keep the blood from coagulating, they can't keep their mouth closed.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  Once they start feeding until they've gored their little bellies, you don't.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  Yeah, let's show some of this being so mean to him.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  Imagine he just flapped on over their little belly.
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  He was hungry.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  Yeah, let's watch some feeding time.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  There you go.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  So this lady doesn't understand what she was dealing with.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  And I'm sorry for actually what she went through.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  You know, those even come up to the edge of South Texas.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  You walk out your barn, five or six of those are on top of your horse, your cow.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  That's not a good deal.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  But what happens when they're a top anchor at NBC News?
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  Huh?
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  The whole time, masquerading is a human.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  Let's continue.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  I humiliated in front of a room full of my colleagues.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  I jumped, got out of the way, got out of his grasp.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  No one did a thing.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  And there was really nothing I could say or do because I was so low on the totem pole
[52:34.000 --> 52:42.000]  that I had just had to get out of there as quickly as possible and try to go on and do my job covering the pope.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  That's just an excerpt of her big variety interview.
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.000]  And to be serious, I believe her and mammals are mammals.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Men and women like each other.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  That's their issue.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  If she didn't like it, she'd never have done it again.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  And obviously I'm not literally saying he's a vampire bat, but they'll edit that together and put it on.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  It's okay.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  He is the vampire bat now.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  Tom Brokaw.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  And if you look at his face, the nose kind of points up everything.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  That happens from years of having your face down in the meat.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  And then the nose kind of bends up when you're slobbering along, you know, getting your dinner.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  And that's what happens.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  This is called satire, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  I'm having a little bit of fun here.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[53:22.000 --> 53:30.000]  If you're a new viewer on all our great new TV affiliates across the country, please tell your circle of friends, your neighbors, people randomly.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  Hey, Alex Jones is on Channel X.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  He's on Channel Y.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  He's on Channel A because it's exciting.
[53:38.000 --> 53:45.000]  You see, all these TV stations have two or three or four sub-carriers now in the digital band.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  And they can just put us on 24 hours a day.
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  That's what the stations all want, just to fill those.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  We're free to air.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  You can take all the commercials.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  If you are a TV station, you can't with radio.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  I still work with GCN. I like GCN, but I thought about not working with them.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  So I can say, hey, the ads are all radio stations.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  Wow, that'd be a nice incentive, wouldn't it?
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  But we'll see.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  I'm a very loyal person, but I've just been using them as a syndicator for a while.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  And I just want to go free to air for everybody and do something no one's ever done in talk radio and commercial talk radio.
[54:14.000 --> 54:21.000]  But I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen, to all the TV stations and cable stations.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  You name it.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Free to air, baby.
[54:25.000 --> 54:31.000]  And we're up to 10 hours live every day, some days more.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  We're trying to add more broadcasts, trying to add more hoes.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  We're building up the infrastructure while we're under globalist attack.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  Am I complaining?
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  It's an animating contest, but we need your support.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  Now, the next hour will be more serious.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  We had some serious North Korean news earlier.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  Very good news.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  Record coming together the North and South.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  Trump just spectacular job changing course and it's truly delivering.
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  So let's pray for peace. There's some really bad news when it comes to Iran.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  They're, they're really a big issue and making a lot of threats and matters is talking about that.
[55:01.000 --> 55:09.000]  Crime rates skyrocketing and culturally enriched Britain now higher than New York and other cities in the U.S.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  More on Bill Cosby.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  Who I guess is an unalloyed rapist.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Is it convicted unalloyed rapist?
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  I don't take pleasure in that because Bill Cosby was more of a conservative individual.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  And you notice he got conservative the last decade publicly and they didn't like that.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  And I know some folks that know Bill Cosby known him a long time.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  They say he's a gentleman.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  Super nice to everybody.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  But a woman says that, you know, you took him in the house and gave him a quailude or whatever.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  I've never even seen a quailude, but some kind of pill and some kind of like barbiturate or something.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  I don't know.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  And that that's the end end of it.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  So there you go.
[55:48.000 --> 55:57.000]  You know, I just have a little bit of a jaundice eye at all this because I've had people accuse me of things that are 110% totally false.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  In that EEOC complaint, it says, Jones never said anything sexual to me.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  But I felt like he was gay grooming me.
[56:05.000 --> 56:17.000]  How am I supposed to sit there with a straight face and talk to somebody who wants to have mediation with me and go, OK, I never said anything sexual, but you felt like it.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  That's next level.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  That's next level.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  Now it's, I felt like it.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  Did you, did you, you know, did you feel like a little wind blew behind your back?
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Maybe Casper the friendly ghost flew by too.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  I mean, it's, it's, it's next level.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  Seriously, folks, infowarstore.com.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  That's how we battle all this garbage.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  We're bringing America back.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  We're bringing freedom back.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  We're bringing Americana back.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  We're bringing it all back, baby, and they hate us and they think if they can knock us down, they can knock anybody down.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  They can knock anybody down.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  Big sales are going to have to end next week.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  A lot of them this weekend.
[56:52.000 --> 57:02.000]  50% off for male vitality, 25% off brain force, the best selling to tropic, 25% off X2 survival shield, the purest iodine that we know of anybody can even get close to.
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.000]  And it's a rare earth, you know, deep, deep breath crystal, pure.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  And it's very hard to get.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's why we can't find anybody else that's got up and trying for two years as another supplier.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  So that group with his proprietary deal can make it.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  And I remember saying years ago, no, I can't find anybody else to get it from.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  We, we looked big time.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  We've got people that are big cures for some of the largest companies in the country.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  And I could know it's all signed off in contracts for pharmaceutical production.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  It's a precursor to a lot of things.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  It's a controlled substance.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  Actually, pure iodine before it's been put into the palm oil is a precursor to a lot of things.
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.000]  But it's available at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  Unfortunately, possibly for a limited time.
[57:45.000 --> 58:14.000]  Stay with us.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones,
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  we have it in fullers life.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  They take hours.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  It's stronger.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  It's back in stock.
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.000]  It's got the preglonone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  So you can upload it.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4 to 5 toothpaste
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  is super blue silver immune gargle.
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  That's a spray you do.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  You can also swallow it.
[59:28.000 --> 59:34.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[59:35.000 --> 59:41.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[59:45.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  When Bigly, that's his new bestselling book about Trumpisms and more.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Scott Adams joins us for the next 30, 40 minutes or so.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Dilbert.com, blog.dilbert.com.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Wow, he has just been a free thinker and he has been somebody outside the box and trying
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  to get people to not just go off what the spin is, but what the facts are.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  He's called it the fact free world.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  But maybe we're going to the golden age, like he said, where it'll be more about the facts
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  and knowing about our own emotions.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  And so he has been at the center of the firestorm with Kanye West, thousands of articles a
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  day, millions of people extra watching his videos.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  I've played his latest video a few days ago here on air.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  We're going to go to break in a minute and come back with Scott Adams joining us live
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  via Skype, but they are melting down about this.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  And I see it as a major turning point as he said Kanye West blew a hole in reality when
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  he did this, just like Scott Adams blew, maybe a little smaller hole.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  And I blew a smaller hole, but all of us blowing little holes.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  Now Kanye blowing a bigger, much larger hole.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Candace Owens doing that, shaking the authoritarians and showing us just how authoritarian they
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  are that this is a big deal in America, that Kanye West can be friends with Trump for
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  a decade and say he supports him right as Trump with Korea and so many other things
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  has big victories.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  So here's a few minutes of the viral video is Kanye West bringing us into the golden age
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  and what is the golden age?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  So we humans have developed a number of prisons of the mind, things that we just imagine to
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  be true, and it limits what we think is possible and it limits what choices we make.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  Here are two of the biggest ones.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  I talk about this a lot.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Is the false belief that history repeats?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  It doesn't.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  It never does.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  It just looks like it because we have this pattern recognition brain.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  So anytime we see anything that reminds us of another thing, we say, well, there it is,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  history repeating again.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  History can't repeat because all the variables are changing all the time.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  So you can't ever have the same starting point you ever had in history.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  History never repeats, ever.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  If you think it does, you're in a mental prison.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  If you think it doesn't, do you know what happens if you think that history doesn't repeat?
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Then you can become president of the United States without ever being a politician.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  If you believe the history repeats, you don't even try.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  President Trump is not in a mental prison.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Did he think that North Korea was unsolvable?
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Nope.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Did he think he couldn't negotiate trade deals?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Nope, he didn't think that.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Did he think he couldn't give people nicknames and win an election that way?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  With other stuff, of course.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Nope.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Did he think that nobody could talk about immigration without being labeled a racist
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  and therefore their life was over?
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  Didn't seem to bother him.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  He consistently shows you that history doesn't repeat.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Where do you get that?
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Well, probably.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  It traces back to the same place I got it.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  The power of positive thinking.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Remember, his pastor, when he was a kid, was Norman Vincent Peel, who wrote The Power of Positive Thinking.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  The power of positive thinking is very close to this.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  It's very close to thinking to the belief that you're not in a mental prison.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  History doesn't define you.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  You know, you can get out of that little mental prison.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Here's another one that I like to look at.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Another mental prison.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  All right.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  That the problem has to be the solution.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Now, this will require some explaining.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  All right.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  But it's a mental trap.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  It's a prison.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  If you think that the only...
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  All right.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  We'll be back with the man himself.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Adams of blog.dilbert.com.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  And of course, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Isn't it great now?
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  After being sold out for months,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue fluoride.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  And people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  But if you contribute to blood clots and heart attacks,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  that's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Silothol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  By the way, on the heels of the big North Korea peace deal
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  to denuclearize and basically begin the process of merging with two countries,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  a huge victory by Trump getting outside the box believing that
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  you don't solve problems as Scott Adams was saying with the same problem.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  House panel. Russia report finds no evidence.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  200 plus pages long of collusion.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  Trump says probe must end now.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  Well, they might not mind that because they've moved on to Stormy Daniels
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  and Trump's lawyer and women.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  All of that directed by Mueller.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Unbelievable.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Trump calls Russia investigation a witch hunt after it finds no evidence of collusion.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  The collusion is by Hillary.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  But Scott Adams sarcastically during the campaign said,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  I am now a Hillary supporter so they don't kill me.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Well, I guess it wasn't too sarcastic, but I guess it was real,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  but it was done tongue in cheek.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Talk about courage.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  That's who I admire.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Not just folks that are right because I admire people that are smart
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  and know what they're talking about.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  People have courage.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  You add those together.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  That's called game changing.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  That's called trailblazing.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Do I agree with him that history doesn't repeat?
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Well, times come when there's renaissance and people stop repeating.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  But a lot of times we get in these state systems where people do follow the power structure,
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  do follow the state political system.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  So the same group stays in power so they repeat the same basic activities,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  but he's right.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  They're not literally repeating the same thing.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  But then there are these renaissance points that I believe do cause these giant leaps forward.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  But he's laid out this golden age.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  I think we've been in it since the Gutenberg press.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  I think it's been tumultuous.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  It's been problems, but look at all the good things happening with the bad.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  But what could the end of the golden age bring us into the age of infinity?
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  We'll talk some about that.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  So, Scott Evans, congratulations on getting the whole world really thinking about
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  shifting paradigms and thanks for spending time with us.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  You know, everybody, my critics told me that I can't talk to you.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  You know that, right?
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  They attacked me and said, he's been on info wars so we can't listen to anything he says
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  that might be productive and useful.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  But I say Kanye changed everything.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  And, you know, I can love you.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  I don't have to disagree with you.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  So I'm going to take Kanye's lead and say, I'm Switzerland.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  I'll go on whatever show wants me to talk to their audience and share my opinion.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Which is a fundamental Americana idea.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  I mean, let's speak to that.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  This new thing where they say lie about who I am and what I say when they tell you don't come on the show.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  You want to control who can communicate, who can talk.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  That sounds like a prison.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Yeah, a prison of the mind.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  You know, the moment you can't associate and deal with people, you got problems.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  You know, speaking of North Korea, let's not forget the enormous psychological benefit
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  that Dennis Rodman brought to the situation.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Because if you think about it, you know, he's as out of the box as you can get.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  And what did he do?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  He associated with someone that everybody said, don't associate with him.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  You can't do that.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  And Dennis Rodman said, watch me, watch me go do this.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And I'm pretty sure that the Dennis Rodman experience probably was part of the calculation
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  that we understood Kim Jong-un to be a rational player who had at least a little fondness for the West.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  So Dennis Rodman, presidential, you know, medal of freedom, maybe, you know, if things work out,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I think his name's got to be in that conversation.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  I've got to apologize, Dennis Rodman.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  I didn't see it the way you saw it then.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  And I just saw the freakest nature and the crimes committed by North Korea.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  But keeping them in the communist position, if we don't reform them and don't work with them,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  we become the oppressors by keeping them in our minds being the devil.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  Is that what you're talking about, about mental presence?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And think about the fact that we like to say, oh, don't give oxygen to this bad person or this bad idea.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  But it's not giving oxygen.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  It's bringing in another voice.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  It's bringing in an influence.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  It's bringing in a persuasion that could change that thing you're not liking to something you might like a little bit better.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So Dennis Rodman was not endorsing North Korea.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  He was bringing persuasion.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  And it may have been an important part of progress.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Why didn't I see that?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  It was like bringing Coca-Cola, rock and roll, and Levi's blue jeans into Russia.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  I admit, Scott, I missed the boat on that.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Wow.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Well, go back to your constitution, right?
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  This whole freedom of speech business, it's a big, big idea and it keeps working.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Like every time we get a little more freedom of speech, people are a little happier and they act surprised.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  It's like, whoa, freedom of speech worked again.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Surprise.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  So Kanye is reminding us something I guess we forgot.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  Dennis Rodman reminded us of something I think we forgot.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  Candace Owens is also part of the conversation, the reminding us of the power of free thought, free speech,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  the ability to talk to the people who are not your best friend,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  the ability to talk to somebody without saying you can't talk to them.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  And what I define as the golden age is a realization that most of our problems are no longer physical.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  As in, I have the plague and I don't have a cure.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  That's a physical problem.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  I don't have enough resources.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  I don't have enough food.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  That's a physical problem.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  But North Korea, we're starting to understand was always a psychological problem because the solution was there.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  We just had to figure it out.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  I believe the same is true with issues in Iran.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  I think we can get to a good place with them if we take the same mindset that we can talk to them.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  We can listen to them.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  We can figure something out.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  There's probably a way to make that work.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  You look at Kim Jong-un, I've never seen him actually look this happy.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  I mean, I would imagine he does want to reform.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  He probably doesn't want to continue being part of this evil dynasty that he was, this communist dynasty he was born into.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  And you see all this happening just like Trump planned it.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  I was told by State Department officials over a month ago how this would then unfold.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  And that's why this is moving so fast.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  It looks like Kim Jong-un is basically really ready to give up the nuclear weapons.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Yeah, you know, I call this the difference between wanting and deciding.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  They probably wanted to denuclearize, but now he's actually decided.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  So that's what you're seeing looks like the activity.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Both sides have just said, wait a minute, I can't even remember why we were mad at each other, right?
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  History is going to say, why did you have that problem in the first place?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  In fact, Kim Jong-un, I believe one of his quips when he was shaking hands with Moon was, you know, why did this take so long?
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  You know, why did we wait?
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You know, something along those lines that I think that's how history will see it.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  And you've been saying for months Trump's going to get a good deal just at a historical gut level against Scott Adams,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Crater Dilburton, so much more great philosopher with us.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  And you've been proving right about that again.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  But the way the media is trying to ignore this or sidestep it, some of them are having to admit that it's a big deal and a good deal.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  This is really game changing.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  But the way they're trying to sabotage it and the way they're not giving Trump credit when the new policies really did push this decision is just crazy.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Yeah, you know, the whole who gets credit for what is going to be a fascinating to watch.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  I was very encouraged by seeing President Trump tweet credit to President Xi of China without taking credit in the same tweet.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Now, I always talk about the dog that didn't bark, you know, look for the thing that's not there.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  What was missing was President Trump taking credit.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  He was actually giving it to China.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Now, is that the right way to play it?
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Hell, yes.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  I mean, you know, that is your highest level of good work.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  I mean, that's the leader you want.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  You want him to say, I'll take the credit when it's mine.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Here's your credit.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Everybody gets credit.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Let's make this thing happen.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  So his relationship with, you know, Macron, with President Xi, you know, those things make a big difference.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And he does that stuff well when it matters.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  And notice Trump called it an elevation.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  He doesn't like fake tension and rotting countries and all the rest of it.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  He wants to pragmatically build things up and why if South Korea is the most productive country in the world per capita,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  why would we sit there just for the military industrial complex and for China for tension?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Let this keep going.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  We now know it was the Clintons and others shipping weapons in, giving them the nukes,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  giving them the missiles that wanted to keep this going.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And now the globalist and their continued crises creation have a new sheriff in town.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  But we'll see how they'll strike back.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  More predictions with Scott Adams.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  And we'll talk about Kanye West and what's next.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  That's black rifle real estate.com.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Ready to eat bacon.com.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  Hear that?
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  even when you're miles away.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  Security is a mindset.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  FakeTV.com.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  For your gut, because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there,
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  and other free radicals.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from InfoWars.

[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  Well, Scott Adams is our guest.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  And again, over the weekend and throughout the week,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Kanye West started tweeting out some of his videos and information.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  And I'm all about positive thinking.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Now, I've run into some people, some of these preachers that get into it,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  they just say name it and claim it.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  You just say, I want a box of gold to fall out of the sky like a genie does,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  and it's going to happen.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  And then it doesn't happen, and I've seen the people go crazy.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  But I remember growing up, going into stores or businesses,
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  and everybody liked my dad so much.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And I was like a 10 or 11, 12, kind of a bad attitude.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  And I'd say, why is everybody like you?
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  And he'd say, because I have a good attitude.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  And you know, my dad was married, my mom's still married, great.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  I was like, why do these women come up and like get out of cars at red lights
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  and ask where you're going?
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  What are you doing?
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  He's like, I just have a good attitude.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  I have a good attitude.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  So I understand in business and life and everything,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  being positive, looking at the best parts of it.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  I see some positive thinking that where they get so positive,
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  they look at all the bad things that don't do anything about it,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  just saying be positive.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Now, I think admitting bad things are going on is positive to get that out
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  front and do something about it.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  And I wanted to get Scott Adams of blog.dilbert.com's breakdown on that.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  What he thinks is coming next with Trump.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  What's coming next with Kanye West.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  But the other big shoes to drop are because when you think about positive thinking,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  I never really applied it to what the left does.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  The social engineers with the me too movement trying to make all women victims
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  or make all blacks victim.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  And you realize they're like the anti positive movement.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  And I never really, even though it's so obvious now,
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  and I've listened to his stuff for years and read books about it and know it's
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  right that it's totally true.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  And I feel like I've missed the center point of it until just the last few weeks.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  But I think like the hundreds of monkeys Scott Adams,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  other people are starting to really get that it's not just positive thinkers
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  like you that are so successful and right and helping people like Kanye and others
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  not be negative, but that we're now realizing like the other side knows this
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  but is using the opposite tactics.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  So it's more important than ever to do what you're doing.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  Yeah, there's such a utility in positivity.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  You know, they can do get into your box.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  We can make this happen, kind of make America great again attitude.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  And the thing is it's sort of a long game.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  You know, the classic game was, well, I'll take care of this special interest group.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  You know, these guys will get a little something this these would get a little something
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  Trump by completely refusing to recognize categories of Americans rather
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  rather than just treating us as Americans.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  It's a long game where you knew he would be viciously criticized for being racist, whatever.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  But if his plan works long term, the economy gets better.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  We see talk from Jared Kushner about prison reform.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  We might see something out of that.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  We see something good with North Korea.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  I think something good and with Iran will happen after maybe some extra tenseness
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  before we get there.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  But there's a whole lot of stuff going in the right direction.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  And that's why I call it the golden age.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  I think it's going to be a time when when this president consistently draws a picture
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  that says this is what your experience is as our friend.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  This is what your experience is as not our friend.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  Do you see how gigantic this difference is?
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  We'd like more friends.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Come on over.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  You know, that in some cases there will be legitimate differences of strategic priorities.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  So we can't be friends with everybody about everything.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  But I would argue that most of the problems, at least between countries,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  at least the big countries fall into the psychological positioning persuasion kind of category.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  And I don't see anything that would physically stop us from having something good come out
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  with Russia, with Iran.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  You know, the Palestinians is a little, not a little, but a harder, harder thing to crack.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  But for the big countries, I think we may be entering a golden age of cooperation.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  I agree with you and a lot of insiders, a lot of top academics, a lot of top people in government say, though,
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  that the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of and other groups,
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  they want tension, they want crisis, they want problems because they're crisis managers
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  and that they're deliberately always trying to stoke tensions and problems.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And you can see that out of the groups trying to make sure we don't have peace with North Korea particularly
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  and other things happening.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  They are actively in there trying to get us into a new conflict with Russia.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  What's your view on that, Scott Adams?
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Well, money ruins everything.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  So if you have an enormous military industrial complex, there's just a lot of money
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  to nudge a lot of things the way that will make them more money.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  So I don't know exactly how the conversations go within closed doors, within Congress in Washington.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Do they really say, ah, we don't want to war with North Korea,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  but it looks like it'd be profitable for your company and you donate to me, so I'll be okay.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  I don't know that it's express.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  It feels like it just manifests itself in a lot of different ways, in small ways until it becomes a big problem.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  But if our economy is good and we've got a president who can say no to these companies, we've got something.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Now it looks like President Trump has found a workaround because if you want to sell a lot of arms, there are two ways to do it.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  One is have a war.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  Nobody wants that.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  But the other way is to have a peaceful buildup of your military.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  And President Trump is saying, look, we're going to get to peace by sort of the Reagan method of making our military so strong that it's not even worth a thought.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  Peace through strength.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  You're going to go up against it.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  So the military industrial complex has a plan B with President Trump that they did not have with, let's say, President Obama.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  And when you said that, I was just thinking as a smaller microcosm, you're at the 40,000 foot view, about a thousand foot view on the peninsula,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  to pressure the North to stop what they're doing in China.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Massive buildup.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Japan buys a bunch of weapons.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  South Korea buys a bunch of weapons.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  Peace through strength.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  They cut off Kim, have the sanctions.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  He comes to the table, so now we have the cake and eat it too.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  The U.S. is in a stronger position.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  These countries can defend themselves from China, which is becoming a bigger threat in the region.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  And we force North Korea to come to the table and begin de-escalating things.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  That is beautifully done.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  That is amazing parlance.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  And all of that is amazing and great, and you left out the best part of the story, which is North Korea is going to have an economic boom, the like of which they have never seen, if they play well.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  So if our former enemies see the benefit of becoming current friends, that's big.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  Just like Vietnam.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  It's really big.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  Just like Vietnam.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  Vietnam, I think we didn't drag our feet a little bit on that.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  That was more of a running away situation than making peace.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  No, no, I agree.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  But now look 40 years later.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I mean, just look at the place.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  There are allies there against China.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  Right.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Yeah, and Japan, of course, is the best example of all time of the benefit of turning from enemy to friend.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  That worked out very well for them.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  So that serves as a good model as well.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  There you go.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  For example, Scott's got one even better.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Man, I tell you, I've been reading your books since I was a teenager.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  My uncle, God rest his soul, died a few years ago.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  He was a huge fan because he was a lay cartoonist.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  He liked doing drawings and stuff himself.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  Just amazing.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  We come back.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  Scott Adams, I want to ask him the final segment with us.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  What does he want to cover?
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  What does he think is coming next?
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  And, you know, a lot of positive things are happening.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  I agree.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  But what are the pitfalls of the Golden Age?
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Because so many times right before you get there, before you get to the promised land,
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  there's something in your way.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  We're not promising some utopia.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  We're just saying an age of things being better.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Or will it be a technocracy of dystopia?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  It's a lot of powerful groups.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  They don't want to ride success.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  They want to sit on top of a pile of political skulls.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  We'll be back with Scott Adams.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  We'll be back with Scott Adams.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  This is Dan Pilla.

[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again,
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  hitting the gym once again.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Obviously, a superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing,
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.

[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Mother!
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Well, Scott Adams has been on fire for a long time.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  How many number one New York Times bestsellers he's had?
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  I know quite a few, always in the list.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Crater Dilbert and so much more.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  But better known, I've got to say just to a wider audience today
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  by daring to not say that Trump was Satan.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And then he went through a lot.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  He talks about it.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  I've heard him talk about how it basically killed some of his speaking career
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  and some of the things that he went through.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  But now, by being a trailblazer, it's paying off big time.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  And going back to that, what made you decide?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  Something you've always said what you think and stand for what you stand for.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  Or maybe you've always been the South Spoken,
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  but it just seems like they're really attacking you more.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  Are you more outspoken than you used to be a decade ago?
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  Or are they just bigger bullies than they were a decade ago?
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  And we know that's the case.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  Why is it now that they're just everywhere freaking out how dare Scott Adams
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  say these horrible things when it's totally positive?
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  It just shows what crazy cults they are.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  Yeah, some of it is.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  I think people are thinking that I have enough influence
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  that it's a problem to whatever they want to influence.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  So some of it is just the appearance of having influence.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  That makes you a target.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Now, I am a little more outspoken, but I got there honestly
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  by just getting on the early story about Trump's rise
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  and being a narrator for that impredictor of it.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  So that gave me a little bit of credibility,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  which allowed me to change focus to a persuasion filter on politics
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  and people take me a little bit more seriously now.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  And then Kanye's tweet probably changed how people look at me as well,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  because in a sense it's showing that we're on the same wavelength
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  on something that people care about.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Well, you've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  What are you predicting next?
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  What trends is Scott Adams looking at?
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Well, it's a Friday, so I'm going to go all with good news.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  That's where the Golden Age is taking us.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  For on the humorous side of predictions,
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  I had speculated that wouldn't it be funny if the climate,
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  the temperature of the world went down during Trump's administration
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  for no reason, just sometimes temperatures go down.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  And we're seeing some reports, I don't know how reliable they are,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  that there might be some kind of a cooling pause that we're in,
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  which is hilarious, but not scientific.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Well, that's right, even Noah came out,
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  the big national center this week and said,
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  oh, global warming is not as bad as we thought.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  There's a cooling trend.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  Yeah, so I think here's my optimistic prediction.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  I think that the temperature might keep going up on average,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  even though it looks like it took a pause.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  But we're also developing technology that can alter the CO2 in the air.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  It can suck it out.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  And if we spend enough money, we can actually make a difference in the climate.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  So I think between the fact that the projection models are being proven to be a little hot
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  and the fact that our technology is coming online,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  the risk went from this big to maybe more like this,
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  meaning that if you get the technology up, which we could do,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  it would just take a moonshot kind of attitude to do it.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  But the engineering's already proved out.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  So I think we're at a point where climate change could approach solvable.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  That's the optimistic view.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Then on healthcare, I'd like to see technology do what government can't.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Congress is a terrible tool for figuring out anything that's complicated
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  and has a lot of different interests involved.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And healthcare is all of that.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  But technology is coming online.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  We just saw which country was it.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  One of the Middle East countries developed a pod that you just get in it
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  and it does a full body scan and checks everything.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  It just takes a minute. You're seeing lots of telemedicine,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  lots of breakthroughs in cancer treatments, et cetera.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  So the real magic bullet for healthcare is bringing down the cost through technology
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  so that some people, perhaps not all,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  but some people who would not be able to afford healthcare
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  could get something closer to a free version
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  that might actually be the best healthcare you can get
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  because it could be all the new stuff.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Whereas other people might want to say,
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  I want to keep my doctor. I like the personal touch.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  So I'm going to just stay with the traditional path.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  I think we have a chance for a Bernie Sanders-like,
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  almost universal healthcare without changing taxes.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Now that would be the golden age, right?
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  Sure, because we lower the prices so much, it's still free market,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  but it's so exactly.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  Normally, in every case, technology gets more available.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  The price goes down massively.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  I mean, here's an example of a product we sell.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Alexa Breeze came out about three years ago.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Back then, four-stage HIPAA filters were about $800.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  They were revolutionizing it, making it for a lot less.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  We were selling it for $300.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  Just in the three years, it's gone down.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  We can sell it for $200, and it's only costing like $100 to make.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  It's about to go down to like $70 to make.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  We're going to lower the price again.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  But why is healthcare skyrocketing then
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  when every other technological development makes the price go down?
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Because of bureaucracy or why?
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  It's probably because of some combination of lobbyists
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  and rules that are favorable for companies.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  There could be something about risk management
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  that needs to be tweaked, maybe with better information,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  not to be reckless.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  But there are probably things that are safe enough
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  or could be safe enough under the right conditions
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  that we could do right now.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  So some of it's probably regulation.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Some of it is inertia and what we have to work with.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  And a lot of it is the new stuff that's expensive
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  is for things that we have never been able to cure before.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  So some of it is all just good.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  You got to pay for the big research up front.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  Yeah, and if there's a new solution for something
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  that didn't have a solution before,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  that's an extra expense, even if you're happy about it.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  So anyway, the big picture is that for routine medical care,
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  I think we could get that cost down through technology
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  approaching zero for people who don't have many resources
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  and it would be maybe 95% as good as the full service
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  that the rich people are getting.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  So I think that's possible.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  You're talking about almost a medical singularity
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  and before we get to more amazing predictions,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  let me just ask you this point.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  What would you call the thing that comes after the Golden Age
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  where things aren't perfect,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  but things get more and more positive.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  We go through some tumult.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  We go through some serious issues in that transition.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Things are going that way,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  but we have that Atlantean moment.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  We're in that process.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  The technology is so advanced, so dangerous.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  We blow ourselves up.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  Yeah, I'm a believer with Elon Musk
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  and a lot of other smart people
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  that the so-called singularity is a risk to humanity.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  And for those who are not familiar
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  with that use of the term singularity,
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  because it gets used in different contexts,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  it's when artificial intelligence gets to the point
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  where the computers can reprogram themselves.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  In other words, where they can evolve on their own
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  without our help.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  And the thought is that when they reach that point,
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  they will become a super mind, essentially.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  So quickly that we may not be ready
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  for how much it changes society.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  I'm an optimist on that.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  I love the fact we're worrying about it
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  because that's what makes you safe.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  I call this the Adam's Law of Slow Moving Disasters.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  And the way that works is,
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  if you can see a disaster coming for years,
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  it almost never kills us.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  We didn't run out of oil.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  The year 2000 thing didn't...
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  We'll do that. Humans build and try to take control
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  of their environment.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  You're right. We're seeing that.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  So let me ask you this then.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  What would you call what comes after the Golden Age?
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  I'd call it the Age of Infinity.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  Life extension, being a type 1 civilization,
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  off-world, unlimited, humanity going in different directions,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  basically unlimited choices, a human singularity.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Yeah, and it may be that intelligence
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  that we now think is pockets,
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  like you've got a brain, I've got a brain,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  the computer has a brain.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Those things may be so merged in the future
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  that intelligence doesn't mean what it used to.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  It's just what we all have.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  For example, my phone is here.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  I can talk into my phone and get an answer
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  to pretty much any question in the world,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  and that's only going to get better.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  So when I'm on Periscope, for example,
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  and I'm getting live responses in the comments,
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  it feels like a big connected brain
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  because I can say stuff like,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  well, you know, in history, that was that time.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Oh, tell me the history.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Hold on, Scott, stay right there.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  I mean, you'd agree to the whole hour,
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  but I want to take all your time,
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  but if we can go to break,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  come back for just a few minutes
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  and we'll decide to finish this thought
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  and then other predictions
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  about where Kanye's going next,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  and we'll let you go to have a great weekend.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  A little bit more time with Scott Adams.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones, straight ahead, infowars.com.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Call us Scott at Twitter at Scott Adams says.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  This essential mineral is necessary
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  in order to produce thyroid hormones
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  which influence every cell, tissue,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  and organ in the body.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  you may experience slow metabolism,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  work together to support the systems in your body.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  Take control of your chemistry today
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  with this super combo.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  and BioTrue Selenium at infowarslife.com.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  The new product at infowarslife.com
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  in a glass bottle, two-month servings
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  the real red pill.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  This is a heart and brain pill,
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  but it wasn't prescription,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  and I came up with our own formula
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  you add the preglenone to it,
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  that your body has to have
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  It is amazing.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  and your purchase of the operation.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  with prebiotic fiber by InfowarsLife.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  Help the good bacteria thrive
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  and support overall digestive health
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber,
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  a mixture of clinically studied
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients,
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  and even support your immune system.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  InfowarsLife's cutting-edge formula
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  only brings you the highest quality, organic,
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  only at the beginning of the colon,
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  throughout the entire colon
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Head to infowarslife.com
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  and tell you about the 60-plus products,
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  we have an InfowarsLife.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  It'd take hours.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins,
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  the amino acids.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  So you can upload it.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  And our latest product that goes great
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  with the super blue colloidal silver
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  and iodine fortified toothpaste
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  is super blue silver immune gargle
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  that's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  super high-quality silver,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  and a lot more.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  So thank you all for remembering InfowarsStore.com
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  and remembering that it's not just you
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  that's already awake,
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  but it's other people that aren't awake
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  Scott Adams is a best-selling author, cartoonist,
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  you name it,
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  and very, very popular, I guess,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  futurist online.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  He joins us here
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  and he's been at the center of the big Kanye West.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I don't want to say awakening,
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  but getting Kanye to go even more public
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  and speak out.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  And so you were finishing up
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  about the hive mind
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  and how you're connecting in
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  and the same thing, I'll be on Periscope
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  and I'll say something that isn't exactly right,
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  just as I forgot, they'll get it right,
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  or then they'll add some information
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  and the same thing on YouTube
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  with live comments coming in.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  And it gets where you can't even really do it live yourself.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  You're just suddenly interfacing with the people
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  and they're humans going out,
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  searching on the big, giant hive mind,
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  coming back to that little node
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  and then all sharing information with each other.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  That's what we started doing 20 years ago.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  I would start showing you articles
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  on the internet for radio and people are like,
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  wow, he's not just talking on a webcam,
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  he's showing me things.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And it made people add a whole new level
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  until it turned into radio for TV
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  or vice versa.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  So finish up with that point
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  and then tell us about your popular apps.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  And then I want to get into your next prediction for Kanye.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Will they be able to break his spirit,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  break his will?
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  Yeah, you know, the power of knowledge
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  can't be underestimated.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  I think that it had a big,
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  a lot to do with why North Korea is getting flexible
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  because they can't keep the internet from their population
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  and still be a legitimate modern country in the world in 20 years.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  It just can't happen.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  There is no path for keeping the internet away from a country.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  Likewise, Iran has the same problem only maybe bigger
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  because they're trying to keep,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  at least they're trying to edit the internet
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  for their population of this gigantic young population.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  They're very disproportionately young
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  and they're kind of Western.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  So you've got these fairly Western,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  not so religious, relatively speaking,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  you know, population bomb in Iran
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  who only needs the internet to make some change
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  because young people plus internet equals change.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  So the leaders of Iran have to see
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  that they only have a runway of 5 to 10 years maximum
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  for what they're doing now.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  So they better get flexible
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  and figure out what the thing is after this
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  that works better with the community of worlds.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  When we talk about how our audiences are getting younger
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  and younger and mainstream media is getting older and older,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  I'm not knocking old people.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  It was old people who taught me about globalism
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  and these systems of government and how to resist them.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  We're not attacking old folks when Paul Watson says,
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  my audience is, you know, 18 to 30 on average
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  and CNN is basically 54 to 86.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  I mean, that's their number. Same thing with Fox News.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  But the fact is I looked up your demographics interestingly enough
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  just through some Facebook statistics I saw
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  and you've got a wide swath of old, middle-aged, young,
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  but you're trending younger
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  and I'm really seeing with not millennials so much on average.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  There's a lot of great millennials.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  But with Generation Z, when my children are in school,
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  they go play sports at other schools.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  They have friends that are in public schools.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  They're in private school and I'm like a rock star,
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  but I'm kind of like tier two rock star.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  Oh, it's Alex Jones. Hey, photo.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  Paul Watson, Gavin McGinnish, Stephen Crowder,
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  all these people are like, do you know them?
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  Do you know them?
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  They don't know who Wolf Blitzer is.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  They don't care who Tom Brokaw is.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  I mean, that's got to scare the establishment.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  Yeah. I'm not sure how much the big networks
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  are making an impact anymore
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  because it feels like ABC, NBC, CBS,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  they're not moving the dial at all.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  There's an interesting thing with Fox News and CNN.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  They've kind of set themselves as each other's nemesis,
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  which gives them both more attention,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  is great for branding and all that.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  So CNN will keep its relevance,
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  but the ABC, NBC, CBS folks, they seem to be timing out.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  So what comes next for Kanye?
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Have you had a chance?
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  I mean, he's been tweeting your stuff.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  It's not like I'm enamored with a star.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  I'm enamored by top tier, second or third, first,
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  largest music person in the world,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  probably a billion fans.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  And to have him make this bold move,
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  and Jordan Peterson to be a rock star,
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  I mean, it really shows that,
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  I think we've hit the tipping point.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  As you said during the break in your own words,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  something's happening.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  So when you speak to that, and what is happening?
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  There seems to be some kind of a shift in,
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  you know, I hate to go new age,
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  but, you know, because it would be easy to go into Woo-Woo land.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  But it feels like the way people are looking at things is changing.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  Now, Trump is a big part of that.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  North Korea is a big part.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  Kanye is a part.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  And I think that people are noticing
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  that when we think in non-traditional ways
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  and get out of the box and say,
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  okay, we thought this was impossible,
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  let's just think what if it isn't?
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  So maybe the whole thing is just simply defined by possibility.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  And I think that our notion of what is possible
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  got expanded recently.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  North Korea and Kanye being the best examples of it.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  But I think there's more to come.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  I'm not going to get scientific about this
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  because I can't offer you data.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  But now that the physical problems have been solved,
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  we can get enough physical resources to where we need it
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  if we can figure out where to put it and how to get it there.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  So we're in a world where there's great possibility
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  and we're being held back by the way we think of things.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  And we're watching that the way we think of things
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  is being changed by thought leaders.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  But in closing, I was just talking to one of the producers earlier,
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  and he watched the whole hearings with Diamond and Silk,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  and the Republican congressman,
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  particularly the Democrats too,
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  didn't even really know what the internet was,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  didn't understand social media,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  were just bumbling around.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  I watched some of it too.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  And that's what's scary is that's how the censorship
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  can come in with the tech giants
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  because Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  they're being interviewed by congressmen
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  that think, you know, islands float.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  The congressman from Atlanta is interviewing these women,
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  and he doesn't know what planet he's on.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  It's like that late senator from up in Alaska
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  who said the internet's a bunch of tubes,
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  and you see that unfortunately,
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  people that don't know how any of this works
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  are sitting there trying to then dictate
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  how it's going to operate.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  I think that's one of the big pitfalls is
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  you're going to have so many people that are technologically
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  and informationally illiterate
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  that they just try to censor all of us
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  and they don't even know what they're doing.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  Now, extend that to anything complicated,
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  like healthcare, you know, fixing education.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  You know, if the people working on this
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  are all 80 and tired and, you know, and busy,
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Congress, I've said this before,
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  they're not the right tool for the job.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  And of course, in the past, they have to rely on lobbyists
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  to do the technical stuff for them.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  But I think in the future, the internet is going to sort out
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  what it thinks is a good idea,
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  and Congress is going to be just the implementers
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  and law writers in the long run.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And I think the internet will become the government
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  in a good way, not a bad way.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Well, Scott Adams, who's just joined us,
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  opened the interview by saying,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  people told me don't come on your show.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  And then they make up what I've said
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  and what I've done to try to stop him.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  As he said, he'll go on anybody's show,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  and he's not listening to that.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  He knows most of it's bull.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  The point is they then do that to him.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  They do that to Kanye.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  They're telling Kanye,
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  you're not going to have your job anymore.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  We're going to punish you.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  And he's saying, listen, I'm free.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  You're authoritarian. It's over.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  And I think we're breaking their will right now
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  to break our will.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  I think we've crossed the tipping point.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  And I think you're going to see an acceleration
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  thanks to Trump and all of our listeners
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  and Scott Adams and Kanye and everybody else.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  We're going to see an acceleration now
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  in the tipping point.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  And I think you're going to see the First Amendment
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  and free speech worldwide come back in a big way.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  I don't think you could stop the signal.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  What do you think in closing?
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  I'll tell you, you know, when you,
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  when I was first asked to come on the show today
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  by your producer, my first thought was,
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  I'm too busy, too much going on.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  I'd love to, but I don't have time.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  And then I saw people telling me in the news,
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  hey, you can't go on Info Wars.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  And I said, well, I'm going to clear my schedule now
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  because Kanye says I could talk to anybody I want.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  So it's changing things.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  It's a bigger deal than people think.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  So thank you.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  Well, Scott, thank you.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  When people tell me not to cover things,
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  it makes me cover more.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  Well, again, thank you for your work.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  We'll be watching and we'll be reading.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  And hopefully you'll join us again soon.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  Thank you and have a great weekend.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  All right. Thanks for having me.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  That was a powerful, full hour.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  Just really glad he gave us that time.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Smart guy, man.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  I always liked him, but I tell you,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  I really love him now because it's just
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  not the Kanye thing.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  It's like, well, the stuff he's saying is now
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  I'm getting it and I'm realizing,
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  why didn't I get the Dennis Rodman thing?
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Why didn't I get that that was just like,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  would we have sent a basketball star to the Soviet Union in 1980?
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  Would I call him a traitor for going over there?
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  No, they're going over there to talk to him.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  It's just the hideousness of the communists
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  and watching it and Dennis being happy with them.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  That's what I couldn't stand.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  But I get it now.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  So again, I'm learning that I have my blind spots too.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, you live, you learn.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  All right.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  I have not plugged it one time today.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  If I don't start plugging every segment,
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  we're not going to be able to expand.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  If I stop plugging, we're going to go under.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  You're the folks at Fundus.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  We have supplements and products and air filtration
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  and water filtration and everything.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  That is the very best out there infowarstore.com.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  The deals are so good.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  We don't make a lot of money on each item,
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  but we do sell a lot of stuff.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  There's folks that know about supplements go, wow,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  supermails great 50% off.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  Rainforest is amazing 25% off.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  X2, you got to have it 25% off.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  Even though the supply is limited infowarstore.com
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  or AAA 2533139.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  You are the info war without you buying the products.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  You don't be here.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Yet 10% off additionally with auto,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  she had the Patriot points are double the month.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  to detoxify the body.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  for over a year.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  as you can be because we need you.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  The remnant of America to reignite those brushfires
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  as you can be.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  To see your support and your prayers together
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.160]  and we can finally reunite our
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.000]  When it comes to sustainable change
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  we have to change our lives that are independent
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:37.940]  and we can also be present at a revolutionary
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:42.140]  This violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:59:42.140 --> 02:00:08.140]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:28.140]  SuperWars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:33.140]  Man, I get so caught up in the news in front of me that I never even plug who's coming up.
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:37.140]  Like one of the hottest guests you can get right now, always a great guest is Scott Adams.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:41.140]  The plug he was coming on. This is because I got tunnel vision on news.
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:47.140]  This North Korea thing is so big. And then PJW is coming on. Good old PJW.
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:50.140]  You know he didn't like being on air even though he's good at it.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:56.140]  And he's a smart whipper snapper. He's almost like 35 now. We're all getting older out here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:12.140]  Look, there's Paul right there. Let's fade Paul up. How's Bridget Steele doing, my boy? Should I bully you with some Bridget's accents?
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:16.140]  The bullying and harassment start after 20 seconds.
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:26.140]  Well, I mean, we're learning from the news. There's gay grooming. But even worse, Paul, there's British accent torture.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:33.140]  Like they play skinny puppy to torture people at Gitmo. But you know, on our little private channel, it's Royal Britain Steele.
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:41.140]  I'm getting flashbacks already, Alex. PTSD. I mean, come on. How have I survived for 16 years with this level of abuse?
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:47.140]  I do talk to you in the Jack T Ripper voice though. I go, get over here with that belt. Feed me this machine gun.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:51.140]  Huron, Mandrake, the Redcoats are coming.
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:58.140]  That's right. I mean, traumatized doesn't even begin to cover it, Alex. It's just how have I survived? God only knows.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:03.140]  We got a lot of serious news to cover. Some of the top stories that I want to review. But let's get into it right now.
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:07.140]  We got a lot of news coming in the next segment. But let's just, there's been a lot of articles and investigative journals.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:12.140]  Let's talk about how I control everything you say and do.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.140]  I mean, just tell people. Tell them about our relationship. I mean, let's get serious. How do things actually work?
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:20.140]  The media is obsessed with it. Explain it to people.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:27.140]  Well, I mean, if you read this Daily Beast article, which we can get into, by the way, point by point, it's complete trash.
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:31.140]  Again, they introduced these articles. This is why I don't do mainstream media, Alex.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:37.140]  Every single time they approach you and say, oh, we just want to write a fair profile piece.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:43.140]  In fact, I can quote from his email. This is the first email this Nico Hein sent to me in relation to this piece.
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:47.140]  He said, it's so weird that no one has done a decent profile yet given your stature.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:53.140]  Would be great to get a pint with you to discuss what inspired you, what drives you to work so hard and what you plan to do next.
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:03:00.140]  And then he's like, I'd love to talk to some people you've worked with or known over the years to get a sense of how you shot up the ranks and become such an influential figure.
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:06.140]  So it goes from that to him writing the article and the two main sources for the article.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:15.140]  Your bitter ex-wife, Alex, somebody who I met once 13 years ago and a disgruntled former employee who barely even came into the informal office.
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:20.140]  Again, probably exchanged like two sentences with him over the course of 10 years.
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:26.140]  And that's the impartial independent sources that they based this whole profile piece on.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:31.140]  So again, it's the complete disconnect between the initial approach. Oh, we just want to be friendly.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:33.140]  We just want to understand where you're coming from.
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:44.140]  So the actual article, a vicious hit piece where they literally crown me like King of the Tards in the image there and say that I'm your crackpot protégé.
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:46.140]  So this is why I don't do mainstream media.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:55.140]  I also don't do the Daily Beast because I directly told them, look, you basically doxxed out at exposed Pamela Geller's daughters who weren't political.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:04:01.140]  They just had like a fashion account on Instagram, opening them up to a fat war from Islamic terrorists.
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:05.140]  I said, I'm not going to talk to a publication that treats people like that.
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:08.140]  They didn't put that in the article, Alex, did they?
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:14.140]  They didn't mention why I refused to talk to them because that would expose the Daily Beast for what it is.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:17.140]  And that was the foundation of the article.
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:20.140]  They approached me and said, this is going to be fair. This is going to be balanced.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:24.140]  Turns out to be a vicious hit piece every single time.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:29.140]  And it's like someone saying, come back behind the bleachers with me, you know, a hot girl.
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:32.140]  This actually happened to me once in like eighth grade.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:36.140]  And then her boyfriend thought I was hitting on her and him and his buddy were there to try to beat me up.
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.140]  So I get behind the bleachers after school. I'm like, okay, you want to kiss?
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:42.140]  All of a sudden they're like, we're going to kick your ass, Jones. Well, that didn't what happened.
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:49.140]  But the point is, is that it's like luring a kid. Hey, I got candy in the white van and a little kid gets in the white van.
[02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:55.140]  Little Paul wants it. Oh, hi, Daily Beast. We're like, we're tying you up, little kid. I mean, that's what this is, deception.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:05:00.140]  In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:04.140]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:16.140]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.

[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:47.140]  Bodies sold out in a month. Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with. It's sold out for another month and a half.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:50.140]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:06:10.140]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today in FullWarsLife.com.
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:29.140]  All right, we're now into the third hour on this Friday Global Transmission. Paul Joseph Watson is my guest and we never talk about what goes on at InfoWars.
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:34.140]  We never talk about how we come up with ideas, stories, any of this.
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:46.140]  So I thought, in amongst all the huge news I'm beginning to in a moment, why not get Paul Joseph Watson on and you can even call him with your questions for Paul Joseph Watson on our personal workings of InfoWars.
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:53.140]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:57.140]  Paul and I used to talk three or four times a week. We probably talk...
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:00.140]  Paul, how often do we talk now?
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:07.140]  Because I love this Daily Beast fabrication because the Daily Beast isn't important enough on their own to talk about.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:12.140]  They've had hundreds of these about me and they've had dozens of them about you.
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:24.140]  And it's incredible how fictitious they are, how much work goes in, how they tell weird stories on purpose so people think they must be true.
[02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:34.140]  Like, I'm wearing swastika shoes in the office and again, telepathically gay groom people.
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:41.140]  This isn't the Daily Mail. He never said anything sexual to the man, but he felt like he was being gay groomed.
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:46.140]  I mean, you read this stuff and it's like, why do they come up with such ridiculous garbage?
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:49.140]  And then you pointed out with this latest piece, how they twist everything.
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:56.140]  It's like, why aren't they just fiction writers? Why aren't they writing screenplays for Hollywood, Paul?
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.140]  Well, I mean, it's because that would be a more honest profession than the most dishonest people going.
[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:08.140]  And they're trying to frame you. They're trying to create a perception of you that they can broadcast to the world, which is completely inaccurate.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:14.140]  And basically this article, you know, I was going to do a video response to it, but it's just not that interesting.
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:20.140]  It's not worthy enough to make a video about. It's too long. It's, you know, TLDR, too long didn't read.
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:27.140]  It's boring because it's full of like weird stuff I said when I was 19 and 20, which I don't even believe anymore.
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:33.140]  And they're main sources. I mean, let's go for a few quotes because it's funny as hell.
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:40.140]  It says, insiders are convinced that Watson is destined to seize Jones's crown as the king of the conspiracy theorists.
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:46.140]  Right? Who are those insiders, Alex? Your bitter ex-wife and a disgruntled former employee.
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:51.140]  They're not insiders. They're literally the very opposite of insiders.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:56.140]  They're now outsiders and not just outsiders, but outsiders with their own agenda.
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:04.140]  So even in that very first sentence there, they're saying, oh, we've got, we've got, you know, inside intel from the people who will be in a position to know.
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:08.140]  I literally met these people twice, like five years ago.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:12.140]  It also says that you are a smart ass at my house smoking cigarettes.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:18.140]  You've only joked around in a few video shots of cigarettes and every once in a while, because I know I've talked about it with you.
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:22.140]  I mean, I'm not seeing you smoke twice. I mean, you weren't smoking then.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:26.140]  I wasn't. That was 2005 when I met her. I wasn't smoking.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:31.140]  I was as nice and kind as possible, but because now she's got an agenda.
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:35.140]  And by the way, they'd literally use this entire hit piece against me because they didn't really have that much on me.
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:39.140]  There's a platform for her website. So that was another part of it.
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:44.140]  The other sources they've got are Alex, two kids who went to school with me.
[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:49.140]  And one of them, I barely recognized his name. He was like a friend of a friend.
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:53.140]  He never even came to my house where I live with my parents.
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.140]  The other one, the other source, by the way, these two kids didn't say that was bad.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:10:04.140]  In fact, they said quite interesting things, but the other source, this school friend, I don't even know who it is.
[02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:08.140]  I don't even remember this person's name, but they were the two.
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:11.140]  Oh, these are the two guys who knew him intimately growing up.
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:14.140]  One of them I barely knew them. The other one I don't even remember.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:22.140]  So he was basically going to this rural village where I used to live, knocking on people's doors and trying to find out if they went to school with me.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:24.140]  I mean, they must have thought.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:26.140]  And then they say he didn't grow up in a council house.
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.140]  But I remember only getting your personal stuff when your parents had to sell everything.
[02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:32.140]  There's the steel factory closed.
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:38.140]  And I remember you complaining about when you were 18 and worked for me about burning cars outside the basically the section 8 housing.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:44.140]  And then they just say that's all a lie that you grew up in this beautiful meadow.
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:46.140]  What does even matter? You never made it a big deal that you grew up in a poor area.
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:48.140]  You just said that's what you were doing when people asked.
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.140]  And they try to make how weird deceivers.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:54.140]  No, we didn't lie about W&Ds in Iraq.
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:59.140]  We didn't lie about the Alexa systems of Amazon listening to you.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:01.140]  We didn't lie about world government. We told the truth.
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:03.140]  We didn't lie about Trump was going to win.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:05.140]  We were right. We're the trailblazers.
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:07.140]  We're the people telling you the truth over and over again.
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:08.140]  We have the credibility.
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:15.140]  We told you about the secret deal with North Korea, how they were going to nuclearize and have these meetings and sign a peace treaty and merge together.
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.140]  It's all being announced.
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:19.140]  We are real and the good guys know we're real.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:24.140]  Then they say, oh, you're not the counterculture because the Republicans have all three branches.
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:27.140]  Barely half of those are establishment.
[02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:29.140]  We're fighting hard.
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:35.140]  And we have a same group in the government that doesn't want to go under full Hollywood, globalist, Chinese, communist control.
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:44.140]  But all of the media, all the academia, all of the big mega banks, all of the Fortune 100 are globalists openly trying to destroy this country in free speech, Paul.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.140]  We are the resistance, not them.
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.140]  Well, that's exactly it, Alex.
[02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:52.140]  They want to take away our authenticity because it's all about authenticity.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:12:02.140]  I mean, that's why Kanye exploded because he's at least expressing some kind of authenticity away from the reservation of leftist dogmatic mind control.
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:04.140]  That's why they're so petrified of it.
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:07.140]  So you bring it back to what you said at the start of that.
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:10.140]  They're trying to make out that I was like born into white privilege.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:14.140]  OK, my parents bought their first house from the council.
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:17.140]  It was a council house for 30,000 pounds.
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:19.140]  This was a tiny little three bedroom house.
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:29.140]  My dad literally had to get up at 6 a.m. every single morning for 30 years to work in a factory making tools.
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:31.140]  OK, this wasn't a privileged upbringing.
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:34.140]  I mean, it was a happy upbringing, but it was by no means privileged.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:42.140]  My mom literally went out on the streets in northern ghetto towns until midnight talking to drug addicts.
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:44.140]  That was literally her job for years.
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:52.140]  She would come back at like 1 a.m. after having done this job, and they bought their second house for 58,000 pounds.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:53.140]  I mean, that was a big step up.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:59.140]  Basically, my parents worked their way up from the working class to the lower middle class, and that's how I grew up.
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:04.140]  It was, you know, happy upbringing and lots of friends, lots of, you know, I was playing in the field.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:06.140]  Sure, but they even try to steal your identity.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.140]  You never made a big deal out of this.
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.140]  There's a couple of news articles.
[02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:09.140]  They ask how you grew up.
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:12.140]  You tell them and I have to know you when you were 18.
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.140]  And so I know your parents.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.140]  I mean, I've talked to them.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.140]  I know your life.
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:21.140]  I know how they had to sell their houses and everything because there were no jobs or whatever and moved to France where it was totally depressed property values.
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.140]  I mean, I know the whole story.
[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:23.140]  I know the truth, Paul, and I sit there.
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:25.140]  I know the story of Sheffield, too.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:27.140]  So I've read about it in the news and they just sit there and lie.
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:30.140]  It just shows how there are nothing but frauds.
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:37.140]  Well, yeah, the reason my parents moved to France was because my dad's factory got job got shipped off to the Czech Republic.
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:41.140]  So it was directly as a result of globalism that it changed their lifestyle.
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:42.140]  They sold the house.
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:47.140]  We're able to buy a cheap house for what you could get in France with my auntie at the time.
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:51.140]  So that's, that's the white, you know, privileged upbringing that I had.
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:56.140]  But yeah, it's just every little thing here is either twisted or completely untrue.
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:00.140]  And you go back to the Comedy Central hit piece, which you mentioned earlier as well.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:05.140]  In that, they try to make out because it's aimed at me basically at the start.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.140]  They play a video of me.
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:16.140]  They try to make out that I have no interest in punk whatsoever and that I just adopted this kind of rebellious youth now as a gimmick to try and give myself authenticity.
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:24.140]  What's funny though is if you read this Daily Beast hit piece, the kids who went to school with me say, yeah, he was into punk.
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:26.140]  He was into the sex pistols.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:29.140]  He was into smoking and rebelling and playing guitar.
[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:37.140]  So actually one hit piece in the one thing they get right in the Daily Beast hit piece, this proves the other hit piece by Comedy Central.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:40.140]  And you know, I'm not claiming I was some great badass or whatever.
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:41.140]  But yeah, I went to school.
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:44.140]  I got kicked out of school briefly for smoking weed.
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:46.140]  I was, I was into drinking.
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:50.140]  I was into smoking all the usual things you go through as a young teenager.
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:53.140]  And I was into punk music and grunge and alternative music.
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:15:00.140]  And yes, that had an influence on my mindset growing up because I did get in trouble from time to time was a little bit rebellious.
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:04.140]  And you know, that continued throughout the political awakening that I had as well.
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:06.140]  So yes, I am authentic.
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:07.140]  I'm not perfect.
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:09.140]  I wasn't a complete badass, but I'm authentic.
[02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:13.140]  And that had a direct impact relation to what I do now.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:18.140]  So I used one, you know, one truth out of one hit piece to debunk the other.
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:23.140]  Well, they are the same thing went out about the crazy stuff I did growing up.
[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:24.140]  They go, oh, Jones has all these crazy stories.
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:25.140]  Look what we've done since then.
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.140]  It's all crazy.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:30.140]  I mean, it's these little state and they always take that we have families too.
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.140]  Like they hate that we have families.
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:32.140]  They hate that we have wives.
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:33.140]  They hate that we have kids.
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:36.140]  They just, they just can't stand the authenticity.
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:39.140]  Let's talk about now some of the other big lies against info wars.
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.140]  We haven't scripted this talk.
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:43.140]  We talked like two minutes a few days ago and I got pulled to come on.
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:47.140]  Let's talk about what it's been like with 16 years in info wars and where he thinks we're going in the future.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:49.140]  Then your phone calls and a bunch of news.
[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:50.140]  PJW joins info wars.
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:16:19.140]  Stay with us.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:45.140]  Thank you.
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:17:12.140]  Thank you.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:27.140]  You have been lied to.
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:56.140]  My name is Kevin ship.

[02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:07.140]  We are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:15.140]  One of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat other proteins better.

[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:30.140]  And we also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance.
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:40.140]  But all of these are the very cutting edge top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.

[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:21.140]  All right.
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:23.140]  I'm going to give the number up folks.
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:34.140]  Any questions or comments for Paul or myself about info wars 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:35.140]  We never do stuff like this.
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:39.140]  People are always asking questions because we don't talk about ourselves a lot in our own workings.
[02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:44.140]  People then just kind of go out and see what the establishment says.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:49.140]  It doesn't really do anything but they're obsessed with stealing our identities.
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:59.140]  They have shows like homeland and shows like the opposition and countless others where they obsess on us all day.
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:01.140]  They steal our identities.
[02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:06.140]  They misrepresent what we say and then they hate us all at the very, very same time.
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.140]  Why is that the case?
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:08.140]  Because we're like Kanye West.
[02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:10.140]  Doesn't mean Kanye West is perfect.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:11.140]  Doesn't mean we are.
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:13.140]  We're trying to support free thinking and free speech.
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.140]  That's really paramount, isn't it?
[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:17.140]  That's why it's the First Amendment.
[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:19.140]  And worldwide it comes first.
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:26.140]  The right to your views, the right to your mind, the right to having at least your own destiny in your head between your ears.
[02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:29.140]  And the idea that you can associate with who you want.
[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:30.140]  That's courage.
[02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:32.140]  Kanye West has got courage.
[02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:40.140]  Nobody else in the entertainment industry who's still on the front lines, who's still out there doing anything other than like James Woods.
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:41.140]  That incredibly talented guy.
[02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:43.140]  He's been black bulb.
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:45.140]  And I have them trying to destroy me all the time.
[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:48.140]  People go, oh, isn't that terrible?
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.140]  Well, it's terrible that they're so bad.
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:52.140]  It proves how bad they are.
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:55.140]  I can't even bring myself to sue people that defame me.
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:58.140]  But people that sue me now, I'm countersuing them.
[02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:02.140]  They're dropping the lawsuits left and right, but they just file more.
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:04.140]  But it's going to be okay.
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.140]  It's a badge of honor.
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:06.140]  This is happening.
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:09.140]  But Paul, specifically the workings of info wars.
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:13.140]  Talk about how we operate here for folks that don't know.
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:15.140]  People that are here know.
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:17.140]  I hire people I think are smart and cool that I trust.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:18.140]  Turn them loose.
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:21.140]  Every once in a while, see something I don't like or more often than not.
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:26.140]  Paul, isn't it you that calls me and says, Hey, you really, I think you're off the reservation.
[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:28.140]  It only happens about once a year.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.140]  You're always right.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:34.140]  But they have it like I've got you on this short leash and I shouldn't you a memo when you didn't like trumpet first.
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.140]  And I said, you better get on the Trump train.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.140]  Paul, have I ever talked to you like that?
[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:41.140]  There was no memo, Alex.
[02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:43.140]  You sent one. I didn't receive it.
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:47.140]  But yes, I mean, the way it works is obviously you give people an opportunity.
[02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:49.140]  They need to prove themselves.
[02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:53.140]  Maybe you would keep them on short leash and initially, but there's no leash on me now.
[02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:59.140]  I mean, you let me do whatever the heck I want because you trust me because we've been doing it for so long and there's no.
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:03.140]  There's no hard line narrative that you call up and bark down the phone every day.
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:04.140]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:07.140]  I mean, I had my reservations about Trump.
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.140]  I supported Rand Paul at the beginning.
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:20.140]  Obviously, when I saw why Trump was becoming so popular because he was the revolution against politically correct behavior politics that people despised in America.
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:26.140]  And I was on that whole, you know, that whole movement coming up before Trump even announced he was running for office.
[02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:28.140]  Obviously, then I supported Donald Trump.
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:30.140]  No regrets that I did.
[02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:34.140]  But now there's there's no hard line narrative that comes down every day.
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:40.140]  And yes, sometimes I have differences with what's posted on info wasn't I tell you about it and we take it from there.
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:46.140]  But the idea that you like bullied and harassed me by doing British accents down the phone and that.
[02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:48.140]  So I mean, these are the quotes in the article.
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:49.140]  Go and read them.
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:54.140]  She's like, oh, he was he was tortured by this absolute complete nonsense.
[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:56.140]  The entire article is a tissue of lies.
[02:23:56.140 --> 02:24:03.140]  The other thing Alex, John Ronson, I mean, this is a guy who's popped into your life from time to time.
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:05.140]  Again, it's the same thing with all these journalists.
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:08.140]  They're so nice behind the scenes.
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:09.140]  They're so friendly.
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:14.140]  And yet he told the newspaper he said he likes me and he missed me and wanted to be my friend at the RNC.
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:16.140]  I'm still the RNC two days later.
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:21.140]  And he goes, Alex Jones is the most horrible person in the world and all this other crap.
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.140]  And he and then I let him back in the offices.
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:24.140]  I've known him for 20 years.
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:26.140]  He was shaking in hatred.
[02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:28.140]  He couldn't even contain it.
[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.140]  And then he's like my proctologist.
[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:35.140]  He's telling everybody how I operate, what I do, who I am.
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:37.140]  It's ridiculous.
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:47.140]  Well, I mean, in this article, the quote is he asks Ronson about me because I once told John Ronson that I saw his documentary about you, Secret Rules of the World.
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:51.140]  And that's how I first learned about you, which was basically a hit piece, by the way.
[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:56.140]  But I learned about you initially because of that documentary way back even before 9 11.
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:57.140]  I think that was.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:04.140]  So he said about me in this article, John Ronson, well, I'm not happy about it talking about, you know, our influence.
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:08.140]  He fears Watson is obsessed with Muslims and dangerous.
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:12.140]  So I listened to John Ronson as well about you on different podcasts that he does.
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:15.140]  And he's so vicious about you now.
[02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:22.140]  Funny thing is, Alex, John Ronson wanted to do a profile piece on me for the New York Times about six months ago.
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:23.140]  Me too.
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:25.140]  And he was the nicest person, imagine.
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:27.140]  No, no, he did the same thing.
[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:29.140]  And he said, he said, listen, he's one of the ones.
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:31.140]  He goes, just leave the Muslims alone.
[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:32.140]  And we're in the media.
[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:34.140]  It's like a message.
[02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:35.140]  He goes, stop it.
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:37.140]  And I said, my God, they're bringing in Sharia law.
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.140]  I haven't the news today in Sweden, the fish of the government that they're killing everybody.
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:44.140]  They're the most anti-feminine thing on earth.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:46.140]  And he just goes, no, they're good people, Alex.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:47.140]  No, stop it.
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:48.140]  Stop it.
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:49.140]  Stop it.
[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:51.140]  But since you brought it up, by the way, it wasn't a profile either of us.
[02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:54.140]  I found out later it was just a big hit piece.
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:55.140]  Exactly.
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:56.140]  Total dishonesty.
[02:25:56.140 --> 02:25:57.140]  Total dishonesty.
[02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:02.140]  But I mean, I've got the DMs where he's like basically kissing my behind to try and get
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:03.140]  this profile piece.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:05.140]  Whereas in public, he's completely vicious.
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:08.140]  I tagged him once in a tweet talking about this kind of stuff.
[02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:10.140]  And he almost had a psychological breakdown.
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:12.140]  So I can't even tag him in tweets anymore.
[02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:15.140]  But he's another person who talks out of both sides of his mouth.
[02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:16.140]  They all do it.
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:20.140]  There is another quote from the article from a disgruntled former employee.
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.140]  We all know who it is.
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:27.140]  He says, I put him in the same camp with Richard Spencer and Pamela Geller and the anti-Islam
[02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:29.140]  faction of the so-called alt-right.
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:31.140]  Several years ago, he was anti-war libertarian.
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.140]  Yeah, I still am.
[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:33.140]  I went on a note.
[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:38.140]  Notice he mixes the alt-right that you distance yourself from day one with being against the
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:39.140]  radical Islam takeover.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:43.140]  I mean, radical Islam is like being against the Nazis.
[02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:46.140]  But it says now he is a racist.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:51.140]  Well, Alex, the alt-right hates me specifically because I'm not racist.
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:54.140]  But notice this person won't even say what their name is.
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:58.140]  They just proclaim you're a racist using liberal tactics.
[02:26:58.140 --> 02:26:59.140]  Yeah.
[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:01.140]  I mean, you just showed a tweet up there.
[02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:05.140]  Like Richard Spencer has events and there are more television cameras at his speeches
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:07.140]  than actual attendees.
[02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:09.140]  I've made videos about this.
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:13.140]  The alt-right would not exist anymore if not for mainstream media attention because they
[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:15.140]  use them as a bogey, man.
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:16.140]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:20.140]  All the people that organized Charlottesville, all the top people, a year or two before work
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:24.140]  for Hillary Obama, it's central casting.
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.140]  And I'm allowed to say that, folks.
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:27.140]  That's a fact.
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:30.140]  The fact that leftist groups pose as Nazis, that's been in court.
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:31.140]  That's come out.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:33.140]  It's a known fact.
[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:35.140]  But whether they are or not, they all hate us.
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:39.140]  Like, I mean, fortune and not fans of info wars, you can go on there and have a look.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:41.140]  Richard Spencer hates us.
[02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:43.140]  We're constantly having battles with people.
[02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:44.140]  Yeah.
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:45.140]  We have the establishment.
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:46.140]  We have the Nazis hate us.
[02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:47.140]  Exactly.
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.140]  Because it's all fake.
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:49.140]  We're real.
[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:50.140]  And they know it.
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:51.140]  And they know it.
[02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:55.140]  But there's a very clear distinction between people like you, people like myself, people
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:56.140]  like Cernovich, and the alt-right.
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:58.140]  The alt-right does not like us.
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:00.140]  You have to be completely dishonest.
[02:28:00.140 --> 02:28:01.140]  That's a Hillary term.
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:03.140]  She just said that two years ago.
[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:05.140]  I mean, oh, God said it's alt-right.
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:06.140]  Everything that's new, independent.
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.140]  No, we're the new right, as you pointed out.
[02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:10.140]  We're not the alt-right.
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:11.140]  Yeah.
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:13.140]  So yet again, another twist, another lie.
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:16.140]  There's another quote in there which says, Paul seems totally different to when I knew
[02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:17.140]  him.
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:18.140]  The same intelligence, but clouded somehow.
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:23.140]  This was a kid who I've never heard of who knew me supposedly in school when I was 13.
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:25.140]  Oh, but I'm different now.
[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:28.140]  Of course, I'm different from when I was 13.
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:29.140]  I'm 35 years old.
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:31.140]  It was like two decades ago.
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:33.140]  So again, it's just so weak.
[02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:37.140]  It's so incredibly weak and so funny, but we can go on after the break.
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:39.140]  And then we'll go to phone calls.
[02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:47.140]  But I want to specifically get into this because, I mean, okay, I'm going to wait until we come
[02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.140]  to the end of the break.
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:49.140]  InfoWars.com.

[02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:41.340]  off because we've got an emergency shipment in.
[02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:44.340]  I'm going to have to end that sale in a couple days because we're going to coast out till
[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:45.940]  it sells out at full price.
[02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:48.220]  It's still a great deal of a good halogen.

[02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:59.540]  Those are bound to iodines.
[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:01.980]  This is totally different.

[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:33.180]  When I forget to take them, I go, why didn't I take it?
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:39.420]  Read the thousands of five-star reviews at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com or
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:47.820]  triple eight, 253-3139 and we also have alpha power that's basically the same herbs and
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:53.380]  compounds, organic, concentrated, but dry.
[02:34:53.380 --> 02:34:54.500]  So it's a much bigger dose.
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:35:00.900]  It's just not cold pressed and it's so strong, I can't take the alpha power.
[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:04.220]  Other people take it and they go, my God, this is, I mean, I'll just be, I'll tell
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:09.940]  us very briefly, I was 40, four years ago, I go in, get my blood test and medical doctor,
[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:13.900]  everybody says, man, you got to get a checkup, say the whole, you know, test, blood test,
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:17.260]  you know, doctor had me, you know, everything, you know what they do.
[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:18.260]  Not a lot of fun.
[02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:19.260]  First time a guy's done that.
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:20.700]  I guess once in football, they kind of did it.
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:26.140]  But the point is, is that, first time a guy's done, anyways, the point, I'll be in bed,
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:27.220]  I'm gonna stop right now.
[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:33.580]  The point is, is that, he said, hey, you want some of Agra Cialis prescription, you're 40.
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:34.980]  I said, man, I don't need that.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.460]  He said, well, you know, just to try it.
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:43.340]  Well, the, the, the Viagra made me see blue and I guess it worked, but not, it's like
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:44.740]  your engine fires right up anyway.
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:48.980]  It's like, that could really tell the difference, maybe 93 octane does, you know, 89 octane.
[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:49.980]  Okay.
[02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:57.380]  A little bit of difference, but Cialis like kind of more through the day, just a little
[02:35:57.380 --> 02:35:58.380]  more excited.
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:01.380]  I mean, being honest, the stuff works.
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:06.420]  In my experience, everybody else's that I've talked to stuff like super mail, but especially
[02:36:06.420 --> 02:36:10.300]  alpha power and stuff.
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:12.820]  It's insane.
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:18.740]  It's insane in full or store.com in fours, life.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:19.740]  three, one, three, nine.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:21.500]  Now I'm going to stop being bad and telling jokes.
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:22.900]  I apologize.
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:29.460]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, I was raised as Amish and I am a pure as a driven snow.
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:32.300]  You know, I hate people that say they are and they're not, you know, that's what really
[02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:36.300]  gets annoying to me, but, but seriously, let's get serious here.
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.620]  Paul, here's the big one.
[02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:41.300]  You raised it in all these hit pieces.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:43.340]  Paul's too good for Alex.
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:45.900]  Paul wants to distance himself from Alex.
[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:48.940]  Alex is jealous that Paul's as big as him or bigger.
[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:52.300]  Paul on record and I'm not bragging about this.
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:53.940]  Who flogged you to get on here?
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:55.140]  Who wants you to get on things?
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:57.900]  Who tells you that you're as good as me or better in many ways?
[02:36:57.900 --> 02:36:58.900]  They don't get it.
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:01.100]  I'm worried about the globalist in genetic engineering.
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:02.580]  I'm worried about world war.
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:04.260]  I'm worried about forced inoculations.
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:06.180]  I'm worried about the socialists taking over.
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:07.380]  I'm worried about globalism.
[02:37:07.380 --> 02:37:09.020]  I want you and others.
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:13.180]  I'm looking like the, you know, the great crew we have here, Owen Schroder and others.
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:17.020]  And David Knight does a great job, but I'm looking for people like I was looking for
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:18.020]  you.
[02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:21.860]  If they don't even give me that that we built in for us, it's like I'm this raving lunatic
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:26.260]  dumb dumb when I could sit here and have a fake, you know, intellectual accent and pull
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:28.100]  it off, you know, three hours a day.
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:29.900]  But I'm just being real here.
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:33.020]  But again, it's not that I care that they lie about us.
[02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:38.500]  It's studying their psychology that they think we're like they are, that they'd be pissed
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:44.900]  at Buzzfeed or at, at, at Daily Beast if somebody was bigger than the big cheese.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:46.780]  Don't they get, I'm in a war.
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:47.780]  I want soldiers.
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:48.780]  I want generals.
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:49.780]  I want captains.
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:52.860]  I don't care if you're black, you're a woman, you're Hispanic, you're Asian.
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:55.780]  If you're cool and want to have freedom, let's get together.
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:56.780]  Does that make sense?
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:59.860]  Well, Alex, they, they're losers.
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:04.940]  I mean, losers resent other people's success, successful people learn from other people's
[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:08.260]  success and use it to create their own platforms.
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:13.500]  I mean, they've got your wife quote again, your ex-wife says, once you hired me, she
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:17.020]  said basically it was a joint paranoic enterprise from then on.
[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.020]  Okay.
[02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:22.820]  So the info was was a raving lunatic paranoid enterprise from over a decade ago.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:28.460]  Okay, so why were you editing info wars and writing many of the same stories about the
[02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:31.420]  same subjects for over 10 years?
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:36.180]  If it was all a paranoid fever dream, okay, she was a central part of it.
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:39.340]  And now it's like, oh no, it was just those two.
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:40.340]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.780]  I mean, there's other stuff in there.
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.380]  You mentioned the, you know, snarky and entitled with a cigarette in his mouth.
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:48.100]  He didn't give a crap about anybody.
[02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:54.260]  Like I visited you with my brother in 2005, just to try to be as polite as possible.
[02:38:54.260 --> 02:38:56.180]  She says, you see him on the clips.
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:57.180]  That's who he is.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:59.700]  I mean, what just authentic truthful.
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:02.060]  I mean, you know, I've got friends.
[02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:05.100]  They don't think I'm this raving lunatic, this vicious person.
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:07.780]  Do you think maybe she's got an agenda, Alex?
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:12.980]  Maybe she's got a bias, but she's like the main source for the entire article.
[02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:15.340]  They keep going back to these insane quotes.
[02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:20.900]  I've got another one, which this is the funniest, a second former staffer said he heard regular
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:25.820]  phone calls in which Jones shouted bullied and abused Watson, including by mocking his
[02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:26.820]  voice.
[02:39:26.820 --> 02:39:33.620]  So I've been abused, bullied and tormented and I'm still here 16 years later.
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:35.820]  Does that make much sense?
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:39.660]  It's just every single quote is provably fraudulent.
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:42.420]  Well, let's, let's, let's be honest with people.
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:46.820]  You talk about that one person that worked here that you were only talked to like a couple
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:50.060]  times when you were here, come like once a year and then back there and I would get
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:51.060]  in the meeting.
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:55.100]  I'd say we have his job, by the way, no, no gratitude there.
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:56.660]  Oh, you got him his job.
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:57.660]  I forgot that part.
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:58.660]  Yeah.
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:39:59.660]  Yeah.
[02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:00.660]  You said this guy might be good.
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:01.660]  Well, that's a strike against you then.
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:04.380]  But we're sitting there and I've got all the writers on the phone or in the room and
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:07.700]  I go, listen, we have a subscription to these photos.
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:11.540]  Use these or use them off Wikipedia where they're all vetted or go to the comments.
[02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:14.100]  I'm trying to explain that, you know, some of these things say they're copyright free,
[02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.340]  but they've got to be fully used and still credit them.
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.340]  Those are the type of meetings we have.
[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:22.180]  It's not meetings where I go, here's what we're going to cover.
[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:26.020]  I mean, let me tell you, I was glad you were anti-Trump, but that's what you really thought
[02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:27.020]  early on.
[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:28.020]  I wasn't sure I was totally right though.
[02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:31.660]  My gut was, did I ever call him to say you better go on the Trump train?
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:35.780]  No, I mean, that's what they claim is that Alex Jones decided to turn his operation into
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:37.820]  a pro-Trump cheering section.
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:38.820]  Watson got the memo.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:40.340]  I didn't get the memo.
[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:44.020]  Actually I had reservations about Trump to begin with and gradually, you know, I knew
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:50.740]  where it was heading and that this was the true core of the anti-authoritarian real resistance
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:52.580]  that led to him becoming president.
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:57.380]  So there was no memo, there was no bullying that made me support Donald Trump.
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:40:59.580]  I heard what he was saying and got on board.
[02:40:59.580 --> 02:41:04.020]  But did I ever even call you about your anti-Trump articles?
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:05.020]  No, never.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:09.740]  I mean, I made a video saying, maybe it's a big ruse because of the Hillary photos,
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:10.740]  the wedding photo.
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:12.420]  You didn't even call me after that.
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:14.380]  I mean, there was no memo.
[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:20.220]  Also, you know, after the Syria attack, we vehemently attacked his policy on Syria twice
[02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:22.060]  because it was a bad idea.
[02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:25.460]  So it isn't a Trump, you know, indoctrination call.
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:26.460]  That's what the left does.
[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:27.460]  They don't allow any criticism.
[02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:28.460]  Exactly.
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:31.340]  They get talking points from John Podesta, Hillary, George Soros, they admit and they
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:34.980]  follow it like it's a God and we're not, I respect you.
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:38.020]  You know, I'm thinking maybe Paul's right, maybe Trump's bad and we later learned in
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:41.500]  politics, Hillary in the media did think he'd lose to her.
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:45.740]  So they actually gave him more coverage, attacking him, but said make him front and
[02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:48.060]  center to embarrass Republicans.
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:49.620]  He won't get the nomination.
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:51.020]  That blew up in their face.
[02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:52.020]  They did the same thing to us.
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:56.140]  So your initial instinct that they're kind of pushing him was true, but only because
[02:41:56.140 --> 02:41:58.020]  they didn't get it, Paul.
[02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:59.020 --> 02:42:04.820]  And I mean, even today I have like ding dong fights with Trump's thicker fans on Twitter
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:07.020]  who will never question anything he does.
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:09.860]  When I look, I lose like 5,000 Twitter followers.
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:13.580]  It doesn't even benefit me, but obviously I'm not a sicker fan.
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:15.740]  Obviously I still have my own thought process.
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:17.340]  I can think independently.
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:20.860]  So the whole idea that there was a memo and that we were forced to do all this, complete
[02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:25.300]  an utter pablin, just like everything else in this hit piece and every other hit piece
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:28.460]  notice they've never got the memos that they never show these memos.
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:29.460]  Everybody's getting.
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:30.460]  I didn't get a memo.
[02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:32.460]  Have I ever read you a memo?
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:34.460]  No, never.
[02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:37.460]  Do I even use email?
[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:39.900]  Do I even use email, Paul?
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:41.660]  You don't use email at all.
[02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:42.660]  No.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:44.380]  How do I communicate?
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:46.140]  Text message and phone calls.
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:47.140]  There was no memo.
[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:49.300]  That's actually a conspiracy theory.
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:50.300]  There was no memo.
[02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:51.300]  Just like Trump.
[02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:52.300]  Text messages or phone calls.
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:53.300]  We'll be back.
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:43:18.580]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:21.900]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:26.860]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:31.900]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:32.900]  symptoms.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:35.580]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:36.580]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:41.500]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:47.300]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:50.020]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:55.180]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:59.820]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:03.660]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability
[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:07.620]  of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:11.380]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:13.220]  particles in the gut.
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:15.660]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:19.780]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:22.780]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:27.340]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:30.140]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:34.340]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:38.340]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:42.660]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:44.940]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:46.700]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:49.420]  Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:52.900]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:56.100]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:58.900]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:44:58.900 --> 02:45:05.260]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:09.420]  with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:10.420]  Scalability.
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:16.100]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off, because there's
[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:18.660]  a lot of product and a lot of ingredients.
[02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:19.660]  It's MycoZX.
[02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:20.660]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:24.740]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins
[02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:28.580]  in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:30.860]  probiotics help displace.
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:37.100]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all
[02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:39.340]  that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:44.060]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:46.060]  that slime wall.
[02:45:46.060 --> 02:45:48.740]  Don't wait to start any toxifying your body until it's too late.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:56.060]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX plus now from the InfoWars store.
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:59.900]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:01.620]  in FullWars life.
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:02.620]  It take hours.
[02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:04.940]  MycoZX plus now is a lower price.
[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:06.100]  It's stronger.
[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:07.700]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:12.060]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[02:46:12.060 --> 02:46:15.260]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.700]  It's got the preglinone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:23.060]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:27.820]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine four
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:32.220]  to five toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:33.220]  That's a spray you do.
[02:46:33.220 --> 02:46:34.420]  You can also swallow it.
[02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:39.940]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more.
[02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:41.140]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:46:41.140 --> 02:46:46.860]  So thank you all for remembering in FullWarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:50.300]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:51.300]  the word.
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:47:00.100]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:12.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:16.580]  All right, let's just cut this luscious Motley crew off right now so we can go right back
[02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:21.260]  to Paul Watson and some of these phone calls, Tom and London, Danny and Sarasota, Florida.
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:30.500]  But Paul, what would you call this point and time we're in historically when the big corporations,
[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:32.180]  the media, they're all calling for us to be banned.
[02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:33.900]  We've already been shadow banned.
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:39.060]  We're still reaching record numbers of people thanks to the audience getting the word out.
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:42.500]  I think as long as people realize that we're in the middle of the fight, we're going to
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:43.500]  win.
[02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:44.500]  But if people go back to sleep, we're in trouble.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:45.500]  What do you think, Paul?
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:51.740]  I think their reaction to this Kanye West thing is very interesting because of course
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:56.860]  we've entered into an age of celebrity now where no celebrity has anything authentic
[02:47:56.860 --> 02:47:59.660]  to say, anything interesting to say.
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:03.980]  So basically, basically, Kanye comes out and says, I don't hate the president.
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:06.540]  I like the sitting president of the United States.
[02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:11.900]  In what world should it be controversial for a well-known personality to say that he has
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:15.900]  things in common and likes the president of the United States?
[02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:19.300]  Look at the absolute freak out in response to it.
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:21.620]  Look at the Comedy Central hit piece.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:25.620]  Look how they've been freaking out about us claiming to be the new counterculture for
[02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:29.900]  the past year because it has an essence of truth about it.
[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:34.020]  I mean, I've said repeatedly, I get messages.
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:40.540]  Most of the messages I get every day are from kids, 16, 17, 18-year-olds in universities,
[02:48:40.540 --> 02:48:46.980]  in schools saying it's the new cool edgy rebellious thing to watch your videos, to watch videos
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:47.980]  by Jordan Peterson.
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:51.500]  I mean, Jordan Peterson, he's a rock star.
[02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:53.100]  He packs out venues.
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:54.420]  You can't get in them.
[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:57.980]  It's like 200 pounds just to get in his venue at this point.
[02:48:57.980 --> 02:48:59.420]  He's a new rock star.
[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:00.820]  What does he represent?
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:04.140]  The antithesis of identity politics.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:09.940]  So in this Comedy Central piece, they claim that being punk, being counterculture has
[02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:16.380]  to implicitly embrace identity politics, yet the new rock stars that all the kids, all
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:19.940]  the 20-somethings are going to see, people like Jordan Peterson, they're going to see
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:23.980]  someone who represents the very opposite of that.
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:27.980]  That's why they're panicking because it is seen as avant-garde to rebel against the
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:28.980]  culture.
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:31.820]  And what does Jordan Peterson say?
[02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:34.620]  He says the radical saying that there are two sexes.
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:35.620]  Yeah.
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:40.500]  I mean, that's the level of crazy town that it's avant-garde to say that the two plus
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:41.740]  two equals four.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:44.620]  Well, this is the point I had in my video.
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:45.860]  You go back to the 70s.
[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:50.900]  Who was it that was trying to know platform offensive speech, offensive comedy, offensive
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:52.700]  music, offensive movies?
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:55.180]  It was the religious right, generally.
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:49:57.220]  The tables have turned.
[02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.220]  Everything's flipped.
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:03.180]  Now, they're literally, USA Today are coming out with articles saying, oh, these offensive
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:05.140]  song lyrics shouldn't be allowed now.
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:07.060]  Oh, maybe we should ban Chile.
[02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:11.740]  And the left is mad at the left is mad at Trump supporters for not getting rid of him
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:16.220]  because he might add girlfriends or something, which we're not endorsing, but we didn't elect
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:17.220]  him for that.
[02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:19.260]  And so they're going, oh, you Christians are hypocrites.
[02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:23.820]  No, the Christians are the opposite of being hypocrites because if Trump had said he didn't
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:24.940]  do that, then they'd be mad.
[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:25.940]  He didn't say that.
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:27.180]  They didn't hire him for that.
[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:28.180]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:50:28.180 --> 02:50:31.940]  The left is pissed at the evangelicals for not being mad at Trump.
[02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:36.780]  Well, I don't, I don't think anybody voted for Trump thinking that he would be a pure
[02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:38.620]  straight line Christian conservative.
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:42.820]  I mean, that would be the ultimate form of naivety, but I mean, they're the ones trying
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:44.060]  to ban everything.
[02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:47.700]  You know, grid girls, page free girls, they're basically now saying we shouldn't.
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:50.820]  I mean, in London, we're not allowed to show beach body ads.
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:51.820]  They're aligned.
[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:52.820]  Because you're Islamic mayors.
[02:50:52.820 --> 02:50:57.060]  No, and I have articles today where they've got major political parties in Europe saying
[02:50:57.060 --> 02:50:59.940]  ban, segregate women and men on buses.
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:00.940]  It's here.
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:03.620]  It's the green party telling women don't wear skirts.
[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:09.540]  And by the way, the far left leader of the labor party says, wear skirts, wear skirts.
[02:51:09.540 --> 02:51:10.540]  Sorry, Paul.
[02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:15.740]  They, Belgium, they had the leader of the Islam party, which has got elected councilors
[02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:19.020]  in Belgium, get up on a television debate show.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:23.620]  He not only refused to shake hands with the women on that panel, on that debate show,
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:29.060]  he refused to look them in the eye or even look in their direction when they addressed
[02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:30.060]  him.
[02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:33.740]  And this is the kind of attitude the far left is now aligning itself with.
[02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:37.260]  They're also calling for gender segregated public transport.
[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:38.860]  Who's calling for that in the UK?
[02:51:38.860 --> 02:51:39.860]  Jeremy Corbyn.
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:40.860]  Let's think about that.
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:44.580]  The Muslims won't even talk to women in a debate.
[02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:49.420]  And the left just loves it because they want women to be their slaves.
[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:50.940]  I'm telling you, I can't believe it.
[02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:52.940]  I just, it gets crazy and crazier.
[02:51:52.940 --> 02:51:53.940]  Paul, let's go.
[02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:54.940]  Some phone calls.
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:55.940]  We can go on for hours.
[02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:57.140]  We're going to do a little bit of the next hour.
[02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:00.820]  Paul on and Joe Gilbert to take over, but let's go to Danny.
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:01.820]  No, no, no.
[02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:02.820]  Tom in London first.
[02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:09.660]  Tom, you're on the air with Paul Watson, his Britannic majesties, secret service, defender
[02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:17.140]  of the realm, eight armies, great overlord, filled marshal of the cohorts of the visitors
[02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:20.860]  of the cottages of the appendages of the shrubberies.
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:23.620]  Paul, that give you PTSD?
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:24.620]  I'm triggered.
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:28.780]  Tom from Herod of the Britannic majesties, London, England.
[02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:33.220]  We herald you entering into the United States of America.
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:35.700]  You are on the air with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:38.060]  Welcome, my good friend.
[02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:41.580]  I feel very bullied by you putting on that X and X.
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:52.900]  By the way, I'm the person who phoned you in 2015 predicting Trump and Brexit.
[02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:55.540]  I remember you didn't call a predictor and you made some other predictions that haven't
[02:52:55.540 --> 02:52:56.540]  come true.
[02:52:56.540 --> 02:52:57.540]  Go ahead.
[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:00.700]  I dare you to challenge me.
[02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:09.540]  I have royal right to the crown by way of genetic force and the first alignment of the
[02:53:09.540 --> 02:53:11.140]  Cambridge decision.
[02:53:11.140 --> 02:53:15.940]  I am rightful heir to the Britannic throne.
[02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:20.940]  I actually haven't yet made predictions that haven't come true.
[02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:28.460]  My predictions that I made last time I phoned you haven't come true yet because, well, I
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:36.140]  predicted that North Korea was a smokescreen and the real thing going on was Iran.
[02:53:36.140 --> 02:53:42.900]  And I also predicted that Trump would be removed by autumn, fall, fall in American.
[02:53:42.900 --> 02:53:49.340]  And that was last year and you have been proven disgraceful and correct.
[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:52.860]  Well, that remains to be seen.
[02:53:52.860 --> 02:53:57.900]  I mean, Trump, I still think that's going to happen to Trump before your election in
[02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:01.340]  November, but he can save himself.
[02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:02.340]  And I just want to mention that.
[02:54:02.340 --> 02:54:09.780]  By kneeling with a barny stone and kneeling to the great stoning, if he kisses the rear
[02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:12.180]  end of the great leprechaun, he will be free.
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:13.180]  Is that the secret?
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:14.180]  No, no.
[02:54:14.180 --> 02:54:17.540]  It's what he does in North Korea.
[02:54:17.540 --> 02:54:26.020]  Because he, what's on offer with North Korea is Kim Jong-un will announce the peace treaty,
[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:32.900]  the denuclearization and reunification talks, and he'll give Trump the credit, right?
[02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:39.260]  But to get that, Trump has to do certain things and also not screw it up.
[02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:43.260]  Otherwise, he'll get much less than that, which won't save him.
[02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:49.220]  So how he gets the, you know, the full jackpot is he has to go to Pyongyang.
[02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:56.220]  Now, this is about the Chinese culture and the North Korean culture.
[02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:59.380]  It's about faith and saving faith.
[02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:02.940]  And not just their faith.
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:06.780]  If he goes there, they'll feel like it's so embarrassing to everybody if they don't make
[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:07.780]  a deal.
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.940]  Well, no, it's not.
[02:55:09.940 --> 02:55:13.820]  See, right now, Kim Jong-un would lose enormous faith.
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:16.020]  This is a cultural thing.
[02:55:16.020 --> 02:55:18.860]  You know, faith is, you know, it's all important.
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:24.100]  Tom, but we're taking calls for Paul Watson and the fact that every word he says is directly
[02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:26.100]  programmed by me.
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:30.060]  Yeah, but he, he, he, he knows about this sort of thing as well.
[02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:32.260]  He had a Chinese partner, didn't he?
[02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:35.900]  So maybe he knows about the faith, the faith concept.
[02:55:35.900 --> 02:55:39.660]  My husband was Chinese, I had a Chinese husband, he had a Chinese wife.
[02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:41.420]  I got to go, Tom.
[02:55:41.420 --> 02:55:42.420]  Let's get serious here.
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:45.340]  Paul, you want to comment on what Tom was saying?
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:51.500]  Well, I mean, North Korea, we play out, you remember Trump's big button, big nuclear button
[02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:53.700]  tweet at the beginning of January.
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:59.700]  They literally had MSNBC commentators on air saying that this would lead to the annihilation
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:01.180]  of the planet.
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:03.380]  Those tweets haven't aged very well, have they?
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:08.140]  There was another one which I tweeted today basically saying the same thing, that it would
[02:56:08.140 --> 02:56:09.780]  lead to World War three.
[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:14.180]  Ben Rhodes said every taunt back and forth between Trump and Kim Jong-un makes the escalation
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:16.820]  and diplomacy less possible.
[02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:18.860]  They were all proven spectacularly wrong.
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:20.420]  Pompeo's met with him.
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:24.360]  We've got genuine hope for peace between those two nations.
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:25.360]  This is monumental.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:27.380]  Imagine if Obama had achieved that.
[02:56:27.380 --> 02:56:28.380]  They would be lavishing.
[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.380]  Oh, they'd be throwing rose petals on the ground.
[02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:31.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:33.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:34.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:35.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:36.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:37.380]  They'd be throwing roses on it.
[02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:39.740]  Yeah, they would be absolutely lavishing him.
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:41.740]  I mean, what is Trump's approval rating?
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:45.040]  Did you just say lavish the royalty?
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:46.040]  Lavish the royalty.
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:48.420]  But yes, it's massive.
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:49.420]  It's positive.
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:50.980]  It's a genuine step towards peace.
[02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:53.820]  We don't know if it's going to be followed through yet, but they're not going to give
[02:56:53.820 --> 02:56:55.260]  him any credit for it.
[02:56:55.260 --> 02:56:56.260]  The voters know that though.
[02:56:56.260 --> 02:56:58.580]  He's, you know, his approval ratings at what, 50%?
[02:56:58.580 --> 02:56:59.580]  Here's the question.
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:04.180]  Will Trump get a Nobel Peace Prize if they denuclearize the peninsula?
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.180]  Probably not.
[02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.180]  They'll give it to Obama.
[02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:10.100]  Trump could solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:12.620]  They could have a peace deal with North and South Korea.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.820]  You know, Venezuela could be prosperous again.
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:19.260]  They would still not give him anything because they're incredibly biased.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:20.260]  Let me say this then.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:25.100]  I nominate Obama for a peace prize if we denuclearize the peninsula.
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:26.100]  And Hillary.
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:27.100]  She came.
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:28.100]  She saw they died.
[02:57:28.100 --> 02:57:34.380]  I nominate Hillary, Rudd, and Clinton to be empress of the world and have to 5,000.
[02:57:34.380 --> 02:57:36.380]  Don't leave Watson.
[02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:37.380]  You're staying in the next hour.
[02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:38.380]  Look at him trying to leave.
[02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:39.380]  Look at it.
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:40.380]  Running from me.
[02:57:40.380 --> 02:57:42.780]  Running against the, go to that camera.
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:43.780]  Look at him.
[02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:45.300]  He won't escape the fourth hour.
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:47.180]  Mike and Arizona are on the air worldwide.
[02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:48.180]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:50.500]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:54.180]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:57:54.180 --> 02:58:00.940]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:00.940 --> 02:58:06.380]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:58:06.380 --> 02:58:07.380]  Anthroplex.
[02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:09.620]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:10.620]  Thank you.
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:14.700]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[02:58:14.700 --> 02:58:15.700]  toothpaste fans.
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:17.540]  The super blue is awesome.
[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:20.460]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars life products.
[02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:21.660]  They are quality.
[02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:23.620]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:58:23.620 --> 02:58:26.500]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:27.500]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:32.660]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:36.980]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in
[02:58:36.980 --> 02:58:46.460]  order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[02:59:49.500 --> 03:00:06.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.060 --> 03:00:12.220]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:15.220]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:17.460]  Paul told me he's got a date.
[03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:18.460]  He's got to leave.
[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:19.460]  He's going to stay in the hour with us.
[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:22.580]  He says she looks like Baroness from G.I. Joe.
[03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:24.580]  Now that's awesome.
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:27.580]  And she's Russian, folks.
[03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:28.580]  Russian handler.
[03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:29.580]  That's not the good one.
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:30.580]  It's a bit...
[03:00:30.580 --> 03:00:31.580]  There you go.
[03:00:31.580 --> 03:00:34.420]  That's like Dana Lash, but better not that.
[03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:36.020]  I'm not going to leave my wife, but I don't know.
[03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:37.020]  For Baroness.
[03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:39.780]  Paul, do you like Baroness?
[03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:40.780]  I think that's...
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:41.780]  You're putting words in my mouth, Alex.
[03:00:41.780 --> 03:00:45.020]  I don't have a date, but yeah, she's not too bad.
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:46.540]  Let's put Baroness back on screen.
[03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:48.340]  Stop giving me memos.
[03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:50.700]  The memo is, find the Baroness.
[03:00:50.700 --> 03:00:52.700]  Okay, mission...
[03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:55.300]  What do you think Baroness is thinking about right there?
[03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:57.740]  Well, it's a family show.
[03:00:57.740 --> 03:01:00.180]  Oh, that's what she's thinking about.
[03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:03.180]  She's thinking about Cobra Commander.
[03:01:03.180 --> 03:01:05.580]  I am a supreme ruler.
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:07.580]  You like that, Paul?
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:09.100]  Yeah, I remember that one.
[03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:11.780]  Is this abuse or is this my Tourette syndrome?
[03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:14.100]  Be honest with people.
[03:01:14.100 --> 03:01:15.100]  It's kind of Tourette's.
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:20.060]  I mean, after you've been saying the same thing literally for 16 years, it's kind of,
[03:01:20.060 --> 03:01:21.420]  you know, I forgive you for it now.
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:22.420]  I kind of...
[03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:26.220]  And see, now they know secretly we're discussing the Baroness every couple days, right?
[03:01:26.220 --> 03:01:27.380]  Well, it could be code.
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:28.900]  It could be code, yeah.
[03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:30.900]  Well, there's code right there.
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:31.900]  Is there...
[03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:34.500]  Oh, there's any codes needed, what I like.
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:35.500]  Okay.
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:36.500]  Hey, let's get serious.
[03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:37.500]  Danny, you're on the air.
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:41.460]  Paul Joseph Watson, go ahead and ask your question.
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:45.740]  I subscribe to five supplements, but if I can only buy one, it'd be X2.
[03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:48.140]  I hope it doesn't disappear.
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:49.820]  I'm telling you, that's not a thing to sell it.
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:52.220]  I mean, it's selling it good, but I'm worrying as we're...
[03:01:52.220 --> 03:01:55.620]  It's hard to get it then, man, yeah.
[03:01:55.620 --> 03:02:03.060]  Question for Paul, if you could critique Alex, what would you like to see him stop doing
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:07.660]  that you think distracts from the message he's delivering?
[03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:09.380]  Be real, Paul.
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:13.860]  Well, people say Alex interrupts his guests too much, and although you've gotten better
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:18.460]  at that more recently, so I guess I'd say that, but it's improved a lot over the past
[03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:19.460]  year, hasn't it?
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:22.020]  You don't interrupt people that much anymore.
[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:26.260]  That's number one on my list.
[03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:29.500]  We love you, Alex, but we like to hear what your guests have to say too.
[03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:31.500]  I'm getting better, Danny.
[03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:32.500]  Okay.
[03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:35.100]  Haven't I gotten better, Danny?
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:37.540]  Yes, you're getting better.
[03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:38.540]  We love you, Danny.
[03:02:38.540 --> 03:02:39.540]  All right.
[03:02:39.540 --> 03:02:40.540]  Thanks.
[03:02:40.540 --> 03:02:44.540]  Oh, Danny boy.
[03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:47.300]  Some of these calls are like...
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:50.540]  I can't figure out what they're saying.
[03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:51.540]  Lots of hate from Austin.
[03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:59.060]  Here, Sam from the ATX, you're on the air with his Royal Majesty, go ahead.
[03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:03.580]  I prefer the title Lord Protector of the Realms.
[03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:07.020]  That would be Wellington.
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:08.740]  That was Cromwell.
[03:03:08.740 --> 03:03:09.740]  That's right.
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:11.500]  Cromwell of the whole Protestant movement.
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:12.500]  You're right.
[03:03:12.500 --> 03:03:13.500]  Lord Wellington was the guy.
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:19.180]  Hey, guys, this is Standard Co-Intel Pro-Operation, trying to bring friction internally.
[03:03:19.180 --> 03:03:24.940]  Gunderson from the FBI tells all about him doing this to the Black Panthers and his memoirs,
[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:26.700]  and this is how we resist.
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:28.460]  This is how we resist this.
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:29.460]  We're forgiving.
[03:03:29.460 --> 03:03:33.700]  We don't backbite one another, and you guys are really good examples of that, Paul.
[03:03:33.700 --> 03:03:34.700]  I appreciate that.
[03:03:34.700 --> 03:03:35.700]  No, you're right.
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:39.060]  The Black Panthers are trying to manipulate us when we battle over the crown.
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:40.340]  The crown is freedom.
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:41.340]  We don't want the crown.
[03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:43.460]  Hey, man, and that's a bunch of bulls.
[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:49.700]  The Bible says, at the last judgment, the saints will throw down their crowns.
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:53.260]  And give glory and honor to the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[03:03:53.260 --> 03:03:54.260]  Absolutely.
[03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:57.500]  You know, I'm not from the ATX, but I wanted to see how the other half lived.
[03:03:57.500 --> 03:04:01.700]  I was coming back from the border at the governor's racketeering trial, and I thought I'd stop
[03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:02.700]  in.
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:07.780]  And I were rocked into the Starbucks on South Lamar in my Info Wars t-shirt, and let me
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:11.700]  tell you, I was the only Info Warrior in the place.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:16.940]  We make a point to be polite, to tip well, to say please and thank you, hold doors for
[03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:17.940]  people.
[03:04:17.940 --> 03:04:22.380]  But you guys experience a lot of hatred, and I just appreciate you, I commend you for holding
[03:04:22.380 --> 03:04:23.380]  up under that.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:25.700]  Well, Sam, I'm going to come back.
[03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:26.700]  Paul's got a go.
[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:27.700]  He's got a date with the Baroness.
[03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:28.700]  But I want to talk more about that.
[03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:30.860]  It's an honor to do it, because these are weak people.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:34.740]  We have to stand strong on their face, but yeah, living here in Austin is quite interesting
[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:36.020]  now with people.
[03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:38.860]  Paul, I'm going to call you a little while with your memo.
[03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:39.860]  All right?
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:40.860]  All right.
[03:04:40.860 --> 03:04:41.860]  You do that.
[03:04:41.860 --> 03:04:44.860]  Good job, Paul.
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:45.860]  Have fun.
[03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:47.580]  Have a pint for me, all right?
[03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:48.580]  Will do.
[03:04:48.580 --> 03:04:49.580]  Take care.
[03:04:49.580 --> 03:04:54.980]  There goes Paul with the Baroness tonight in London.
[03:04:54.980 --> 03:04:57.860]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life.
[03:04:57.860 --> 03:05:02.420]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:05.180]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:07.740]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:07.740 --> 03:05:12.500]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:14.980]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:19.460]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:21.900]  reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:21.900 --> 03:05:27.060]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:29.940]  these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:35.020]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:35.020 --> 03:05:39.820]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:42.540]  species and other free radicals.
[03:05:42.540 --> 03:05:47.620]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life.
[03:05:47.620 --> 03:06:00.940]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:06:00.940 --> 03:06:20.500]  The sound we're brought to you by my girlfriend, the Baroness.
[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:25.420]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, about to turn the baton over next segment to the great Joel
[03:06:25.420 --> 03:06:26.420]  Gilbert, the filmmaker.
[03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:32.540]  Taking some phone calls right now, though, but getting serious about it here for just
[03:06:32.540 --> 03:06:33.540]  a moment.
[03:06:33.540 --> 03:06:41.140]  Let's not get that guitar sounds right now, but let's turn the radio on.
[03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:42.140]  Humans made that.
[03:06:42.140 --> 03:06:43.140]  Humans are awesome.
[03:06:43.140 --> 03:06:44.140]  I'm a fan of humans.
[03:06:44.140 --> 03:06:51.580]  And I'm looking past the golden age, the age of infinity, and we're so close.
[03:06:51.580 --> 03:06:56.220]  I can taste it, and God's made it for us, and I'm ready.
[03:06:56.220 --> 03:07:03.260]  But I was talking to Sam in Texas, who came into the ATX, just to experience it wearing
[03:07:03.260 --> 03:07:07.700]  an Info War shirt in a South Lamar Starbucks, another one he's talking about, next door
[03:07:07.700 --> 03:07:15.100]  to a pool hall, and they were very hateful to it.
[03:07:15.100 --> 03:07:20.580]  Now people think that that would be something that intimidated me.
[03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:26.700]  When I'm out in Elgin or New Braunville or whatever, it's nothing but fans, white people,
[03:07:26.700 --> 03:07:31.980]  white people, Hispanics, everybody, but in Austin, they still watch the comedy shows.
[03:07:31.980 --> 03:07:33.660]  They still watch Homeland.
[03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:40.020]  They think a real demon has entered their midst, and actually I enjoy being at the grocery
[03:07:40.020 --> 03:07:44.260]  store and having somebody come over and scream and cuss at me, only every once in a while,
[03:07:44.260 --> 03:07:50.820]  every fiftieth person that goes by, because I have an internal compass, and I know that
[03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:54.620]  I'm upsetting them because I'm challenging their whole system.
[03:07:54.620 --> 03:07:58.180]  But I wanted you to be able to Sam walk through that describing where you said you came in
[03:07:58.180 --> 03:07:59.180]  from Texas.
[03:07:59.180 --> 03:08:01.900]  This is at ATX McCall, so I said, Austin, wrongly.
[03:08:01.900 --> 03:08:05.740]  Where you came from, what you saw, what you experienced, what Info War shirt you were
[03:08:05.740 --> 03:08:06.740]  wearing.
[03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:07.740]  Go ahead.
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:08.740]  Yes, Alex.
[03:08:08.740 --> 03:08:15.220]  I got a really nice Info Wars May the Truth Be With You black T-shirt, and you sent it
[03:08:15.220 --> 03:08:17.540]  to me actually for holding one day.
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:19.540]  I appreciate you doing that.
[03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:24.580]  I wear it a lot of places, and I get commendations, too.
[03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:26.300]  People commend me for wearing it.
[03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:32.180]  They kind of have a look in their eye that, man, take some cajones to stand up to the
[03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:37.380]  persecution and to tell people what we really believe and where we really stand, but it's
[03:08:37.380 --> 03:08:38.980]  nothing new in Christianity.
[03:08:38.980 --> 03:08:42.460]  So, yes, I walked into Starbucks today.
[03:08:42.460 --> 03:08:48.740]  I know this is where your old offices were, and I went in there and just had my latte.
[03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:53.940]  I don't think it helped me wake up near as much as my two brain forces that I popped.
[03:08:53.940 --> 03:08:58.660]  But I went in there and had my latte, and to send you an email about the Mexican Army's
[03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:02.580]  reserves being put on alert for Carla today.
[03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:10.700]  And every person takes a side-long look at that shirt, and they chat among themselves,
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:12.500]  hey, that's one of those guys.
[03:09:12.500 --> 03:09:13.780]  That's one of those enemies.
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:16.420]  That's one of the ones that we talk about.
[03:09:16.420 --> 03:09:17.420]  They're real.
[03:09:17.420 --> 03:09:18.420]  That's it.
[03:09:18.420 --> 03:09:19.420]  That's one right there.
[03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:20.420]  And it's a badge.
[03:09:20.420 --> 03:09:22.420]  I also wear Proudly myself.
[03:09:22.420 --> 03:09:24.580]  And it's so sad.
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:29.780]  All we're trying to do is free market, freedom, everything that we know works, and they're
[03:09:29.780 --> 03:09:37.020]  just brainwashed by big corporations that think of them as morons like Jeff Bezos, Bezos.
[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:40.860]  It's very frustrating, and I just wish that I could deprogram them.
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:41.860]  But the thing is-
[03:09:41.860 --> 03:09:47.940]  The Gospel has always been an offense, and I'm Pastor Sam, that's me.
[03:09:47.940 --> 03:09:49.820]  The Gospel has always been an offense.
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:56.780]  It was in a front in England, great heroes of the reform in England, Tindale Bible translators.
[03:09:56.780 --> 03:10:03.140]  And then in America, there was this loyalist, royalist, Catholic Anglican movement, and
[03:10:03.140 --> 03:10:07.020]  the people that stood up against it, they suffered great persecution.
[03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:12.500]  But because we stood for our pilgrim values, that's how we got 1776.
[03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:15.740]  And people from around the world, they still don't understand freedom, and I traveled
[03:10:15.740 --> 03:10:16.740]  to a lot of countries.
[03:10:16.740 --> 03:10:21.420]  I've been through all South America just recently, and people, one question they ask
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:25.940]  is, they let you do this and that in America, and they don't understand it.
[03:10:25.940 --> 03:10:30.580]  It's not that they let us do it, it's that they won't come and stop us, that nobody will
[03:10:30.580 --> 03:10:33.900]  come and stop us, because that's our culture.
[03:10:33.900 --> 03:10:37.420]  As we stand for righteousness, we execute judgment.
[03:10:37.420 --> 03:10:40.180]  And this is what the Bible says will happen at the end.
[03:10:40.180 --> 03:10:45.500]  The saints take the kingdom, and then yes, we lay down our golden crowns before the lamb
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:47.500]  and the ancient of days.
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:55.460]  Well, if anybody ever doubted Revelation with all the world government and the world taxation
[03:10:55.460 --> 03:11:00.940]  system, and the world ID number, and the world social score, they call Skynet, and the human
[03:11:00.940 --> 03:11:04.020]  animal cloning and all of it, I mean, it's here.
[03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:05.020]  It's here.
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:08.740]  I just did a massive teaching on that.
[03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:15.780]  Some of the most confusing chapters of Revelation, chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15, and it's on YouTube.
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:21.340]  You just have to search Pastor Sam or Honnold Sam, and it will come up, and it talks about
[03:11:21.340 --> 03:11:26.140]  some things that are going to happen in reality that these liberal theologians have always
[03:11:26.140 --> 03:11:29.620]  made to be fairytale, and it's going to happen.
[03:11:29.620 --> 03:11:30.620]  We're going to see it.
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:32.020]  I put out a teaching on there.
[03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:34.780]  It's very controversial.
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:35.780]  We're about to see everything.
[03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:36.780]  Thanks a lot.
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:37.780]  God bless you.
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:38.780]  Look, I got all these callers.
[03:11:38.780 --> 03:11:42.020]  I can never get all these people, and I can't always get free t-shirts out when I ask money
[03:11:42.020 --> 03:11:45.820]  to hold for an hour, because most of these folks have only been holding about 30 minutes,
[03:11:45.820 --> 03:11:51.380]  but I got Gilbert here with a huge show lined up, so much key intel.
[03:11:51.380 --> 03:11:54.740]  The report on Russian active measures has come out.
[03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:57.180]  Trump, no collusion.
[03:11:57.180 --> 03:12:00.460]  We've got that.
[03:12:00.460 --> 03:12:05.940]  We've got Trump getting North Korea to sign a peace deal.
[03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:07.860]  I mean, is this what the Russians do?
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:09.420]  Give me a break, man.
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:12.260]  The Democrats have historically been with the Russians, folks.
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:13.260]  Give me a break.
[03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:15.980]  Joe Gilbert's made films about that, he can talk about it.
[03:12:15.980 --> 03:12:21.020]  We've got Raphael and Brooklyn, Isaac and all these other people.
[03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:24.620]  Paul had to go.
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:27.900]  Let's talk to Gage in North Carolina.
[03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:29.260]  Gage, you're on the air.
[03:12:29.260 --> 03:12:30.260]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:31.260]  You're awesome, dude.
[03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:33.260]  I'm on the brain force right now.
[03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:34.260]  Thank you, brother.
[03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:35.260]  Really, I got a question.
[03:12:35.260 --> 03:12:42.260]  How are we going to position ourselves to get this global society and the daily basis,
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:46.580]  you see what I'm saying, every day, every day, when I go into Walmart, when I beat
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:52.340]  the robot, you know what I mean, that's fucked.
[03:12:52.340 --> 03:12:54.380]  We had some cussing there and I had to drop that call.
[03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:55.380]  We're going to let him go.
[03:12:55.380 --> 03:12:58.060]  How do you position yourself against this?
[03:12:58.060 --> 03:13:01.660]  I like doing your research, making your own personal decisions.
[03:13:01.660 --> 03:13:07.300]  You know, you say you go into Walmart, but Walmart's not as bad as Amazon.
[03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:11.260]  And I still show up in my house, I'm like, well, it's like dog turds or something.
[03:13:11.260 --> 03:13:13.860]  There's like Amazon package on the kitchen table.
[03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:15.860]  I'm like, buy it somewhere else.
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:16.860]  Well, it's cheaper.
[03:13:16.860 --> 03:13:18.460]  It's quicker because they run scams.
[03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:23.460]  They got monopolies, stop people go, well, you've got an Amazon account because we keep
[03:13:23.460 --> 03:13:27.780]  the counterfeits off Amazon by having an Amazon account, but I don't promote it and
[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:36.060]  I don't discount stuff on there, strategic, but we've got to support an economic ecosystem
[03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:43.340]  of liberty and Jeff Bezos ain't it.
[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:48.180]  I want to hear Teresa, even though Paul had to go, he had a hot date with Baroness of
[03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:52.860]  Cobra Commander, Teresa of Santa Cruz, California, you had a gift for us.
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:53.860]  Thanks for holding.
[03:13:53.860 --> 03:13:54.860]  Go ahead.
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:55.860]  Hey, Alex.
[03:13:55.860 --> 03:13:57.260]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:13:57.260 --> 03:13:58.260]  Thank you.
[03:13:58.260 --> 03:13:59.260]  Yes, I do.
[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:00.260]  I do have a gift.
[03:14:00.260 --> 03:14:02.540]  I've got a domain for Paul.
[03:14:02.540 --> 03:14:09.260]  I secured, imaginemyshock.com, I wanted to give that to him.
[03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:10.260]  Say that again.
[03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:11.260]  You said redcoatcommander.com.
[03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:12.260]  Yeah.
[03:14:12.260 --> 03:14:13.260]  Yeah.
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:14.260]  Imaginemyshock.com.
[03:14:14.260 --> 03:14:19.260]  Oh, that is a great name, but he always says that.
[03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:20.260]  Yeah.
[03:14:20.260 --> 03:14:21.260]  Exactly.
[03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:22.260]  Exactly.
[03:14:22.260 --> 03:14:23.260]  We'll get your number.
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:24.260]  You want me to get in touch with Paul?
[03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:25.260]  Yes.
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:26.260]  Yes, please.
[03:14:26.260 --> 03:14:30.620]  To give him the URL though, you guys have to go to the little swan love tunnel.
[03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:33.740]  Yes, yes, the swan love tunnel.
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:36.620]  And then I've got a book idea for you, Alex.
[03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:37.620]  Okay.
[03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:38.620]  Okay.
[03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:42.380]  Produce a book called I told you so.
[03:14:42.380 --> 03:14:52.100]  And with all the white papers and all the information that you have provided us with
[03:14:52.100 --> 03:14:57.940]  for many, many years, I mean, sometimes I wish you weren't right, you know?
[03:14:57.940 --> 03:15:03.900]  I tell people prove them wrong, prove me wrong when I'm talking about this stuff, you know?
[03:15:03.900 --> 03:15:12.980]  And so if you produced a book, you know, showing people, like you said, a lot of it is in white
[03:15:12.980 --> 03:15:13.980]  papers.
[03:15:13.980 --> 03:15:16.540]  A lot of it is public knowledge now.
[03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:17.540]  You're a genius.
[03:15:17.540 --> 03:15:19.060]  We're going to get your number.
[03:15:19.060 --> 03:15:21.900]  If you'd like to give Paul that, that'd be a great place for him to have his own blog
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:25.540]  or his own little personal statements as we got all moved off Facebook and Twitter.
[03:15:25.540 --> 03:15:26.540]  They're all censoring us.
[03:15:26.540 --> 03:15:28.540]  ImagineMyShock.com.
[03:15:28.540 --> 03:15:29.780]  Teresa will put you on hold.
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:30.780]  Thank you.
[03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:31.780]  You're awesome.
[03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:32.780]  I'm sorry to Vincent, Nelson, Isaac and Raphael.
[03:15:32.780 --> 03:15:40.020]  I tried to get the piece of good, but coming out of the gates is the great, the amazing,
[03:15:40.020 --> 03:15:51.260]  the powerful filmmaker, Joe Superpatriot, Gilbert.
[03:15:51.260 --> 03:15:53.620]  And then this Sunday I'll be back.
[03:15:53.620 --> 03:15:55.780]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:55.780 --> 03:15:57.380]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[03:15:57.380 --> 03:16:00.500]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:04.260]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[03:16:04.260 --> 03:16:05.260]  government ever.
[03:16:05.260 --> 03:16:10.820]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.820 --> 03:16:14.060]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[03:16:14.060 --> 03:16:15.060]  are.

[03:17:55.060 --> 03:17:56.060]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:56.060 --> 03:18:02.740]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim,
[03:18:02.740 --> 03:18:06.180]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:11.660]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[03:18:11.660 --> 03:18:14.580]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:18:14.580 --> 03:18:20.940]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw of medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:18:20.940 --> 03:18:27.220]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[03:18:27.220 --> 03:18:30.700]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:34.860]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:18:34.860 --> 03:18:41.260]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:18:41.260 --> 03:18:45.060]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:45.060 --> 03:18:47.860]  It is amazing.
[03:18:47.860 --> 03:18:54.700]  Red pill, now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:59.060]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:03.780]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:05.300]  to detoxify the body.
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:10.180]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:11.700]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:16.620]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[03:19:16.620 --> 03:19:18.460]  the body, and it supports the M4.
[03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:20.740]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:19:20.740 --> 03:19:25.220]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[03:19:25.220 --> 03:19:29.900]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:30.900]  get.
[03:19:30.900 --> 03:19:34.100]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:39.140]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[03:19:39.140 --> 03:19:44.340]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:47.060]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:47.060 --> 03:19:50.380]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:50.380 --> 03:19:57.660]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and m4warslife.com.
[03:19:57.660 --> 03:20:21.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:21.780 --> 03:20:29.460]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the infowars.com
[03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:36.060]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:36.060 --> 03:20:41.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Joel Gilbert joining you for this final hour of
[03:20:41.300 --> 03:20:42.300]  the show.
[03:20:42.300 --> 03:20:47.140]  I want to talk about what's going on with the Democrats and the black community.
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:53.980]  This is the holy grail for the Democrats, they rely on 90% of the black vote, typically
[03:20:53.980 --> 03:20:59.620]  coming from urban areas in order to send people to Congress and in order to support their
[03:20:59.620 --> 03:21:01.780]  national candidates.
[03:21:01.780 --> 03:21:07.220]  This week we saw Kanye West came out with tweets supporting President Trump.
[03:21:07.220 --> 03:21:13.580]  He specifically said Barack Obama did nothing for blacks that things got worse under Obama
[03:21:13.580 --> 03:21:20.220]  and he said, I refuse to be enslaved by monolithic thought and he even shared a text message
[03:21:20.220 --> 03:21:26.380]  from his buddy John Legend who was probably horrified that Kanye went ahead and shared
[03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:35.700]  his actual text on Twitter where John Legend said, hey, you're risking your legacy and all
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:44.660]  your fans and Twitter suddenly dropped Kanye West's followers by 9 million within like
[03:21:44.660 --> 03:21:46.780]  an hour and then they had to restore it.
[03:21:46.780 --> 03:21:50.940]  Some clown over at Twitter probably got rid of a lot of his followers and they had to
[03:21:50.940 --> 03:21:55.500]  put him back and we had Kanye West standing his ground.
[03:21:55.500 --> 03:22:02.180]  He said, no, I refuse to be enslaved, I refuse to be enslaved, I can like Donald Trump.
[03:22:02.180 --> 03:22:08.300]  We had Chance the Rapper chimed in and said blacks don't have to be Democrats and this
[03:22:08.300 --> 03:22:13.100]  all started because of Candace Owen from Turning Point USA.
[03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:18.640]  She's the one that spoke at an event and said things like, you know, Democrats own the body
[03:22:18.640 --> 03:22:24.580]  of black people during slavery, now they want to own my mind and she said they cannot own
[03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:26.140]  my mind anymore.
[03:22:26.140 --> 03:22:34.540]  So this issue, it terrifies Democrats because they rely on getting the black community to
[03:22:34.540 --> 03:22:39.660]  vote for them despite the fact that they're working against their interests.
[03:22:39.660 --> 03:22:44.140]  Now I made a movie called There's No Place Like Utopia a few years ago and in that film
[03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:47.900]  it was kind of like a Michael Moore film if you haven't seen it, I'm running around the
[03:22:47.900 --> 03:22:53.980]  country to progressive cities like Chicago, Detroit, Newark where Democrats have been
[03:22:53.980 --> 03:23:00.900]  in control for 50, 60 years and they all have drug cultures, single motherhood, terrible
[03:23:00.900 --> 03:23:10.020]  education, taxes went higher and they drove businesses out of the city yet the Democrats
[03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:14.620]  still have a hold on these people voting for them.
[03:23:14.620 --> 03:23:18.700]  So let's take a look at the trailer, watch just about a minute of the trailer from There's
[03:23:18.700 --> 03:23:23.660]  No Place Like Utopia and I'm going to talk more about the reactions of the people I talked
[03:23:23.660 --> 03:23:24.660]  to in the inner cities.
[03:23:24.660 --> 03:23:25.660]  Let's play the trailer.
[03:23:25.660 --> 03:23:48.660]  Oh, we're glad you landed on Oz, we've got a wizard here, you can solve your problems.
[03:23:48.660 --> 03:23:54.660]  People on welfare assistance here mostly, that's the whole city.
[03:23:54.660 --> 03:24:05.660]  We're going to replace capitalism with socialism to remake the world as it should be.
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:09.660]  Utopia is the kingdom of heaven on earth, that's what they believe.
[03:24:09.660 --> 03:24:15.660]  Everything is pointed up, this is game four, honestly.
[03:24:15.660 --> 03:24:21.660]  There's no home left anymore, they're stuck in Oz, they never get home.
[03:24:21.660 --> 03:24:25.420]  Okay, that's the portion of the trailer I wanted you to see.
[03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:28.820]  Now I'm going to take questions throughout the hour on this film as well as some other
[03:24:28.820 --> 03:24:34.940]  films, Atomic G Hot about the Iranian nuclear program and also Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:24:34.940 --> 03:24:45.940]  If you want to call in, please call at 1-877-789-2539, that's 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:51.620]  Now you saw I talked to a lot of black folks in Chicago and the first thing they said was
[03:24:51.620 --> 03:24:57.820]  we don't want illegals, we don't want marijuana legalized, we don't want businesses being
[03:24:57.820 --> 03:25:02.980]  driven out of our communities because we want good jobs, we want lower taxes, we don't want
[03:25:02.980 --> 03:25:06.980]  our daughters using the public restroom with men.
[03:25:06.980 --> 03:25:09.540]  We want more police.
[03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:14.700]  Now these people sound like conservatives, especially black women are the greatest conservatives
[03:25:14.700 --> 03:25:15.980]  in the country.
[03:25:15.980 --> 03:25:20.580]  And then you ask them, well, who would you vote for, are you going to vote Republican?
[03:25:20.580 --> 03:25:22.660]  They say, no, we vote Democrat.
[03:25:22.660 --> 03:25:27.580]  And I said, but look, everything you believe in is not what the Democrats believe in, they've
[03:25:27.580 --> 03:25:32.660]  created these drug cultures, violent community, everybody's on welfare, nothing got better
[03:25:32.660 --> 03:25:36.060]  just like Kanye West said, nothing got better under Obama.
[03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:42.380]  So the first thing they start to say is, well, wait a minute, they start to rethink the situation
[03:25:42.380 --> 03:25:47.980]  because they've been inundated with these Democrat politicians and narrative that Republicans
[03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:53.660]  are racist when, in fact, a lot of people are catching on, like Candace Owens, Kanye
[03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:58.460]  West that, well, no, maybe the Democrats don't have our interest at heart.
[03:25:58.460 --> 03:26:02.900]  And Kanye West is saying, well, we shouldn't just give all of our vote away to one party,
[03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:04.100]  let them earn it.
[03:26:04.100 --> 03:26:08.700]  So let's take our first call and we want to talk a little bit about Kanye West and the
[03:26:08.700 --> 03:26:15.180]  very dangerous movement that seems to be starting for the Democrat Party if they lose their
[03:26:15.180 --> 03:26:16.340]  hold on the black vote.
[03:26:16.340 --> 03:26:18.780]  Can we bring up the first caller?
[03:26:18.780 --> 03:26:21.580]  Isaac, go ahead.
[03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:24.940]  Hi, Isaac, go ahead.
[03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:32.580]  I apologize, I haven't seen your video utopia yet, but my family settled in Fredericksburg,
[03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:35.780]  Texas in 1840 and they left Denmark.
[03:26:35.780 --> 03:26:42.100]  And I was doing some research on them and following my family's origin and I found out
[03:26:42.100 --> 03:26:49.540]  and Germany in 1840, they really expelled a lot of liberal thinkers and there was a group
[03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:58.660]  called the Dermstadt 40 who settled, who left the Gottenberg College, I'm probably pronouncing
[03:26:58.660 --> 03:27:04.780]  a lot of that German role, but they came all the way to Texas to do a thought experiment
[03:27:04.780 --> 03:27:07.780]  and there was 40 of them and they called them the Dermstadt 40 and they wanted to build
[03:27:07.780 --> 03:27:14.780]  a utopia in the middle of Texas and they thought they had no rules, no law, it was a disaster
[03:27:14.780 --> 03:27:16.420]  within two years.
[03:27:16.420 --> 03:27:23.580]  They all dispersed, some of them went back home, but the origins of this Dermstadt 40
[03:27:23.580 --> 03:27:26.100]  goes all the way to Christian Orstrup.
[03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:31.260]  He had created some of the first electronic.
[03:27:31.260 --> 03:27:32.260]  Thank you for the call.
[03:27:32.260 --> 03:27:34.500]  I'm going to comment because we don't have that much time in the segment.
[03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:36.860]  Look, it's been tried many times.
[03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:44.100]  Thomas Moore, Marx's workers' paradise, Stalinism, Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tong, everywhere they tried
[03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:49.460]  to create this perfect world with a paradise on earth that always failed and that's the
[03:27:49.460 --> 03:27:55.020]  difference between conservatives and liberals and leftists.
[03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:59.380]  Leftist socialist communists, they look at America and compare it to the perfect society,
[03:27:59.380 --> 03:28:03.700]  the perfect world and they conclude, okay, we have to tear it down and destroy it because
[03:28:03.700 --> 03:28:05.820]  it's not perfect.
[03:28:05.820 --> 03:28:08.940]  Conservatives compare America to the rest of the world and we say, we love America,
[03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:10.940]  we want to build it up.
[03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:12.340]  That's the basic difference.
[03:28:12.340 --> 03:28:18.900]  The Democrats are putting black people and minorities out in the front and saying, look,
[03:28:18.900 --> 03:28:20.740]  they don't have a perfect world.
[03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:26.020]  They don't have all these services and things that everybody else has, so we have to take
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:28.860]  down and start the system all over again.
[03:28:28.860 --> 03:28:32.340]  And I think black people are catching on that the Democrats have never had their interest
[03:28:32.340 --> 03:28:33.340]  at heart.
[03:28:33.340 --> 03:28:37.580]  They're only looking to use them to further an agenda to take power.
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:40.740]  And that's what Barack Obama did when he was in office.

[03:32:57.660 --> 03:33:14.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:14.300 --> 03:33:16.540]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:16.540 --> 03:33:17.820]  Joel Gilbert back with you.
[03:33:17.820 --> 03:33:24.940]  We're talking about this phenomena this week, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, Candace Owens.
[03:33:24.940 --> 03:33:29.500]  This may be the week that the black community starts to take a hard look at the Democrats
[03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:33.460]  and how they've abandoned them and used them over the years for their votes while doing
[03:33:33.460 --> 03:33:37.540]  absolutely nothing for them, including Barack Obama.
[03:33:37.540 --> 03:33:43.300]  We saw during the last election, I made the film called Banished, the untold story of
[03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:49.620]  Danny Williams, Bill Clinton's black son living in Arkansas whose aunt took him to the governor's
[03:33:49.620 --> 03:33:55.180]  mansion when he was five years old, had the door slammed in his face and they didn't
[03:33:55.180 --> 03:33:56.580]  care about Danny Williams.
[03:33:56.580 --> 03:33:59.100]  Guess who else didn't care about Danny Williams?
[03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:00.100]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:02.180]  Black Lives Matter made fun of him.
[03:34:02.180 --> 03:34:03.420]  They didn't even contact him.
[03:34:03.420 --> 03:34:08.020]  They just tried to make fun of him and dismiss him because they had an agenda to support
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:11.180]  the Democrats, not an agenda to help black people.
[03:34:11.180 --> 03:34:16.260]  We're going to be talking more about this monumental week for the black community where
[03:34:16.260 --> 03:34:21.900]  the tide may be turning and the Democrats are living in terror right now that black
[03:34:21.900 --> 03:34:26.420]  people might start to reexamine their blind faith at the Democrat Party.
[03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:36.460]  You can call in at 1-877-789-ALIX, that's 1-877-789-2539.
[03:34:36.460 --> 03:34:43.020]  Now, most of you have seen my film Dreams of My Real Father and Obama's story is typical
[03:34:43.020 --> 03:34:48.780]  of what the black community has suffered from, from liberals and communists.
[03:34:48.780 --> 03:34:53.820]  Barack Obama's real father, as I showed in my film, was not the Kenyan goat herder.
[03:34:53.820 --> 03:35:01.460]  It was a Russian agent named Frank Marshall Davis who was in Chicago who the white communists
[03:35:01.460 --> 03:35:05.900]  got to help try to bring black people into the communist movement in the 30s.
[03:35:05.900 --> 03:35:18.220]  Let's take a quick look at part of the trailer for Dreams of My Real Father.
[03:35:18.220 --> 03:35:23.340]  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya.
[03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:48.460]  He grew up hurting goats.
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:54.140]  I wanted you to be reminded of this trailer because Obama's father, Frank Marshall Davis,
[03:35:54.140 --> 03:35:59.220]  was recruited into the Communist Party by white communists to help convince black people
[03:35:59.220 --> 03:36:03.380]  in Chicago to join the communist movement in the 30s.
[03:36:03.380 --> 03:36:04.380]  Black people were no fools.
[03:36:04.380 --> 03:36:10.660]  They were religious, church-going people, hard-working, strong families, and they rejected Frank Marshall
[03:36:10.660 --> 03:36:14.860]  Davis and the communism he represented because it was atheist.
[03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:18.780]  But Davis later went to Hawaii on orders of the Kremlin.
[03:36:18.780 --> 03:36:25.900]  His son, Barack Obama, he raises Barack Obama by Obama's own admission and Frank Marshall
[03:36:25.900 --> 03:36:30.020]  Davis radicalizes Obama into this Marxist worldview.
[03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:34.540]  Obama ends up back in Chicago where his father is from, and the same thing happens.
[03:36:34.540 --> 03:36:40.060]  The white communists recruit Obama to try to trick black people into joining the socialist
[03:36:40.060 --> 03:36:41.140]  movement.
[03:36:41.140 --> 03:36:44.300]  But 50 years later, black people in Chicago are no fools.
[03:36:44.300 --> 03:36:45.420]  They rejected Obama.
[03:36:45.420 --> 03:36:46.700]  He ran for Congress.
[03:36:46.700 --> 03:36:47.700]  They didn't vote for him.
[03:36:47.700 --> 03:36:49.580]  Bobby Rush won.
[03:36:49.580 --> 03:36:55.820]  It was only the white liberals that supported Obama and pushed him into the national spotlight.
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:36:58.780]  Let's take a call from George in Texas.
[03:36:58.780 --> 03:37:04.100]  Go ahead with your question about any of my films or the way that the Democrats have been
[03:37:04.100 --> 03:37:07.660]  using the black community for years and years.
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:09.500]  I have all three-year films.
[03:37:09.500 --> 03:37:12.100]  Dreams of my real father.
[03:37:12.100 --> 03:37:20.060]  There's no place like Utopia and The Art of the Insult, but one thing, I lived in Florida
[03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:27.260]  and I'd seen a lot of Cubans, and they told me all about Castro and how communism has
[03:37:27.260 --> 03:37:33.540]  destroyed the human dignity, the human spirit.
[03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:39.140]  If you want to really see communism in its graphic form, you can go on YouTube and go
[03:37:39.140 --> 03:37:44.100]  look up the movie, The Checkist, that was made in 1992 in Russia.
[03:37:44.100 --> 03:37:48.860]  If you want to see graphic communism, how it destroys the human spirit, go see that
[03:37:48.860 --> 03:37:57.980]  movie, The Checkist, but as far as like Black America, I've seen how the great society and
[03:37:57.980 --> 03:38:01.460]  the socialist program have destroyed the black family.
[03:38:01.460 --> 03:38:08.060]  I remember one time, I'm 51 years old, that black Americans used to be the most righteous
[03:38:08.060 --> 03:38:09.900]  upright people.
[03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:12.340]  Now you can't really find them anymore.
[03:38:12.340 --> 03:38:16.460]  Well, let me comment, thanks for your call.
[03:38:16.460 --> 03:38:23.620]  Look, black people are very righteous, they're very family-oriented, they're very close-knit
[03:38:23.620 --> 03:38:24.620]  families.
[03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:30.860]  I think it's actually hard to find a black child to adopt because the grandparents or
[03:38:30.860 --> 03:38:36.980]  the parents of the child or the grandparents will raise that child because they're so close-knit
[03:38:36.980 --> 03:38:38.180]  people.
[03:38:38.180 --> 03:38:42.020]  If you saw in my film, there's no place like Utopia, I talked to a lot of black people
[03:38:42.020 --> 03:38:47.140]  all over and a lot of them were on welfare and they're very unhappy about it.
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:48.140]  They're very unhappy about it.
[03:38:48.140 --> 03:38:49.140]  They don't want to be on welfare.
[03:38:49.140 --> 03:38:51.740]  They don't want to be on these assistance programs.
[03:38:51.740 --> 03:38:58.900]  It's embarrassing and that's why Trump has made such inroads because he's got the lowest
[03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:05.620]  black unemployment in history and he even announced that in the State of the Union address
[03:39:05.620 --> 03:39:10.500]  and guess who wouldn't even clap or even stand up was the black caucus.
[03:39:10.500 --> 03:39:16.580]  These black people that have been coerced into the Democrat Party that just follow
[03:39:16.580 --> 03:39:21.060]  that line and are not looking after the interests of the black community who probably voted
[03:39:21.060 --> 03:39:22.060]  them into power.
[03:39:22.060 --> 03:39:24.260]  Let's take another call from Jim.
[03:39:24.260 --> 03:39:27.140]  Go ahead, Jim.
[03:39:27.140 --> 03:39:32.180]  Okay, Jim, are you there?
[03:39:32.180 --> 03:39:35.460]  Okay, it looks like we don't.
[03:39:35.460 --> 03:39:39.100]  Is it Jim in Virginia or who is it?
[03:39:39.100 --> 03:39:40.660]  Let's go with Alexander in Virginia instead.
[03:39:40.660 --> 03:39:41.660]  Go ahead, Alexander.
[03:39:41.660 --> 03:39:50.420]  Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would like to suggest that maybe a focus of breaking the democratic
[03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:57.460]  hold on the black vote should be going into their past with Jim Crow, the reversal of
[03:39:57.460 --> 03:40:02.260]  reconstruction, the KKK, all this stuff.
[03:40:02.260 --> 03:40:08.820]  And now the Democrats have gotten away with the illusion or the myth that they and the
[03:40:08.820 --> 03:40:14.180]  Republicans switched in the past and so all that actually happened from the Republican
[03:40:14.180 --> 03:40:18.420]  Party and that's what I hear from people.
[03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:24.740]  They are convinced that all those things in the past was a result of Republicans.
[03:40:24.740 --> 03:40:29.300]  Right, that's what a lot of, thank you for the call, a lot of them will say, well, things
[03:40:29.300 --> 03:40:31.260]  have flipped, things have changed around.
[03:40:31.260 --> 03:40:34.460]  Now the Democrats represent our interests.
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:39.660]  But now you've got admired black cultural figures like Kanye West, I mean, who's bigger
[03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:47.340]  than him, that are openly questioning why black communities should just give away their
[03:40:47.340 --> 03:40:48.500]  votes to the Democrats.
[03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:51.860]  It really hasn't done anything for them.
[03:40:51.860 --> 03:40:55.700]  We saw Chance the Rapper came right away and said, you don't have to be a Democrat.
[03:40:55.700 --> 03:41:01.060]  So this is the biggest nightmare of the Democrat Party because if they lose, let's say the
[03:41:01.060 --> 03:41:06.540]  black vote is 20% and even bigger in Democrat primaries of course.
[03:41:06.540 --> 03:41:13.100]  If it's 20% and they lose 10% of it, Democrat Party is finished.
[03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:18.500]  But the trick that the Democrats have done with Barack Obama is to try to get black
[03:41:18.500 --> 03:41:24.820]  leaders to join the Democrat Party and trick black people into thinking, well, here's a
[03:41:24.820 --> 03:41:28.020]  black guy and he's going to look out for my interests.
[03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:30.060]  Barack Obama didn't do anything for the black community.
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:32.100]  He did a lot for Iran.
[03:41:32.100 --> 03:41:33.100]  He did a lot for Russia.
[03:41:33.100 --> 03:41:35.340]  He was very pro-Russian in his first term.
[03:41:35.340 --> 03:41:36.580]  He did a lot for illegals.
[03:41:36.580 --> 03:41:38.100]  He did a lot for Hondurans.
[03:41:38.100 --> 03:41:39.100]  He did a lot for Mexicans.
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:41.940]  He didn't do anything for black people.
[03:41:41.940 --> 03:41:48.460]  And I think they realize it now that just because someone has the same race as them
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.780]  doesn't mean they're going to look out for their interests.
[03:41:50.780 --> 03:41:57.500]  I think Donald Trump, a white guy, has done a lot more to achieve employment goals and
[03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:04.580]  all the agenda that the Democrats have been promising for years and years.
[03:42:04.580 --> 03:42:08.620]  Education is going to get better, schools reduce the violence, get rid of the violent
[03:42:08.620 --> 03:42:10.120]  gangs and so on.
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:15.660]  So it's a monumental week because this really is the tipping point, I think, where if you
[03:42:15.660 --> 03:42:20.660]  have Kanye West saying you don't have to be a Democrat and chance the rapper and John
[03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:25.220]  Legend come and says, no, Hillary Clinton, you know, he put on rallies for Hillary Clinton.
[03:42:25.220 --> 03:42:28.020]  John Legend comes and says, no, you can't do that.
[03:42:28.020 --> 03:42:31.260]  And Kanye West said, well, yes, I can.
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:36.860]  So keep a close eye on this debate in the black community with the Democrats.
[03:42:36.860 --> 03:42:40.940]  I think the stranglehold is beginning to be broken.
[03:42:40.940 --> 03:42:44.220]  When we come back, we're going to come back with Larry Claimant to talk about the Senate
[03:42:44.220 --> 03:43:13.540]  Committee trying to protect the Mueller probe, we'll be right back.
[03:43:13.540 --> 03:43:39.420]  And
[03:43:39.420 --> 03:43:42.860]  The strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[03:43:42.860 --> 03:43:44.900]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:44.900 --> 03:43:48.300]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[03:43:48.300 --> 03:43:50.780]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[03:45:58.980 --> 03:45:59.980]  say.
[03:45:59.980 --> 03:46:04.820]  I've talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders, a lot of the behavioral
[03:46:04.820 --> 03:46:11.740]  disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines
[03:46:11.740 --> 03:46:17.900]  that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut
[03:46:17.900 --> 03:46:19.340]  causing toxicity in the brain.
[03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:21.420]  Here's a big BBC report today.
[03:46:21.420 --> 03:46:24.900]  How bacteria are changing your mood if you have the wrong ones.

[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:38.700]  go through.
[03:46:38.700 --> 03:46:39.700]  They get what they want first.
[03:46:39.700 --> 03:46:40.700]  They colonize you.
[03:46:40.700 --> 03:46:43.740]  Then they secrete toxins in you that cause depression.
[03:46:43.740 --> 03:46:46.420]  They can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar.
[03:46:46.420 --> 03:46:47.420]  This is well known.
[03:46:47.420 --> 03:46:57.060]  Newcombe with Myco ZX exclusively at info wars life.com.
[03:46:57.060 --> 03:47:07.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:07.340 --> 03:47:09.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:09.940 --> 03:47:21.020]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:47:21.020 --> 03:47:23.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:24.900]  Welcome back.
[03:47:24.900 --> 03:47:25.900]  I'm Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:25.900 --> 03:47:27.300]  We've got one more segment for you.
[03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:32.580]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store for Trump, the art of the insult by an Alex
[03:47:32.580 --> 03:47:33.580]  Jones store.
[03:47:33.580 --> 03:47:37.780]  You'll laugh for 95 minutes and you'll get to understand Trump for the very first time,
[03:47:37.780 --> 03:47:43.820]  the marketing and branding genius that he is and that he's continuing today.
[03:47:43.820 --> 03:47:48.700]  So much so that little rocket man is giving up his nuclear weapons and laying down his
[03:47:48.700 --> 03:47:49.700]  arms.
[03:47:49.700 --> 03:47:53.820]  So, Trump, victory after victory, it's a whole lot of winning.
[03:47:53.820 --> 03:47:58.820]  Let's take one more call on the Kanye West phenomena from Marty and Boston.
[03:47:58.820 --> 03:47:59.820]  Marty, go ahead.
[03:47:59.820 --> 03:48:00.820]  Hi.
[03:48:00.820 --> 03:48:04.020]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:04.020 --> 03:48:08.980]  My father has been working in the entertainment industry for quite some time and he actually
[03:48:08.980 --> 03:48:14.020]  had the pleasure of working with Kanye a few years back and the things that he learned
[03:48:14.020 --> 03:48:19.020]  from Kanye, I see playing out in front of us right now.
[03:48:19.020 --> 03:48:27.340]  One of those things being that Kanye West, he's taking the leap forward and he's leading
[03:48:27.340 --> 03:48:29.220]  a lot of the black community.
[03:48:29.220 --> 03:48:31.780]  No, no, okay.
[03:48:31.780 --> 03:48:33.260]  Sorry about that, folks.
[03:48:33.260 --> 03:48:36.300]  Kanye West really is a leader.
[03:48:36.300 --> 03:48:41.020]  He's shown that he'll go against the grain and he'll speak his mind and I think a lot
[03:48:41.020 --> 03:48:47.060]  of people have a lot to be proud of that are listening to him and are willing to hear what
[03:48:47.060 --> 03:48:48.060]  he has to say.
[03:48:48.060 --> 03:48:52.420]  Obviously, he didn't appreciate his buddy John Legend telling him, the thought police
[03:48:52.420 --> 03:48:57.180]  telling him, no, you've got to go with Hillary like I've done my whole life.
[03:48:57.180 --> 03:49:01.260]  We're going to switch gears here to talk to Larry Klayman.
[03:49:01.260 --> 03:49:07.660]  We had a great interview a couple of weeks back, 120,000 views on YouTube and I'd like
[03:49:07.660 --> 03:49:08.660]  to hear from Larry.
[03:49:08.660 --> 03:49:09.660]  Are you there, Larry?
[03:49:09.660 --> 03:49:10.660]  Oh, I'm here.
[03:49:10.660 --> 03:49:12.420]  Great to see you.
[03:49:12.420 --> 03:49:13.420]  Great to see you.
[03:49:13.420 --> 03:49:18.140]  Well, look, the Senate Judiciary Committee just approved legislation.
[03:49:18.140 --> 03:49:22.100]  That's why I wanted to have you back on today to protect the Mueller probe so that Robert
[03:49:22.100 --> 03:49:24.260]  Mueller can't be fired.
[03:49:24.260 --> 03:49:25.660]  What is playing out now?
[03:49:25.660 --> 03:49:30.700]  Are we at the end game where they're just trying to save Mueller so he can keep persecuting
[03:49:30.700 --> 03:49:34.140]  Trump and what can and should Trump do to fight back?
[03:49:34.140 --> 03:49:38.660]  Joe, the reality is, and we've seen this all along, is that it's not just the Democrat
[03:49:38.660 --> 03:49:42.380]  establishment in Washington, D.C. It's the Republican establishment.
[03:49:42.380 --> 03:49:47.620]  They want to see President Trump dead politically, and in some cases, actually, it's unbelievable.
[03:49:47.620 --> 03:49:48.620]  It's outrageous.
[03:49:48.620 --> 03:49:50.300]  This is Senator Charles Grassley.
[03:49:50.300 --> 03:49:52.260]  He's the chairman of that committee.
[03:49:52.260 --> 03:49:54.060]  I dealt with him in the last few years.
[03:49:54.060 --> 03:49:57.860]  I tried to bring mass surveillance to his attention, and he didn't listen to me.
[03:49:57.860 --> 03:49:59.260]  I don't think he understood what I was saying.
[03:49:59.260 --> 03:50:04.340]  I think, frankly, not only is the establishment, but he's become senile at an old age.
[03:50:04.340 --> 03:50:09.100]  But you've got this very evil establishment that wants to destroy the president.
[03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:13.220]  And that, of course, explains why Jeff Sessions is left alone at the Justice Department to
[03:50:13.220 --> 03:50:14.220]  do nothing.
[03:50:14.220 --> 03:50:18.740]  This week, he says he's not doing anything because special counsels take on the life
[03:50:18.740 --> 03:50:19.740]  of their own.
[03:50:19.740 --> 03:50:25.140]  Well, yes, if I was special counsel and you go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org,
[03:50:25.140 --> 03:50:27.940]  you can be damn sure I would take on the life of our own.
[03:50:27.940 --> 03:50:31.500]  I would prosecute the elite criminals on behalf of the American people.
[03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:38.060]  Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Robert Mueller, Barack Obama, George Soros, the rest of them.
[03:50:38.060 --> 03:50:42.140]  But this establishment doesn't want to rock the boat, and Trump rocks the boat because
[03:50:42.140 --> 03:50:45.260]  he challenges their money train and their power.
[03:50:45.260 --> 03:50:48.780]  And that's why we, the American people, need to rise up, and that's why I need to be named
[03:50:48.780 --> 03:50:49.780]  special counsel.
[03:50:49.780 --> 03:50:53.540]  And I also think that we should be starting citizens' grand juries, which are totally
[03:50:53.540 --> 03:51:00.180]  legal, just as Scalia found in 1992, in a case United States v. Williams, that the grand
[03:51:00.180 --> 03:51:03.940]  jury belongs to the American people, not to the other three branches of government.
[03:51:03.940 --> 03:51:09.780]  We have the right to a panel grand jury, to indict, to try, and to convict.
[03:51:09.780 --> 03:51:13.540]  And also, we have the right to sentence and enforce that, and I would go to a federal
[03:51:13.540 --> 03:51:15.980]  judge through a citizen's grand jury.
[03:51:15.980 --> 03:51:22.260]  Again, you can see that on our website at freedomwatchusa.org, and I would seek to enforce
[03:51:22.260 --> 03:51:23.260]  the convictions.
[03:51:23.260 --> 03:51:24.260]  We need your help.
[03:51:24.260 --> 03:51:26.260]  We need American people's help here.
[03:51:26.260 --> 03:51:29.220]  All right, yeah, go ahead and go to freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:30.300]  So Larry, how does this work?
[03:51:30.300 --> 03:51:36.260]  When you go to, come to Texas, come to Dallas, and choose citizens and set up a grand jury,
[03:51:36.260 --> 03:51:42.340]  how would that work, and how would you impanel people, and how would you get testimony?
[03:51:42.340 --> 03:51:43.860]  What would happen in the end?
[03:51:43.860 --> 03:51:44.860]  Explain the process.
[03:51:44.860 --> 03:51:48.620]  Yes, and we need resources to do that so people can donate to our cause by going to
[03:51:48.620 --> 03:51:49.620]  freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:51:49.620 --> 03:51:55.180]  But I am a member of the Northern District of Texas, District Court.
[03:51:55.180 --> 03:51:56.180]  We could do it.
[03:51:56.180 --> 03:52:00.420]  In and around InfoWars down there, I would like to see them play a role here, too, so
[03:52:00.420 --> 03:52:02.620]  we can reach the American people.
[03:52:02.620 --> 03:52:08.260]  But yes, we can impanel grand jury by going to neutral voter rolls and choose them randomly,
[03:52:08.260 --> 03:52:12.380]  exactly the way it's done by the Justice Department and judges.
[03:52:12.380 --> 03:52:19.260]  We would then choose a petted jury once we got convictions, a regular jury, again, neutrally
[03:52:19.260 --> 03:52:24.660]  chosen, get a retired judge that had some courage, I've got some in mind, and then we
[03:52:24.660 --> 03:52:29.820]  give notice to the defendants, such as Comey, Muller, Clinton, and the rest, that they're
[03:52:29.820 --> 03:52:34.660]  willing to come and testify in front of that grand jury, and if they don't, we'll seek
[03:52:34.660 --> 03:52:37.180]  to indict them on the evidence we have.
[03:52:37.180 --> 03:52:38.180]  And then we'll try them.
[03:52:38.180 --> 03:52:44.740]  We'll try them before a neutral judge and a jury, and we will convict them undoubtedly
[03:52:44.740 --> 03:52:49.180]  because there's so much evidence out there, there's no way that we don't get convictions.
[03:52:49.180 --> 03:52:52.340]  Easier than convicting, I might say Bill Cosby.
[03:52:52.340 --> 03:52:55.100]  So this is what we have in plan.
[03:52:55.100 --> 03:52:56.620]  What would happen with that conviction?
[03:52:56.620 --> 03:52:58.260]  Can you then enforce it?
[03:52:58.260 --> 03:53:02.180]  How do you enforce it?
[03:53:02.180 --> 03:53:04.820]  Technically speaking, the American people could enforce it themselves, like they did
[03:53:04.820 --> 03:53:05.820]  in the old West.
[03:53:05.820 --> 03:53:10.660]  I wouldn't advocate that, but I do have a judge in mind who I believe would issue an
[03:53:10.660 --> 03:53:17.100]  order to the U.S. Marshal Service to arrest the criminals and throw them in federal prison.
[03:53:17.100 --> 03:53:21.700]  And we can certainly find, with all of the judges in this country, one judge that will
[03:53:21.700 --> 03:53:25.980]  do that, I have one particular judge in mind who I believe would do that.
[03:53:25.980 --> 03:53:29.340]  But we've got to try it, in addition to being special counsel.
[03:53:29.340 --> 03:53:33.500]  I wouldn't need a citizen's grand jury if I was appointed to that, but if that does
[03:53:33.500 --> 03:53:38.460]  not happen, and I don't believe that it will, because President Trump's been collared, I
[03:53:38.460 --> 03:53:44.580]  think, by his lawyers to take not very strong action here, we need to do the citizen's grand
[03:53:44.580 --> 03:53:45.580]  jury.
[03:53:45.580 --> 03:53:48.180]  We need to do it quick because our country's sinking into the swamp.
[03:53:48.180 --> 03:53:49.180]  All right.
[03:53:49.180 --> 03:53:50.180]  Do you have faith?
[03:53:50.180 --> 03:53:53.140]  You've got this guy, Huber, is a prosecutor working with Sessions.
[03:53:53.140 --> 03:53:57.100]  You've got the Horowitz report coming out in drips, and the big part is probably coming
[03:53:57.100 --> 03:53:58.900]  in a couple of weeks.
[03:53:58.900 --> 03:54:05.900]  You've got this guy, Cohen Watnick, from the Intelligence working with DOJ.
[03:54:05.900 --> 03:54:11.660]  You not have any confidence that the system that is slowly working behind the scenes will
[03:54:11.660 --> 03:54:18.420]  go ahead and come up with prosecutions, indictments, and carry out what a special counsel would
[03:54:18.420 --> 03:54:19.620]  have done anyway.
[03:54:19.620 --> 03:54:20.620]  And why not?
[03:54:20.620 --> 03:54:22.260]  Zero confidence, Joel.
[03:54:22.260 --> 03:54:26.540]  Look, we have the example of the last three decades.
[03:54:26.540 --> 03:54:31.460]  When has any of the elites in Washington, D.C., been held accountable for anything?
[03:54:31.460 --> 03:54:36.340]  What happens is the justice system burns the lower level and middle-hanging fruit.
[03:54:36.340 --> 03:54:41.100]  People like Scooter Libby, who was Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney in the Valerie
[03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:42.100]  Plain scandal.
[03:54:42.100 --> 03:54:43.100]  He got indicted.
[03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:45.220]  Cheney never got indicted.
[03:54:45.220 --> 03:54:47.140]  Karl Rove never got indicted.
[03:54:47.140 --> 03:54:48.780]  No one gets indicted.
[03:54:48.780 --> 03:54:50.900]  So we need a special counsel as well.
[03:54:50.900 --> 03:54:51.900]  I should be appointed.
[03:54:51.900 --> 03:54:56.100]  You can go to our website, freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:54:56.100 --> 03:55:01.740]  And in the addition, we need a citizen's grand jury, because we need to go after the high-hanging
[03:55:01.740 --> 03:55:02.740]  fruit.
[03:55:02.740 --> 03:55:06.500]  We need to go after Obama, after Clinton, after Mueller, after Comey.
[03:55:06.500 --> 03:55:09.020]  Look, Mueller has been leaking grand jury information.
[03:55:09.020 --> 03:55:10.020]  That's a crime.
[03:55:10.020 --> 03:55:12.940]  He should be taken out legally now for that.
[03:55:12.940 --> 03:55:18.260]  I have chases pending in that regard, but if I was special counsel, I would control
[03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:23.740]  a grand jury and have him indicted for that and convicted and thrown in prison.
[03:55:23.740 --> 03:55:24.980]  This guy is a crook.
[03:55:24.980 --> 03:55:25.980]  He's a criminal.
[03:55:25.980 --> 03:55:26.980]  He's dishonest.
[03:55:26.980 --> 03:55:30.820]  And the Republican establishment is backing him up because they want to see the president
[03:55:30.820 --> 03:55:32.340]  legally dead.
[03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:34.780]  And people need to understand that.
[03:55:34.780 --> 03:55:35.780]  Tell me this.
[03:55:35.780 --> 03:55:42.100]  Do you think it's realistic that the lower level of the FBI decided one day, we don't
[03:55:42.100 --> 03:55:43.220]  like Donald Trump.
[03:55:43.220 --> 03:55:47.980]  Let's start this whole thing in motion and work with the DNC to try to spy on him and
[03:55:47.980 --> 03:55:49.620]  get him out of office.
[03:55:49.620 --> 03:55:56.900]  Is that realistic or, by definition, orders come from the White House, from Valerie Jarrett,
[03:55:56.900 --> 03:56:02.780]  from Obama, just like with the IRS scandal, where they use the IRS to interfere in the
[03:56:02.780 --> 03:56:06.340]  2012 election so conservatives could not organize?
[03:56:06.340 --> 03:56:11.060]  Is this only originating the FBI or does it come from far above?
[03:56:11.060 --> 03:56:13.220]  That comes from the top.
[03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:17.820]  Comes from people who are in control of the FBI, Comey and Mueller, before that.
[03:56:17.820 --> 03:56:22.660]  Comes from the president of the United States, Barack Obama, yes, it comes from him.
[03:56:22.660 --> 03:56:25.660]  Average FBI agents, special agents, I've represented them.
[03:56:25.660 --> 03:56:28.900]  They're generally very good, honest, patriotic people.
[03:56:28.900 --> 03:56:32.020]  If they want to stay in the FBI, they have to do what they're told.
[03:56:32.020 --> 03:56:33.460]  Many of them have quit.
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:37.900]  Many of them expressed complete consternation and disgust at what happened with regard to
[03:56:37.900 --> 03:56:42.460]  Hillary Clinton and covering up her email scandal and other scandals.
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:44.980]  It's the people at the top that are highly corrupt.
[03:56:44.980 --> 03:56:50.260]  And that's who we need to hold accountable to set an example for everybody else.
[03:56:50.260 --> 03:56:55.900]  We peasants, if we commit a crime, we go to prison, but if you're a higher up, you just
[03:56:55.900 --> 03:57:01.420]  walk off and continue to cash in and we're in and around Washington, D.C. and state capitals.
[03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:03.820]  And this is why this country's coming unglued.
[03:57:03.820 --> 03:57:07.620]  This is what we saw in the days leading up to the revolution, which caused the revolution.
[03:57:07.620 --> 03:57:13.220]  King George III and his yes men judges, rubber stamping, the illegal acts that he was issuing
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:15.780]  by eating against the colonies.
[03:57:15.780 --> 03:57:17.660]  We are in a second American rebel.
[03:57:17.660 --> 03:57:18.660]  Okay.
[03:57:18.660 --> 03:57:19.660]  Very good, Larry.
[03:57:19.660 --> 03:57:20.660]  We only got a few seconds left.
[03:57:20.660 --> 03:57:21.900]  I want to wrap it up.
[03:57:21.900 --> 03:57:24.100]  Thanks everybody for being here on Infowars.
[03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:27.380]  Don't forget to get the art of the insult, the Infowars store.
[03:57:27.380 --> 03:57:32.380]  Go check out Larry's website, FreedomWatchUSA.org and God bless Kanye West.
[03:57:32.380 --> 03:57:42.540]  We'll see you next time.
