[00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:06.634]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:17.980]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.241]  Coming to you from the United States of America.
[00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.503]  Founded to be the New Atlantis by the founders.
[00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.845]  Now occupied by globalist forces of Satanism.
[00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:30.266]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:36.014]  From the former great state of Texas, now deep in, occupied FEMA Region 6.
[00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:41.517]  We've got an amazing guest coming up.
[00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:43.739]  We'll introduce him in the next segment, just leave it at that.
[00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.059]  But here is the article.
[00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.000]  How good is my team?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.143]  Nico Acosta had this in here, printed within 60 seconds of me asking for it.
[00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:54.805]  They're like fast gun drawing in there.
[00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.986]  With whatever I talk about, they're just googling it and putting it on screen.
[00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:00.468]  I love doing that because that really freaks the globalist out.
[00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:03.571]  We can just constantly pull up whatever we're talking about instantly.
[00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:09.355]  I'll have like, you know, ABC News here or whatever over the years and I'll say, and this person called for world government and that person goes, no you didn't.
[00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:10.295]  In seconds we have it up.
[00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:11.036]  Oh, here it is.
[00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.137]  That's another world government than the one you're talking about.
[00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:17.200]  And then at dinner, the ABC News anchor goes, yeah, I know it's all bull.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.024]  We're just mercenaries.
[00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:23.285]  Why are you a mercenary?
[00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:25.966]  Why don't you go build your own thing and have your integrity?
[00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.968]  Don't trade your passion for glory.
[00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.535]  And then you'll rise to the top.
[00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:35.236]  And you won't even want the glory once you get it.
[00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:40.478]  Because you already had the honor, which is beyond glory.
[00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:42.999]  Glory will fade and pass away.
[00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.481]  Being honorable and the decisions you make lives on forever through other people.
[00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.183]  So that's why I'm not scared to die.
[00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:56.445]  Because my actions, my art, my ideas transcend, just like yours do.
[00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:58.806]  That's why the elite are scared of the free human spirit.
[00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:05.411]  A dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:08.173]  Empowered individuals is what the Pentagon says they're most worried about.
[00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:18.840]  Not violent people, but disruptors with disruptive technology, disruptive music, disruptive poetry, disruptive art, disruptive ideas.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.142]  These are not an elite.
[00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:25.105]  A real elite wants to see humanity's wings spread.
[00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:31.361]  No, they want us down in the cave while they soar in the sky.
[00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:32.843]  They're not even soaring in the sky.
[00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:39.254]  They instead perch, only flying a few dozen feet into the air, on the dead trees, looking at us down in the pit.
[00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:53.237]  And they go and toy with the humans who they've gouged their souls out, their eyes out, and they're just like Helen Keller stumbling around in the buzzards, hop around in victory like a cat playing with a half-dead mouse.
[00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:54.138]  Oh, aren't we great?
[00:02:54.138 --> 00:02:55.159]  Oh, aren't we powerful?
[00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.142]  You know, just, you're pathetic is what you are.
[00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:00.184]  You're pet demons.
[00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:04.918]  Wanted to add a genie to the front of that, but I didn't do it.
[00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.179]  But you are damned to hell.
[00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.341]  And that's not a curse, that's what you are.
[00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:10.462]  I'm not even judging you, I can just see you.
[00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:11.263]  Spiritually.
[00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:12.484]  You're already in hell.
[00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.045]  You haven't figured it out yet.
[00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.126]  You're already crawled in there.
[00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:20.049]  Your soul already dropped to the center of it.
[00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.471]  And now there's a reflection.
[00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:23.952]  A tunnel.
[00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:24.532]  A vortex.
[00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:33.269]  Smelly, giant, blubbering tick just begging to be kicked off a cliff forever and out of our universe!
[00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.729]  You'll be with yourselves down there!
[00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.090]  Now, let's continue.
[00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:50.915]  This is George Will, the arrogance, the hatred of the American people, the false bravado, the hubris, the aplomb.
[00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:54.676]  If Trump is nominated, the GOP must keep him out of the White House.
[00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:59.238]  And then he has three paragraphs before he drops the bomb.
[00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:21.448]  A convention's sovereign duty is to choose a plausible nominee who has a reasonable chance to win, not to passively affirm the will of a mere plurality of voters recorded episodically in a protracted process.
[00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:24.770]  He says there, we decide who can win, we decide
[00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.113]  As the party chiefs, as the oligarchy.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.641]  Oh, but there's an episode of people thinking they're voting and it's protracted and easy.
[00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.681]  Protracted!
[00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:38.442]  Episodic!
[00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:39.982]  I use big words.
[00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:49.184]  I'm George Will and I talk with a real straight monotone as if I'm an intellectual when I'm a fop, a fake, and I bet money on intelligence agency assets.
[00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:49.864]  Oh!
[00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:52.164]  You have your little badge, don't you, George Will?
[00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:53.404]  You're so important!
[00:04:53.404 --> 00:04:55.925]  You are a disease on this country and humanity filth!
[00:04:57.771 --> 00:05:01.393]  Does 2016 feel more like 1984 to you?
[00:05:01.393 --> 00:05:11.700]  Life is certainly imitating art, with Uber's announcement that its fleet of more than 1 million drivers will now be tracked, traced, and henpecked throughout every ride they provide.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.625]  This is the next step toward totalitarian control of transportation and the end of individual autonomy on our roads.
[00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:24.929]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the ride-sharing app has launched new and invasive technology called Telematics
[00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.912]  Which records drivers' behaviors behind the wheel.
[00:05:27.912 --> 00:05:37.101]  When a driver exceeds the speed limit, brakes abruptly, cuts corners, or sends a text while driving, Uber alerts the driver of their mistake in real time.
[00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:41.666]  In the future, drivers who receive low scores throughout their driving history may be penalized.
[00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:51.677]  In addition, negative driving data such as speeding could easily be sent to law enforcement to enhance the tactics they use to pilfer the public through draconian fines.
[00:05:51.677 --> 00:05:53.138]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:56.882]  Stay tuned for more special reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:57.763 --> 00:05:58.664]  Shower filters.
[00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:00.385]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:04.467]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:09.270]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.354]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:31.002]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:31.002 --> 00:06:39.246]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:39.246 --> 00:06:44.648]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:47.189]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.309]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:57.532 --> 00:07:05.719]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:06.520]  Here's why.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.684]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:11.605]  So please listen.
[00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:15.028]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:07:15.288 --> 00:07:21.670]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:28.973]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:31.314]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:38.677]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:42.879]  Of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.639]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.320]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.060]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.922]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[00:07:51.922 --> 00:07:53.482]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:54.843]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:07.820]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.807]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:16.610]  We're going to have a very special guest joining us in about 5-10 minutes, Matt Bracken.
[00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.132]  He'll be here until the end of the third hour, so almost two hours.
[00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:28.598]  We're going to have open phones, so you can ask this experienced Navy SEAL who works around the world what his view is on what's happening in the planet today.
[00:08:28.598 --> 00:08:33.182]  Very interesting perspective, great writer, great researcher, a lot of smart folks respect him.
[00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:34.863]  Matt Bracken was on with us for an hour last week.
[00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:36.804]  I want to get him on for almost two hours today.
[00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:39.226]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com, that's coming up.
[00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:40.827]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:51.879]  There are videos up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com that are so over the top, I mean, I can't even believe them, quite frankly.
[00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:55.102]  And what's even more surreal is most of them we shot.
[00:08:55.102 --> 00:09:00.227]  I mean, it is young children with their parents screaming the most horrible, nasty stuff you can imagine.
[00:09:01.283 --> 00:09:12.171]  It is people saying we're not criminals, and then attacking people, and attacking cars, and trying to run crowds over, and knocking people over, just frothing idiocy.
[00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:19.696]  And then members of the Citizen Press, they're just trying to document it, who weren't even Trump supporters, but just trying to see what's happening.
[00:09:19.696 --> 00:09:20.737]  They're attacked.
[00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:23.179]  And we got the interviews with the folks after they were attacked.
[00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:33.966]  So this is the bedlam that's going on and it's all just mindless tribal idiocy because the mainstream media told them.
[00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:39.344]  That Donald Trump, quote, hates all Mexicans or hates all blacks.
[00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:48.789]  No, Donald Trump said Mexico is collapsing into a narco-terrorist state with 100,000 dead, and that many of their criminals are coming up here, and that a culture of crime is forming all over the nation.
[00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:56.233]  But if you look at rap music and you look at the whole Tejano thing is morphed into like rap, and it's all glorifying the drug dealers and El Chapo,
[00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:02.225]  Let's be clear, El Chapo's been caught working with the CIA and is not a hero at all.
[00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:13.675]  I'm not for the drug culture, I'm for decriminalization, because having it illegal is what gives the banks $500 billion a year here in North America alone.
[00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:15.816]  $500 billion.
[00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:19.219]  And big banks get caught with hundreds of billions in them.
[00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:25.785]  Everything from Wachovia to Wells Fargo, oh, little Berkshire Hathaway over there, and nothing gets done.
[00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:42.246]  Or in the case of Berkshire Hathaway's banking division, Wells Fargo, and with Wachovia, it was $378 billion laundered over two years, and they paid, what was it, a $111 million fine.
[00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:46.526]  That's like you get caught robbing a bank for $3 million, you pay a $4,000 fine or something.
[00:10:46.526 --> 00:10:51.467]  This is the craziness that the system has set up and how dumb they think we are.
[00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:55.248]  And if you just joined us, I was reading an opinion piece in the Washington Post,
[00:10:56.294 --> 00:10:57.234]  By George Will.
[00:10:57.234 --> 00:11:00.395]  If Trump is nominated, the GOP must keep him out of the White House.
[00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:03.695]  And they say, just go ahead and just give it to Hillary.
[00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:08.897]  Then he goes on, quote, a convention's sovereign duty is to choose a plausible nominee.
[00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:12.077]  I hope the people voted for that.
[00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:13.857]  Who has a reasonable chance to win.
[00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:15.118]  Oh, you decide.
[00:11:15.118 --> 00:11:19.759]  Not to passively affirm the will of a mere plurality.
[00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.919]  The will of a mere
[00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:23.643]  We're good to go.
[00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:47.272]  And they said, but sir, it was lies.
[00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:48.894]  And he said, listen, we control reality.
[00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:50.315]  We're history's actors now.
[00:11:50.315 --> 00:11:52.877]  All you do is repeat what we say the new reality is.
[00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:55.239]  We may say the moon's made of cheese tomorrow.
[00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:56.660]  You're going to report that.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.801]  I control reality.
[00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:01.584]  You are a minion.
[00:12:01.584 --> 00:12:05.488]  And they were so scared of him, they wouldn't even say his name for three or four years in the press.
[00:12:07.369 --> 00:12:08.789]  That he was the one that told him that.
[00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:10.430]  He didn't even say it off record.
[00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:19.473]  He's just walking around with a martini, you know, walking around to the women and going... It's like Richard Perle was at some of those same cocktail parties, and I've seen it talked about in the press.
[00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:22.373]  He'd walk up to the best-looking female reporters.
[00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:26.455]  We're talking a 400-pound guy, huge black circles around his eyes.
[00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:28.895]  Looks like a penguin.
[00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:31.916]  And he'd walk over to women and go, I kill a lot of people.
[00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:33.417]  They call me the Prince of Darkness.
[00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:34.697]  I'm really powerful.
[00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:38.274]  And the women just go, ugh!
[00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:39.734]  Hey buddy, you're actually killing people?
[00:12:39.734 --> 00:12:41.174]  Women don't want to hear about it, okay?
[00:12:41.174 --> 00:12:45.056]  Do the killing over here and pet their puppies, that's what they like.
[00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:55.479]  But this just shows they're little boys, folks, that thinks he's gonna go over and pick women up by bragging that he's a killer and loves to kill people.
[00:12:55.479 --> 00:13:01.200]  But couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.121]  But don't worry, he's really good at killing people.
[00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:07.782]  You know, my nickname's the Prince of Darkness.
[00:13:07.782 --> 00:13:10.003]  Can we put a picture of Richard Perl up on the screen, please?
[00:13:10.003 --> 00:13:11.464]  The TV viewers?
[00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:13.225]  This is who infested D.C.
[00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.066]  This is who has taken this country over.
[00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:16.607]  This is who thinks we're a joke.
[00:13:16.607 --> 00:13:31.354]  So, they now go on TV, Priebus and Curly, Hughlin, and George Will, in their con games, and say, we don't go with the will of the people.
[00:13:31.354 --> 00:13:33.235]  Silly rabbit, voting's for kids.
[00:13:36.527 --> 00:13:40.128]  We don't need no badges, we don't need no stinking badges!
[00:13:40.128 --> 00:13:42.928]  And they've weaponized the culture.
[00:13:42.928 --> 00:13:57.411]  In fourth-fifth generation warfare, where they've so dumbed down the public across the board, that large swaths of humanity, if you watch the Social Justice Warrior videos, it's all of them.
[00:13:57.411 --> 00:14:05.092]  They just go, shut up, I'm intellectual, you're racist, they just virtue signal, and people actually lovingly talk to them.
[00:14:06.124 --> 00:14:20.038]  Like there was a video, we've got to cue that up and play that, about California and San Francisco, where this really smart guy, happens to be black and white, just a human, had to come out because he saw the previous videos of folks beating people up, and they just keep calling him racist.
[00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:24.984]  Just because he's there to cover what's happening, he's not even really a Trump supporter.
[00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:26.986]  But he has to support the free speech.
[00:14:28.962 --> 00:14:30.483]  This video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:14:30.483 --> 00:14:35.785]  It's very, very important because he just so eloquently crystallizes it even better than I could do.
[00:14:35.785 --> 00:14:37.066]  Here it is.
[00:14:37.066 --> 00:14:39.207]  So why are you out here today?
[00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:41.468]  You know, I am a Trump supporter.
[00:14:41.468 --> 00:14:57.675]  I don't know if I would vote for him, but I have to support what he's standing for because I've been seeing all this opposition coming from Bernie and Hillary supporters and sitting there talking about we're liberal, we're loving, we just want peace, yet they throw eggs at you and punch you in the mouth because they're peaceful and loving.
[00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.278]  I saw what went down in Southern California.
[00:15:01.278 --> 00:15:02.379]  It got to me.
[00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:05.582]  I had to come out here and actually talk about what's going on.
[00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:06.963]  These people don't want to talk to you.
[00:15:06.963 --> 00:15:08.044]  That's the problem.
[00:15:08.044 --> 00:15:11.667]  They sit there and say they don't have double standards and that they're not hypocritical.
[00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:15.831]  They'll come up to you and just yell and scream like you're just you're nobody.
[00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.412]  We hate you.
[00:15:16.412 --> 00:15:17.092]  You're racist.
[00:15:17.092 --> 00:15:18.914]  You're misogynist, homophobic.
[00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:20.235]  I have black friends.
[00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:21.136]  I have white friends.
[00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:22.497]  I have Mexican friends.
[00:15:22.497 --> 00:15:24.159]  And supposedly I'm a racist.
[00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:25.880]  Wow, that's crazy.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.960]  My family is black.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.461]  We're all mixed, okay?
[00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.182]  So, it has nothing to do with race.
[00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:35.846]  I think Trump is really just trying to get the sovereignty back in America when he's talking about the borders.
[00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:39.608]  Like, he's not saying, let's import all Muslims, let's import all Mexicans.
[00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:41.829]  He's talking about the drug pushers.
[00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:43.190]  He's talking about the criminals.
[00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.510]  He's talking about them.
[00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.752]  He's not talking about good people that are going to work every day and paying their bills.
[00:15:48.752 --> 00:15:54.133]  And there's just too many of these misconceptions generated by the hype of the mainstream media.
[00:15:54.133 --> 00:15:57.274]  And people just kind of buy into it because of the herd mentality.
[00:15:57.274 --> 00:16:01.315]  I really urge people to, you know, read Edward Bernays' book on propaganda.
[00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:03.116]  When I wrote and when I read that book,
[00:16:03.616 --> 00:16:04.536]  Blew my mind.
[00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:08.877]  Blew my freaking mind, man.
[00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:11.298]  That is the Bernie supporter, because they love you.
[00:16:11.298 --> 00:16:12.918]  That's love right there.
[00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:14.498]  You see that?
[00:16:14.498 --> 00:16:16.519]  I don't think he supports anyone.
[00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:19.860]  I think he just supports hate, but apparently I support hate.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.540]  But you read Edward Bernays' book on propaganda, it blows your mind.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.241]  It's like almost everything that's going on right now, he talked about it 100 years prior.
[00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:28.881]  It's crazy.
[00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:30.262]  He nailed it.
[00:16:30.262 --> 00:16:30.702]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:32.002 --> 00:16:33.803]  Did they find that guy over there, or what's going on?
[00:16:33.803 --> 00:16:36.845]  No, they managed to escape the bomb.
[00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:37.806]  So what was going on?
[00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:41.148]  The guy was, he threw eggs at a guy who was burning a flag?
[00:16:41.148 --> 00:16:48.992]  The kid that, they stole this kid's American flag and then burned it, and then hit the kid that had the flag with an egg.
[00:16:48.992 --> 00:16:52.134]  And so they were chasing the guy that threw the egg and stole the flag.
[00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:53.535]  It was the same person apparently.
[00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:55.876]  Alright, interesting.
[00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:59.158]  Interesting doings here at the Trump protest.
[00:16:59.158 --> 00:16:59.699]  I don't know if...
[00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:04.158]  I might go check into my hotel right now.
[00:17:04.158 --> 00:17:08.801]  I'm supposed to fly out at 5, so I don't even know if I'm going to check into the hotel.
[00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:15.987]  The name of the video is, there's more of it, that's just part of it, Black Trump supporter calls out racist provocateurs as propaganda victims.
[00:17:15.987 --> 00:17:27.155]  That's a great headline, but really it's Black Trump supporter exposes the idiocy of racist anti-Trump people.
[00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:29.197]  I don't know what you call it, it's just ridiculous.
[00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:34.964]  And then we've got this footage that just blows my mind.
[00:17:34.964 --> 00:17:45.771]  You know, used to when we were kids, I didn't do a lot of juvenile delinquent stuff, but a few times, I was like 13, I'd go with neighborhood kids and run around and smash pumpkins at midnight.
[00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:46.932]  And yes, we had a game.
[00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:47.913]  I only did it a few times.
[00:17:49.453 --> 00:17:56.060]  We throw eggs at police cars on Halloween so the cops would chase us for fun.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.962]  One of the cops caught us one time.
[00:17:57.962 --> 00:18:01.566]  He's like, you idiots, you know, go home.
[00:18:01.566 --> 00:18:05.190]  Anyways, the cop seemed like he actually thought it was kind of fun and it was a game.
[00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.311]  I'm lucky I didn't get shot, I guess.
[00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:09.783]  Yes, I've done dumb stuff like that.
[00:18:09.783 --> 00:18:11.664]  That's about the worst I did.
[00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:19.749]  We'd go paper cheerleaders, you know, I was like 11 or 12, you know, walk a mile to the cheerleaders house and throw toilet paper in the trees.
[00:18:19.749 --> 00:18:21.350]  I've done that stuff.
[00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.812]  But that's kind of what this is, but it's 2.0.
[00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:34.278]  Where just the media hypes it that a bunch of idiot teenagers and people just go out and act like total morons and then beat people up and attack police cars and burn things.
[00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:38.983]  And then it's mixed with a bunch of weaponized race stuff just to attack free speech.
[00:18:38.983 --> 00:18:40.545]  It's total garbage.
[00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:43.829]  And none of them have anything to say when you nicely ask them questions.
[00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:45.210]  It's very sad.
[00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.051]  All I know is this.
[00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:48.935]  The world economy is imploding.
[00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:50.817]  Engineered crisis is being put into high gear.
[00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:55.712]  We're going to be covering it in the next hour and 45 minutes with our guest.
[00:18:55.712 --> 00:18:58.654]  He would have been on already, but his computer totally died.
[00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:00.075]  His Skype totally crashed.
[00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:01.175]  His computer doesn't even work now.
[00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:04.598]  So he's going to be on the phone with us, so that's fine.
[00:19:04.598 --> 00:19:08.060]  This keeps happening to almost every guest, but I'm sure it's a coincidence.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.003]  So that is coming up with our guest, Matt Brackett, EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[00:19:13.003 --> 00:19:15.185]  He'll be with us to the end of the next hour.
[00:19:15.185 --> 00:19:16.546]  Open phones in the third hour.
[00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:21.109]  You can talk to the Navy SEAL, talk to a really smart writer, and ask your questions or make your points.
[00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:34.776]  We're going to talk about all these defaults with these different countries in Puerto Rico and different cities and the pension funds getting raided and how this is all cascading and how the government knows this is coming and other governments do but they're trying to keep it quiet while they dig in.
[00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.937]  So, we're here raising the alarm.
[00:19:36.937 --> 00:19:39.358]  We hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:42.980]  As George Washington said, don't be involved in foreign entanglements.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.843]  But at the same time, to secure peace you must be prepared for war.
[00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:50.545]  You must be war ready.
[00:19:50.545 --> 00:19:52.006]  That turns the enemy like nothing else.
[00:19:52.006 --> 00:19:57.871]  We need to be ready, prepared, involved, and informing to affect the battle space.

[00:20:57.407 --> 00:21:05.574]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:06.375]  Here's why.
[00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:10.518]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:11.439]  So please listen.
[00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:15.122]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:21.487]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:21:21.487 --> 00:21:25.551]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:28.752]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:21:28.752 --> 00:21:31.073]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.

[00:23:26.937 --> 00:23:31.961]  I was taught that if you're wicked, you go to hell and suffer eternal fiery torment forever and ever.
[00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:33.843]  Is that what the Bible really says?
[00:23:33.843 --> 00:23:37.206]  What if you found out that nobody's burning in hell right now?
[00:23:37.206 --> 00:23:38.887]  We built a website for the curious.
[00:23:38.887 --> 00:23:41.269]  It's called thebiblesaysthat.org.
[00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:44.232]  What you've been taught might not actually be in the Bible.
[00:23:44.232 --> 00:23:51.598]  Thebiblesaysthat.org dismantles misguided religious doctrines and helps you find your own way, your own answers straight from the Bible.
[00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:54.740]  Find out what's hot and what's not at thebiblesaysthat.org.
[00:24:19.105 --> 00:24:22.627]  Matt Bracken is our guest for the next hour and 40 minutes or so.
[00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:26.270]  We're going to be up with the phones up in the second hour with him.
[00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.971]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com is his site.
[00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:31.413]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's a former Navy SEAL.
[00:24:31.413 --> 00:24:32.714]  He works around the world.
[00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:33.555]  He's an author.
[00:24:34.575 --> 00:24:39.878]  And of course he also writes a lot of current articles on what's happening in the world.
[00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:46.382]  We had him on last week about the radical jihadist element and why would Europe bring five million of them in the last three years.
[00:24:46.382 --> 00:24:47.462]  Hundreds of thousands here.
[00:24:47.462 --> 00:24:49.924]  The numbers are much bigger than they're saying.
[00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:53.606]  They claim that 400 or so have been brought in the last year to Texas.
[00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:56.968]  It's thousands in the high schools alone.
[00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:02.192]  232 in the last year to Anderson High, my alma mater.
[00:25:02.192 --> 00:25:03.673]  That's in the newspaper.
[00:25:03.673 --> 00:25:05.615]  They don't even hide this stuff.
[00:25:05.615 --> 00:25:16.884]  And so why would they be telling us it's 400 for the whole state, or 500 now, and then I've called the high schools and it's 200 here, 300 there, 100 here, and that's not counting the elementary schools.
[00:25:16.884 --> 00:25:19.926]  And the schools are saying, we need interpreters, we're in a crisis, and what's the real number?
[00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:20.507]  I don't know.
[00:25:20.507 --> 00:25:25.891]  There's articles in mainstream news that planes land at Air Force bases and they just give them IDs and they're just there.
[00:25:27.341 --> 00:25:42.345]  Again, how does this all feed into all these big protectorates, like Puerto Rico, going completely bankrupt and defaulting, and now major, from California to Michigan, major municipalities just looting the pension funds.
[00:25:42.345 --> 00:25:48.966]  And the dot-com bubble, part two, about to bust, according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:53.908]  And the Royal Bank of Scotland saying, sell everything, sell everything.
[00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:55.468]  That was the headline a month ago, two months ago.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.242]  Something big is going on.
[00:25:58.242 --> 00:26:00.765]  I hope it can be averted or we can have a soft landing.
[00:26:00.765 --> 00:26:07.171]  But it's gone from possibility, in my view, to probability that all hell is breaking loose in the next six months to a year.
[00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:09.594]  And you see politically the crisis that's going on.
[00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:16.151]  There are a lot of forces behind the scenes that don't encourage Donald Trump to run and, quote, save America.
[00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:17.171]  He knows about the globalists.
[00:26:17.171 --> 00:26:19.012]  He knows about all the stuff that's happening.
[00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:21.252]  Now, is this a double-cross by some other crime group?
[00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:22.373]  I don't know.
[00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:24.974]  I'm just telling you the system is freaking out about Donald Trump.
[00:26:24.974 --> 00:26:28.215]  So I want to cover the waterfront and what we have left in this hour.
[00:26:28.215 --> 00:26:31.196]  This is a short segment so you can just intro what he wants to cover with Matt Bracken.
[00:26:32.645 --> 00:26:44.449]  And how all this ties together and how he sees different scenarios unfolding as they militarize and activate the social justice warrior zombies and as they roll out the economic warfare.
[00:26:44.449 --> 00:26:47.010]  So Matt Bracken, glad we got your Skype back up, my friend.
[00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.551]  Great having you on last week.
[00:26:48.551 --> 00:26:49.931]  We got four minutes to break.
[00:26:49.931 --> 00:26:52.532]  What's your summation of what you're gonna be breaking down today?
[00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:57.854]  Yeah, that's a great way to come on to the show is seeing the blue screen of death.
[00:26:57.854 --> 00:26:58.154]  Absolutely.
[00:26:58.154 --> 00:27:00.475]  People are saying, what's taking you so long?
[00:27:02.713 --> 00:27:05.415]  Right as I'm booting up Skype, get the blue screen.
[00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:13.920]  Anyway, at the end of last hour, which is kind of funny because I just lost track of time, it was at my end, the cutoff.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.982]  No conspiracy that I know of, but I wouldn't be surprised on the other hand.
[00:27:16.982 --> 00:27:24.987]  I was talking about tsunamis, and the waves are coming, the earthquake has already happened way out at sea.
[00:27:25.914 --> 00:27:28.316]  And I went back and I looked up this story from 2004.
[00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:32.760]  There was a 10-year-old English girl named Tilly Smith.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.503]  If you Google it or YouTube it, you'll find the whole thing.
[00:27:36.503 --> 00:27:42.228]  And she had just taken a class a month before and it explained about earthquakes and tsunamis.
[00:27:42.228 --> 00:27:47.113]  And she was watching the tide rolling out at a beach in Thailand with her parents.
[00:27:47.113 --> 00:27:48.094]  They're intelligent people.
[00:27:48.094 --> 00:27:48.774]  They're grown-ups.
[00:27:48.774 --> 00:27:49.575]  They flew her there.
[00:27:50.365 --> 00:27:53.929]  And she's telling them, Mom, Dad, this means a tsunami is coming.
[00:27:53.929 --> 00:27:54.870]  We have got to go.
[00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:00.617]  It took this girl 10 minutes to convince her intelligent parents to go back to the hotel.
[00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:06.945]  They told staff a Japanese tourist overheard the word tsunami and said, yes, I think it's tsunami.
[00:28:06.945 --> 00:28:10.449]  And that's when the staff finally at that one place started warning everybody.
[00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:15.099]  But we know that hundreds of thousands died because nobody knew.
[00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:21.201]  Well, a tsunami, an economic tsunami, hasn't hit us in several generations.
[00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:25.121]  Going back, say, to the 1930s Great Depression.
[00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:27.242]  Well, we're watching the water going out.
[00:28:27.242 --> 00:28:35.244]  We're seeing these precursors and we have to be the intelligent English girl and not the dumb parents that are going, what's that mean?
[00:28:35.244 --> 00:28:36.544]  The water's going out.
[00:28:36.544 --> 00:28:38.645]  Let's go down and take a look at the beached boats.
[00:28:40.191 --> 00:28:43.913]  You would think that intelligent people would understand something so simple.
[00:28:43.913 --> 00:28:50.177]  So it's not a surprise completely that the intelligent adults in the room are all saying things are fine.
[00:28:50.177 --> 00:28:52.078]  There can't be an economic crash.
[00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:56.541]  There are great minds in charge of all of this and we'll just muddle through.
[00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:58.062]  This time we're not muddling through.
[00:28:58.062 --> 00:29:02.965]  The tsunami waves are already on the way and it's time to head for the high ground.
[00:29:02.965 --> 00:29:04.706]  We're going to break down
[00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:10.455]  Why you see these different factors coming together, I guess, in a perfect storm.
[00:29:10.455 --> 00:29:13.897]  The establishment admits now they're digging in.
[00:29:13.897 --> 00:29:21.901]  While weaponizing culture even more, like having us fight with each other is going to help during a crisis, I really think this elite is pretty insane overall.
[00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:23.161]  Matt Bracken is our guest.
[00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.082]  We're going to come right back.
[00:29:24.602 --> 00:29:27.242]  And kind of give him the floor to break all this down.
[00:29:27.242 --> 00:29:31.983]  And then get your questions and comments ready for the third hour coming up.
[00:29:31.983 --> 00:29:38.824]  We'll also intersperse a lot of the breaking news with him and get his take on what he thinks the different factions are inside this new world order.
[00:29:38.824 --> 00:29:39.945]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.985]  Infowars.com is the new site.
[00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:47.166]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:48.566]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.566 --> 00:29:51.106]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:53.787]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:57.884 --> 00:30:06.667]  The article titled, Revolution, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips, A Grim Vision of the Future, is based on a 30-year future cast completed by the British Ministry of Defense team back in 2007.
[00:30:06.667 --> 00:30:15.550]  The goal of the report was to create a future strategic context of obstacles and events and to create an analysis of key risks and shocks that would face the British military.
[00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:23.452]  The fall of the mainstream media and the rise of the internet-enabled citizen journalists are predicted in the report, as well as neutron bombs and brain chip mobilized flash mobs.
[00:30:23.652 --> 00:30:32.844]  The report even predicted the politically correct invasion of triggerly puffed social justice warriors whose ranks would be filled by the socialist spewing spoiled children of a once prosperous middle class.
[00:30:32.844 --> 00:30:39.052]  Finally, compact, increasingly cramped cities and booming third world populations would lead to increased migration, massive food riots,
[00:30:39.292 --> 00:30:44.417]  And spread of the radical political Islamic concept of Ummah, which is the global Islamic community.
[00:30:44.417 --> 00:30:48.682]  Food riots are now cropping up across the world in places like Venezuela and Greece.
[00:30:48.682 --> 00:30:50.764]  Are you prepared for widespread food riots?
[00:30:50.764 --> 00:30:55.048]  Go to InfoWars.com and stock up on InfoWars Select storable foods right now.
[00:30:55.048 --> 00:30:56.610]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.331]  Rob Dew reporting.
[00:30:57.691 --> 00:30:58.191]  Not a group.
[00:30:58.191 --> 00:30:59.632]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:30:59.632 --> 00:31:00.953]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:31:00.953 --> 00:31:02.173]  Why is this so good?
[00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:07.456]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:31:07.456 --> 00:31:21.003]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:31:21.003 --> 00:31:22.364]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:24.786]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:31:24.786 --> 00:31:27.310]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.652]  These are all parasites.
[00:31:28.652 --> 00:31:29.753]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:31:29.753 --> 00:31:31.095]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:35.601]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:31:35.601 --> 00:31:38.765]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:31:38.885 --> 00:31:41.928]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:31:41.928 --> 00:31:42.989]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:44.910]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.951]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:48.653]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:51.916]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.

[00:31:54.158 --> 00:31:56.120]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:59.190]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.670]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.871]  But where do you get it?

[00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:21.061]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:21.061 --> 00:33:32.632]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.632 --> 00:33:34.154]  We are here trying to scare you.
[00:33:36.212 --> 00:34:02.730]  I try to get myself concerned because I just get so comfortable living with this tyranny and watching all the signs and Europe arresting people that criticize open borders and all the tyranny going on, all the surveillance and the government opening the borders but tracking citizens and the TSA and just all the countless things that are going on and derivatives bigger than they were in 2008 and big megabanks saying get ready for more bailouts and NATO moving troops in on the Russian border.
[00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.391]  I mean, I'm gonna go over all this with our guest today.
[00:34:04.391 --> 00:34:06.032]  It is just over the top what's happened.
[00:34:06.893 --> 00:34:12.978]  The defaults, the economic bubble, we're sitting on the biggest the world's ever seen.
[00:34:12.978 --> 00:34:15.741]  So I'm trying to get myself concerned.
[00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:18.083]  I'm trying to get myself ready.
[00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:20.665]  And again, I hope we're wrong.
[00:34:20.665 --> 00:34:22.727]  I hope things just magically turn out better.
[00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:25.830]  But I think things run from bad to worse.
[00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.912]  And we'll talk about the bad to the worse with our guest.
[00:34:27.912 --> 00:34:29.253]  We're going to him in one moment.
[00:34:30.245 --> 00:34:33.028]  Speaking of this, I personally have been getting prepared.
[00:34:33.028 --> 00:34:35.650]  So I said, I want to really push preparedness, which I've always been doing.
[00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:40.575]  This is going to be prepared for earthquakes, whatever happens, you know, economic problems, or you lose your job, or whatever.
[00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:42.176]  Storable food is one of the most important things.
[00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:49.643]  In the last 25 years, the folks at MyPatriotSupply, Power, InfoWare Select, we're running a special that's got to end very, very soon.
[00:34:49.643 --> 00:34:51.044]  I've extended it 30% to 40% off.
[00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:54.327]  R to the lowest prices at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:34:55.307 --> 00:34:58.448]  We've also got 10% off all other preparedness items.
[00:34:58.448 --> 00:35:04.069]  The little car charger batteries we've got, the most high-tech, most affordable out there.
[00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:14.750]  The G-Shock watches, the water filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, strategic relocation, the book and the film, solar-powered and cranked shortwave radios, very inexpensive already.
[00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:21.171]  10% off all preparedness items, including all the nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:22.412]  We decided to do that last hour.
[00:35:22.412 --> 00:35:23.692]  We're going to run this for a week.
[00:35:24.412 --> 00:35:27.734]  Because I'm going to have to end the food very, very soon, but 10% off everything else.

[00:35:39.423 --> 00:35:50.331]  And the biggest thing is, firearms, knowing how to use them, having a safety plan, having friends and family you can count on, water filtration, food, things like that.
[00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:54.836]  And quite frankly, not living in a mega city like a New Yorker in LA.
[00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:57.537]  I mean, that is so freaking dangerous, folks.
[00:35:57.537 --> 00:36:07.040]  I mean, I'm telling you, I live in a big city too, but I live in a globalist protected city that they've got admitted management plans during all sorts of collapse to leave the power on here.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.841]  But I don't even trust that.
[00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:10.421]  And look, I hope that isn't the case.
[00:36:10.421 --> 00:36:11.782]  I want to be clear.
[00:36:11.782 --> 00:36:12.782]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:13.888 --> 00:36:15.809]  By the way, I want to get our guest on sometime.
[00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:16.730]  I want to carry his books.
[00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.471]  I've told the crew, I think we're setting that up.
[00:36:18.471 --> 00:36:27.697]  He's written a bunch of books, you know, breaking down different globalist scenarios that really get you inside the mind of how they would carry something like that out.
[00:36:27.697 --> 00:36:34.781]  Again, our guest is former Navy SEAL, author, researcher, highly respected by a lot of great people who recommended him on the show.
[00:36:34.781 --> 00:36:38.163]  We really clicked when he was on enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:38.644]  Okay, Matt.
[00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:43.888]  I'm going to try to shut up for the next 14 minutes or so before break, give you the floor.
[00:36:43.888 --> 00:36:54.976]  You were saying that, I mean, the great story that's on record where the little girl says, hey, when the water goes way out, then we know that a tsunami is going to happen.
[00:36:54.976 --> 00:36:57.658]  And they listened finally, but it took them 10 minutes.
[00:36:57.658 --> 00:37:00.120]  They almost didn't make it.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:06.645]  I remember whatever year it was, Galveston got hit by a 20 foot wall of water.
[00:37:06.645 --> 00:37:07.526]  And they always thought it was a
[00:37:09.935 --> 00:37:12.016]  I think that right now the waves are already coming.
[00:37:12.016 --> 00:37:13.276]  And if you can picture a big dyke system like, um,
[00:37:31.824 --> 00:37:40.627]  New Orleans or London, they have a big system of dikes and berms going around that risky part of English territory.
[00:37:40.627 --> 00:37:52.670]  If they're made to have the capability, for example, of stopping, say, a 200-year North Sea storm, like a perfect storm bringing giant waves down from the North Sea and high tides,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.986]  But what happens if there's another earthquake coming from another direction and you're getting two waves?
[00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:06.450]  I think that's what's going to happen this fall, winter, definitely 2017.
[00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:12.595]  We're going to see a convergence of these waves that's going to overtop all of our defenses at the end of
[00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:18.320]  All of these scenarios as one byproduct is a grid down situation.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:27.446]  Once our cities don't have their electronic oxygen, their electrical oxygen, there will be a big bottleneck event, population correction.
[00:38:27.446 --> 00:38:29.247]  Cities just can't survive that way.
[00:38:29.247 --> 00:38:32.208]  I mean, they can't survive without power.
[00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:33.049]  They can't.
[00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:35.651]  We didn't consider this a century ago.
[00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:36.731]  Power was meaningless.
[00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:40.153]  People had iceboxes and Iceman brought a block of ice.
[00:38:40.153 --> 00:38:42.855]  And if you didn't have it, you ate more canned food.
[00:38:43.812 --> 00:38:58.260]  Today, our economy can't work, hospitals become death traps, and the goblins that are already out in the street, you know, ready to throw punches, you know, racist mobster hordes are already out in the street.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.142]  And this is when they're fat, they've got full bellies, their EBT card is working.
[00:39:03.142 --> 00:39:07.225]  How are they going to act when the EBT cards are not working?
[00:39:07.225 --> 00:39:09.806]  I think we don't need to be geniuses to see that this is
[00:39:10.783 --> 00:39:20.329]  Similar to watching the tide going out and knowing the tsunami's coming on the on the rebound, you know, I Before I go on each time.
[00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:21.290]  I'm introduced.
[00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:33.417]  It's always sounds like you know, Navy SEAL is what Matt Bracken is and I and it's almost to me it makes kind of causes me a little bit of pain and I kind of like a I'm not a combat veteran.
[00:39:33.417 --> 00:39:34.518]  I was in Lebanon and
[00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:37.391]  You know, we were ready to go and do anything, anywhere.
[00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:39.313]  And it was a dangerous job, even in training.
[00:39:39.313 --> 00:39:41.956]  Helicopters crash, people get shot.
[00:39:41.956 --> 00:39:43.318]  Even in peacetime, we're in training.
[00:39:43.318 --> 00:39:49.385]  But the guys that have been in the teams since 9-11, people need to understand something.
[00:39:50.285 --> 00:40:04.376]  Very few Americans are in the military anymore, but in the special ops community, it's been like World War III followed by World War IV, followed by World War V. There are guys that have spent years and years of their lives in horrible places fighting for this country.
[00:40:04.376 --> 00:40:08.640]  I don't like being introduced as Navy SEAL Matt Bracken is.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:15.785]  Sure, and that is on record that they've engaged in more combat, I mean sometimes dozens of raids a day, than anyone ever even thought about.
[00:40:15.785 --> 00:40:17.507]  The level of stress is just over the top.
[00:40:18.007 --> 00:40:22.529]  And it's the same guys that it really it tears up the families.
[00:40:22.529 --> 00:40:24.110]  People would like to go for 20 years.
[00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.550]  I did not.
[00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:29.813]  I was just paying for my naval ROTC scholarship and having fun in the teams.
[00:40:29.813 --> 00:40:33.395]  I never planned to be a I just wanted to be a shooter and an operator.
[00:40:33.395 --> 00:40:35.916]  I didn't want to become a staff officer.
[00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:38.577]  So, you know, after Beirut, that was going to be my future.
[00:40:38.577 --> 00:40:40.938]  So I got out and did the boats and other things.
[00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:41.079]  But
[00:40:42.725 --> 00:40:52.235]  I want to really, at all times, anytime I'm introduced as a Navy SEAL, I want to say, look, I was a glorified... Sure, the point is you're a smart rider and you've got a really clear perspective and a lot of smart people respect what you're saying.
[00:40:52.235 --> 00:40:53.056]  So let's get into the facts.
[00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:53.896]  Let's get into the facts.
[00:40:53.896 --> 00:40:54.057]  Right.
[00:40:54.801 --> 00:41:06.008]  Anyway, yeah, there's no avoiding what's happening now, and some of the clues that this is going to be a big, huge year are that they're not even hiding the conspiracy anymore.
[00:41:06.008 --> 00:41:18.156]  If you went back 10 years or 20 years, as soon as anybody on any, say, talk radio show, or much less network television, God forbid it would never happen, anybody ever mentions things like Bilderberg
[00:41:19.238 --> 00:41:26.286]  They immediately go into, ah, black helicopter, whoa, conspiracy, conspiracy.
[00:41:26.286 --> 00:41:28.047]  That's the way of just disregarding it.
[00:41:28.047 --> 00:41:29.369]  Now they're not hiding it.
[00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:32.012]  Now Davos and Bilderberg are just part of the news.
[00:41:32.012 --> 00:41:34.895]  Like, of course CNN is at Davos.
[00:41:34.895 --> 00:41:35.836]  Why wouldn't they be?
[00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:37.798]  We are always at Davos.
[00:41:37.798 --> 00:41:39.259]  Now they're giving it credibility.
[00:41:39.259 --> 00:41:40.380]  Well, who are these guys?
[00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:46.493]  I'm not saying it's like the same secret society with the same secret society handshake.
[00:41:46.493 --> 00:41:48.974]  It morphs, it changes, there's a lot of overlap.
[00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:52.696]  You know, there's Bilderberg, there's CFR, Trilateral Commission.
[00:41:52.696 --> 00:41:54.537]  I always get a good chuckle in the morning.
[00:41:54.537 --> 00:42:00.741]  I like to watch Morning Joe on MSNBC and there's Mika Brzezinski.
[00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.263]  Look up Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Trilateral Commission.
[00:42:04.263 --> 00:42:07.485]  I mean, folks, it's just staring us in the face.
[00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:12.918]  And in July, they're going to meet in Dresden, the Bilderberg Group.
[00:42:12.918 --> 00:42:16.039]  And I have to think this is going to be like an emergency meeting.
[00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:27.422]  And I wonder if it'll have to be relocated somewhere else, because by July, Dresden might not be a safe place for the Gulf Streams and the Falkwolves or the Falkers to fly in.
[00:42:27.422 --> 00:42:29.483]  These guys are trackable.
[00:42:29.483 --> 00:42:31.564]  Now they're coming out of the closet a little bit.
[00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:33.604]  They're showing their hand.
[00:42:33.604 --> 00:42:36.065]  Look at all the presidents that visit Bilderberg.
[00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.811]  That's sort of where you'd get the secret handshake.
[00:42:39.811 --> 00:42:44.752]  That's where they see if you're going to be a team player, a willing stooge, a patsy.
[00:42:44.752 --> 00:42:47.572]  Bill Clinton comes to mind, along with many others.
[00:42:47.572 --> 00:42:59.775]  That's where the elite of the elite, the super elite, that's where the super elite meet to see who they can trust to be their political front men and stooges.
[00:42:59.775 --> 00:43:03.656]  Whether it's the European Union, national governments, America,
[00:43:05.043 --> 00:43:14.669]  Nobody, I wouldn't say nobody, but most of the people that are even in the pool of electability are already approved by the super elites.
[00:43:14.669 --> 00:43:16.830]  It's what you're saying about George Will.
[00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.491]  I mean, obviously he's part of the club.
[00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:21.673]  He's part of that DC super establishment.
[00:43:21.673 --> 00:43:28.037]  He's a trusted, proven, reliable journalist in the Soviet meaning of the word.
[00:43:28.037 --> 00:43:29.918]  You know, he's a team player.
[00:43:29.918 --> 00:43:31.559]  He won't rock the boat.
[00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:33.941]  What the super elites hate more than anything
[00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:36.297]  is a loose cannon.
[00:43:36.297 --> 00:43:38.979]  Somebody who goes off script.
[00:43:38.979 --> 00:43:42.962]  Somebody who can get a mass audience, below InfoWars.
[00:43:42.962 --> 00:43:47.184]  You know, this is something wonderful you've been doing for years and years.
[00:43:47.184 --> 00:43:51.467]  You can be belittled, you know, you can be called whatever, a conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:58.012]  But it's pretty funny now, they go and cover Davos and Bilderberg, and you know, there's an InfoWars reporter.
[00:43:58.012 --> 00:44:01.234]  Now it's suddenly not quite as conspiracy.
[00:44:01.234 --> 00:44:03.135]  Now it's just reality.
[00:44:03.135 --> 00:44:04.036]  And I think that
[00:44:05.191 --> 00:44:13.118]  This, this summer, if Europe is not in full all out, you know, Islamic versus European civil war, I'll be happy.
[00:44:13.118 --> 00:44:15.319]  I mean, I don't want to be right about these things.
[00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.641]  I'd love to be wrong about these things.
[00:44:17.641 --> 00:44:21.645]  But I wonder if Bilderberg is going to be able to even take place.
[00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:23.546]  Similar to Cleveland.
[00:44:23.546 --> 00:44:31.393]  This, if you look at this in California, what they're doing just at Trump rallies, imagine what a big purple bug light Cleveland is going to be.
[00:44:32.873 --> 00:44:35.640]  It's gonna bring the black block, you know, out of the woodwork.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.424]  And these guys don't live under bridges.
[00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:38.587]  They're paid.
[00:44:38.587 --> 00:44:40.672]  They all belong to committees of, you know...
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.861]  Political action, non-governmental.
[00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:49.184]  Yeah, you're talking about the so-called anarchists that are actually malice youth brigades funded by the major foundations.
[00:44:49.184 --> 00:44:50.085]  Totally funded.
[00:44:50.085 --> 00:45:03.232]  And the money is, you know, if there was honest journalism going on, they'd be very interested to see, you know, who's printing the signs and who's paying for the hotel rooms for these, you know, supposedly philanthropic
[00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:05.674]  You know, protesters.
[00:45:05.674 --> 00:45:09.877]  These are actually BlackBlock and Aslan, the Mecha people.
[00:45:09.877 --> 00:45:11.778]  Those are the ones out in California.
[00:45:11.778 --> 00:45:15.481]  I don't know if people are familiar with Mecha.
[00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:23.907]  It stands for the student, the Chicano student movement, basically, in the Spanish spelling of it.
[00:45:23.907 --> 00:45:31.513]  But it's the same phonetic or homonym for a Mecha, which is a match or fuse in Spanish.
[00:45:31.513 --> 00:45:33.034]  The logo of Mecha
[00:45:33.803 --> 00:45:37.705]  is a warbird holding a lit dynamite fuse.
[00:45:37.705 --> 00:45:40.647]  That's Metch's logo.
[00:45:40.647 --> 00:45:44.790]  Now, it's been around since the 70s, this Chicano radical group.
[00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.791]  Look up the plan of Asplan.
[00:45:47.768 --> 00:45:48.728]  We're in it now!
[00:45:48.728 --> 00:45:52.670]  This is a destabilization process that they're rolling out.
[00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.611]  This is the out-of-order chaos.
[00:45:54.611 --> 00:45:56.392]  Now they're creating the chaos.
[00:45:56.392 --> 00:46:08.457]  Just like they bring in radical Muslims in Europe, it's radical folks who are brought in here, and then once they get to the universities, they're absolutely there with all their white professors who are the communist operatives, admittedly, with money and everything, saying, yes, yes, do this.
[00:46:08.937 --> 00:46:22.392]  It is such a sickening plan, but you mentioned last week this, it's in the news today, I'll dig the article out, mainstream news, Europe preparing for civil emergency, experts call it martial law, and they're preparing to suppress political speech in the next six months.
[00:46:22.392 --> 00:46:26.496]  So, Europe is going under official martial law, civil emergency already.
[00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:27.416]  It doesn't matter.
[00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:39.519]  Their plan is, when the tiger breaks out of the zoo, we're going to jump on the tiger's back, put a bridle in its mouth, and then ride it back into the zoo and lock it back in.
[00:46:39.519 --> 00:46:40.759]  Good luck with that.
[00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:41.900]  They don't have the bench.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.680]  They don't have the troops.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.461]  Belgium was completely overwhelmed by what happened on one day.
[00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:48.841]  They had no bench.
[00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:50.182]  They've got nothing.
[00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:51.202]  There's no reserves.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:47:02.389]  If there's a Beslan, a Bataclan, and a Brussels happening every day or week somewhere in Europe, the economy freezes.
[00:47:02.389 --> 00:47:12.377]  You can't just stay in these European cities, even if the water is still running at that time, and live everybody just in their tower blocks.
[00:47:12.377 --> 00:47:13.377]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:47:14.963 --> 00:47:19.907]  That's what's going to happen because the economy is... nobody will be able to take a train or a subway.
[00:47:19.907 --> 00:47:20.107]  Sure, Matt.
[00:47:20.107 --> 00:47:21.328]  And that's how they get to work.
[00:47:21.328 --> 00:47:23.130]  Matt, let me throw this at you.
[00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:25.251]  The elites you mentioned are very OCD.
[00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:26.352]  They're control freaks.
[00:47:26.352 --> 00:47:28.034]  That's admitted.
[00:47:28.034 --> 00:47:29.395]  They have a large plan.
[00:47:29.395 --> 00:47:32.397]  They admit this is part of their destabilization plan.
[00:47:32.397 --> 00:47:38.582]  They think out of this chaos they'll get a diversion from their looting and what they're doing and use the crisis for more control.
[00:47:38.582 --> 00:47:39.383]  Order out of chaos.
[00:47:39.383 --> 00:47:40.324]  Order out of chaos.
[00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.945]  But here's my question.
[00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:42.946]  Here's my question to you.
[00:47:44.363 --> 00:47:48.166]  Do you think they're then engineering this, or are they unconscious of it, or are they delusional?
[00:47:48.166 --> 00:47:56.313]  Because if they want order, why are they bringing in tsunami-level crises, or opening the door for it, that I don't think they're going to survive?
[00:47:56.313 --> 00:48:05.400]  I think that the way that they look at it, imagine if at the point in The Wizard of Oz, when they see him behind the curtain, and they go pull the curtain back, alright?
[00:48:06.352 --> 00:48:09.994]  Um, that's the super elite, that's Oz, the great and powerful.
[00:48:09.994 --> 00:48:26.364]  Well, Oz has a contingency, you know, the great and powerful Oz has a contingency plan for when Dorothy and the Tin Man and the Lion get there, which is they have, you know, flash bangs go off, the whole theater burns down, and Oz gets away in a Porsche, you know, with his gold.
[00:48:27.382 --> 00:48:30.183]  They're similar the way I think of it.
[00:48:30.183 --> 00:48:44.928]  If you're on an airplane and it has like an engine go out and there's an explosion in the wing and you're leaking fuel, the flight crew is on the phone or on the intercom telling the passengers, don't worry folks, we're going to make it all the way to the Canary Islands.
[00:48:44.928 --> 00:48:46.369]  We're not going to run out of fuel.
[00:48:46.369 --> 00:48:48.850]  And they know damn well they are running out of fuel.
[00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:50.950]  So they chew everybody out of first class.
[00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.251]  They're all putting on parachutes.
[00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:58.836]  But on the intercom, they're saying, don't worry folks, remain calm, remain in your seats, because there's only about 10 paratroopers.
[00:48:58.836 --> 00:49:00.577]  Just like the Titanic?
[00:49:00.577 --> 00:49:06.341]  The Titanic, or the Korean ship full of student researchers.
[00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:14.607]  As it was capsizing, as the officers and the crew are getting in the lifeboats, on the intercom, they're saying, everything's fine.
[00:49:14.607 --> 00:49:17.830]  The same thing happened with the big cruise ship, remember?
[00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.231]  The cruise ship in Greece.
[00:49:20.722 --> 00:49:21.703]  Go back to your room.
[00:49:21.703 --> 00:49:23.124]  Everything's fine.
[00:49:23.124 --> 00:49:34.911]  They never say, buddy, you better be running for the top right now, because they don't want to be swarmed like a, you know, a crush of people getting into the one lifeboat.
[00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:44.737]  But the plan, as far as that goes, I don't think that they meet and discuss it in these terms, but a lot of people have the feeling, a lot of these, you know, the Davos Bilderberg crowd
[00:49:45.433 --> 00:49:49.496]  What they're planning for is to emerge on the other side of the big emergency.
[00:49:49.496 --> 00:49:57.041]  Yeah, I wrote about this in my essay, Burning Down the House in 2016.
[00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:07.909]  If they are going to have a world war, which will wipe out all the bad debt, essentially what's happened is, you know, if you understand algorithms, it's gone vertical.
[00:50:08.516 --> 00:50:10.817]  There's no more level of debt.
[00:50:10.817 --> 00:50:14.258]  We're at the end of Keynesian economics.
[00:50:14.258 --> 00:50:14.798]  The end.
[00:50:14.798 --> 00:50:16.638]  The holiday's over.
[00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:17.859]  We've hit the vertical wall.
[00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:18.879]  We can't invent it.
[00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:26.781]  We've got zero interest, which means shoveling money to Wall Street, hoping to... But this is like hitting Frankenstein with the paddles.
[00:50:26.781 --> 00:50:29.502]  Come on, Frankenstein, you know, he's not dead.
[00:50:29.502 --> 00:50:30.982]  Look, Frankenstein's not dead.
[00:50:30.982 --> 00:50:36.524]  But if anybody thinks that the actual economy is going to get up and start moving again, they're completely dreaming.
[00:50:36.544 --> 00:50:41.889]  That's right, there's flies all over Frankenstein, he stinks, arms are falling off, and they're just saying, look, he's never looked better.
[00:50:41.889 --> 00:50:45.872]  Obama said the economy's never been better, and it's like Frankenstein's head falls off.
[00:50:45.872 --> 00:50:55.681]  We'll be back with our guests straight ahead to get more into this, because they admit, I have the stacks of articles here, mass immigrant waves are just intensifying everywhere as the third world sinks.
[00:50:55.681 --> 00:50:56.782]  So what's the chain trigger?
[00:50:58.086 --> 00:51:08.082]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books, and founder of the national chain, Meyer Clinics, to tell you about two Your Health liquid vitamins.

[00:52:28.695 --> 00:52:30.496]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:52:30.496 --> 00:52:32.157]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:10.604]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:14.630]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[00:54:07.685 --> 00:54:10.107]  Matt Bracken's our guest.
[00:54:10.107 --> 00:54:15.150]  Writer, researcher.
[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.414]  Everything he's saying while he's talking, I just have stacks of news basically saying the same thing, but telling us everything's okay.
[00:54:20.414 --> 00:54:23.957]  So while he's talking for TV viewers, I'm gonna be going through articles just showing you...
[00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:37.921]  Where they admit big defaults, state level, pension level, Puerto Rico, record numbers of people exiting the third world, the government just letting them in, illegals coming in, get more than a social security recipient.
[00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:39.542]  That's mainstream news.
[00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.863]  I'm going to be going over all of that.
[00:54:40.863 --> 00:54:42.165]  I mean, this is an elite.
[00:54:43.223 --> 00:55:09.795]  They organize their main plan, they meet at different meetings to steer it, but because we've exposed it and others have exposed it, and you've exposed it, more and more, they are going to a policy of just going, okay, there's world government, or George Will, in the article I mentioned earlier, says, quote, a convention's sovereign duty, oh, they're sovereign, that means royalty, the Republicans, the party, that's like the inner party in China,
[00:55:10.578 --> 00:55:12.039]  The Central Committee.
[00:55:12.039 --> 00:55:32.426]  The Convention's sovereign duty is to choose a plausible nominee, they decide, who has a reasonable chance to win, they decide who can win, not to passively affirm the will, the will of the people, of a mere plurality of voters recorded episodically in a protracted process.
[00:55:32.426 --> 00:55:32.886]  I mean, that is
[00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:37.211]  Sophistry.
[00:55:37.211 --> 00:55:42.574]  I mean, it is total pseudo-intellectual tripe, a fancy way to say, your vote doesn't count.
[00:55:42.574 --> 00:55:44.716]  Well, guess what, you little con artist, George Will?
[00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:49.880]  You guys have been acting like that vote counts, but because we're not selecting who you want, you say it doesn't.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.641]  You say you passed a rule back in the 70s.
[00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:55.044]  Well, you didn't try to use it till now.
[00:55:55.044 --> 00:55:56.765]  Last time you thought about it was with Reagan.
[00:55:58.695 --> 00:55:59.575]  I'm going to go back to our guest.
[00:55:59.575 --> 00:56:08.540]  We're about to start the next hour, but continue Mr. Bracken with where you say we're going and what the establishment's going to pull in these different waves.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:15.504]  The debt bubble, the massive migrant invasions, the social justice warrior Ford Foundation radicalization program.
[00:56:15.504 --> 00:56:17.405]  I mean, what do you think the elite's thinking?
[00:56:17.405 --> 00:56:21.267]  I mean, I got your allegories that were excellent of the Wizard of Oz.
[00:56:21.267 --> 00:56:27.511]  Well, what he'd really do is if they caught him, he'd blow up the palace, have a pre-produced fake video of Dorothy being a suicide bomber.
[00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:31.094]  When really he blew it up and flew off in his jet copter to his next base.
[00:56:31.094 --> 00:56:33.515]  But, I mean, I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:37.518]  Look at the arrogance of all these people thinking they can just steal an election.
[00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:38.479]  It's not flying.
[00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:46.685]  I mean, I really think in history it shows that megalomania becomes a delusion in and of itself, and the elite's biggest enemy is themselves.
[00:56:46.685 --> 00:56:51.088]  It's interesting, the jet copter.
[00:56:51.088 --> 00:56:55.852]  The super elites do have a few small Achilles that are exposed.
[00:56:56.841 --> 00:57:02.216]  Obviously, if you're a Sun Tzu fan, you know you minimize and hide your own weaknesses.
[00:57:02.216 --> 00:57:03.961]  Well, one of their weaknesses is security.
[00:57:04.773 --> 00:57:23.229]  And their paranoia about security, which is really why it's so rich when people like Zuckerberg talk about the need for America to bring in way more refugees while, you know, he has a 700 acre estate on Kauai on the North Shore, you know, with like Blackwater security keeping everybody out.
[00:57:23.229 --> 00:57:27.192]  He's got his place to go, but he wants us to take more refugees.
[00:57:27.192 --> 00:57:31.176]  Or the Vatican with its 200 foot walls or the big wall they're building around the White House.
[00:57:31.616 --> 00:57:33.959]  But they fly in private jets.
[00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:37.743]  They do not go tourist class on American Airlines, believe me.
[00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:40.545]  And they do not go through TSA security either.
[00:57:40.545 --> 00:57:43.809]  Now, none of these guys owns a jet, except for Trump.
[00:57:43.809 --> 00:57:44.970]  It's interesting.
[00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.653]  Trump actually does own a big jet that says Trump right on the side.
[00:57:48.419 --> 00:57:54.104]  But Zuckerberg and the rest of these folks, you won't find a jet that has his name on it.
[00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:58.147]  It's all holding companies and leases and sharing and so forth.
[00:57:58.147 --> 00:58:07.034]  But when they're flying to Bilderberg in July, it'll be very interesting to see the flight schedules and then sort of untangle the tail numbers.
[00:58:07.034 --> 00:58:08.295]  Because that's the big guys.
[00:58:08.295 --> 00:58:09.957]  That's the big guys.
[00:58:09.957 --> 00:58:12.539]  You can track them by their golf streams for sure.
[00:58:13.935 --> 00:58:17.399]  Absolutely, and they're building a world that will destroy them historically.
[00:58:17.399 --> 00:58:23.085]  It's like the Rothschilds, at some level, funded Hitler, and then Hitler did kill some of them in France.
[00:58:23.085 --> 00:58:25.207]  It's like, they think they can control everything.
[00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:34.988]  They can't control everything, but I think that their plan is to emerge on the other side when the fire is down and the ashes are cooling, then they can fly back from Patagonia or New Zealand.
[00:58:34.988 --> 00:58:36.589]  Exactly, stay there.
[00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:37.871]  They're all going to New Zealand, that's right.
[00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:42.035]  We'll talk more about your research, how we stopped this with Matt Bracken straight ahead.

[01:00:25.962 --> 01:00:27.624]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:31.087]  Matt Bracken, as you can see right there.
[01:00:31.087 --> 01:00:32.449]  Let's punch up the side camera.
[01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:33.109]  I love it.
[01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:37.614]  I bet he thought that was like a three-minute break, not a one-minute break, but he's right over there when he comes back.
[01:00:37.614 --> 01:00:39.036]  We will talk more with him.
[01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:39.816]  Really smart guy.
[01:00:39.816 --> 01:00:40.717]  Really enjoy talking to him.
[01:00:40.717 --> 01:00:43.380]  Very humble guy, like so many of those great folks are.
[01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:47.709]  In a moment he'll be coming back.
[01:00:47.709 --> 01:00:50.109]  Here are some of those articles I was mentioning.
[01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:53.190]  As deadlines come and go, Puerto Rico's debt crisis grows.
[01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.371]  CS Monitor.
[01:00:55.371 --> 01:01:00.052]  A canary in a San Juan coal mine is what Bloomberg says.
[01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:00.972]  Here's another one.
[01:01:00.972 --> 01:01:06.414]  Puerto Rico will default on government development bank debt.
[01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:09.570]  Again, what does that signify?
[01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.772]  Again, what will that mean?
[01:01:11.772 --> 01:01:21.137]  And then as he's speaking here, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, I'm going to go over some of the other articles about illegals to get more money than Social Security recipients, that's official.
[01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:24.840]  All of this, but really overall there is a hatred
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.701]  Of the West, of Americana, a free market by the elites.
[01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:31.942]  That's why they're desperately trying to consolidate power.
[01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:33.342]  Matt, I've been asking a lot of the questions.
[01:01:33.342 --> 01:01:38.143]  This is a short segment, but getting back to other points you want to impart to folks.
[01:01:38.143 --> 01:01:44.845]  People should look at history in a lot of respects in terms of wave theory.
[01:01:44.845 --> 01:01:51.287]  Look up what a Kondratiev wave is, which is sort of a multi-generational economic cycle.
[01:01:52.134 --> 01:01:55.955]  Uh, postulated by a Russian economist at the beginning of the 20th century.
[01:01:55.955 --> 01:01:58.116]  You're talking about turnings.
[01:01:58.116 --> 01:02:05.358]  Yeah, and when people forget, when you have three or four generations on Wall Street that never suffered a wipeout crash, like a 1929 type of crash,
[01:02:07.843 --> 01:02:09.964]  Their normalcy bias says it can never happen.
[01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:10.904]  They're like dodo birds.
[01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:12.344]  They're like dodo birds.
[01:02:12.344 --> 01:02:13.265]  It's different this time.
[01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:14.505]  You know, that's the famous saying.
[01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:16.486]  It's different this time.
[01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:18.526]  The French Revolution happened.
[01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.567]  Social change came.
[01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:22.727]  It was an engineered event.
[01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:35.251]  There was no huge protest among French peasants at the time, but the conspirators that had come from Bavaria, Adam Weishaupt, the original Illuminists, they
[01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:43.082]  Instigated the French Revolution as a way of engineering a way to be on top of that.
[01:02:43.082 --> 01:02:50.406]  If you look at the 1917 revolution in Russia, American bankers funded Lenin going to Russia.
[01:02:50.406 --> 01:02:52.086]  The Finland Station, all of that.
[01:02:52.086 --> 01:02:56.208]  That was paid for by American bankers hoping to get in on the ground floor.
[01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:56.849]  They're amoral.
[01:02:57.469 --> 01:03:04.914]  But a figure like the American capitalist industrialist Armand Hammer, so what if they're mass murdering communists?
[01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:05.835]  Who cares?
[01:03:05.835 --> 01:03:08.797]  We're going to be in tight with them right from the ground floor.
[01:03:08.797 --> 01:03:15.641]  So you'll often see an evolution in economics that's followed by an evolution in society.
[01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:19.284]  When the Industrial Revolution began, it led to factory work.
[01:03:19.284 --> 01:03:26.489]  Factory work led to workers living in mass huddled slums near the factories, which led to unions.
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:43.019]  Unions then were co-opted by the progressives and communists, but behind them, it's one of the strangest things is to see communists in bed with billionaires, you know, who are like the original Adam Weishaupt.
[01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:46.221]  They believe that society is perfectible.
[01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:50.804]  In fact, that was one of the other names that Weishaupt was going to give to his Illuminists group.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.383]  That was going to be a perfectibility society.
[01:03:54.383 --> 01:04:01.108]  Another one was the bee society, like we're all going to be in the beehive and guess who's going to be the queen bee?
[01:04:01.108 --> 01:04:08.714]  So human beings can be figured out and perfected with progressive, super intelligent, super elites.
[01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:11.657]  So why shouldn't they also be billionaires?
[01:04:11.657 --> 01:04:20.184]  It's kind of perverse and strange, but on the backside of the circle, you know, a lot of times the billionaires actually meet the black block.
[01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:24.788]  They both profit from revolution and rage and overturning.
[01:04:24.788 --> 01:04:28.759]  They all hope to emerge on top of the wreckage after the tsunami.
[01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:37.746]  Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Bracken, in my experience dealing with the black bloc all over the country, I've had them always punch me in the back, act like they didn't, trying to make some, you know, big deal happen.
[01:04:37.746 --> 01:04:40.987]  They normally get in brand new Mercedes, Jaguars, we have tape of this.
[01:04:40.987 --> 01:04:53.931]  These are all pretty much kids, the leaders of it, of rich corporate heads, and their kids are doing military service in America and actually know that they're taking over, and they'll admit to me, we're gonna kill you soon.
[01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:55.372]  Of course we're fascist.
[01:04:55.372 --> 01:04:56.552]  So they're even more evil than that.
[01:04:57.714 --> 01:04:59.735]  Article up by Associated Press.
[01:04:59.735 --> 01:05:03.256]  Pentagon ends ban on transgender troops in the military.
[01:05:03.256 --> 01:05:03.636]  Why?
[01:05:03.636 --> 01:05:06.117]  Because we're a f***ing social experiment now.
[01:05:06.117 --> 01:05:08.458]  We're not the fighting force we should be.
[01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:12.680]  Instead, we are a social experiment.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.380]  Negative.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:17.362]  We are men and women committed to fighting for our country.
[01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:20.543]  We don't worry about whether someone wants to cut off their genitalia.
[01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:22.804]  And we sure as f*** aren't paying for it.
[01:05:22.804 --> 01:05:24.225]  That's a personal choice.
[01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:27.866]  Transgender people will be allowed to serve openly in the U.S.
[01:05:27.866 --> 01:05:30.366]  military, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
[01:05:30.366 --> 01:05:33.107]  First, we had the guys walking around in red high heels.
[01:05:33.107 --> 01:05:39.348]  Then we allow women who've never been in combat to lead and train soldiers in combat situations.
[01:05:39.348 --> 01:05:41.629]  And now you want to bring in this bullsh**.
[01:05:41.629 --> 01:05:51.771]  Under this new policy, by October 1st, transgender troops already serving should be able to receive medical care and begin formally changing their gender identifications in this Pentagon's
[01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.472]  Personal system.
[01:05:53.472 --> 01:05:57.374]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and I'm pretty f***ing pissed off.
[01:05:57.374 --> 01:06:00.475]  Hey everyone, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:00.475 --> 01:06:04.317]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:06.398]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:06.398 --> 01:06:15.622]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are
[01:06:15.842 --> 01:06:16.663]  Rampant.
[01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:23.126]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:37.554]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats,

[01:08:14.722 --> 01:08:16.825]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:21.572]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[01:08:21.572 --> 01:08:23.855]  I mentioned some of these articles the last hour.
[01:08:23.855 --> 01:08:31.185]  I want to just show TV viewers some of them now and then also read out the headlines for radio listeners so you can see this is happening.
[01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.196]  Puerto Ricans leaving island for U.S.
[01:08:34.196 --> 01:08:35.177]  in record numbers.
[01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:39.002]  CNN, due to the economic crisis there and the ongoing default.
[01:08:39.002 --> 01:08:40.985]  They're in a full bore depression.
[01:08:40.985 --> 01:08:42.047]  That's in Bloomberg as well.
[01:08:42.047 --> 01:08:44.169]  Obama budget $17,613 for every new illegal minor.
[01:08:44.169 --> 01:08:45.651]  More than Social Security retirees get.
[01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:55.623]  And they won't let Christian refugees come here.
[01:08:55.623 --> 01:08:58.225]  For every like 300, 400, there's one token.
[01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:01.768]  When 20% of Syria is Christian, and run them for their lives.
[01:09:01.768 --> 01:09:03.189]  Hundreds of thousands killed.
[01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:05.250]  Why would our elite do that?
[01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.132]  Ted Cruz's support softens among the delegates he counted.
[01:09:08.132 --> 01:09:10.674]  That shows folks are waking up on that front.
[01:09:10.674 --> 01:09:17.959]  Graham, Lindsey Graham, the Queen of the Senate, says Trump would lead to another 9-11.
[01:09:19.605 --> 01:09:24.107]  These are the people bringing in the jihadis, funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda with Saudi Arabia, caught red-handed.
[01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:26.929]  Trump's exposing it, exposing the 28 pages.
[01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:33.972]  There's a sick globalist alliance with radical Islam, and they say Trump is going to cause it.
[01:09:33.972 --> 01:09:36.993]  It's crazy how they invert reality.
[01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:46.378]  Since I mentioned this, NATO deploys 4,000 troops to Russian border as the EU Comm Chief urges, quote, return to war planning.
[01:09:47.455 --> 01:09:54.860]  Meanwhile, watch German shutdown leftist ministers probe migrant speech and chase him through the streets.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.320]  But don't worry.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:03.044]  The London Express reports EU military police carrying out extremely worrying civil unrest crisis training.
[01:10:03.044 --> 01:10:04.886]  And it's not for the Muslims, folks.
[01:10:04.886 --> 01:10:09.088]  They can do whatever they want to encourage the aggression until it explodes.
[01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:10.169]  So the elites are doing this on purpose.
[01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.170]  And I can look at history and things.
[01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:13.811]  They're insane.
[01:10:13.811 --> 01:10:20.633]  I've run into so many really rich people, I mean billionaires, that are either scared of moving to New Zealand years ago, but they tell me, oh, the rest of the elite are nuts.
[01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:21.153]  They're right.
[01:10:21.153 --> 01:10:22.773]  They're crazy.
[01:10:22.773 --> 01:10:24.414]  They want total control.
[01:10:24.414 --> 01:10:25.574]  And they like to see us squirm.
[01:10:25.574 --> 01:10:26.914]  It's like entertainment.
[01:10:26.914 --> 01:10:33.536]  You got 15 mistresses and all these elites with Bill Clinton flying to sex islands with little kids, and it comes out and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:38.517]  And when you're into screwing little kids, folks, you're into blowing stuff up and killing innocent people.
[01:10:38.517 --> 01:10:40.318]  I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's who we're dealing with here.
[01:10:42.757 --> 01:10:54.986]  So I just, I mentioned all that, so I thought I would just, and of course, George Will, in his last article in the Washington Post, saying, we are sovereign, your vote doesn't count, you are nobody.
[01:10:54.986 --> 01:10:55.626]  That's what he says.
[01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:59.969]  Here, let me say it in White Shoe Boy talk, what he actually said.
[01:10:59.969 --> 01:11:08.075]  A convention's sovereign duty, that's their sovereignty, a convention, that's the party, I'm deciphering, this little arrogant piece of filth thinks we don't understand this.
[01:11:08.888 --> 01:11:13.169]  It just makes it sound fancy to you so you just shut up and go along with it like the queen with a stupid hat on.
[01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:32.535]  A convention's sovereign duty is to choose a plausible nominee who has a reasonable chance to win, not to passively affirm the will of a mere plurality of voters recorded episodically in a protected process.
[01:11:34.059 --> 01:11:44.463]  Like you come up and mug somebody and knock their teeth out and you go, and then I went to your mandibles and massaged them for the lovingness that you would not ever have to deal with them and brush them.
[01:11:44.463 --> 01:11:47.644]  I took them from your mouth in a loving flurry.
[01:11:47.644 --> 01:11:51.545]  No, you knocked your teeth out with a frickin' ball-peen hammer, you little bastard!
[01:11:51.545 --> 01:11:55.147]  And it's this type of garbage that I'm sick of!
[01:11:55.147 --> 01:11:56.647]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:11:56.647 --> 01:11:58.448]  We're gonna start taking your calls in the next segment.
[01:11:59.714 --> 01:12:05.656]  800-259-9231 for Mr. Bracken, a great writer, great brain, really impressed with his work.
[01:12:05.656 --> 01:12:10.518]  Want to have him on routinely, want to have him on the nightly news, even to pop in when events are happening.
[01:12:10.518 --> 01:12:18.902]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us with your questions or comments on these subjects or for Mr. Bracken or myself.
[01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:21.223]  And then just briefly, this is a backdrop to all this.
[01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:24.366]  We're running a special on the best durable food out there.
[01:12:24.366 --> 01:12:27.770]  Infowarrestore.com, powered by my patron, The Wise Selection.
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:29.271]  30-40% off.
[01:12:29.271 --> 01:12:30.593]  I twisted their arms.
[01:12:30.593 --> 01:12:32.335]  I'm able to extend it a day, maybe two.
[01:12:32.335 --> 01:12:33.636]  It's gotta stop.
[01:12:33.636 --> 01:12:33.897]  Okay?
[01:12:33.897 --> 01:12:36.199]  Because nobody else has these prices.
[01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:42.507]  10% off all other preparedness items from car jumping, little micro batteries, this stuff gets more and more miniaturized, works so well.
[01:12:43.755 --> 01:12:58.972]  It plugs into dozens of different devices, everything from G-Shock washers, a whole spectrum of the best gravity-fed and survival filters out there, high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, the widest spectrum of those out there, high-quality shortwave radios, crank-powered, solar-powered, you name it.
[01:12:59.412 --> 01:13:00.393]  And so much more.
[01:13:00.393 --> 01:13:06.976]  When you're moving around with cell phones, you need to put them in the little packages with the lead walls so that, you know, obviously you can't be tracked.
[01:13:06.976 --> 01:13:08.657]  This is a rule, folks, for your privacy.
[01:13:08.657 --> 01:13:09.477]  Those are there.
[01:13:09.477 --> 01:13:11.618]  Plus, folks can't hack your phone with those.
[01:13:11.618 --> 01:13:17.542]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:20.483]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:23.465]  Before you leave today, I want to talk about some of your books, because I can't wait to read those.
[01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.006]  Well, I think that every time that I see or hear, it's a battle for our minds.
[01:13:26.006 --> 01:13:26.287]  It really is.
[01:13:26.287 --> 01:13:27.928]  It's all about getting the herd running.
[01:13:27.928 --> 01:13:30.430]  Now, the herd can be run like buffaloes right towards a cliff.
[01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:57.593]  The people that are doing the buffalo herding, they don't plan on going over the cliff edge.
[01:13:57.593 --> 01:13:59.854]  They just want to get the buffaloes moving.
[01:13:59.854 --> 01:14:06.959]  Whether it's the people that hate Trump so much or the people that love Trump so much, we're gearing up for a big collision.
[01:14:06.959 --> 01:14:12.924]  The people that are engineering the collision do not plan to be at the site of the train wreck.
[01:14:12.924 --> 01:14:18.868]  They're going to be on a jet to New Zealand or Chile, somewhere nice in another hemisphere.
[01:14:22.029 --> 01:14:25.510]  I had a lot of great reaction after the show last week.
[01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:29.991]  And one person on Facebook said, said, oh, you went on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:29.991 --> 01:14:31.572]  You've lost your credibility.
[01:14:31.572 --> 01:14:35.033]  And I just, I said, what?
[01:14:35.033 --> 01:14:37.773]  Do you think they would have me on Fox News?
[01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.694]  I'm not a script reader.
[01:14:39.694 --> 01:14:43.135]  To get on network television, you have to join the club.
[01:14:43.135 --> 01:14:46.116]  You have to go to your own little Bilderberg meeting, so to speak.
[01:14:46.116 --> 01:14:51.037]  You have to get invited to network, go upstairs and meet the big shots in the top corner office.
[01:14:51.767 --> 01:15:00.812]  And that's where they learn that you really are a docile puppy that will roll over and, you know, expose your throat and ask for a rub on the stomach.
[01:15:00.812 --> 01:15:08.617]  That you'll never rock the boat, you won't be a loose cannon, you'll stay on script, you'll respect the third rails, and you'll, you know, promote the going narrative.
[01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:15.799]  It's basically not that much different from Pravda and Izvestia, except we have more flavors of propaganda.
[01:15:15.799 --> 01:15:18.820]  But none of them really go way off of message.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.242]  Now, I'm old enough to remember Watergate.
[01:15:21.242 --> 01:15:23.943]  I was working outdoors construction the whole summer.
[01:15:23.943 --> 01:15:25.804]  They preempted every network channel.
[01:15:25.804 --> 01:15:27.305]  You couldn't turn your TV on.
[01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:30.707]  And not see gavel-to-gavel coverage.
[01:15:30.707 --> 01:15:37.311]  The front page of every newspaper for a year was Watergate, until Nixon was thrown out.
[01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:40.733]  Nobody died in the Watergate.
[01:15:40.733 --> 01:15:48.018]  300 to 400 or more by now, Mexicans died on purpose as a result of Fast and Furious.
[01:15:48.018 --> 01:15:49.399]  Benghazi is another case.
[01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:54.002]  Americans died, the president was hiding, no help was sent.
[01:15:54.002 --> 01:15:56.003]  It's not my point to bring up these old cases.
[01:15:56.716 --> 01:16:00.021]  Just to study how the media portrays them.
[01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:08.052]  If the media had focused on Fast and Furious, hundreds of Mexicans killed so that they could discredit the Second Amendment.
[01:16:08.052 --> 01:16:11.697]  During the time before Agent Terry was killed, Holder
[01:16:12.475 --> 01:16:18.700]  Hillary Clinton at State Department and Obama were on a narrative that I call the 90% lie.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:28.087]  Every time they were on a Sunday morning show they would talk about how it's so terrible that 90% of the guns found in Mexico came from American gun stores.
[01:16:28.087 --> 01:16:30.329]  They were guilting us!
[01:16:30.329 --> 01:16:33.451]  And it's the fault of the Second Amendment and it's the fault of these gun stores.
[01:16:33.451 --> 01:16:36.133]  These are gun stores that were forced and coerced by the ATF.
[01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:39.909]  But I don't even care about that.
[01:16:39.909 --> 01:16:41.250]  I mean, that's terrible.
[01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:45.471]  What I care about is that the media stayed away from it.
[01:16:45.471 --> 01:16:56.636]  How many Americans know that zero people died at Watergate, hundreds died at Fast and Furious, four died in Benghazi, including an ambassador, which is the equivalent of a four-star general.
[01:16:56.636 --> 01:16:56.976]  That's right.
[01:16:56.976 --> 01:17:03.579]  And Sheryl Atkinson basically lost her job at CBS for being the only person in a command position to be able to sneak through the truth.
[01:17:03.579 --> 01:17:04.460]  And let me just stop you there.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:16.313]  Since you bring this up, Matt, they use all this peer pressure like, ooh, you're discredited, you're on Alex Jones, or oh, Matt's discredited, Matt Drudge, he gets more and more popular, he links to Alex Jones.
[01:17:16.313 --> 01:17:19.076]  They hate this show because they know how accurate it is.
[01:17:19.076 --> 01:17:24.302]  It's reaching 28 million people a week now worldwide, 15 million of them here in the US, we're only a global audience.
[01:17:24.702 --> 01:17:29.204]  Like, all these corporate guys go, too bad more than half your audience is overseas, doesn't really matter for money making.
[01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:30.925]  I don't care about that at the end of the day.
[01:17:30.925 --> 01:17:32.426]  Globally, I want an effective change.
[01:17:32.426 --> 01:17:33.327]  That's the real value.
[01:17:33.327 --> 01:17:34.828]  But absolutely, it's a psy-op.
[01:17:34.828 --> 01:17:36.088]  Like, you can't be for Trump.
[01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:37.189]  He's a racist.
[01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:38.349]  You're discredited now.
[01:17:38.349 --> 01:17:40.491]  People know the media's lying.
[01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:47.474]  How bad is it that the mainstream media, in an AP poll, also Gallup showed the same number, 6% trust rate.
[01:17:47.474 --> 01:17:49.355]  Don't they get they're pathetic?
[01:17:49.355 --> 01:17:52.217]  And saying we're kooks is our red badge of honor?
[01:17:53.836 --> 01:18:07.088]  On network television, they've got fantastic production values, great studios, beautiful blonde newsreaders, every graphic you can possibly imagine, reporters all over the place, but they don't tell the truth.
[01:18:07.088 --> 01:18:13.473]  The reason that 28 million people a week are watching Alex Jones is because you go places that they won't go.
[01:18:13.473 --> 01:18:15.815]  We look at them now and we just see Pravda.
[01:18:15.815 --> 01:18:21.400]  Now you've got red Republican Pravda and you've got blue Democrat Pravda.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:30.641]  But when you've got George Will basically agreeing with the Democrats that we've got to keep this Trump out, even if we lose, even if Hillary wins.
[01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:40.623]  George Will's happier with Hillary, but I don't even see that as the problem now, because whether it's Hillary or Trump, by January this country is going to be in a whole new ballgame.
[01:18:40.623 --> 01:18:44.464]  I'll be surprised if nobody takes a shot at Trump.
[01:18:44.464 --> 01:18:51.225]  The other day when he hopped the Jersey barricades to get into the rally that was up in Northern California,
[01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:59.250]  It reminded me of 1914 in Yugoslavia with the Mars Duke.
[01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.951]  The bomb was a failure.
[01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:05.594]  They tried to toss a bomb in his car and it bounced off and went under the car behind.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:13.366]  Then their security detail made a series of mistakes, but the conspirators thought the plot had failed.
[01:19:13.366 --> 01:19:19.431]  Gavalo Princep was sitting in a cafe, you know, drowning his sorrows at missing his big chance.
[01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:31.421]  The security details had kind of a snafu, and here comes the Archduke straight down the street, where Gavalo Princep, the mission has already failed, it's an abort, he's having a beer, he steps out and shoots him.
[01:19:32.532 --> 01:19:41.677]  And that was British intelligence manipulating the black hand to fool the Germanic group into going into World War I. Absolute total setup.
[01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:45.380]  Yeah, folks, the West was pretty much the bad guys of World War I, and you see what it created.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.921]  The next group of bad guys had Adolf Hitler in World War II.
[01:19:47.921 --> 01:19:49.662]  It was also financed by the British and U.S.
[01:19:49.662 --> 01:19:50.403]  elite.
[01:19:50.403 --> 01:19:54.165]  They're very sophisticated, but their BS is coming to an end.
[01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:06.213]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:20:06.213 --> 01:20:07.034]  Here's why.
[01:20:07.034 --> 01:20:11.158]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:20:11.158 --> 01:20:12.079]  So please listen.
[01:20:12.079 --> 01:20:15.503]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:20:15.763 --> 01:20:22.107]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:20:22.107 --> 01:20:29.392]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.733]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:20:31.733 --> 01:20:42.960]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.002]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:20:45.002 --> 01:20:46.684]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:20:46.684 --> 01:20:48.406]  That's gridwars.com.

[01:21:57.126 --> 01:21:58.133]  My name is Jay.
[01:21:58.133 --> 01:21:59.945]  I'm 26 years of age and I...
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.080]  I took the One World Way protein powder.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.061]  After having chronic abdominal pain and pressure for months, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.
[01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:13.422]  The medical doctor told me there was nothing I could do to treat it other than taking pain and nausea medication.
[01:22:13.422 --> 01:22:19.403]  Then I came across an ad for One World Way on the radio and read the claims that it can help with all types of inflammation.
[01:22:19.403 --> 01:22:27.465]  I took the One World Way protein powder every day for a month and the chronic pain and pressure sensations went away completely and I never took the pain or nausea meds.
[01:22:27.465 --> 01:22:29.845]  To this day, my intestines are free of pain.
[01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:31.186]  Nature is kind.
[01:22:31.186 --> 01:22:35.509]  When we consume foods we're designed to eat, then she gives back health when it was once lost.
[01:22:35.509 --> 01:22:40.012]  One World Way consistently supports the body's production of glutathione and overall repair.

[01:22:44.374 --> 01:22:47.997]  When inflammation is gone, the body can complete its healing process.

[01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.030]  Come and take it.
[01:24:23.894 --> 01:24:27.337]  Look, I know most of you know what we are talking about is true.
[01:24:27.337 --> 01:24:29.518]  You've got more experiences than we do.
[01:24:29.518 --> 01:24:35.323]  There's a lot of amazing people out there, but the general public still doesn't get how history works.
[01:24:35.323 --> 01:24:40.267]  There are groups of ruling predators who don't like freedom and don't like real prosperity.
[01:24:40.267 --> 01:24:43.689]  They want total control.
[01:24:43.689 --> 01:24:45.211]  Humans are the same all over the world.
[01:24:45.211 --> 01:24:47.492]  We have the same patterns as our guest was just saying earlier.
[01:24:47.492 --> 01:24:48.093]  It's totally true.
[01:24:49.704 --> 01:25:01.130]  We've now reached a crossroads with the weapons and the technology and the huge population and all the rest of it, where you have an elite that has passed on its class envy.
[01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.751]  You're like, well wait, the elite has class envy?
[01:25:02.751 --> 01:25:05.072]  Yes, against the middle class.
[01:25:05.072 --> 01:25:10.615]  So they're playing the giant unwashed masses off against the middle class, pressure from below, the elites above.
[01:25:10.615 --> 01:25:12.636]  That's their admitted plan.
[01:25:12.636 --> 01:25:16.038]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written books admitting it!
[01:25:16.038 --> 01:25:17.939]  He's one of their top gophers, one of their top planners.
[01:25:18.925 --> 01:25:20.306]  On their top generals.
[01:25:20.306 --> 01:25:25.590]  And so they've got all these different disparate groups filled with class envy, chips on the shoulders, you name it.
[01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:31.855]  None worse than the white knight social justice warriors who just want to see Rome burn.
[01:25:31.855 --> 01:25:40.021]  Even though these fat, soft, stupid people don't even know how to throw a punch, folks.
[01:25:40.021 --> 01:25:41.622]  And I watch them just beat up the Trump people.
[01:25:41.622 --> 01:25:42.803]  They just stand there and let them beat them up.
[01:25:43.792 --> 01:25:48.554]  I mean, I don't know who is wimpier, but all I know is that is scary looking to me.
[01:25:48.554 --> 01:25:49.555]  I don't know what they've done.
[01:25:49.555 --> 01:25:50.315]  Is it TV?
[01:25:50.315 --> 01:25:51.576]  Is it the culture?
[01:25:51.576 --> 01:25:54.737]  Is it modern industrial sickness, like space sickness?
[01:25:54.737 --> 01:25:55.778]  I don't know.
[01:25:55.778 --> 01:25:59.199]  We're going to go to callers at the start of the next segment.
[01:25:59.199 --> 01:25:59.900]  Phones are loaded.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.241]  Crystal, Shane, Billy, Andrew, Joseph, and others.
[01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.422]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:26:04.422 --> 01:26:09.864]  Other points, Matt Braggins, I know you got caught up with a break of EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com that you want to make.
[01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:13.406]  And then also, any rays of hope you see out there.
[01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:23.157]  Well, if anybody goes to my Amazon reviews, you know, one of the most common things is that I saw this coming a long time ago.
[01:26:23.157 --> 01:26:29.538]  First book is about a false flag operation blaming, you know, right-wing militias for a massacre.
[01:26:29.538 --> 01:26:34.039]  Second book is about the Southwest splitting apart the country, basically fracturing.
[01:26:34.039 --> 01:26:36.740]  The third book, the country is completely fractured.
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:42.281]  Foreign peacekeepers are brought in because American National Guard won't fire on Americans sufficiently well.
[01:26:44.276 --> 01:26:47.177]  You kind of get the idea of what I think could be ahead.
[01:26:47.177 --> 01:26:49.018]  It's not a very rosy scenario.
[01:26:49.018 --> 01:27:05.025]  I wish I could be just writing genre fiction, you know, spies or adventure type of novels, but time is short and we have to stay on the actual message because the water is going out and we have to be that kid that's warning everybody that the tsunami is coming.
[01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:08.347]  We can't reach everybody, but we can reach a lot of people.
[01:27:08.347 --> 01:27:10.648]  A hopeful sign I've seen in the last couple weeks
[01:27:11.907 --> 01:27:19.269]  A little bit of is emerging above the surface, this fight between two Navy SEAL admirals.
[01:27:19.269 --> 01:27:27.051]  They're talking right now about a fairly parochial issue, but there's a lot of hate and discontent and tension among the flag ranks.
[01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:33.992]  And I'm waiting for somebody, an honorable general or admiral, to be as honorable as Colonel David Hackworth was.
[01:27:33.992 --> 01:27:36.833]  He was a battlefield commission in Korea as a kid.
[01:27:37.635 --> 01:27:39.576]  He did not go to West Point.
[01:27:39.576 --> 01:27:45.320]  He was one of the, I think, the youngest colonel in Army history in Vietnam.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.680]  He wrote the book about face.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.143]  He went on national news shows and said the way we're fighting the war can't be won.
[01:27:51.143 --> 01:27:52.003]  We're being lied to.
[01:27:52.003 --> 01:27:58.307]  He took his, basically took his uniform off and threw away his career out of a sense of honor.
[01:27:58.307 --> 01:28:01.529]  Duty, honor, country, you know, integrity, the core values.
[01:28:02.412 --> 01:28:04.494]  And I'm not seeing that from our current generals.
[01:28:04.494 --> 01:28:07.517]  There are generals, and we can go by their assigned duty stations.
[01:28:07.517 --> 01:28:09.698]  We know who was on duty during Benghazi.
[01:28:09.698 --> 01:28:11.000]  We know.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.661]  We know who was in Stuttgart.
[01:28:12.661 --> 01:28:15.283]  We know who saw all the flash traffic.
[01:28:15.283 --> 01:28:17.786]  If you've seen the movie 13 Hours, they allude to it.
[01:28:17.786 --> 01:28:25.232]  There are commandos on runways ready to go and save the little, you know, besieged Alamo in Benghazi.
[01:28:25.232 --> 01:28:28.295]  Until then, we have always gone to save the Alamos.
[01:28:28.295 --> 01:28:29.376]  In this case, we didn't.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:37.082]  Because the president wanted the, you know, a few weeks from the election, he didn't want a possible Black Hawk Down scenario.
[01:28:37.082 --> 01:28:38.662]  He also wanted weapons transferred.
[01:28:38.662 --> 01:28:39.882]  He wanted weapons transferred into Syria.
[01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:40.503]  Just hide it.
[01:28:40.503 --> 01:28:42.103]  Just let that thing be overrun.
[01:28:42.103 --> 01:28:43.243]  Just let it be overrun.
[01:28:43.243 --> 01:28:45.384]  The terrible breach of faith.
[01:28:45.384 --> 01:28:50.305]  And there are generals and there are admirals that know that we're undergoing a cultural Marxist
[01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:52.927]  Destabilization.
[01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:55.509]  Transgender military, hello?
[01:28:55.509 --> 01:28:57.510]  Can you say good order and discipline?
[01:28:57.510 --> 01:29:06.797]  If you were trying to destroy a military, make it combat ineffective, ruin its morale, drive out the best soldiers and sailors, this is what you would do.
[01:29:06.797 --> 01:29:14.483]  I look at some of the famous generals that are always on TV on the Sunday morning shows, even Petraeus.
[01:29:14.483 --> 01:29:17.385]  Come on, salvage your honor, General.
[01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:20.328]  Write the memoir now while it makes a difference.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.321]  Punk out and write your memoir.
[01:29:23.321 --> 01:29:23.661]  I agree.
[01:29:23.661 --> 01:29:24.161]  Stay there.
[01:29:24.161 --> 01:29:24.941]  Stay there.
[01:29:24.941 --> 01:29:25.921]  But it's even beyond honor.
[01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:28.002]  You would do it for honor, my friend, Mr. Bracken.
[01:29:28.002 --> 01:29:29.762]  These guys need to understand it's end of the line.
[01:29:29.762 --> 01:29:31.783]  You're going to get screwed over.
[01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:33.484]  All these globos are screwing each other.
[01:29:33.484 --> 01:29:36.845]  See, they claim they're going to honor each other, but there's no honor among thieves.
[01:29:36.845 --> 01:29:38.545]  That's why it's so dangerous.
[01:29:38.545 --> 01:29:44.747]  And they're starting to figure that out, which makes them steal even faster, which accelerates the collapse that much quicker.
[01:29:44.747 --> 01:29:44.987]  Whoa.
[01:29:47.031 --> 01:29:50.972]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.972 --> 01:29:57.814]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.814 --> 01:30:05.797]  Barack Obama's propaganda tool clock boy, Ahmed Mohammed, talks about life and guitar and what he's learned about hate.
[01:30:05.797 --> 01:30:13.179]  Ahmed, the Muslim teenager who was suspended for bringing a homemade clock that looked like a f***ing bomb to school in Irvine,
[01:30:13.319 --> 01:30:15.580]  He poses for a photograph at his home.
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:23.505]  If I'm not mistaken, isn't Qatar the same place that Barack Obama traded Bo Bergdahl for the freakin' Taliban Five?
[01:30:23.505 --> 01:30:25.366]  But let's go back to this stupid article.
[01:30:25.366 --> 01:30:32.830]  He's no longer surprised when people recognize him since his arrest at Irvine's MacArthur High School in September, when he brought a homemade cloth.
[01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:34.631]  No, it's not a homemade cloth.
[01:30:34.631 --> 01:30:40.554]  You took a cloth, then you gutted it, and you laid it in a suitcase to look like a f***ing bomb.
[01:30:40.854 --> 01:30:44.377]  Anybody in their right mind would have said that looks like a f***ing bomb.
[01:30:44.377 --> 01:30:51.061]  But because you're Arabic, we have to all sit around and bow down while you go eat at the White House with the Islam in chief.
[01:30:51.061 --> 01:30:53.703]  Hands across America for this clock boy.
[01:30:53.703 --> 01:30:54.364]  Negative.
[01:30:54.364 --> 01:30:56.926]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:57.666 --> 01:30:58.566]  Shower Filters.
[01:30:58.566 --> 01:31:00.307]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:31:00.307 --> 01:31:04.368]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[01:31:27.395 --> 01:31:30.916]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:39.159]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:39.159 --> 01:31:44.580]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:31:57.259 --> 01:31:59.321]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:31:59.321 --> 01:32:00.542]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:32:00.542 --> 01:32:02.123]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:32:02.123 --> 01:32:05.265]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:32:05.265 --> 01:32:06.346]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:07.287]  I've been working all day.
[01:32:07.287 --> 01:32:09.769]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:32:09.769 --> 01:32:11.190]  I get in here at 8 30.
[01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:13.091]  I was kind of run down.
[01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:15.053]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:32:15.053 --> 01:32:16.914]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:32:16.914 --> 01:32:18.756]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[01:32:18.756 --> 01:32:21.418]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[01:32:22.079 --> 01:32:23.760]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.522]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:32:25.522 --> 01:32:26.864]  People really love it.
[01:32:26.864 --> 01:32:27.465]  Read about it.
[01:32:27.465 --> 01:32:36.575]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:32:36.775 --> 01:32:40.796]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:32:40.796 --> 01:32:46.938]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:32:46.938 --> 01:32:52.840]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:01.343 --> 01:33:04.004]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:04.004 --> 01:33:10.785]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:24.788]  You know, I don't believe this conspiracy is a Nazi conspiracy.
[01:33:26.348 --> 01:33:35.130]  But the Nazis were carrying out the latest civilization control technologies in the world.
[01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:40.632]  They envisioned the 10-member EU that would expand in other countries.
[01:33:40.632 --> 01:33:48.474]  They wrote and talked about how they would put chemicals and things in food to slowly dumb down and poison populations before finally wiping them out, soft kill.
[01:33:50.495 --> 01:34:02.208]  They adopted from the Soviets, when they had a deal with them splitting Poland, they let them in and taught them how they put in up to 10 parts or higher per million of hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water.
[01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:04.530]  That's in, that's in like, rise and fall of the Third Reich, folks.
[01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:06.012]  That was in the Nuremberg trials.
[01:34:06.012 --> 01:34:06.492]  They would put...
[01:34:07.569 --> 01:34:15.557]  Uh, basically, uh, acid-based fluoride, weaponized fluoride in the water to make people docile and also lower fertility.
[01:34:15.557 --> 01:34:20.982]  And then we adopted that, our 68 gun control act, if taken except for five or six words, whole cloth.
[01:34:22.202 --> 01:34:28.248]  Senator Dodd, the late Senator Dodd, who was on the Nuremberg trial and changed her 68 gun control act.
[01:34:28.248 --> 01:34:42.741]  So, I guess the Hugo Boss, black uniforms or something, our elites thought that was really sexy and they got 34 to 36,000, the numbers vary, in the rat line of Nazis over here to run basically everything.
[01:34:42.741 --> 01:34:46.845]  The intelligence agencies, plus they were in very short leashes and lived on military bases.
[01:34:47.543 --> 01:34:48.163]  We're good to go.
[01:35:03.635 --> 01:35:15.182]  You know, oil fields and things, work for an oil company, and you'd have to go to a military base to go chicken fry a steak, and it would be like guys in there shooting their mouths off, oh, we really kicked your ass in the World War II, we'll kick your ass now, there'd be fights and stuff.
[01:35:15.182 --> 01:35:17.904]  Because that's how arrogant these people were.
[01:35:17.904 --> 01:35:27.490]  But see, it's our elites, ladies and gentlemen, it's our elites that are the ones that are so sick-minded they're doing this, the Tuskegee Experiment and all the rest of it, but think about it.
[01:35:28.251 --> 01:35:35.217]  I mean, I remember being a kid hearing my grandfather talk about all the damn Nazis, you know, at military bases after World War II and how much he hated them.
[01:35:35.217 --> 01:35:37.780]  And my mom would just go, he's a little eccentric.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.781]  But, you know, it was all true.
[01:35:39.904 --> 01:35:42.345]  So, that's what I'm getting at here.
[01:35:42.345 --> 01:35:48.308]  George Soros is a weird, freakazoid Nazi collaborator that helped round up thousands of people.
[01:35:48.308 --> 01:35:52.570]  He goes on 60 Minutes and says he's not ashamed of it, and the ADL gives him an award.
[01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:54.751]  With these people, it's all about perversion.
[01:35:54.751 --> 01:36:01.194]  To give a Jewish Nazi collaborator an award for being a Nazi war criminal, they think is really cute.
[01:36:01.194 --> 01:36:02.695]  Then they call Donald Trump a Nazi.
[01:36:02.695 --> 01:36:06.017]  The ADL came out this weekend and said, yeah, you're like a Nazi saying America first.
[01:36:08.123 --> 01:36:10.106]  Nationalism is Nazi.
[01:36:10.106 --> 01:36:13.011]  See, I mean, at a certain point you're like, shut up!
[01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:19.421]  Don't try to import Nazism onto me when you're into it up your eyeballs!
[01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:20.142]  Anyways, I'm ranting.
[01:36:20.142 --> 01:36:21.303]  I want to go to these phone calls.
[01:36:23.325 --> 01:36:35.273]  Please sign up for our free newsletter, exclusive articles, exclusive videos, things like that, because it's so easy for them to censor our platforms now, and a lot of times I'm sending exclusive videos and articles out just to the folks on email.
[01:36:35.273 --> 01:36:44.980]  It's one of the few areas we're deficient, we never really promoted or pushed, and now with all the censorship coming in, all the experts say go low, high tech, this is the equivalent of your shortwave radio of the future.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:48.323]  So, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:36:48.323 --> 01:36:52.225]  I want to go to calls here, Matt Bracken, a lot of amazing points, EnemiesForeignDomestic.com,
[01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.328]  How do people get in contact with you?
[01:36:55.328 --> 01:36:56.469]  Tell us about some of your books.
[01:36:56.469 --> 01:37:01.811]  I mean, let's do a plug for all things EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[01:37:01.811 --> 01:37:04.692]  My first three books are part of a trilogy.
[01:37:04.692 --> 01:37:06.392]  They take place in different places.
[01:37:06.392 --> 01:37:13.975]  Only a few characters hold over from one to the other, but they sort of follow an evolutionary narrative.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:19.322]  The second one is the one that's taking place in the Southwest.
[01:37:19.322 --> 01:37:25.726]  It looks like a lot of it's coming true today with the big street riots where people are waving Mexican flags.
[01:37:25.726 --> 01:37:34.391]  I've always tried, I guess my novels are really to encourage people to look behind the curtain for the masters of the super elites.
[01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:38.534]  I'm not saying that they run everything, but boy, they sure do run a lot, including media.
[01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:40.355]  And when you can't trust the media,
[01:37:41.124 --> 01:37:46.348]  I mean, you know, we're basically being brainwashed and most people are completely unaware of it.
[01:37:46.348 --> 01:37:58.457]  So it's up to those of us that see around the brainwashing, you know, to try to reach those of us, our friends and family that are reachable, and let them know that this is a very serious time right now.
[01:37:58.457 --> 01:37:59.438]  Extremely serious.
[01:37:59.438 --> 01:38:02.520]  The waves are already heading for the beach from several directions.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.083]  All this political squabbling, you know, it might seem, it might seem quaint.
[01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:13.246]  In a year or two, people might be saying, you know, can you believe we were worried about whether Hillary or Trump would be elected?
[01:38:13.246 --> 01:38:16.108]  As they're gathered around a barrel with trash in it, you know, for a fire.
[01:38:16.108 --> 01:38:23.113]  I mean, the elites that are engineering this burning down the house scenario.
[01:38:23.843 --> 01:38:28.005]  You know, they think that on the other end, no matter what, they're going to come back and be in charge again.
[01:38:28.005 --> 01:38:33.488]  And maybe they will, because they'll preserve their wealth through the disaster, through the emergencies.
[01:38:33.488 --> 01:38:37.991]  The first Baron Rothschild, he changed his name to that, by the way, it means Red Shield.
[01:38:39.521 --> 01:38:47.228]  The first Baron Rothschild, who wasn't really a Baron either, he said the time to buy is when the blood is running in the streets.
[01:38:47.228 --> 01:38:52.894]  He made a killing on Waterloo because his messengers got to England first with news of the battle results.
[01:38:52.894 --> 01:38:54.495]  These guys use war as a tool.
[01:38:56.014 --> 01:38:58.576]  And they planned to outlast everything.
[01:38:58.576 --> 01:39:02.700]  But this super cycle might be bigger than even, say, 1914 to 1918.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.363]  This might be bigger than World War II.
[01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:15.531]  We might look in history a century from now and see that World War I and World War II were sort of like precursor shocks to the big earthquake which is coming now.
[01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:22.947]  Because nothing is going to be a bigger societal earthquake than a grid down... Sure, just briefly though, you made an astute point about New Zealand, but also Chile.
[01:39:22.947 --> 01:39:35.758]  I know a lot of really, really rich people that are going into these mountainous, very beautiful redoubts where they're building their own little mini-cities with their own little towns, their own imported security forces for what's coming.
[01:39:35.758 --> 01:39:41.764]  And I've gone to, you know, elite events where I've been a speaker in things where, you know, there's billionaires, quite a few of them in attendance.
[01:39:42.304 --> 01:39:44.526]  And they're going, you need to come with your family to Chile.
[01:39:44.526 --> 01:39:45.908]  And they're bugging out down there.
[01:39:45.908 --> 01:39:47.570]  They're bugging out to New Zealand.
[01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:55.278]  And it is just over the top that I've never seen such a migration out of Israel, out of the U.S.
[01:39:55.278 --> 01:39:59.743]  These elites are leaving and they're going to, like you said, Chile.
[01:40:01.184 --> 01:40:08.151]  Places also like Australia and other areas, but especially New Zealand.
[01:40:08.151 --> 01:40:12.956]  So that shows to me they really think there's a big probability something huge is coming.
[01:40:15.367 --> 01:40:30.980]  I see them going for, you know, the safe places that they think that, and if they have a number of castles, you know, if they have a number, and I just, and not that these are survivalist retreats, but Clooney owns a giant mansion in Los Angeles, he owns a giant mansion in Italy on the water, and he owns a giant mansion in England.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:35.944]  So, you know, he can move, and he probably owns some things that are, aren't, he doesn't publicly show.
[01:40:35.944 --> 01:40:37.625]  And he's just an example.
[01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:39.547]  He's only a 200 millionaire.
[01:40:39.547 --> 01:40:42.489]  So imagine what the billionaires have for their preparations.
[01:40:42.489 --> 01:40:44.811]  But, and this is more or less directed to young people.
[01:40:45.566 --> 01:40:46.147]  Younger than me.
[01:41:04.406 --> 01:41:08.772]  Uh, read my short essay called, um, Get Yourself a 30-Footer and Go.
[01:41:08.772 --> 01:41:10.954]  Because there are some ways out.
[01:41:10.954 --> 01:41:21.608]  Everybody doesn't have to either be stuck in a city... I was about to say though, if you're in a big megacity, it's important to live right by the water, and like you said, have an escape boat or a sailboat, or a sailboat that's got a motor but also the sails.
[01:41:22.088 --> 01:41:22.928]  Well, right.
[01:41:22.928 --> 01:41:31.393]  When I say sailboat, I'm assuming that it has an inboard diesel that can go for hundreds of miles alone, even with no wind.
[01:41:31.393 --> 01:41:34.914]  Enough to get you way out of the reach of the cities.
[01:41:34.914 --> 01:41:39.917]  But there are ways to prepare and I think that
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.322]  We have to kind of just give up on the general media.
[01:41:43.322 --> 01:41:48.887]  You know, we still follow what they're saying on the networks as if, you know, what they're saying is newsworthy.
[01:41:48.887 --> 01:41:50.288]  And I think we have to abandon that.
[01:41:50.288 --> 01:41:58.054]  I get my own information from websites like yours, Western Rifle Shooters, Gates of Vienna, Vlad Tepes.
[01:41:58.054 --> 01:42:00.716]  There are fearless people out there working for nothing.
[01:42:00.716 --> 01:42:06.180]  They're not even inside of like a Breitbart type of a company with a salary.
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.022]  They're just doing it out of patriotism.
[01:42:08.702 --> 01:42:13.306]  And the information is out there and the ability to link is super important.
[01:42:13.306 --> 01:42:17.769]  I admire Breitbart because they allow links in their comment sections.
[01:42:17.769 --> 01:42:30.978]  This might not seem like a significant thing in America, but if you're in Europe where you can be arrested for posting something on Facebook that, hey, I don't like these, you know, all these Muslims pushing their women around, you can be, you know, called in for talking to in Europe.
[01:42:31.418 --> 01:42:39.911]  So, being able to spread links is how, that's sort of the modern version of Russian or Soviet samizdat, or the pamphlets of... Sure, sure.
[01:42:39.911 --> 01:42:47.462]  Well, Zuckerberg, as you know, he's been meeting with the communist Chinese censorship bosses, and they've announced at Silicon Valley meetings, they want to get rid of comments altogether because...
[01:42:47.842 --> 01:42:50.944]  It's just showing no one agrees, and they've already gotten rid of the links.
[01:42:50.944 --> 01:42:53.646]  So yes, these are serious issues we're talking about.
[01:42:53.646 --> 01:42:57.869]  I want to have you back in a few weeks again to talk about what the breakdown in cities will probably look like.
[01:42:57.869 --> 01:43:02.713]  I know they've done military studies around the world, but within 9-10 days, most people will start murdering for food.
[01:43:02.713 --> 01:43:06.836]  Within about 15-16 days, 90-plus percent will start becoming cannibals.
[01:43:06.836 --> 01:43:10.178]  I mean, we're talking about a Viggo Mortensen road scenario within a month.
[01:43:10.178 --> 01:43:10.959]  Yes.
[01:43:10.959 --> 01:43:12.120]  And people just don't understand that.
[01:43:12.768 --> 01:43:14.368]  A true bottleneck event.
[01:43:14.368 --> 01:43:27.352]  I wrote something that was maybe one of my most, it's funny because I'm not like in any of the legit, you know, name brand websites where they have to make sure that you're going to stay on message and not be a loose cannon, not rock the boat.
[01:43:27.352 --> 01:43:30.553]  I like rocking the boat and I like, you know, I've always been a loose cannon.
[01:43:30.553 --> 01:43:33.974]  So I find a good home at some places that just take what I write.
[01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:39.236]  But if you, and I don't care where they are relinked, I say relink everything, post stuff in whole, I don't care.
[01:43:40.845 --> 01:43:44.567]  I did put my first, I put a couple of my books on free on Amazon.
[01:43:44.567 --> 01:43:47.269]  For some reason I couldn't do it until starting tomorrow.
[01:43:47.269 --> 01:43:50.071]  But a couple of my books will be free on Amazon tomorrow.
[01:43:50.071 --> 01:43:53.053]  Just, if anybody's that broke, you know, you can download them.
[01:43:53.053 --> 01:43:54.714]  I'll tell you, it is a freeing feeling, though.
[01:43:54.714 --> 01:43:57.696]  It's not, I mean, because I always never worshipped money, but now I don't even care.
[01:43:57.696 --> 01:44:04.140]  I just want to get the word out and stop this and, or save as many people as I can and just get my ass ready and get right with God.
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.020]  What's the point?
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:05.700]  What's the point?
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.221]  You know, we're like,
[01:44:06.881 --> 01:44:08.022]  We're good to go.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:28.521]  We're going to go ahead and talk to Andrew.
[01:44:28.521 --> 01:44:31.783]  We're going to talk to Joseph, Billy, Shane, Crystal, everybody right now.
[01:44:31.783 --> 01:44:36.466]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Ohio.
[01:44:36.466 --> 01:44:37.046]  You're on the air.
[01:44:37.046 --> 01:44:38.607]  Go ahead.
[01:44:38.607 --> 01:44:39.347]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:44:39.347 --> 01:44:40.488]  It's great to talk to you today.
[01:44:42.259 --> 01:45:00.588]  Thanks, I just wanted to ask Mr. Bracken about what he thought about the Dreamer riots in California, and I was listening to your guys' analogy about the Wizard of Oz earlier, and it was really funny, and I bet another analogy could be made about these Dreamer riots, basically like the munchkins being told to turn on Dorothy as she's trying to free the land of Oz.
[01:45:02.074 --> 01:45:04.937]  Sure, but these guys are ideological.
[01:45:04.937 --> 01:45:17.628]  You have to understand, we have gone so far, just to isolate Southwest for example, every university, every college the last 40 years has had a very strong Mecha outfit.
[01:45:17.628 --> 01:45:25.575]  Imagine a group called the White Student Union and their symbol is a lit dynamite bomb.
[01:45:25.575 --> 01:45:27.977]  And the word means fuse, Mecha.
[01:45:28.866 --> 01:45:31.427]  I mean, just imagine that.
[01:45:31.427 --> 01:45:35.008]  La Raza means the race.
[01:45:35.008 --> 01:45:36.328]  La Raza is the race.
[01:45:36.328 --> 01:45:40.349]  Mecha is fused with a lit dynamite bomb logo.
[01:45:40.349 --> 01:45:44.271]  Well, for 40 years, university students have been graduating.
[01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:45.111]  They're now U.S.
[01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:45.671]  attorneys.
[01:45:45.671 --> 01:45:46.871]  They're judges.
[01:45:46.871 --> 01:45:48.472]  They're mayors of towns.
[01:45:49.167 --> 01:45:58.273]  You are never going to close the border if the mayor of an adjoining town is a traitor who is pipelining drugs and criminals through his territory.
[01:46:19.828 --> 01:46:24.853]  The people in La Raza and Mecha believe completely in Marxism.
[01:46:24.853 --> 01:46:31.700]  They are Marxists, they're pro-Palestinian, they're all the left-wing causes, you know, anti-Islamophobia, quote-unquote.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.083]  But they are really hating big-time on Whitey.
[01:46:35.083 --> 01:46:37.726]  Look up the plan of Asplund.
[01:46:37.726 --> 01:46:41.510]  They actually have a plan of San Diego.
[01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:42.471]  You meant the plan of San Diego?
[01:46:43.596 --> 01:46:44.257]  Exactly.
[01:46:44.257 --> 01:46:47.379]  Or called the Plan de Azklan, but Plan of San Diego.
[01:46:47.379 --> 01:46:48.239]  Exactly.
[01:46:48.239 --> 01:46:50.661]  And they make no bones about it.
[01:46:50.661 --> 01:46:52.942]  They're going to wipe out the white guys.
[01:46:52.942 --> 01:46:54.263]  You know, it's the brown race.
[01:46:54.263 --> 01:46:56.825]  It's the new bronze race, which is ridiculous.
[01:46:56.825 --> 01:47:00.067]  I wrote something else called The True History of the Southwest 101.
[01:47:00.067 --> 01:47:02.968]  You know, the Spanish came in as conquistadors.
[01:47:02.968 --> 01:47:04.389]  They weren't loving on the Indians.
[01:47:04.389 --> 01:47:05.090]  They burned them.
[01:47:06.411 --> 01:47:08.053]  No, it's terrible.
[01:47:08.053 --> 01:47:11.278]  But that's what I mean, though, is that it's just all twisted history.
[01:47:11.278 --> 01:47:12.860]  It's not even real.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:19.929]  And this whole Oslon plan is like a twisted German-Austrian-Hungarian empire World War I manipulation.
[01:47:19.929 --> 01:47:21.971]  It's like an old battle plan still running.
[01:47:22.975 --> 01:47:24.456]  I'm confusing the plan of San Diego.
[01:47:24.456 --> 01:47:26.436]  The plan of Aslan.
[01:47:26.436 --> 01:47:28.177]  Yes.
[01:47:28.177 --> 01:47:30.758]  This is what they still have as the Constitution.
[01:47:30.758 --> 01:47:32.799]  I'm not going to plan Aslan, absolutely.
[01:47:32.799 --> 01:47:34.060]  But it all interfaces.
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:34.660]  Thank you, Andrew.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:35.580]  Let's get in one more here.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.721]  If we're going to break.
[01:47:36.721 --> 01:47:37.821]  Billy in Texas.
[01:47:37.821 --> 01:47:38.621]  Billy, you're on the air.
[01:47:38.621 --> 01:47:38.962]  Go ahead.
[01:47:38.962 --> 01:47:41.343]  Yeah.
[01:47:41.343 --> 01:47:42.263]  Go ahead, Billy.
[01:47:43.257 --> 01:47:45.780]  I just wanted to ask Matt what he thought.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:48:00.358]  I was reading up on the MECHA organization earlier and I couldn't help but make a connection between what Judicial Watch has been saying and what you guys have been saying about the Muslims coming in, the radical Wahhabis, I'm sorry, coming in across the border.
[01:48:01.344 --> 01:48:07.729]  And also the radicalization, how prone are these social justice warriors to radical Wahhabis?
[01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:11.552]  You have to understand that it doesn't matter that women are chained up like dogs.
[01:48:11.552 --> 01:48:14.054]  It doesn't matter that they make them wear bags over their heads.
[01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:18.178]  It doesn't matter if they execute gay people or the communist Chinese kill gays.
[01:48:18.178 --> 01:48:24.423]  They don't care because it's anti-American, anti-West, so it must be good.
[01:48:24.423 --> 01:48:26.585]  They don't care that weird, twisted, sicko,
[01:48:27.265 --> 01:48:30.306]  Billionaires are running it all and laughing at them.
[01:48:30.306 --> 01:48:36.288]  It's just, look, it is the way to sabotage all these immigrants and others that never actually go up in society.
[01:48:36.288 --> 01:48:37.748]  It's meant to balkanize.
[01:48:37.748 --> 01:48:38.809]  It's a destabilization.
[01:48:38.809 --> 01:48:40.849]  It's a destabilization program.
[01:48:40.849 --> 01:48:42.230]  It's intentional.
[01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:46.951]  It's like putting so many people in the life raft that it has to tip over and send everybody into the water.
[01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:47.731]  That's it.
[01:48:47.731 --> 01:48:50.392]  You're saying, oh, we need to put 10 more refugees in the life raft.
[01:48:50.392 --> 01:48:53.133]  You say, it's only one inch above the waterline.
[01:48:53.133 --> 01:48:54.894]  No, we have to put 10 more in.
[01:48:54.894 --> 01:48:56.174]  Or you're a bigot and a racist.
[01:48:57.119 --> 01:49:01.441]  The plan is to turn over the life raft and put everybody in the water.
[01:49:01.441 --> 01:49:02.662]  They're gearing up for it.
[01:49:02.662 --> 01:49:05.083]  Anything else, Billy?
[01:49:05.083 --> 01:49:07.064]  I just wanted to say I really support you guys.
[01:49:07.064 --> 01:49:10.545]  Just come up for a sample of our product and support my Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[01:49:10.545 --> 01:49:11.426]  And God bless you.
[01:49:11.426 --> 01:49:12.406]  Thank you guys for everything you're doing.
[01:49:16.567 --> 01:49:17.628]  Alright, God bless you sir.
[01:49:17.628 --> 01:49:18.689]  I appreciate the call Billy.
[01:49:18.689 --> 01:49:19.810]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:22.572]  I'm going to skip this network break because it's so important.
[01:49:22.572 --> 01:49:27.056]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in Pennsylvania.
[01:49:27.056 --> 01:49:28.978]  Go ahead.
[01:49:28.978 --> 01:49:29.718]  Hello Alex.
[01:49:29.718 --> 01:49:31.500]  Hello Mr. Bracken.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:31.880]  Welcome.
[01:49:33.263 --> 01:49:34.804]  You and your guests are unbelievable.
[01:49:34.804 --> 01:49:38.547]  From Bracken to Billy Corgan to Roger Stone to everyone.
[01:49:38.547 --> 01:49:40.108]  It's unreal and I thank you.
[01:49:40.108 --> 01:49:41.269]  Well we're all discredited.
[01:49:41.269 --> 01:49:43.011]  That's why we're exploding and they're dying.
[01:49:43.011 --> 01:49:44.151]  We're discredited!
[01:49:44.151 --> 01:49:46.113]  Fox News and CNN said I'm discredited.
[01:49:46.113 --> 01:49:49.275]  Oh no!
[01:49:49.275 --> 01:49:53.679]  Learn more in 10 minutes from Matt Bracken than I can learn in 10 years on the television.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:50:02.166]  Now it is kind of fun to watch the ladies cross their legs and uncross them, but yeah, other than that, you know, there's better stuff than that on the internet.
[01:50:02.166 --> 01:50:03.267]  I want to go see that stuff.
[01:50:03.267 --> 01:50:05.128]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:05.128 --> 01:50:19.680]  Well, I just would like Matt and you to talk about the troops that the UN just put on the Russian border and the other aggressive maneuver that was made to the C-130 by the Russian fighter jet, I believe two days ago or something like that, the barrel roll.
[01:50:21.035 --> 01:50:22.156]  That's happened a bunch.
[01:50:22.156 --> 01:50:25.879]  Yeah, what do you make of NATO's moves and like Fox News?
[01:50:25.879 --> 01:50:28.561]  I mean, I'm not saying Russia's perfect, but they've got two or three bases.
[01:50:28.561 --> 01:50:29.482]  We've got hundreds.
[01:50:29.482 --> 01:50:30.543]  They're moving troops in.
[01:50:30.543 --> 01:50:36.187]  They ran the color revolution there two years ago in Ukraine, trying to put crazy right-wingers in.
[01:50:36.187 --> 01:50:43.433]  They're playing Catholic off against Orthodox, using again sociology, classic anthropology tactics, admitting they spent $5 billion to do it.
[01:50:43.433 --> 01:50:45.435]  George Soros, again, quarterbacking it, as usual.
[01:50:45.695 --> 01:50:46.215]  Ukraine.
[01:50:46.215 --> 01:50:47.916]  Ukraine was a destabilization op.
[01:50:47.916 --> 01:50:52.017]  If you want to see what they're planning here, look at other destabilization ops.
[01:50:52.017 --> 01:50:54.198]  They're using a playbook.
[01:50:54.198 --> 01:50:55.539]  You can see what's going to happen.
[01:50:55.539 --> 01:51:02.001]  Yeah, they did destabilization all over Africa and the Middle East, but radical jihadists didn't.
[01:51:02.001 --> 01:51:04.642]  I mean, so why do they want this destabilization?
[01:51:04.642 --> 01:51:06.023]  They already pretty much run the world.
[01:51:06.023 --> 01:51:08.204]  Why are they doing something so dangerous?
[01:51:08.204 --> 01:51:11.185]  Because they're going to hit, we're going to hit the wall.
[01:51:11.972 --> 01:51:14.633]  Mathematics, you can't escape from mathematics.
[01:51:14.633 --> 01:51:16.574]  You can't fudge mathematics.
[01:51:16.574 --> 01:51:18.455]  You can't pretend that 2 plus 2 equals infinity.
[01:51:18.455 --> 01:51:19.315]  There's the end of the debt
[01:51:30.246 --> 01:51:30.366]  Okay.
[01:51:53.223 --> 01:51:55.164]  A little sticky from running in the streets.
[01:51:55.164 --> 01:51:56.204]  Rothschild there.
[01:51:56.204 --> 01:52:01.246]  They're gonna fly back and pick up some more castles and estates at fire sale prices.
[01:52:01.246 --> 01:52:04.468]  Now, if a few countries go completely, you know, haywire, that's alright.
[01:52:04.468 --> 01:52:06.889]  There's plenty of other countries and plenty of more castles.
[01:52:06.889 --> 01:52:07.209]  No, that's it.
[01:52:07.209 --> 01:52:11.591]  Just like in Goodfellas, when they've maxed out the bar and everything they can, they burn the sucker down.
[01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:14.412]  This is almost a scorched earth retreat.
[01:52:14.412 --> 01:52:15.553]  That's what it is.
[01:52:15.553 --> 01:52:17.914]  It's a mafia burnout.
[01:52:17.914 --> 01:52:20.015]  It's a mafia takedown.
[01:52:20.015 --> 01:52:20.995]  They're crashing it.
[01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:32.239]  Then they can blame external forces, acts of God, oh it was a war, but don't worry, when it's all over we'll fly back in and pick up the best castles at dirt cheap prices.
[01:52:32.239 --> 01:52:33.100]  You know what?
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:42.788]  They could have pulled this stuff off before and they've gotten away with it a little bit, but the fact that this is already, the message has already gone out, the books are written, people are saving these videos, no matter what they do,
[01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:46.834]  We're going to reconstitute this country and others, and we're going to go get them.
[01:52:46.834 --> 01:52:48.575]  And this time there won't be a George Seale.
[01:52:48.575 --> 01:52:55.221]  There'll be a rest of 97-year-old guard, because some document said their name was similar, and take them to Israel as a Nazi.
[01:52:55.221 --> 01:52:57.203]  And then the ADL gives awards to real Nazis.
[01:52:57.203 --> 01:53:03.049]  I mean, if they're not going to get away with it this time, I guarantee you they have gone too far pulling this off.
[01:53:03.049 --> 01:53:08.153]  And I guarantee you the elites and their stinking families that are involved in it are going to pay.
[01:53:08.153 --> 01:53:09.375]  And I think it's important to let them know.
[01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:15.753]  It's like warning the Nazis.
[01:53:15.753 --> 01:53:23.976]  In certain circumstances, even POWs warned their bosses, look, you can see how the war is going.
[01:53:23.976 --> 01:53:25.516]  You can't kill us all.
[01:53:25.516 --> 01:53:26.997]  At the end, there's going to be trials.
[01:53:28.732 --> 01:53:30.573]  I don't know what the end of this looks like.
[01:53:30.573 --> 01:53:34.374]  If it's a true bottleneck event, we could wind up in a new dark age.
[01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:37.535]  A plan to ride a tiger is not the same as riding a tiger.
[01:53:37.535 --> 01:53:44.377]  A plan to burn down the house and then, you know, buy the ashes for pennies on the dollar, it might not work out that way.
[01:53:44.377 --> 01:53:46.377]  We could enter a new dark age.
[01:53:46.377 --> 01:53:55.860]  In terms of cycles, you could say the biggest cycle, the one cycle, is mankind going from hunter-gatherer to modern man.
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:58.381]  First, he had to master mass agriculture.
[01:53:59.216 --> 01:54:01.379]  Once he did that, a city became possible.
[01:54:01.379 --> 01:54:03.602]  They domesticated first plants, then animals.
[01:54:03.602 --> 01:54:13.134]  It's taken 8,000 years to get to this point, bare minimum, and now it's so unstable, all elites, all statisticians, all main engineers admit it.
[01:54:13.134 --> 01:54:15.397]  It's teetering, even if we try to keep it together.
[01:54:15.737 --> 01:54:19.399]  And the fact that they're trying to use crisis to consolidate is the craziest.
[01:54:19.399 --> 01:54:20.040]  Look, look, look.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:31.547]  It's like the Deepwater Horizon, it's been confirmed, was ordered to dump seawater in because an executive knew they could save a million dollars an hour, basically, with the amount of concrete and mud they were dumping in.
[01:54:31.547 --> 01:54:33.389]  And they had multiple crews quit.
[01:54:33.389 --> 01:54:37.591]  So they put a crew on that would say, OK, dump water on it.
[01:54:37.591 --> 01:54:41.174]  You know, some guy in Houston says so, because some guy in London gave him an order.
[01:54:41.994 --> 01:54:47.096]  It's like, no, the engineers know, you do not dump seawater in there to pressurize it.
[01:54:47.096 --> 01:54:48.156]  I mean, it's delusion.
[01:54:48.156 --> 01:54:49.597]  Just to save a buck.
[01:54:49.597 --> 01:54:50.477]  Just to save a buck.
[01:54:50.477 --> 01:55:07.843]  But, you know, when this crisis happens, if it becomes irrevocable, I mean, you almost would say a Stalinist North Korea 1984 would be better than a total grid-down Mad Max with every other nuclear plant going Fukushima, going Chernobyl.
[01:55:08.678 --> 01:55:14.822]  I mean, if the plants, if the staff at the nuke plants, they have families too.
[01:55:14.822 --> 01:55:18.165]  They're not just going to altruistically chain themselves to their position.
[01:55:18.165 --> 01:55:20.927]  And in three weeks they all blow up.
[01:55:20.927 --> 01:55:21.787]  Or whatever it is.
[01:55:21.787 --> 01:55:23.428]  I mean, I haven't heard definitively.
[01:55:23.428 --> 01:55:26.551]  I've had the engineers on the pending, it's two to four weeks.
[01:55:26.551 --> 01:55:27.591]  It's not sounding good.
[01:55:29.321 --> 01:55:31.823]  There won't even be a response like the Russians.
[01:55:31.823 --> 01:55:35.146]  The Soviets were able to... I mean, very heroic Soviets.
[01:55:35.146 --> 01:55:40.010]  You can say what you want about the Russians, but they have very brave men and women.
[01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:48.477]  They put hundreds and hundreds of firefighters and other great people on the roof of that building, glowing building, to work for two or three minutes.
[01:55:48.477 --> 01:55:50.919]  They're all dead in a year.
[01:55:50.919 --> 01:55:53.401]  And it took that just to cap that sucker.
[01:55:54.278 --> 01:56:00.902]  If we have runaway nukes, who's gonna, in a grid-down scenario, there's nobody organizing a rescue of these nuclear plants.
[01:56:00.902 --> 01:56:07.686]  They're just... That's why I talk about it's so dangerous, the phenomenon where people don't help each other anymore when someone's run over in the street or a woman's been raped.
[01:56:07.686 --> 01:56:09.587]  People think it's so cute to only care about themselves.
[01:56:10.767 --> 01:56:22.176]  7 million people in major university studies starved to death or via malnutrition associated with malnutrition during the Great Depression here, and 90% of us were agrarian, and more than half of those were totally self-sufficient.
[01:56:22.176 --> 01:56:23.517]  We are now reverse numbers.
[01:56:23.517 --> 01:56:26.819]  89% urban, 11% rural, 5.5% half of them are self-sufficient.
[01:56:26.819 --> 01:56:28.880]  My God, 5.5% self-sufficient versus 60%, 50%, I mean we're talking time bomb.
[01:56:36.926 --> 01:56:40.769]  Yeah, I say, I say, how much food do they grow inside of your beltway?
[01:56:40.769 --> 01:56:45.453]  Because that's the only food you're going to have maybe for years or at least months.
[01:56:45.453 --> 01:56:50.638]  Best case scenario, you might have to figure out, how do I survive for just a few months?
[01:56:50.638 --> 01:56:55.182]  You know, when the Pilgrims came over, some of their first colonies were lost due to starvation.
[01:56:55.182 --> 01:56:56.723]  Jamestown, all of them, everybody died.
[01:56:57.364 --> 01:57:02.451]  Right, and if you have a giant city, the people aren't going to stay in the city and die.
[01:57:02.451 --> 01:57:10.303]  One of the little essays I wrote in a collection called Trapping Feral Pigs and Other Parables of Modern Life
[01:57:11.754 --> 01:57:18.436]  The lemmings don't stay on the island where they overbred because of a great summer, lots of grass seeds.
[01:57:18.436 --> 01:57:19.877]  They don't stay on the island.
[01:57:19.877 --> 01:57:21.457]  They bust out of there.
[01:57:21.457 --> 01:57:37.502]  When grasshoppers, which are the same as a locust, a grasshopper is a locust, but when a grasshopper population gets up so high that they begin touching each other, releases hormones, they turn into these big armored war, you know, flying war insects called locusts.
[01:57:38.388 --> 01:57:40.370]  They do not stay and die.
[01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:42.993]  So we're going to see some very radical transformations.
[01:57:42.993 --> 01:57:46.197]  When cities are starving, it's going to be very dangerous.
[01:57:46.197 --> 01:57:50.422]  Within months, there's going to be all sorts of, if this happens, warlords will rise up.
[01:57:50.422 --> 01:57:52.944]  There'll be 50 armored vehicles coming down your street.
[01:57:52.944 --> 01:57:53.946]  Heads on pikes.
[01:57:53.946 --> 01:57:55.007]  I mean, it's going to be hell on earth.
[01:57:55.737 --> 01:57:56.258]  It will be.
[01:57:56.258 --> 01:58:03.508]  And that's why, if people are fit and can take the ocean, get yourself a 30-footer and go.
[01:58:03.508 --> 01:58:06.172]  If you have a little bit more money, get a 40 or a 50-footer.
[01:58:06.172 --> 01:58:10.679]  But even if you're a broke teenager, you can rehab a 30-footer that you get for nothing.
[01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:15.051]  Well, it's what everybody wants.
[01:58:15.051 --> 01:58:27.836]  There's some type of weird racial consciousness that want collapse and destruction, and there's a lot of little nobodies that want to be rulers, so they've imagined how they're gonna put on little black uniforms and be in the new commie brigade, and all you're gonna get is your gut stomped out.
[01:58:27.836 --> 01:58:31.697]  We'll be back in 60 seconds to finish a few final calls from Crystal and others.
[01:58:31.697 --> 01:58:34.278]  For our guest, Matt Bracken, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:34.278 --> 01:58:35.499]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[01:58:35.499 --> 01:58:39.100]  David Knight's coming up.

[01:59:50.018 --> 02:00:01.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.366 --> 02:00:07.990]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:13.033]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.033 --> 02:00:14.735]  This just in from WorldNet Daily.
[02:00:16.332 --> 02:00:28.464]  Dr. Corsi, Feds suppressing draft criminal indictment against Hillary, this after the State Department's own Inspector General found significant security risk and then Hillary Clinton lied, repeated lewd.
[02:00:28.464 --> 02:00:38.334]  Ron Paul's coming up to be discussing this and a lot more here in a moment, but look, let's play that clip one more time where they're talking about Donald Trump and the whole debate.
[02:00:39.364 --> 02:00:41.165]  They were on the stage with him.
[02:00:41.165 --> 02:00:42.425]  He would stab him and keep stabbing him.
[02:00:42.425 --> 02:00:43.945]  It's clearly who he's talking about.
[02:00:43.945 --> 02:00:46.866]  The New York Times has had people call for him to be killed.
[02:00:46.866 --> 02:00:50.367]  They leave stuff up on Twitter and Facebook saying kill him, kill Trump.
[02:00:50.367 --> 02:00:56.829]  But now none of that exists and now he's had this writer on where they discussed killing him.
[02:00:58.524 --> 02:01:01.605]  And said, you know, a good patriot needs to stand up and do this.
[02:01:01.605 --> 02:01:14.031]  And when they come out and Drudge links to an article about it, they say Drudge is evil and Drudge is a horrible person and a piece of garbage, close quote, because he even linked to a news article about it.
[02:01:14.031 --> 02:01:21.274]  Beck calls Drudge evil for suggesting he advocated a patriot killed Donald Trump, co-host, labels news icon, despicable, lying scumbag.
[02:01:22.079 --> 02:01:31.808]  When Beck sensationally labeled Matt Drudge evil for linking to a post that suggested Beck and his guest on his radio show advocated a patriot assassinate Donald Trump if he becomes president.
[02:01:31.808 --> 02:01:42.918]  The American Mirror characterized Beck's discussion with best-selling author Brad Thor as an agreement between the two that the only way to get Trump out of office was to apparently kill him.
[02:01:42.918 --> 02:01:46.181]  And you can tell they're scripting it as to not get in trouble with the Secret Service.
[02:01:46.801 --> 02:01:51.544]  And they say, let's just hypothetically, in a literary way, you know, talk about this.
[02:01:51.544 --> 02:01:56.326]  You know, if Congress won't stop him, then we need somebody else to, you know, a patriot.
[02:01:56.326 --> 02:01:59.128]  This is really creepy, folks.
[02:01:59.128 --> 02:02:05.851]  So let's play Beck one more time from a few months ago at CPAC, and then let's play the latest one.
[02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:08.273]  And each time he denies that's even what he's saying.
[02:02:08.273 --> 02:02:08.593]  Here it is.
[02:02:09.585 --> 02:02:13.988]  If I were on the stage, I would have said, have you been listening to him tonight?
[02:02:13.988 --> 02:02:14.549]  Yeah, right.
[02:02:14.549 --> 02:02:16.390]  Have you been listening to what I say about him?
[02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:18.411]  And also, why would you be sitting in someone's shoes?
[02:02:18.411 --> 02:02:19.972]  I believe these things.
[02:02:19.972 --> 02:02:21.894]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:21.894 --> 02:02:23.215]  You can't sit in their shoes.
[02:02:23.215 --> 02:02:24.896]  I mean, what does he have, gigantic shoes?
[02:02:24.896 --> 02:02:28.018]  Oh man, if I were close enough and I had a knife.
[02:02:28.018 --> 02:02:32.441]  Really, I mean, the stabbing just wouldn't stop.
[02:02:32.441 --> 02:02:33.622]  Okay, it's in full.
[02:02:35.222 --> 02:02:37.003]  Context on Infowars.com.
[02:02:37.003 --> 02:02:41.444]  They're talking about Trump and how everybody should be against him and never Trump, and then they segue.
[02:02:41.444 --> 02:02:44.305]  But for time, I'm just showing the clip where he talks about stabbing him.
[02:02:44.305 --> 02:02:57.970]  Now, this audio is really not that great, because I guess it is the Glenn Beck Show, but Richard Reeves is on the road covering politics, and he was listening to it, following it, and monitoring enemy transmissions, and actually caught video of this audio for you.
[02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:02.652]  The full, in context, is up on Infowars.com, but here's a shorter clip of it.
[02:03:04.355 --> 02:03:08.260]  We have talked about it before.
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:12.346]  We have seen it time and time again, but it's getting worse.
[02:03:12.346 --> 02:03:18.534]  Here's Jake Tapper on the latest National Enquirer angle.
[02:03:18.534 --> 02:03:18.995]  Once again,
[02:03:19.415 --> 02:03:28.883]  Journalists are in the unhappy predicament of trying to decide whether and how to cover false allegations raised by a candidate for President of the United States.
[02:03:28.883 --> 02:03:37.431]  This time, in the midst of Donald Trump's attacks on the Clintons using various scandals and accusations of Bill and Hillary Clintons until his tragic suicide in July 1993, Foster
[02:03:39.292 --> 02:03:48.947]  ...who suffered from depression, drove to Fort Marcy Park in Virginia, walked into the park with an older driver... Okay, we're going to fade this down because of the time constraints, but you can see the full video, then he says what a great job he's doing.
[02:03:48.947 --> 02:03:51.310]  Here's the Thor comment, also...
[02:03:52.718 --> 02:03:53.599]  We're good to go.
[02:04:12.291 --> 02:04:22.700]  If he oversteps his mandate as president, his constitutional granted authority, I should say, as president, if he oversteps that, how do we get him out of office?
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:26.484]  And I don't think there is a legal means available.
[02:04:26.484 --> 02:04:34.931]  I think it will be a terrible, terrible position the American people will be in to get Trump out of office, because you won't be able to do it through Congress.
[02:04:34.931 --> 02:04:36.973]  Oh, I would agree with you on that.
[02:04:38.795 --> 02:04:43.700]  So, again, they're the ones that started the fights with Matt Drudge and everybody.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:46.463]  They're the people that are going after Trump.
[02:04:46.463 --> 02:04:48.204]  Those people are going after populism.
[02:04:48.204 --> 02:04:52.809]  He's the guy that goes and gives, you know, teddy bears to the illegals and all the rest of it.
[02:04:52.809 --> 02:04:55.071]  Will he give teddy bears to the troops that are being euthanized?
[02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:55.832]  I mean, it's all stunts.
[02:04:57.611 --> 02:05:01.253]  Does 2016 feel more like 1984 to you?
[02:05:01.253 --> 02:05:11.560]  Life is certainly imitating art, with Uber's announcement that its fleet of more than 1 million drivers will now be tracked, traced, and henpecked throughout every ride they provide.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:18.485]  This is the next step toward totalitarian control of transportation and the end of individual autonomy on our roads.
[02:05:18.485 --> 02:05:27.511]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the ride-sharing app has launched new and invasive technology called Telematics, which records drivers' behaviors behind the wheel.
[02:05:27.771 --> 02:05:36.958]  When a driver exceeds the speed limit, brakes abruptly, cuts corners, or sends a text while driving, Uber alerts the driver of their mistake in real time.
[02:05:36.958 --> 02:05:41.742]  In the future, drivers who receive low scores throughout their driving history may be penalized.
[02:05:41.742 --> 02:05:51.569]  In addition, negative driving data, such as speeding, could easily be sent to law enforcement to enhance the tactics they use to pilfer the public through draconian fines.
[02:05:51.569 --> 02:05:53.010]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[02:05:53.010 --> 02:05:56.733]  Stay tuned for more special reports at InfoWars.com.

[02:06:57.191 --> 02:07:01.153]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:07:01.153 --> 02:07:07.456]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:07.456 --> 02:07:14.439]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:14.739 --> 02:07:23.868]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:07:23.868 --> 02:07:30.034]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:30.034 --> 02:07:34.879]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:07:34.879 --> 02:07:38.202]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:07:38.442 --> 02:07:40.343]  No needles, no injections.
[02:07:40.343 --> 02:07:41.983]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:07:41.983 --> 02:07:43.183]  Try it for yourself.
[02:07:43.183 --> 02:07:44.424]  Discover the secret.

[02:07:50.685 --> 02:07:51.045]  Secret 12.
[02:07:59.793 --> 02:08:05.376]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.376 --> 02:08:12.080]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:15.802]  We live in an incredible time, to say the least.
[02:08:15.802 --> 02:08:19.624]  We are seeing so many good things happen, but also so many bad things.
[02:08:19.624 --> 02:08:28.169]  We're seeing the Associated Press come out with a national poll a month ago, showing that 6% of news consumers trust mainstream media.
[02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:36.698]  We're seeing the ratings go from bad to worse at CNN and MSNBC and so many other platforms.
[02:08:36.698 --> 02:08:41.684]  Fox to even stay pertinent has to be Ron Paul slash Alex Jones Lite.
[02:08:42.941 --> 02:08:47.825]  And of course, Ron Paul's launched, in the last few years, his own radio TV network, now reaching tens of millions a month.
[02:08:47.825 --> 02:08:49.186]  We're doing the same thing.
[02:08:49.186 --> 02:08:53.770]  Competition is absolutely beautiful for a free market and an open society.
[02:08:53.770 --> 02:08:57.694]  That's why John D. Rockefeller called it a sin, famously.
[02:08:57.694 --> 02:09:08.263]  So I want to talk about these moves by the Federal Elections Commission Deputy Chair to try to censor the Internet, starting with Matt Drudge, and then talk radio, starting with Rush Limbaugh.
[02:09:09.008 --> 02:09:13.610]  Because if they can take down Matt Drudge or Rush Limbaugh, folks, they can take down anybody's free speech.
[02:09:13.610 --> 02:09:16.651]  And believe me, they have been eyeing Campaign for Liberty.
[02:09:16.651 --> 02:09:18.411]  They've been eyeing Infowars.
[02:09:18.411 --> 02:09:22.693]  They've been eyeing Ron Paul's private media operations because they're so effective.
[02:09:22.693 --> 02:09:30.675]  So I wanted to speak with the former congressman and medical doctor and really the torchbearer worldwide for libertarian ideas in my view.
[02:09:30.675 --> 02:09:31.516]  I think that's undisputed.
[02:09:32.336 --> 02:09:36.142]  About where he sees the world right now and what the establishment is going to do.
[02:09:36.142 --> 02:09:40.508]  Also, the big central banks are moving to try to abolish cash.
[02:09:40.508 --> 02:09:43.392]  He, for decades, tried to get the bill passed.
[02:09:43.392 --> 02:09:48.779]  It's very close to passing finally, after not even having any co-sponsors a few decades ago, to audit the Fed.
[02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:53.832]  It seems liberty's on the march, but also tyranny's on the rise.
[02:09:53.832 --> 02:09:56.293]  The best of times, worst of times.
[02:09:56.293 --> 02:09:58.733]  And we'll talk about Campaign 2016 and more.
[02:09:58.733 --> 02:10:01.454]  Dr. Paul, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:10:01.454 --> 02:10:01.994]  You look great.
[02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:05.135]  It's good to have you with us via your Skype connection.
[02:10:05.135 --> 02:10:05.735]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:05.735 --> 02:10:07.495]  Good to see you today.
[02:10:07.495 --> 02:10:09.656]  We've got about a two or three second delay, so I'll try to just...
[02:10:11.405 --> 02:10:14.009]  Not jump in too much, just with a few questions.
[02:10:14.009 --> 02:10:15.491]  You heard what I threw out.
[02:10:15.491 --> 02:10:16.493]  Where would you like to start?
[02:10:16.493 --> 02:10:18.235]  With the moves to censor?
[02:10:18.235 --> 02:10:23.783]  I don't think I've ever seen, with Facebook and all the rest of them being caught, censorship of this magnitude.
[02:10:24.434 --> 02:10:30.599]  I think we live in an age where there's no understanding and no respect whatsoever for personal liberty and personal privacy.
[02:10:30.599 --> 02:10:32.880]  The founders understood it much better.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:38.124]  They tried to protect us against a big government that would come in and destroy that.
[02:10:38.124 --> 02:10:45.350]  But there is a collusion between big business, corporatism, and big government that are in control.
[02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:47.331]  Therefore, they can't control the output.
[02:10:47.331 --> 02:10:48.112]  It used to be that
[02:10:48.832 --> 02:10:53.676]  Newspapers did it, and three major networks, and we understood it.
[02:10:53.676 --> 02:10:58.719]  And then it changed when there were more cable stations and internet stations and all.
[02:10:58.719 --> 02:10:59.700]  But they haven't quit.
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.221]  They're still challenging us.
[02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:04.063]  And you're right, the IRS has not been kind to us.
[02:11:04.063 --> 02:11:09.387]  They've been after us quite a few different times on some of our organizations, and they continue to do it.
[02:11:10.828 --> 02:11:16.390]  I'd like to bankrupt this, you know, through all the money you have to spend to try to defend oneself.
[02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:21.952]  But I think what we're witnessing today is a result of an era ending.
[02:11:21.952 --> 02:11:26.534]  And I've talked about this for maybe five plus years, about the end of an era.
[02:11:27.014 --> 02:11:35.839]  Because I believe the era of big government, the progressive era, really exhausted itself probably at the end of the last century.
[02:11:35.839 --> 02:11:39.540]  And now we have just been fidgeting and trying to keep things together.
[02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:46.224]  And that's why, you know, the political parties are in shambles, the economy is in shambles, civil liberties are in shambles.
[02:11:46.724 --> 02:11:51.669]  But the real problem is that the system we have today isn't working.
[02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:52.510]  It's ending.
[02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:54.372]  Keynesian economics doesn't work.
[02:11:54.372 --> 02:11:57.234]  That model is bad and never worked.
[02:11:57.234 --> 02:12:01.779]  But that was the substitute for fascism and communism in the 20th century.
[02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:07.441]  Did a pretty good job at smashing it, because it's a total failure.
[02:12:07.441 --> 02:12:13.602]  And there are still some who would like to be socialists and think that Venezuela is the way to go and all this nonsense.
[02:12:13.602 --> 02:12:15.123]  But you know, the markets are very powerful.
[02:12:15.123 --> 02:12:18.924]  The markets said that fascism and communism failed.
[02:12:18.924 --> 02:12:25.126]  But the substitute, the American substitute of Keynesianism, economic planning, central banking, inflationism,
[02:12:25.706 --> 02:12:45.920]  A fiat money and running our lives, regulating our lives, taking away our liberties and also this obsession with us believing that we are so exceptional that we can tell the rest of the world how to live and we should be exceptional in dealing with our own problems and setting a good example.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:13:11.396]  So I think the mess that we're in today is the end of this era, and without anybody admitting this, we and those in the freedom movement have been trying to warn people of this and giving them an option, and quite frankly, I think we're doing fine there, even though, like you mentioned, Alex, on the introduction, that, you know, statism and big governments, it's alive and well, but they're bankrupt.
[02:13:11.496 --> 02:13:18.885]  So they will end, just as our empire will end, Keynesian economics will fail, the central banking system is going to fail.
[02:13:18.885 --> 02:13:29.378]  We just have to concentrate on it to energize another generation that there is an option for this, there is an alternative, and of course that's what I've been working on for quite a few years.
[02:13:29.958 --> 02:13:31.641]  Absolutely, Dr. Paul.
[02:13:31.641 --> 02:13:41.379]  Expanding on that, looking at what the so-called left is doing, allied with the establishment Republicans in this country, similarly in Europe, where I know you've traveled and spoken extensively as well.
[02:13:42.597 --> 02:13:59.467]  They now, because they were discredited last century as you said, are instead just trying to dumb everyone down and really much overthrow reality and overthrow the engines of free market that are left because they just can't compete with that even existing.
[02:13:59.467 --> 02:14:05.670]  Even though it brings down the civilization, they'd rather rural people, you know, not be able to take care of themselves.
[02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:09.092]  They'd rather city people not be able to take care of themselves.
[02:14:09.092 --> 02:14:09.573]  They'd rather
[02:14:10.654 --> 02:14:18.683]  The whole country and the whole world be poor and rule a huge junk pile instead of a great civilization.
[02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:22.447]  And so my concerns are, what do you see them doing in their death throes?
[02:14:22.447 --> 02:14:26.452]  Because even most mainline analysts are starting to agree with you that we're coming to the end of a bubble.
[02:14:27.332 --> 02:14:30.954]  That no matter what the establishment does, they're not going to be able to suppress change.
[02:14:30.954 --> 02:14:32.795]  More and more young people are waking up.
[02:14:32.795 --> 02:14:41.759]  So clearly, I agree with you, this great turning that you've talked about for decades, but you've said is very close for five years, is pretty much here.
[02:14:41.759 --> 02:14:44.581]  But how do you expect the empire to strike back?
[02:14:44.581 --> 02:14:45.901]  I mean, I think we're seeing it.
[02:14:45.901 --> 02:14:48.042]  Open, naked authoritarianism.
[02:14:48.042 --> 02:14:51.264]  But doesn't that only accelerate the fall of their system?
[02:14:52.352 --> 02:14:55.554]  Well, yes, they're a failure, but they will strike out.
[02:14:55.554 --> 02:15:00.677]  And I think that what they have going for them right now is the dumbing down of America.
[02:15:00.677 --> 02:15:11.983]  So, in many ways, they have been successful by getting hold of the public school system and teaching people, you know, bad economics and bad foreign policy and all the things that are wrong.
[02:15:12.523 --> 02:15:24.014]  But at the same time, you know, the failures there, I think they know that the failure is there, but they will strike out and they will become more authoritarian, and I think that is exactly what they're doing.
[02:15:24.014 --> 02:15:30.561]  And it isn't a partisan thing when you know that the Nancy Pelosi's of the world and the John Boehner's of the world were
[02:15:31.421 --> 02:15:33.202]  Much more buddies than anybody realized.
[02:15:33.202 --> 02:15:34.163]  But that continues.
[02:15:34.163 --> 02:15:36.464]  The parties mean very little.
[02:15:36.464 --> 02:15:43.908]  But I think if nothing else, this current election cycle that's going on represents the dumbing down of America.
[02:15:43.908 --> 02:15:48.691]  But then again, does that mean we should be exhausted and run for the hills?
[02:15:48.691 --> 02:15:49.972]  Or should we continue the fight?
[02:15:49.972 --> 02:15:52.253]  Obviously, I'm here for the fight.
[02:15:52.253 --> 02:15:54.415]  And to me, it's an intellectual fight.
[02:15:54.415 --> 02:15:56.856]  And we have to beat them with better ideas.
[02:15:56.856 --> 02:15:59.277]  And I think there is a receptive audience out there.
[02:16:00.598 --> 02:16:07.322]  They have power because they're in control right now, but what we have on our side is that ideas have consequences.
[02:16:07.322 --> 02:16:09.824]  You can't stop ideas.
[02:16:09.824 --> 02:16:15.507]  Even the armies and the governments can't stop ideas if their time has come.
[02:16:15.507 --> 02:16:29.356]  And of course, the need has come, and certainly we hope to make it our time has come for the option to be, because I see the collapsing of this system as the opportunity to be more forceful in our presentation.
[02:16:29.736 --> 02:16:32.018]  Because they will be very aggressive.
[02:16:32.018 --> 02:16:37.943]  They will use the judicial system and the IRS and everything else because their goal is power.
[02:16:37.943 --> 02:16:40.446]  They believe that they are exceptional.
[02:16:40.446 --> 02:16:43.608]  They believe that they know what is best for us.
[02:16:43.608 --> 02:16:50.374]  For instance, the silliness of what this country has endorsed now with the Federal Reserve, that they know what interest rates should be.
[02:16:51.055 --> 02:16:56.521]  Well, it would be the most ridiculous thing in the world for somebody who knows anything about economics and free markets.
[02:16:56.521 --> 02:17:01.206]  So I think there's, in the midst of this mess, we do have opportunities.
[02:17:01.206 --> 02:17:04.950]  Sir, you've got so many organizations and groups and TV shows and radio shows.
[02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:05.891]  I see it and hear it everywhere.
[02:17:05.891 --> 02:17:07.573]  I want to say congratulations to your media team.
[02:17:07.573 --> 02:17:10.476]  It's so wonderful to see you, not just in Congress now, but
[02:17:10.856 --> 02:17:21.068]  You look younger than you did five years ago, so congratulations on the hard fight in Congress and not missing any votes, that you couldn't, and working so hard and now reaching so many people.
[02:17:21.068 --> 02:17:26.494]  But is RonPaulLibertyReport.com, is that one of the best sites to talk about?
[02:17:27.406 --> 02:17:35.408]  Yeah, we concentrate on that, although, you know, we have a homeschool curriculum and campaign for liberty and other sites.
[02:17:35.408 --> 02:17:37.148]  But yes, this is my outlet.
[02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:43.170]  This is my effort to reach more people, the RonPaulLibertyReport.com.
[02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:47.851]  And our growth is very significant, and I'm excited about it.
[02:17:47.851 --> 02:17:49.471]  But we still have a ways to go.
[02:17:49.471 --> 02:17:50.632]  Absolutely.
[02:17:52.012 --> 02:17:52.192]  I don't
[02:18:13.562 --> 02:18:19.066]  Famously, without trying to get attention, but it's well known, would go and work basically for free in the charity hospitals.
[02:18:19.066 --> 02:18:29.955]  I mean, you're a real Hippocratic Oath type doctor, and so many people that you delivered, and so many families that you helped, you know, have spoken out in your campaigns about the great job you've done, a true servant.
[02:18:29.955 --> 02:18:35.620]  I know you don't like folks to heap praise on you, but you are uniquely positioned to speak about Obamacare.
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:40.984]  And also about things happening with men and women's issues.
[02:18:40.984 --> 02:18:46.389]  So just briefly, the Alamo Draft House, as you know, is a Texas chain based here in Austin, Texas.
[02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:48.210]  I know the owner of it, the founder of it.
[02:18:49.028 --> 02:18:57.753]  They have been convinced, it's in KXAN, at their new theaters to just have one giant bathroom where men and women both use urinals.
[02:18:57.753 --> 02:18:59.454]  That's in KXAN NBC.
[02:18:59.454 --> 02:19:00.675]  I'm not kidding.
[02:19:00.675 --> 02:19:03.897]  And I've got the State Department and CIA reports.
[02:19:03.897 --> 02:19:11.161]  We've got articles back from 30 years ago about how they wanted to merge men and women together to basically break down the family.
[02:19:11.161 --> 02:19:13.023]  And I have another article here out of National Review.
[02:19:14.003 --> 02:19:17.066]  Where they came out and said, we need to get rid of the family.
[02:19:17.066 --> 02:19:19.067]  You shouldn't read to your children at night.
[02:19:19.067 --> 02:19:20.708]  That advances them too much.
[02:19:20.708 --> 02:19:23.130]  I know this all sounds crazy, but we're putting it on screen, folks.
[02:19:24.324 --> 02:19:29.226]  This is meant to create division, hysteria, insanity, infighting, in my view.
[02:19:29.226 --> 02:19:33.008]  And the article actually has the owner saying, we want to do this.
[02:19:33.008 --> 02:19:34.848]  Let me read the quote, then I'll go back to you, sir.
[02:19:34.848 --> 02:19:38.510]  But I wanted to give you this info so you could respond to it.
[02:19:38.510 --> 02:19:43.532]  He said, this design will hopefully eliminate conflict.
[02:19:44.432 --> 02:19:49.515]  So let me ask you, Dr. Paul, as a doctor, what do you think all this transgender stuff's about?
[02:19:49.515 --> 02:19:50.735]  I mean, I know you're not a hater.
[02:19:50.735 --> 02:19:51.396]  I'm not a hater.
[02:19:51.396 --> 02:19:52.576]  We're libertarians.
[02:19:52.576 --> 02:19:53.497]  These aren't our issues.
[02:19:53.497 --> 02:19:54.537]  But what is this?
[02:19:54.537 --> 02:19:56.258]  Because this is all they talk about.
[02:19:56.258 --> 02:19:57.959]  It's all that seems to be going on.
[02:19:57.959 --> 02:20:03.282]  And now they say if it goes well at this new theater, they're going to do it at the theaters I go to with my family.
[02:20:03.282 --> 02:20:09.905]  I cannot go with my daughters and lead them into a bathroom with women, I'm sorry, squatting over urinals.
[02:20:09.905 --> 02:20:11.546]  What is this, sir?
[02:20:11.546 --> 02:20:13.187]  This sounds like mental illness to me, doctor.
[02:20:14.226 --> 02:20:14.806]  Right.
[02:20:14.806 --> 02:20:17.848]  And they're determined.
[02:20:17.848 --> 02:20:20.109]  And this is social turmoil.
[02:20:20.109 --> 02:20:27.453]  But it's come about because we've lost the sense of private property, because the property owner should make all these decisions.
[02:20:27.453 --> 02:20:31.495]  But this is something that is absolutely absurd.
[02:20:31.495 --> 02:20:32.776]  But you know, if they win,
[02:20:33.596 --> 02:20:47.399]  With this presentation, and the people go along with it because they have been coerced and bribed into it, the principle is the government gives you money, and then all the states and local communities grab the money.
[02:20:47.399 --> 02:20:50.380]  So in education, different things, schools, they take the money.
[02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:56.281]  And the reason why they go along with the law is if you don't do exactly what we tell you, you know, they did this to speed limits and everything else.
[02:20:56.641 --> 02:21:01.103]  They put out the carrot there, and they say, we're going to take it away from you unless you go along with it.
[02:21:01.103 --> 02:21:06.445]  So then the politicians go along with it, and the people get frightened, oh, it's going to cost a lot more, a lot more.
[02:21:06.445 --> 02:21:09.627]  Liberty doesn't mean anything at all.
[02:21:09.627 --> 02:21:13.348]  So this is the real problem that we have.
[02:21:13.348 --> 02:21:21.672]  But if they win, and we don't wake up enough people, and there's not enough fighting back on legal terms, at the same time using boycotts,
[02:21:23.172 --> 02:21:24.833]  They shouldn't get blamed for this.
[02:21:24.833 --> 02:21:29.114]  We the people have to get blamed for this because we go along with this.
[02:21:29.114 --> 02:21:34.415]  And we have indoctrinated our own people to say, oh, this is the right thing to do, this is good.
[02:21:34.415 --> 02:21:37.196]  And if you don't go along with it, you're a bigot.
[02:21:37.196 --> 02:21:40.337]  Well, maybe if you don't go along with it, you believe in private property.
[02:21:40.337 --> 02:21:43.398]  We don't grant people these rights because in our house,
[02:21:44.238 --> 02:21:47.559]  To come in and use our house and live there and use the bathroom.
[02:21:47.559 --> 02:21:50.281]  So we write all the rules.
[02:21:50.281 --> 02:21:52.802]  But business is private property.
[02:21:52.802 --> 02:21:54.282]  Do they get to write their own rules?
[02:21:54.282 --> 02:21:59.545]  No, we gave up on that a long time ago because they said we'd be bigots if we got to write our own rules.
[02:21:59.545 --> 02:22:01.545]  So this is the whole problem.
[02:22:01.545 --> 02:22:11.710]  The answers can be found in private property and volunteerism and cooperation with two people, no matter whether it's a social or economic issue.
[02:22:13.038 --> 02:22:20.001]  But your expert view concurs, especially with what I said, that this is just turmoil, cloward and piven, divide and conquer.
[02:22:20.001 --> 02:22:23.582]  If they can't compete with free market, just create a whole bunch of crazy confusion.
[02:22:23.582 --> 02:22:26.543]  Because, I mean, in a lot of their own writings, they admit that's their plan.
[02:22:27.315 --> 02:22:35.364]  Yeah, I think that if you look at the surface that looks like they're doing quite well.
[02:22:35.364 --> 02:22:44.655]  But what we have to have is people to understand that a moral principle can be used to combat what they're saying because they want to grab the moral high ground.
[02:22:44.875 --> 02:22:51.321]  You know, we become the bigots if we even challenge anything they say.
[02:22:51.321 --> 02:22:54.203]  They're supposed to be able to set the standard.
[02:22:54.203 --> 02:23:00.569]  And of course, for a libertarian, the standard is set, no aggression against anybody else.
[02:23:00.569 --> 02:23:07.815]  It's your life, your body, and your property, and you can do with it what you want, as long as you don't hurt other people.
[02:23:08.275 --> 02:23:22.589]  See, that's been rejected, but that is what should be emphasized over and above everything else rather than entitlements and corporatism and the financial system we have and the international governments that are developing.
[02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:24.810]  They have to be challenged.
[02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:30.272]  They have to be challenged through an intellectual challenge by ideas.
[02:23:30.272 --> 02:23:34.934]  It can't be challenged with a little bit of token political activity.
[02:23:34.934 --> 02:23:38.935]  That's important, but ultimately it's the ideas that count.
[02:23:38.935 --> 02:23:41.476]  Again, former Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[02:23:41.476 --> 02:23:43.117]  Ron Paul, LibertyReport.com.
[02:23:44.259 --> 02:23:52.624]  In closing, sir, I want to, in a few minutes, spend some time getting into your brainchild, auditing the Federal Reserve in 102 years.
[02:23:52.624 --> 02:23:53.344]  It hasn't been audited.
[02:23:53.344 --> 02:23:54.885]  I guess it's about time now.
[02:23:54.885 --> 02:24:08.993]  But before we go there, briefly, so many people contact me, so many listeners, so many people on the street, folks connected to the whole Donald Trump campaign, you name it, and they say, look, we know Donald Trump isn't perfect.
[02:24:08.993 --> 02:24:12.235]  I disagree with him on his apple spying stuff and on torture.
[02:24:13.215 --> 02:24:16.378]  But he doesn't want war with Russia and he doesn't, you know, want war in Syria.
[02:24:16.378 --> 02:24:26.007]  He does a lot of good things, but separately, just that he's a populist at some level, just that he's going after political correctness, that he wants to audit the Fed, that he admires you.
[02:24:26.007 --> 02:24:29.750]  I know he said some mean things about Rand, but Rand said some things back to him.
[02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:31.372]  I would love to see both men friends.
[02:24:31.372 --> 02:24:33.374]  I know they played golf, but all that aside,
[02:24:34.848 --> 02:24:50.880]  Is there any way that you could be given, say, a list of his policies that are on his site, and say, I don't fully endorse Trump, like Senator Sessions and others do, but, and Sessions said he's not perfect, but the system hates him, he's a populist, he wants better deals for us, he's an anti-globalist.
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:52.481]  The CFR hates him.
[02:24:52.481 --> 02:24:59.387]  I mean, it would just be so wonderful to see a purist, you know, Dr. No, a guy with a perfect constitutional record, like yourself.
[02:24:59.387 --> 02:25:09.556]  I understand you don't want to now endorse him because you've got a perfect record, something nobody else has, but is there any way to at least highlight the things you think are good?
[02:25:09.556 --> 02:25:18.204]  Because I would love to see, you know, the whole Ron Paul libertarian revolution somehow, you know, at least talking to the Trump populist movement.
[02:25:18.464 --> 02:25:20.465]  Well, I think he's too much all over the place.
[02:25:20.465 --> 02:25:27.910]  When he says one day is something, the next day, sometimes he flip-flops in one day in what he has said over the years.
[02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:30.592]  So I have no idea what he believes in.
[02:25:30.592 --> 02:25:34.755]  I don't believe he has a basic principle, a basic libertarian principle.
[02:25:34.755 --> 02:25:40.039]  Sure, one thing he does real well is challenges his political correctness.
[02:25:40.039 --> 02:25:44.582]  So no matter what your beliefs are, people get sick and tired of political correctness, and that's very good.
[02:25:44.582 --> 02:25:46.283]  But his economic policies are awful.
[02:25:46.423 --> 02:25:47.464]  Are all over the place.
[02:25:47.464 --> 02:25:53.667]  When you talk about 35% tax on imports, you're looking for a trade war.
[02:25:53.667 --> 02:25:55.448]  Trade wars lead to bad wars.
[02:25:55.448 --> 02:25:59.650]  So, no, I think personally he's very much of an authoritarian.
[02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:01.051]  I'm not looking for a boss.
[02:26:01.051 --> 02:26:03.612]  I'm looking for somebody who will leave me alone.
[02:26:03.612 --> 02:26:06.154]  And he hasn't convinced me that he'll leave me alone.
[02:26:06.454 --> 02:26:16.577]  I think he will be the champion of the executive order, because he has lived with executive orders, and if he has the strings of power, he won't be bashful in using that.
[02:26:16.577 --> 02:26:19.018]  So that is why I'm very hesitant.
[02:26:19.018 --> 02:26:21.399]  Well, I understand, and I've had problems as well.
[02:26:21.399 --> 02:26:25.320]  I mean, what he said is basically that's the negotiation with China is a huge threat.
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:32.683]  Because they basically have a 35 percent, you know, obvious tariff internally on us with their currency and some of the things they do.
[02:26:32.683 --> 02:26:34.684]  And then there would be a negotiation.
[02:26:34.684 --> 02:26:39.007]  But I can see if people take the brashness that he is kind of being the man on the white horse.
[02:26:39.007 --> 02:26:43.069]  Let me ask you this and then briefly about the Federal Reserve on it, Bill.
[02:26:43.069 --> 02:26:45.450]  Why do you think the establishment on both sides is so scared?
[02:26:46.266 --> 02:26:47.067]  Up front.
[02:26:47.067 --> 02:26:51.550]  Because it reveals how the deep state works.
[02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:54.452]  It reveals exactly what goes on behind the scenes.
[02:26:54.452 --> 02:27:05.161]  And the most important part of their secrecy is the interconnection of all the central banks and the arrangements that we make, especially during the bailout period in 2008 and 2009.
[02:27:05.161 --> 02:27:07.022]  That is the part that they keep very secret.
[02:27:07.022 --> 02:27:13.267]  But over the years, even all the way back to Wright-Patman days and Gonzales' days, the populist-type Democrats,
[02:27:13.627 --> 02:27:18.711]  They were always stopped because they did not want to reveal what goes on internationally.
[02:27:18.711 --> 02:27:25.356]  And that ties this globalism together, because if you control the money, you can control the politics of it.
[02:27:25.356 --> 02:27:27.518]  So that is the most important thing.
[02:27:29.239 --> 02:27:32.362]  Individuals, the political interests that benefit.
[02:27:32.362 --> 02:27:39.830]  So there are financial interests, the bankers' interests, but there's foreign governments and foreign central banks and corporations.
[02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:41.852]  They all benefit and they don't want that.
[02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:44.334]  Do you think they're against Trump because he supports the audit of the Fed Bill?
[02:27:44.334 --> 02:27:45.956]  The audit is very, very important.
[02:27:45.956 --> 02:27:46.276]  Sure, sure.
[02:27:46.276 --> 02:27:47.778]  How do we get your audit of the Fed Bill passed?
[02:27:47.778 --> 02:27:48.899]  I know it's very, very close.
[02:27:48.899 --> 02:27:49.540]  Who's against it?
[02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:57.798]  Well, yeah, I have no idea whether that's important.
[02:27:57.798 --> 02:28:02.184]  I don't think it's known to be an issue in this campaign.
[02:28:02.184 --> 02:28:06.911]  If you go out and talk to a couple thousand people involved in the Sanders campaign,
[02:28:08.633 --> 02:28:16.858]  Well, we're getting a long way on it, but Campaign for Liberty, our other group, works on that constantly.
[02:28:16.858 --> 02:28:23.802]  We've had several votes because we stirred up the population, and they told their congressman, we want you to vote for Audit the Fed.
[02:28:23.802 --> 02:28:25.283]  It's been very, very successful.
[02:28:25.283 --> 02:28:28.705]  Because we always win the votes overwhelmingly in the House.
[02:28:28.705 --> 02:28:30.186]  In the Senate, it's a different story.
[02:28:30.186 --> 02:28:32.067]  Rand's gotten a vote once in the Senate.
[02:28:32.067 --> 02:28:36.410]  He got a majority vote, but they closed it by closure, so we haven't passed it in the Senate.
[02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:50.101]  We have a long way to go, and right now, I don't think that any Republican or Democrat that's been running even in this past year, other than Rand, would actually allow the audit to occur.
[02:28:50.101 --> 02:28:52.543]  Because, you know, there's too much tied in.
[02:28:53.143 --> 02:28:56.664]  Trump doesn't think the interest rate should ever raise.
[02:28:56.664 --> 02:29:04.627]  He loves the idea that the Fed has interest rates down to 0% because his business deals depend on that.
[02:29:04.627 --> 02:29:10.628]  Anyway, no, I don't think we're on the verge of passing it, but we're on the verge of getting a lot more attention.
[02:29:10.628 --> 02:29:14.330]  And when this thing comes apart, the Fed has to be the big issue.
[02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:21.592]  That's how all this globalism and big government has been financed, and that is through the monetary system.
[02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:22.653]  Amazing, Doctor.
[02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:27.960]  That, of course, I think is one of the places where we've had amazing success.
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:29.061]  Congratulations.
[02:29:29.061 --> 02:29:32.446]  30 years positioning it so the guys that hijack the country get the blame when it comes down.
[02:29:32.446 --> 02:29:33.847]  We're almost there.
[02:29:33.847 --> 02:29:35.029]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:29:35.029 --> 02:29:36.551]  RonPaulLibertyReport.com.
[02:29:36.551 --> 02:29:37.112]  Thank you, Doctor.
[02:29:40.754 --> 02:29:41.675]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:41.675 --> 02:29:43.878]  Alright, he did a pretty good job with the three second delay.
[02:29:43.878 --> 02:29:45.140]  Alright folks, we'll be back.
[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:45.700]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:46.902]  That was Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:29:46.902 --> 02:29:48.284]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.284 --> 02:29:50.827]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.827 --> 02:29:53.511]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.768 --> 02:30:07.330]  The article titled, Revolution, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips, A Grim Vision of the Future, is based on a 30-year future cast completed by the British Ministry of Defense team back in 2007.
[02:30:07.330 --> 02:30:15.431]  The goal of the report was to create a future strategic context of obstacles and events and to create an analysis of key risks and shocks that would face the British military.
[02:30:15.431 --> 02:30:23.313]  The fall of the mainstream media and the rise of the internet-enabled citizen journalists are predicted in the report, as well as neutron bombs and brain chip mobilized flash mobs.
[02:30:23.533 --> 02:30:32.717]  The report even predicted the politically correct invasion of triggerly puffed social justice warriors whose ranks would be filled by the socialist spewing spoiled children of a once prosperous middle class.
[02:30:32.717 --> 02:30:38.919]  Finally, compact, increasingly cramped cities and booming third world populations would lead to increased migration, massive food riots,
[02:30:39.159 --> 02:30:44.284]  ...and spread of the radical political Islamic concept of Ummah, which is the global Islamic community.
[02:30:44.284 --> 02:30:48.549]  Food riots are now cropping up across the world in places like Venezuela and Greece.
[02:30:48.549 --> 02:30:50.631]  Are you prepared for widespread food riots?

[02:30:56.497 --> 02:30:57.218]  Rob Dew reporting.
[02:30:57.518 --> 02:31:04.023]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:31:04.023 --> 02:31:16.814]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:31:16.994 --> 02:31:20.655]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:31:20.655 --> 02:31:27.638]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:31:27.638 --> 02:31:40.423]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:31:40.523 --> 02:31:42.364]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:31:42.364 --> 02:31:48.748]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:33:02.878 --> 02:33:10.303]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.303 --> 02:33:17.468]  Infowars.com.
[02:33:17.468 --> 02:33:23.733]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.314 --> 02:33:52.576]  I'm going to be honest with everybody.
[02:33:52.576 --> 02:33:57.118]  I get angry on air, and it's real when I get angry, but it's kind of like letting the dog off the leash.
[02:33:57.118 --> 02:34:02.261]  So you can say it's fake in that I'm allowing myself to do it.
[02:34:02.261 --> 02:34:08.103]  But that's kind of like saying, you know, if you have sex with a woman, you know, it's fake because you let yourself do it.
[02:34:08.103 --> 02:34:10.104]  I mean, it's not fake.
[02:34:10.104 --> 02:34:12.986]  Or it's like if you let yourself go swim in the ocean, it's not fake.
[02:34:14.154 --> 02:34:21.838]  When I blow up, when I start yelling and screaming, I'm allowing myself to do it, and it is a way of venting, but it's real.
[02:34:21.838 --> 02:34:29.502]  Not earlier today, I got so flipped out, not even that angry on air, but physically angry, that I want to leave right now, but I'm not going to do it.
[02:34:29.502 --> 02:34:32.684]  I'm going to breathe, and I'm going to settle down, and everything's going to get okay.
[02:34:32.684 --> 02:34:34.145]  Because when something hits you at home,
[02:34:36.741 --> 02:34:41.525]  Like a month ago, I went down to Barton Creek Mall, where I've been going since I was in elementary school.
[02:34:41.525 --> 02:34:43.987]  I'd come down here and visit my grandparents in the summer, and they'd take me to the mall.
[02:34:43.987 --> 02:34:45.047]  It's an old mall.
[02:34:45.047 --> 02:34:46.268]  I've lived here since high school.
[02:34:46.268 --> 02:34:49.531]  I've been going there every couple weeks since high school.
[02:34:49.531 --> 02:34:52.733]  I go to the mall, and there's women wearing beekeeper suits everywhere.
[02:34:52.733 --> 02:34:57.357]  I mean, every turn, I start hyperventilating, and folks, I don't do this normally.
[02:34:58.868 --> 02:35:03.209]  I mean, I don't do this back when I was younger, when three guys were wanting to mug me, I didn't start hyperventilating.
[02:35:03.209 --> 02:35:14.792]  And I've got my daughters with me, and there's all these Middle Eastern men, and it's just culture shock that our government's bringing all these people in, and these women were basically slaves.
[02:35:14.792 --> 02:35:21.073]  I mean, they get killed, folks, if they try to take their beekeeper prisoner mask off.
[02:35:21.073 --> 02:35:23.474]  It's like at, you know, Gitmo, they put a hood over your head.
[02:35:24.744 --> 02:35:26.744]  That kind of freaked me out.
[02:35:26.744 --> 02:35:30.405]  Then Leon McAdoo comes in here with an Austin American Statesman report and a couple others.
[02:35:30.405 --> 02:35:38.407]  And a KXAN report, a TV report, and with a straight face.
[02:35:38.407 --> 02:35:45.649]  They start talking about, we're going to get rid of men's and women's bathrooms and have communal bathrooms where men and women both use urinals.
[02:35:47.093 --> 02:35:53.158]  And they've got a big snout that sticks out, and the woman basically grabs it, and it's all about dehumanizing us.
[02:35:53.158 --> 02:36:01.184]  And they've got the owner of Alamo Drafthouse, who I've known for 18 years, saying this is to stop disturbances.
[02:36:01.184 --> 02:36:07.369]  They're gonna have, I mean, I'm not taking my 8- and 11-year-old daughters and my 13-year-old son all in there.
[02:36:07.369 --> 02:36:10.991]  I mean, we don't go in the bathroom with each other now!
[02:36:10.991 --> 02:36:13.914]  It's been a long time since I went in bathrooms with my daughters!
[02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:18.701]  Because we like privacy, you freaks, and civilization!
[02:36:18.701 --> 02:36:21.182]  And I had a panic attack.
[02:36:21.182 --> 02:36:23.404]  I've never had panic attacks in my life, but I've been asking people.
[02:36:23.404 --> 02:36:24.404]  I'm gonna go to a psychologist.
[02:36:24.404 --> 02:36:25.185]  I'm not kidding.
[02:36:25.185 --> 02:36:28.286]  I mean, I'm starting to have panic attacks where I can't breathe, okay?
[02:36:28.286 --> 02:36:30.267]  These people are coming after us.
[02:36:30.267 --> 02:36:35.350]  And by the way, Tim Lee knows full well what he's doing, okay?
[02:36:35.350 --> 02:36:37.692]  The owner of the Alamo Drafthouse.
[02:36:37.692 --> 02:36:39.032]  He knows full well.
[02:36:39.032 --> 02:36:40.693]  This is social engineering.
[02:36:40.693 --> 02:36:41.534]  And it's a sick joke, now.
[02:36:44.684 --> 02:36:45.745]  These people are out to get us.
[02:36:45.745 --> 02:36:47.687]  Okay, that's all I'm telling you and I've had enough of them.
[02:36:47.687 --> 02:36:51.790]  And listen, I'm not never going there again because I just can't handle it.
[02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:59.797]  People messing with me and the schools saying they're gonna teach five-year-olds that they may not be a man or a woman and don't use he or she.
[02:36:59.797 --> 02:37:01.919]  This is an attack on humanity.
[02:37:01.919 --> 02:37:05.882]  Like it's space aliens or something just ending our biological process.
[02:37:05.882 --> 02:37:08.324]  90% of the sperm are dead or half-dead.
[02:37:08.324 --> 02:37:09.385]  Fertility's plummeting.
[02:37:09.385 --> 02:37:10.906]  Cancer's exploding.
[02:37:10.906 --> 02:37:11.507]  I'm ranting now.
[02:37:11.507 --> 02:37:12.148]  I'm gonna go to our guest.
[02:37:12.948 --> 02:37:20.493]  Gavin McInnes, and I'll be honest, I like a lot of Vice stuff over the years, but I'm so busy, I don't study the media landscape and things.
[02:37:20.493 --> 02:37:22.874]  The last six, eight months, I've just seen his videos.
[02:37:22.874 --> 02:37:25.756]  I saw him some before, really love the stuff he does.
[02:37:25.756 --> 02:37:30.578]  My son watches them, turns out most of the school watches them, and not just because I'm Alex Jones.
[02:37:30.578 --> 02:37:41.745]  I mean, the school, almost everyone, boys and girls, 13, 14, 15, up to high school, and then people I know that are 60 years old are watching Gavin McInnes, and also the next host that's coming on with us.
[02:37:43.004 --> 02:37:44.745]  That's exciting when people hit the zeitgeist.
[02:37:44.745 --> 02:37:47.847]  But I'm like, reading his bio, I go, oh, he's one of the founders of Vice.
[02:37:47.847 --> 02:37:48.868]  So of course he's a smart guy.
[02:37:48.868 --> 02:37:52.150]  And I guess they sold that for a few hundred million or whatever it was, HBO.
[02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:54.592]  Now they've taken a new direction, but whatever.
[02:37:54.592 --> 02:37:57.674]  The point is, is that this is the real media right here.
[02:37:57.674 --> 02:37:59.995]  And I'm not in competition with somebody like Gavin McGinnis.
[02:37:59.995 --> 02:38:06.420]  I love the fact he's out there bringing up different points, different angles, some of the same points, because this is a war.
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:07.921]  I want to beat these people.
[02:38:07.921 --> 02:38:12.864]  I don't want to be like Glenn Beck, the guy that has all the answers and knows everything and tells people he's Moses on the mountain.
[02:38:13.224 --> 02:38:14.925]  I want an army to defeat these people.
[02:38:14.925 --> 02:38:18.426]  I want to hit them from every angle, because it gets to me personally.
[02:38:18.426 --> 02:38:28.990]  They'll be with us 30 minutes to the next hour, and then Anthony Kimmel will continue on for another 30 minutes, but the two will be on together in the next 30 minutes as well after this hour ends.
[02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:33.551]  But boy, it is just crazy the amount of news.
[02:38:33.551 --> 02:38:39.173]  They're saying they want to get rid of the grading system and get rid of below C-.
[02:38:39.173 --> 02:38:40.514]  Now, they always proposed that.
[02:38:40.514 --> 02:38:41.394]  They're doing it now.
[02:38:42.763 --> 02:38:49.050]  They are announcing that they want to get rid of parents reading to their children at night because the family's bad.
[02:38:49.050 --> 02:38:51.192]  They're actually saying it on ABC News.
[02:38:51.192 --> 02:38:53.394]  I've got those articles.
[02:38:53.394 --> 02:38:57.278]  Gavin made a great point with Paul Watson last week.
[02:38:57.278 --> 02:38:58.479]  I appreciate him joining us again this week.
[02:38:58.479 --> 02:39:01.302]  I had to take care of a family matter and Paul sat in.
[02:39:02.233 --> 02:39:02.834]  He made a great point.
[02:39:02.834 --> 02:39:07.878]  He said they just want to blow up civilization because they can't compete with normal free market civilization.
[02:39:07.878 --> 02:39:08.419]  That's it.
[02:39:08.419 --> 02:39:10.040]  These people know what they're doing.
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.621]  And I want to ask you a question.
[02:39:11.621 --> 02:39:12.602]  How high up, though?
[02:39:12.602 --> 02:39:14.184]  I mean, we know the top engineers know this.
[02:39:14.184 --> 02:39:16.426]  They write white papers on it in textbooks.
[02:39:16.426 --> 02:39:17.467]  This is admitted.
[02:39:17.467 --> 02:39:19.328]  They have ABC News interviews now.
[02:39:19.328 --> 02:39:24.373]  But how low down in the strata of the average trendy authoritarian, mental patient, cult member,
[02:39:25.934 --> 02:39:30.278]  How liberal do they realize this is about destroying civilization?
[02:39:30.278 --> 02:39:37.144]  Gavin, you've got compoundmedia.com, Twitter is Gavin underscore McInnes, M-C-I-N-N-E-S.
[02:39:37.144 --> 02:39:38.825]  We salute your wonderful work.
[02:39:38.825 --> 02:39:46.892]  You've got the Gavin McInnes Show that is on Eastern Time many days right up against us at the same time, which I think is just wonderful because I could care less.
[02:39:46.892 --> 02:39:49.254]  It's a tack on all fronts.
[02:39:49.254 --> 02:39:51.316]  Thanks for popping in with us today, Gavin.
[02:39:51.316 --> 02:39:52.257]  What is going on here?
[02:39:53.561 --> 02:39:59.607]  Well, here's the big question is, how much of this sabotage has an agenda?
[02:39:59.607 --> 02:40:02.169]  Like, what are they trying to do?
[02:40:02.169 --> 02:40:10.657]  And, of course, there's the theory that it's all about destroying civilization, destroying Western cultures so they can rebuild something new.
[02:40:10.657 --> 02:40:15.442]  But I'm starting to think that what's really going on here is just sabotage.
[02:40:15.442 --> 02:40:17.143]  Like, I think George Soros is
[02:40:17.844 --> 02:40:25.806]  His grandfather, or sorry, father, was on his deathbed and he just said to George, just go make a huge mess.
[02:40:25.806 --> 02:40:30.827]  And then he died and George went, all right, I'm just going to throw money at sabotage.
[02:40:30.827 --> 02:40:33.308]  I don't think there's an agenda here.
[02:40:33.308 --> 02:40:36.749]  I think it's just malicious.
[02:40:36.749 --> 02:40:38.249]  It's just malicious discontent.
[02:40:39.986 --> 02:40:40.566]  I agree with you.
[02:40:40.566 --> 02:40:46.788]  They set up a system to rot the sub-mass, to make us serve all idiots, but it's affecting them in blowback.
[02:40:46.788 --> 02:41:04.794]  And now, the program has gotten out like zombies out of the underground base, and it's just wreaking havoc where the most radical, stupid ones are now commanders, as they have taxpayer-funded systems dumping Drano in their eyes, and having taxpayers pay for them, and their arms and legs chopped off to live in little boxes.
[02:41:04.794 --> 02:41:07.474]  And folks, if you're a new viewer, this is the new trendy stuff to do.
[02:41:07.474 --> 02:41:09.415]  I mean, how far will it go, Gavin?
[02:41:10.523 --> 02:41:14.344]  Well, it will go until we discipline them.
[02:41:14.344 --> 02:41:17.245]  It's almost like a crazy girlfriend that wants to get slapped.
[02:41:17.245 --> 02:41:34.330]  And I've noticed when I'm in my community, which is Hipstersville, Brooklyn, I live in Williamsburg, and when I wear my Trump shirt, I've noticed there's this strange sort of capitulation where they sort of bow their heads and accept that I am the alpha in this situation.
[02:41:34.330 --> 02:41:38.631]  So I think that these far-left nutbars that are sabotaging our culture
[02:41:39.051 --> 02:41:40.651]  Don't really want to sabotage it.
[02:41:40.651 --> 02:41:43.072]  It's like a child acting out.
[02:41:43.072 --> 02:41:45.673]  They're betas that want to be put in their place.
[02:41:45.673 --> 02:41:47.413]  They want a timeout.
[02:41:47.413 --> 02:41:48.734]  And it's our job to do that.
[02:41:48.734 --> 02:41:50.914]  And that's what we're doing with Compound Media.
[02:41:50.914 --> 02:41:52.414]  That's what you're doing and InfoWorth.
[02:41:52.414 --> 02:41:55.235]  We're saying, I know you want to get slapped.
[02:41:55.235 --> 02:41:56.536]  Here's a slap.
[02:41:56.536 --> 02:41:58.156]  Sometimes a girl needs a good smack.
[02:41:59.625 --> 02:42:03.267]  Which I don't actually believe in that, but that's a famous quote from Sean Connery.
[02:42:03.267 --> 02:42:04.528]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:42:04.528 --> 02:42:07.509]  Yeah, they really honestly don't want to take over.
[02:42:07.509 --> 02:42:09.570]  And look at what they do, too.
[02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:15.754]  They say, okay, I don't like the patriarchy, I don't like white males, I don't like cis, whatever we're called this week.
[02:42:15.754 --> 02:42:21.817]  And you go, alright, because us cis white males are pretty open-minded.
[02:42:21.817 --> 02:42:23.237]  We go, alright, well what do you got?
[02:42:23.237 --> 02:42:23.998]  Maybe I do suck.
[02:42:24.338 --> 02:42:26.840]  And they go, it's called Sharia law.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:29.681]  And you go, that's what you're going to replace me with?
[02:42:29.681 --> 02:42:32.643]  Something that was me 500 years ago?
[02:42:32.643 --> 02:42:33.804]  The Salem witch trials?
[02:42:33.804 --> 02:42:34.984]  We're going back to that?
[02:42:34.984 --> 02:42:37.166]  No, we're not doing that.
[02:42:37.166 --> 02:42:43.169]  That's what's crazy here is they don't have a plan B. They want to eradicate Western tradition.
[02:42:43.169 --> 02:42:45.151]  They want to blow up conservatism.
[02:42:45.151 --> 02:42:48.773]  They want to destroy the family, the patriarchy, marriage, all that stuff.
[02:42:48.773 --> 02:42:50.654]  And you go, wow, you must have a great plan.
[02:42:50.974 --> 02:43:00.907]  No, we'll replace it with caveman patriarchy with a bunch of inbred psychopaths cutting women's genitals off and putting beekeeper outfits on them and all murdering each other.
[02:43:00.907 --> 02:43:04.131]  Why is the left so in love with radical jihadists?
[02:43:05.404 --> 02:43:12.588]  Because they feel guilty that they haven't done anything with their lives and it makes them feel bad about themselves.
[02:43:12.588 --> 02:43:14.229]  And who makes you feel bad about yourself?
[02:43:14.229 --> 02:43:15.350]  Your dad.
[02:43:15.350 --> 02:43:19.072]  So all my anger is now going to be directed towards daddy.
[02:43:19.072 --> 02:43:20.833]  Everyone who looks like dad is evil.
[02:43:21.733 --> 02:43:30.560]  And I'm going to discredit dad so I don't feel bad that I took mass comm at NYU and put myself $60,000 in debt.
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:30.961]  Exactly.
[02:43:30.961 --> 02:43:43.391]  They've got worthless educations and now they've weaponized it to make people so mentally ill and so confused and obsessed with brown paper bags or that somebody's having a costume party that they don't realize they've been totally screwed over.
[02:43:44.204 --> 02:43:44.984]  Exactly.
[02:43:44.984 --> 02:43:52.969]  The lunatics want to run the asylum, but we're telling them, trust me, if I let you run the asylum, you're all gonna die.
[02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:58.552]  Piggy's gonna get the conch shell like in Lord of the Flies, and he's gonna get brained with a big rock.
[02:43:58.552 --> 02:44:05.796]  Trust me, you're better off with me in charge, because I've been doing this for a quarter of a million years.
[02:44:05.796 --> 02:44:07.337]  That is what's crazy, though.
[02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:10.339]  Where they're leading us is Road Warrior with, like,
[02:44:12.159 --> 02:44:19.609]  Literal warlords driving around in armored vehicles with heads mounted on the front with women in bikinis and chains with Slayer playing.
[02:44:19.609 --> 02:44:23.314]  I mean that's where this goes in like 10 years if they keep going this direction.
[02:44:23.962 --> 02:44:29.705]  It is, and the fact that Bernie Sanders is so popular, do you know what socialists do to gays?
[02:44:29.705 --> 02:44:35.988]  Do you know what these totalitarians do to creative types, to artists, to comedians?
[02:44:35.988 --> 02:44:37.928]  You know, you'll be the first to go.
[02:44:37.928 --> 02:44:39.229]  They like me.
[02:44:39.229 --> 02:44:44.431]  Islamists like Islamophobes like me, because we have balls, we're alphas.
[02:44:44.431 --> 02:44:48.693]  The first to go is the gays and the artists and you.
[02:44:48.693 --> 02:44:52.075]  Not you, Alex Jones, but you, the guy who is pro-Islam.
[02:44:52.375 --> 02:44:56.976]  I mean, we just had Eagles of Death medal, they were... Oh yeah, let's talk about that!
[02:44:56.976 --> 02:44:58.936]  89 people killed at that concert, right?
[02:44:58.936 --> 02:45:13.199]  The guy, the singer of the band, he says to me that he's suspicious of the security, he's suspicious of Islam, he's suspicious of Arabs, Arab money, and now he's backtracking because it's killing his band.
[02:45:13.199 --> 02:45:17.340]  They're having shows cancelled because they dared to question the narrative.
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:20.101]  And what's fantastic about it is, in the interview he said to me,
[02:45:20.441 --> 02:45:21.421]  You ever read George Orwell?
[02:45:21.421 --> 02:45:22.602]  You ever read Animal Farm?
[02:45:22.602 --> 02:45:27.923]  He goes, as soon as someone questions the narrative, they all become bleeding sheep.
[02:45:27.923 --> 02:45:32.344]  And then, after saying that, exactly what he said happens.
[02:45:32.344 --> 02:45:34.925]  The bleeding sheep start cancelling their shows.
[02:45:34.925 --> 02:45:37.265]  And now, Jesse Hughes is a pariah.
[02:45:37.265 --> 02:45:38.545]  He's actually mad at me.
[02:45:38.545 --> 02:45:39.746]  We're not friends anymore.
[02:45:39.746 --> 02:45:42.226]  Because I got him in this mess.
[02:45:42.226 --> 02:45:44.667]  And I go, don't get mad at me, get mad at the mess!
[02:45:44.707 --> 02:45:46.290]  They're the ones going after your free speech.
[02:45:46.290 --> 02:45:50.678]  Oh, we're so sorry that radical jihadis came and shot everybody in all this garbage.
[02:45:50.678 --> 02:45:51.881]  No, no, no.
[02:45:51.881 --> 02:45:55.648]  Now that everybody didn't grovel properly, he's got to have his shows cancelled.
[02:45:56.354 --> 02:45:58.536]  A woman stepped in front of him.
[02:45:58.536 --> 02:46:00.177]  She got shot in the face.
[02:46:00.177 --> 02:46:01.298]  Her jaw exploded.
[02:46:01.298 --> 02:46:02.218]  She's dead.
[02:46:02.218 --> 02:46:06.301]  He had shrapnel of teeth and bone in his face.
[02:46:06.301 --> 02:46:07.262]  He had to get stitches.
[02:46:07.262 --> 02:46:09.524]  They had to pull teeth out of his face.
[02:46:09.524 --> 02:46:14.007]  And we are sitting here telling him that we quote-unquote disagree.
[02:46:14.007 --> 02:46:18.851]  That's what the promoter said, who canceled their show at Rock on Sin, which is like the Coachella.
[02:46:18.851 --> 02:46:19.611]  He's the victim.
[02:46:19.611 --> 02:46:21.233]  The West is the victim.
[02:46:21.233 --> 02:46:22.634]  The free speech is the victim.
[02:46:23.314 --> 02:46:26.418]  And it's the West that empowered women and opened everything up.
[02:46:26.418 --> 02:46:27.639]  I mean, I can put it on screen.
[02:46:27.639 --> 02:46:28.500]  BBC.
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:31.243]  Communist China kills gay men.
[02:46:31.243 --> 02:46:40.013]  All these countries kill them, but then we're supposed to sit here and then let pedophiles have access to our kids, or we're homophobic.
[02:46:40.899 --> 02:46:48.841]  Well you know what's really going on here is the socialists, the communists, the far left, when they notice a pattern, they commit genocide.
[02:46:48.841 --> 02:47:04.605]  So that's why they're so petrified of noticing a pattern of any sort of discussion of eugenics or biology or any kind of pattern because they've noticed their boy Stalin, their boy Pol Pot, their boy Hitler, they tend to exterminate the people that notice the pattern.
[02:47:05.445 --> 02:47:10.228]  Us, here on the right, with the Libertarians, we go, we notice a pattern, we just discuss it.
[02:47:10.228 --> 02:47:11.589]  We don't kill anyone.
[02:47:11.589 --> 02:47:13.950]  That's what's crazy about the left and the right.
[02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:18.533]  We all have our opinions, but the left enforces their opinions to a fault.
[02:47:18.533 --> 02:47:21.615]  The right just sits there going, hmm, I've noticed a pattern here.
[02:47:21.615 --> 02:47:22.516]  That's interesting.
[02:47:22.516 --> 02:47:24.897]  And they let meritocracy take over.
[02:47:24.897 --> 02:47:28.580]  If you're tall and you're good at basketball, you're in the NBA.
[02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:29.020]  The end.
[02:47:30.196 --> 02:47:31.036]  Well, that's right.
[02:47:31.036 --> 02:47:40.418]  In fact, they're now, I'm sure you saw the National Review article, I mentioned it, where they're talking to this professor on ABC News, like it's normal, going, well, it's very bad to read to your kids, because other people don't read to their kids.
[02:47:40.418 --> 02:47:42.039]  And it's bad to have private school.
[02:47:42.039 --> 02:47:49.040]  And, you know, families actually say, family's something we're not going to get rid of quite yet, but, you know, the state will allow it for now, but we're phasing it out.
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:57.962]  With a straight face, well, then it's wrong, then, if you're a seven-foot-tall black guy named LeBron James, because, you know, the lollipop guild can't beat you at basketball.
[02:47:58.928 --> 02:48:03.472]  It's just a war on, it's funny, you know, info wars.
[02:48:03.472 --> 02:48:04.413]  What do we want?
[02:48:04.413 --> 02:48:05.634]  We want information.
[02:48:05.634 --> 02:48:07.215]  We just want an open discourse.
[02:48:07.215 --> 02:48:09.137]  They want to shut down discourse.
[02:48:09.137 --> 02:48:11.258]  And I think it's based on revenge.
[02:48:11.258 --> 02:48:12.500]  It's based on spite.
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:14.301]  And there's the Indian Child Welfare Act.
[02:48:14.301 --> 02:48:17.444]  I had this, this, uh, Lauren McGill on my show the other day.
[02:48:17.924 --> 02:48:34.720]  And this six-year-old girl, Lexi Page, she's 1.4% Choctaw, and she was ripped from her foster family, her white foster family, at six years old, torn from them, and thrown to some other family who's loosely related to Choctaws through marriage.
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:37.203]  And the Indian Child Welfare Act ruined this family.
[02:48:37.543 --> 02:48:39.484]  I mean, destroyed her siblings.
[02:48:39.484 --> 02:48:45.005]  This poor girl's siblings are having seizures because they're so traumatized by this event.
[02:48:45.005 --> 02:48:46.405]  And why are we doing it?
[02:48:46.405 --> 02:48:49.686]  It's not to reunite an Indian family.
[02:48:49.686 --> 02:48:51.147]  It's not to right any wrongs.
[02:48:51.147 --> 02:48:52.847]  It's just pure revenge.
[02:48:52.847 --> 02:48:59.229]  And this spiteful, horrible act is taking white guilt and punishing this family because of what we did in the past.
[02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:01.150]  Yes, it was terrible what we did with the Indians.
[02:49:01.150 --> 02:49:02.030]  We separated families.
[02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.570]  That was terrible.
[02:49:02.850 --> 02:49:08.353]  But to create legislation that is just pure revenge, it's sick and twisted.
[02:49:08.353 --> 02:49:09.634]  And you know who suffers?
[02:49:09.634 --> 02:49:11.475]  Lexi Page.
[02:49:11.475 --> 02:49:11.835]  Exactly.
[02:49:11.835 --> 02:49:13.256]  It's all about social engineering.
[02:49:13.256 --> 02:49:18.199]  Gavin McInnes is our guest, radio TV host, one of the founders of Vice Media.
[02:49:18.199 --> 02:49:18.839]  We're going to break.
[02:49:18.839 --> 02:49:22.782]  I want to come back and get into some of the angles and issues that you're looking at front and center, but just briefly.
[02:49:23.562 --> 02:49:36.125]  Is it a sign of weakness in the authoritarian left and this orgy of control that Facebook's openly censoring, denies it, is forced to admit it, that the Federal Elections Commission wants to, you know, regulate drugs, that means us next?
[02:49:36.125 --> 02:49:38.506]  I mean, really, this is so naked.
[02:49:38.506 --> 02:49:42.727]  I'm surprised more on the so-called left aren't repenting and defending the First Amendment.
[02:49:42.727 --> 02:49:44.907]  Because you can say what you wanted about the left a long time ago.
[02:49:44.907 --> 02:49:46.227]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:49:46.227 --> 02:49:48.468]  You know, more I've lied with them on many cases.
[02:49:48.468 --> 02:49:51.209]  But no, they're just like, no, get rid of free speech, we're taking over.
[02:49:51.209 --> 02:49:51.969]  That's really scary.
[02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:56.092]  Yes, well, what we have here is a zenith.
[02:49:56.092 --> 02:50:00.836]  We've reached full peak SJW, and this is not their year.
[02:50:00.836 --> 02:50:02.216]  You know that zombie song?
[02:50:02.216 --> 02:50:05.999]  This will be our year, took a long time to come.
[02:50:05.999 --> 02:50:07.240]  This is our year.
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:09.361]  And people always ask me, where do you get that from?
[02:50:10.682 --> 02:50:15.164]  If you're not watching it every day, you don't really see what is happening with the culture.
[02:50:15.164 --> 02:50:18.245]  But right now, these idiots have gone too far.
[02:50:18.245 --> 02:50:21.226]  And a great example I always use is the chalkening.
[02:50:21.226 --> 02:50:26.948]  Someone wrote Trump in shock on a university floor, on the ground.
[02:50:26.948 --> 02:50:28.008]  Everyone went ballistic.
[02:50:28.008 --> 02:50:32.409]  Instead of getting sympathy, more Trump 2016 happened.
[02:50:32.409 --> 02:50:39.792]  And Trump and this sort of chalkening, they call it, is a perfect example of how they are done, and it's our turn.
[02:50:39.892 --> 02:50:40.232]  That's right.
[02:50:40.232 --> 02:50:44.676]  The minute we start resisting and don't follow their orders is the minute they start to fall.
[02:50:44.676 --> 02:50:54.144]  And their orders get so bizarre, so extreme, so insane, that we're forced to say, OK, I'm not going to the Alamo Draft House for women to use a urinal.
[02:50:54.144 --> 02:50:55.465]  It's over, weirdos.
[02:50:55.465 --> 02:50:56.466]  We'll be right back with our guests.

[02:54:10.151 --> 02:54:11.853]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:54:11.853 --> 02:54:16.256]  Speaking of the zombies, here they are.
[02:54:16.256 --> 02:54:19.278]  By the way, I am the opposite of trendy.
[02:54:19.278 --> 02:54:25.043]  Okay, let's just let's just get that out there that I'd pay no attention.
[02:54:25.043 --> 02:54:27.885]  But most people who are really trendy and cause the trends
[02:54:29.364 --> 02:54:30.425]  Don't pay attention.
[02:54:30.425 --> 02:54:35.067]  And of course, I'm now learning more about Gavin McGinnis, just as I've been watching for six months.
[02:54:35.067 --> 02:54:37.609]  And obviously, you know, has a big buzz going.
[02:54:37.609 --> 02:54:38.610]  He's had big buzzes before.
[02:54:38.610 --> 02:54:39.910]  Started Vice.
[02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:43.873]  But I was reading here, he's known as the godfather of hipsterdom.
[02:54:43.873 --> 02:54:47.615]  And then left Vice in 2007, I guess, because they were not truly hip anymore.
[02:54:48.075 --> 02:54:48.795]  And that's my deal.
[02:54:48.795 --> 02:54:50.696]  He looks just like the Russian Tsar.
[02:54:50.696 --> 02:54:55.579]  The one that looked like the British King, you know, back in, you know, World War I. I mean, he could be a body double.
[02:54:55.579 --> 02:54:56.739]  I guess he was born in England.
[02:54:56.739 --> 02:54:58.740]  But look, he looks good with that beard and that mustache.
[02:54:58.740 --> 02:54:59.601]  He pulls it off.
[02:54:59.601 --> 02:55:00.681]  He's the guy that started it.
[02:55:00.681 --> 02:55:01.882]  In fact, I was just Googling.
[02:55:01.882 --> 02:55:02.722]  I didn't know that.
[02:55:02.722 --> 02:55:04.863]  But now, everybody's got the beard.
[02:55:04.863 --> 02:55:07.684]  And my only issue is, if you can't pull it off, don't do it.
[02:55:07.684 --> 02:55:09.385]  But there's Gavin McGinnis.
[02:55:09.385 --> 02:55:09.805]  Nicholas II.
[02:55:11.887 --> 02:55:17.433]  I'm sure that's not the first time you've been told to say, I got to go to him in a moment because I got to plug at least once this hour.
[02:55:17.433 --> 02:55:19.275]  I already skipped a break with Ron Paul.
[02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:20.196]  Buy our products.
[02:55:20.196 --> 02:55:21.437]  They'll blow you away.
[02:55:21.437 --> 02:55:25.442]  The best water filters, the best non-GMO seeds, the best game-changing nutraceuticals.
[02:55:25.442 --> 02:55:28.946]  This hippopotamus lost 70 pounds on X2 and Super Mel Vitality.
[02:55:29.346 --> 02:55:31.287]  Super Mill Vitality is back in stock.
[02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:38.251]  Two months sold out because it's hard to get the herbs and cold press them and just keep them in stock and we're not changing the formula, but it's a big problem.
[02:55:38.251 --> 02:55:39.432]  It's sold out six months out of the year.
[02:55:39.432 --> 02:55:41.333]  It's sold out a few months and we get more.
[02:55:41.333 --> 02:55:44.014]  We're trying to up the production, but it is that good.
[02:55:44.014 --> 02:55:48.177]  It's kind of like certain vintage wines or certain years you just run out.
[02:55:48.177 --> 02:55:49.037]  It's like wine.
[02:55:49.037 --> 02:55:49.958]  It blows people away.

[02:55:59.721 --> 02:56:03.022]  So, Infowarslife.com, thanks for supporting the broadcast.
[02:56:03.022 --> 02:56:08.304]  Okay, Gavin, I just made the whole point about that you secretly are related to Czar Nicholas II.
[02:56:08.304 --> 02:56:11.285]  That's actually a secret.
[02:56:11.285 --> 02:56:12.606]  You shouldn't have mentioned that on the show.
[02:56:15.143 --> 02:56:22.172]  The Lord designed a man's face to cover the fact that you don't have a chin and you have aesthetic problems.
[02:56:22.172 --> 02:56:23.493]  I don't know why we ignore that.
[02:56:23.493 --> 02:56:28.359]  I look at Rupert Murdoch and as Carl Pilkington says, he looks like a turtle without a shell.
[02:56:28.359 --> 02:56:30.121]  What if you're ugly?
[02:56:30.916 --> 02:56:31.996]  Well hey, here's the deal.
[02:56:31.996 --> 02:56:33.837]  I have not a weak chin.
[02:56:33.837 --> 02:56:36.838]  It's actually, my dad's a dentist, about as big as they get.
[02:56:36.838 --> 02:56:38.919]  It's like a bulldog, so it's giant.
[02:56:38.919 --> 02:56:41.600]  So I have a regular length chin, but you're right, it looks like I have a small chin.
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:43.181]  Because I have a giant pumpkin head.
[02:56:43.181 --> 02:56:45.562]  But if I grow a beard, I look like a caveman.
[02:56:45.562 --> 02:56:49.104]  You think I should grow one now that it's like, now uncool?
[02:56:49.104 --> 02:56:49.964]  What should I do?
[02:56:49.964 --> 02:56:51.084]  By all means.
[02:56:51.084 --> 02:56:52.225]  You've got kind of a round head.
[02:56:52.225 --> 02:56:53.425]  Are you a Slovak?
[02:56:53.425 --> 02:56:54.446]  Are you Eastern European?
[02:56:55.286 --> 02:57:07.077]  Uh, no, but if you mix, like, a Brit with, uh, with a German and then Native American, that's pretty much what Slovaks are, because that's where the Indians came from, was basically China, Huns, over the Bering Strait of the Americas.
[02:57:07.077 --> 02:57:12.242]  So I'm kind of like an artificial Western genetic variety of a Slav, actually.
[02:57:12.242 --> 02:57:13.923]  You're a homemade Slav.
[02:57:13.923 --> 02:57:19.208]  I'm an American-made Slav with no original Slav, but even older Slav, from Bering Land Strait, 15,000-year-old Asian.
[02:57:20.796 --> 02:57:21.396]  Yes.
[02:57:21.396 --> 02:57:24.957]  Well, I married an Indian and I made a bunch of Indians.
[02:57:24.957 --> 02:57:26.438]  They're very cute as kids.
[02:57:26.438 --> 02:57:28.178]  I highly recommend them.
[02:57:28.178 --> 02:57:31.019]  Alright, listen, I'm running over you here.
[02:57:31.019 --> 02:57:36.521]  You got censored famously or manipulated, and I want to talk about this some of the next hour with you, but let's start talking about it now.
[02:57:36.521 --> 02:57:38.821]  On The Daily Show, there's a new case of Katie Couric caught.
[02:57:38.821 --> 02:57:44.683]  I don't know if you've seen it, it just came out yesterday, where she edited the video to make it look like they couldn't answer her question, but they could.
[02:57:45.768 --> 02:57:47.589]  Okay, so here's the assumption, right?
[02:57:47.589 --> 02:57:50.111]  White male patriarchy is retarded.
[02:57:50.111 --> 02:57:51.271]  We're idiots.
[02:57:51.271 --> 02:58:01.218]  And we're so stupid, by the way, that when we talk and when we express our beliefs, the left sort of goes, oh god, here we go again with this idiotic mentality.
[02:58:01.218 --> 02:58:02.778]  This is so boring.
[02:58:02.778 --> 02:58:14.666]  And in order to purport that myth, they have to take dozens of people doing hours of research, they have to spend all this time in the editing lab, and they have to edit in pictures of them going,
[02:58:15.486 --> 02:58:17.128]  Which is what happened on The Daily Show.
[02:58:17.128 --> 02:58:19.169]  I did this interview with this guy about women's soccer.
[02:58:19.169 --> 02:58:22.912]  And his contention was that women are getting paid less for the same amount of work.
[02:58:22.912 --> 02:58:24.414]  Which is just ridiculous.
[02:58:24.414 --> 02:58:25.995]  Women are not as good at soccer.
[02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:28.097]  There's more eyeballs for men's soccer.
[02:58:28.097 --> 02:58:31.159]  Yes, ladies, you had a good year in 2015.
[02:58:31.159 --> 02:58:31.880]  Hold on, Gavin.
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:32.760]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.061]  A lot of breaks at the end of the hour.
[02:58:34.061 --> 02:58:35.342]  I'm gonna come back, finish this.
[02:58:35.342 --> 02:58:36.744]  You caught him red-handed.
[02:58:36.744 --> 02:58:37.524]  Sorry.
[02:58:37.524 --> 02:58:38.525]  They're such geniuses.
[02:58:38.525 --> 02:58:41.267]  The left's always, oh, we're such geniuses.
[02:58:41.267 --> 02:58:42.288]  Libertarians are so dumb.
[02:58:42.288 --> 02:58:43.609]  And they're the dumbest people.
[02:58:43.609 --> 02:58:44.270]  They're minions.
[02:58:47.515 --> 02:58:52.577]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[02:58:52.577 --> 02:59:01.241]  Longevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[02:59:44.515 --> 02:59:45.815]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:49.526 --> 02:59:52.115]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.298 --> 03:00:16.099]  We are on the march.
[03:00:16.099 --> 03:00:19.262]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:19.262 --> 03:00:23.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.105 --> 03:00:26.927]  All right, we're on a radio format, so a lot of our ads are at the end of an hour.
[03:00:26.927 --> 03:00:29.689]  I'm sorry, now we're going to break at five minutes, come back with a 12-minute segment.
[03:00:29.689 --> 03:00:34.173]  We're going to have Anthony Acumia with a balance of the next hour with us, but part of that is going to be
[03:00:34.873 --> 03:00:38.315]  I guess having both hosts on together.
[03:00:38.315 --> 03:00:40.636]  And again, the website is compoundmedia.com.
[03:00:40.636 --> 03:00:43.018]  Gavin McInnes, who I just think is awesome.
[03:00:43.018 --> 03:00:44.278]  I really, really enjoy his humor.
[03:00:44.278 --> 03:00:48.240]  It's a little racy for the AM and FM crowd, so warning there.
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:49.121]  Some parental concerns.
[03:00:49.121 --> 03:00:54.804]  It's adult information, but that's what it takes to also reach out to the trendies and the liberals and try to deprogram them.
[03:00:54.804 --> 03:00:57.406]  But you got caught off by the break, Gavin.
[03:00:57.406 --> 03:01:03.129]  You were getting in the Daily Show, taking jokes you made and acting like they were serious and editing it together.
[03:01:03.931 --> 03:01:04.391]  Exactly.
[03:01:04.391 --> 03:01:08.772]  So what they did after the interview, they recorded a bunch of reactions.
[03:01:08.772 --> 03:01:18.715]  So the guy, I forget, he has some stupid Indian name, but he's sitting there and they record him going, and then they edit that in later.
[03:01:18.715 --> 03:01:20.216]  And at one point they said to me,
[03:01:21.056 --> 03:01:23.218]  What, uh, names from soccer players.
[03:01:23.218 --> 03:01:24.640]  I don't know about American soccer.
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:31.327]  So I made up a bunch of names and then I go, and then of course, everyone's favorite, a guy who's known to most as Junebug.
[03:01:31.327 --> 03:01:35.191]  And then I made it clear to them that that was a joke and they didn't know it was a joke.
[03:01:35.191 --> 03:01:37.093]  The guy said, oh, those are some deep cuts.
[03:01:37.093 --> 03:01:38.554]  And I go, those weren't deep cuts.
[03:01:38.554 --> 03:01:39.435]  I just made up those names.
[03:01:39.435 --> 03:01:39.916]  It was a joke.
[03:01:40.376 --> 03:01:46.941]  And then they made that the whole crux of their point was that I wanted to convince you that Junebug was a soccer player.
[03:01:46.941 --> 03:01:58.670]  But the big picture here is it takes so many resources and so much framing to make us look bad that they end up proving the opposite of what they're setting out to prove.
[03:01:58.670 --> 03:02:01.232]  They ended up proving that we're right and they're wrong.
[03:02:02.076 --> 03:02:03.096]  That's right.
[03:02:03.096 --> 03:02:04.457]  Well, number one, 9-11 truth.
[03:02:04.457 --> 03:02:06.138]  They would always misrepresent what I was saying.
[03:02:06.138 --> 03:02:09.479]  I said criminal elements of our government are working with radical Islam.
[03:02:09.479 --> 03:02:10.860]  Bare minimum allowed this to happen.
[03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:13.241]  I had all these FBI agents and whistleblowers on.
[03:02:13.241 --> 03:02:14.061]  It was a fact.
[03:02:14.061 --> 03:02:15.382]  It's all coming out now.
[03:02:15.382 --> 03:02:19.043]  But Discovery Channel did this hour-long documentary that was two hours long.
[03:02:19.043 --> 03:02:20.143]  They've aired it probably a hundred times.
[03:02:20.143 --> 03:02:20.804]  It's on all the time.
[03:02:20.804 --> 03:02:22.645]  It was like seven years ago.
[03:02:22.645 --> 03:02:25.146]  And I talked to a packed crowd at UT of like 500 people.
[03:02:26.542 --> 03:02:28.443]  Okay, but I've had crowds of 5,000 before.
[03:02:28.443 --> 03:02:38.827]  But the point was, they cut at lunch to two or three people sitting there eating sandwiches in the, you know, big room and showed me speaking, cutting back and forth like there were five people.
[03:02:38.827 --> 03:02:40.448]  I mean, this is real deception.
[03:02:41.733 --> 03:02:45.477]  If we are so stupid, then why can't you ridicule us?
[03:02:45.477 --> 03:02:50.302]  If you believe that Jews are lizard people, then that's easy to mock.
[03:02:50.302 --> 03:02:53.245]  I can just show you, you know, a surgeon working on a guy.
[03:02:53.245 --> 03:02:54.967]  We can see he doesn't have scales underneath.
[03:02:54.967 --> 03:02:56.409]  Very easy to mock.
[03:02:56.409 --> 03:02:59.472]  But if we are so easy to mock, why do you have to keep framing us?
[03:02:59.472 --> 03:03:03.876]  We just did this with Katie Couric, where we see the whole video and we learn that when she's
[03:03:04.517 --> 03:03:06.639]  She said, why don't you have background checks?
[03:03:06.639 --> 03:03:09.282]  The people she was asking didn't sit there dumbfounded.
[03:03:09.282 --> 03:03:14.448]  No, they edited that in later.
[03:03:14.448 --> 03:03:18.192]  What's crazy is they keep doing it even though they've been caught and their ratings are going down.
[03:03:18.192 --> 03:03:20.975]  Are they on a suicide mission?
[03:03:20.975 --> 03:03:21.436]  What's happening?
[03:03:22.742 --> 03:03:23.663]  They're lazy.
[03:03:23.663 --> 03:03:25.384]  They haven't been challenged enough.
[03:03:25.384 --> 03:03:27.325]  That's the funny thing about being right.
[03:03:27.325 --> 03:03:34.730]  I mean, if you're a black conservative, you are getting hammered every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, every time you visit your nephews and nieces.
[03:03:34.730 --> 03:03:37.212]  And what that does is, it's like training.
[03:03:37.212 --> 03:03:41.215]  And you end up getting better at drawing conclusions from data.
[03:03:42.135 --> 03:03:50.301]  And conservatives, anyone right of center, is so used to being challenged and questioned that we actually have become pretty good at the truth.
[03:03:50.301 --> 03:04:03.331]  Whereas the left has been so spoiled with their idiotic, infantilized view of the world, with the racist, evil, bad, white man ruining everything, that when they get challenged, they get verklempt.
[03:04:03.331 --> 03:04:04.192]  They don't know what to do.
[03:04:05.287 --> 03:04:05.787]  You're right.
[03:04:05.787 --> 03:04:07.228]  They really are spoiled.
[03:04:07.228 --> 03:04:09.971]  They just lay back and act like they're intellectual giants.
[03:04:09.971 --> 03:04:11.232]  Look at Triggly Puff.
[03:04:11.232 --> 03:04:12.633]  Look at Age Skrillex.
[03:04:12.633 --> 03:04:15.154]  These are not even the worst examples.
[03:04:15.154 --> 03:04:17.076]  This is what we're talking about.
[03:04:17.076 --> 03:04:22.120]  Victims of this system that gave them everything to the point now they have nothing.
[03:04:23.018 --> 03:04:24.478]  Why do you want to censor me?
[03:04:24.478 --> 03:04:26.659]  If you don't like what I'm saying, debate me!
[03:04:26.659 --> 03:04:28.979]  Why are they so scared of debates?
[03:04:28.979 --> 03:04:32.000]  I have to fight tooth and nail to get a liberal on my show.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.880]  Kurt Metzger over at Race Wars, who does a podcast, he's a liberal!
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:49.503]  Him and his black comedian friend, Charron Small, they have to lay out little breadcrumbs like a squirrel to get a feminist on their show because liberals are petrified of debate because they don't know what they're talking about.
[03:04:49.503 --> 03:04:51.183]  And I don't even think they believe what they're saying.
[03:04:51.263 --> 03:04:52.524]  Oh no, they're not exactly.
[03:04:52.524 --> 03:04:55.105]  They're dumb people who just call themselves liberals.
[03:04:55.105 --> 03:04:57.447]  We'll be back.
[03:04:57.447 --> 03:05:02.430]  No matter where he goes, the one, two, and three goes, we're always together.
[03:05:02.430 --> 03:05:13.357]  As the three amigos of NAFTA, the presidentes of the US, Mexico, and Canada met today, Obama said Trump has worked against economic opportunity for workers and ordinary people.
[03:05:14.577 --> 03:05:17.138]  But the record of the last 20 years is clear.
[03:05:17.138 --> 03:05:21.459]  It is NAFTA that has worked against economic opportunity for ordinary people.
[03:05:21.459 --> 03:05:25.481]  The 22 years of NAFTA have been a giant sucking sound.
[03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:26.261]  One million U.S.
[03:05:26.261 --> 03:05:27.261]  jobs lost.
[03:05:27.261 --> 03:05:32.123]  Hundreds of millions paid to multinational corporations by investor state tribunals.
[03:05:32.123 --> 03:05:34.023]  And hundreds of billions in U.S.
[03:05:34.023 --> 03:05:35.144]  trade deficits.
[03:05:35.144 --> 03:05:38.645]  Trump warned us about NAFTA as it was being created 30 years ago.
[03:05:38.925 --> 03:05:42.646]  And he's made a NAFTA exit a central issue of his campaign.
[03:05:42.646 --> 03:05:46.647]  But the three amigos think you're too stupid to know what they've done to you.
[03:05:46.647 --> 03:05:53.809]  These three clowns are just the latest globalist puppets with a song and dance to distract you while their globalist masters pick your pockets.
[03:05:57.230 --> 03:05:58.051]  Hey, everyone.
[03:05:58.051 --> 03:06:00.353]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:06:00.353 --> 03:06:04.175]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:06:04.175 --> 03:06:06.257]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:06:06.257 --> 03:06:16.545]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:06:16.545 --> 03:06:22.530]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:37.927]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:06:37.947 --> 03:06:38.347]  I think so.
[03:06:57.068 --> 03:06:57.588]  Not a group.
[03:06:57.588 --> 03:06:59.030]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:06:59.030 --> 03:07:00.331]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:07:00.331 --> 03:07:01.552]  Why is this so good?
[03:07:01.552 --> 03:07:06.836]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:07:06.836 --> 03:07:20.387]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:07:20.387 --> 03:07:21.749]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:07:22.529 --> 03:07:24.170]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:26.730]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:07:26.730 --> 03:07:28.051]  These are all parasites.
[03:07:28.051 --> 03:07:29.151]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:07:29.151 --> 03:07:30.491]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:07:30.491 --> 03:07:34.993]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:07:34.993 --> 03:07:38.254]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:07:38.254 --> 03:07:41.315]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:07:41.315 --> 03:07:42.375]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:07:42.375 --> 03:07:44.296]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:44.296 --> 03:07:45.316]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:07:45.316 --> 03:07:48.037]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:07:48.037 --> 03:07:48.237]  And, uh,
[03:07:48.918 --> 03:07:49.940]  You support the broadcast.
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:51.283]  Infowarslives.com.
[03:07:51.283 --> 03:07:53.549]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:07:53.549 --> 03:07:55.513]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:08:14.776 --> 03:08:16.878]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:16.878 --> 03:08:18.879]  Because there is a war on.
[03:08:18.879 --> 03:08:20.520]  Are you in mind?
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:30.767]  Alright, I kind of started spinning out of control at the bottom of the first hour today when Leanne came in and showed me mainstream news articles that are going to put women's
[03:08:32.879 --> 03:08:38.864]  Urinals in the men's restrooms that make us all go into the same restroom in a movie theater.
[03:08:38.864 --> 03:08:44.588]  A movie theater is already a big enough train wreck at the end of the movie when I gotta run in there and there's 20 guys.
[03:08:44.588 --> 03:08:47.711]  And if you're waiting on your wife or girlfriend, it takes her 15 minutes longer.
[03:08:47.711 --> 03:09:01.001]  Now Alamo Drafthouse is building a new super theater with two giant, they put the blueprints out on Facebook, two giant bathrooms where you take your daughters, your son, your wife, and you're in there with all these gross guys.
[03:09:01.001 --> 03:09:01.201]  I mean,
[03:09:02.322 --> 03:09:04.983]  I'm the type of guy that just waits and drives home because I don't be around guys.
[03:09:04.983 --> 03:09:06.564]  Now women and kids?
[03:09:06.564 --> 03:09:08.344]  I'm not going to that movie theater!
[03:09:08.344 --> 03:09:10.545]  But again, you guys, what kind of freakazoids are doing this?
[03:09:10.545 --> 03:09:13.566]  Leanne Mack is popping in at the bottom of the next hour.
[03:09:13.566 --> 03:09:16.627]  I've tried to ignore this because, man, I don't sit around talking about bathrooms.
[03:09:16.627 --> 03:09:17.908]  I don't like them.
[03:09:17.908 --> 03:09:19.148]  Hey, you want to have unisex ones?
[03:09:19.148 --> 03:09:22.489]  Have it like the W, but there's like 21-person ones.
[03:09:22.489 --> 03:09:24.150]  Please bring that in!
[03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:25.451]  Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
[03:09:25.451 --> 03:09:26.771]  I didn't mean to get back to this.
[03:09:26.771 --> 03:09:27.771]  I got so much news to cover.
[03:09:27.771 --> 03:09:28.512]  I want to talk about Trump.
[03:09:29.432 --> 03:09:31.413]  The new media censorship.
[03:09:31.413 --> 03:09:43.581]  We were just talking, you know, earlier to the folks at Compound Media, Gavin McInnes, one of the founders of Vice, an amazing, I'd just call him a free thinker, not even libertarian or conservative, just folks that are for common sense and civilization.
[03:09:43.581 --> 03:09:49.505]  And Anthony Acumia, who I've known for probably, I don't know, 10 years, I probably popped in on one of his previous shows, was one of the top ones in the country.
[03:09:49.505 --> 03:09:54.309]  He's been kicked off Terrestrial Radio because of all those rules, same ones we're under, even though we dominate the internet too.
[03:09:55.009 --> 03:10:02.431]  And then he got kicked off for making comments about Black Lives Matter, running around killing people, saying they were acting, you know, like horrible folks, which they were.
[03:10:02.431 --> 03:10:04.431]  But that's better, because now he's even bigger than ever.
[03:10:04.431 --> 03:10:06.032]  I've gone and looked at the metrics.
[03:10:06.032 --> 03:10:09.573]  Believe me, there's spins all over the place for what they're doing at compoundmedia.com.
[03:10:09.573 --> 03:10:10.893]  And this is a war.
[03:10:10.893 --> 03:10:12.133]  They want to shut down drugs.
[03:10:12.133 --> 03:10:13.754]  They want to shut down everybody.
[03:10:13.754 --> 03:10:23.396]  And when the head of the Federal Elections Commission, the deputy head, comes out and says, yes, I do want to regulate drugs and these horrible right-wingers, what they're saying, it's affecting things.
[03:10:24.136 --> 03:10:25.659]  But I got death threats.
[03:10:25.659 --> 03:10:28.304]  Well, you're talking about getting rid of free speech, you demon!
[03:10:28.304 --> 03:10:30.068]  I mean, come on!
[03:10:30.068 --> 03:10:31.992]  This is what America's about!
[03:10:31.992 --> 03:10:32.934]  What is your problem?
[03:10:33.928 --> 03:10:35.469]  And so it's just out of control.
[03:10:35.469 --> 03:10:37.009]  They know they're losing power.
[03:10:37.009 --> 03:10:39.190]  They know people know they're a bunch of authoritarians.
[03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:40.090]  They're panicking.
[03:10:40.090 --> 03:10:41.391]  And the question is, will they win?
[03:10:41.391 --> 03:10:42.531]  Will we just shut up?
[03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:45.632]  Now, I've been ranting and probably dominating with you with Gavin on.
[03:10:45.632 --> 03:10:52.535]  So I want to give these two guys could just go at it for about 10, 15 minutes before I get to some other subjects with them on whatever is front and center for them.
[03:10:52.535 --> 03:10:55.416]  But I'm telling you, this is an epic time to be alive.
[03:10:55.416 --> 03:10:55.856]  And Trump.
[03:10:56.556 --> 03:10:58.517]  He's got his problems, but he's a nationalist.
[03:10:58.517 --> 03:11:00.858]  He's got the power structure crap in his pants.
[03:11:00.858 --> 03:11:02.799]  So much exciting stuff is happening.
[03:11:02.799 --> 03:11:07.020]  He's going after Hillary for all the murders and the rape and the corruption.
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:08.221]  I love it.
[03:11:08.221 --> 03:11:11.622]  And I love Ron Paul, but I just wish he was on earlier.
[03:11:11.622 --> 03:11:17.845]  I wish he'd be more pro-Trump, because I'm telling you folks, this is the nationalism we need.
[03:11:17.845 --> 03:11:20.846]  Let me just say, Anthony, great having you on here.
[03:11:20.846 --> 03:11:22.227]  And Gavin's riding shotgun with us.
[03:11:22.227 --> 03:11:22.787]  Let me ask you.
[03:11:23.658 --> 03:11:25.260]  What do you think of the Trump phenomenon?
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:26.943]  Where do you think this is all going?
[03:11:26.943 --> 03:11:30.388]  And what do you think the state of, not just America, but the world is right now?
[03:11:31.924 --> 03:11:32.924]  I'm loving this.
[03:11:32.924 --> 03:11:35.305]  I am loving it because it's time.
[03:11:35.305 --> 03:11:50.231]  Finally, a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel that for over a decade, I guess it's been that we just have our freedoms taken away and freedom of speech has been front and center on their agenda.
[03:11:50.231 --> 03:11:55.532]  Somebody on Twitter last night was asking me, do you really think Trump is going to change things?
[03:11:55.532 --> 03:11:59.814]  I said, no, Trump is just a symptom of the change that's already happening.
[03:12:00.595 --> 03:12:02.156]  People want change.
[03:12:02.156 --> 03:12:04.259]  They've been slowly changing.
[03:12:04.259 --> 03:12:06.762]  And Trump is a symptom of that change.
[03:12:06.762 --> 03:12:12.448]  So, I don't think he's going to change things per se, but you can feel it, can't you?
[03:12:12.448 --> 03:12:15.872]  You can feel their desperation.
[03:12:15.872 --> 03:12:17.233]  He shows that we're angry.
[03:12:17.233 --> 03:12:18.675]  He shows that we're standing up.
[03:12:18.675 --> 03:12:19.416]  The sleeping giant.
[03:12:20.407 --> 03:12:31.870]  Yes, finally, we're looking and saying, wow, it's not all them dominating the news and whatever other alternative media is out there.
[03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:36.571]  It's people that are thinking like we are, and like the majority of Americans are thinking.
[03:12:36.571 --> 03:12:38.532]  We want our freedoms back.
[03:12:38.532 --> 03:12:41.813]  Look, Jar Nicholas II looks so pleased sitting there.
[03:12:41.813 --> 03:12:45.254]  Gavin, are you feeling the energy of our age shift?
[03:12:46.476 --> 03:12:47.656]  This is our year!
[03:12:47.656 --> 03:12:53.038]  And you were talking about this with Arnie Lang the other day about how he would fake his way onto job sites.
[03:12:53.038 --> 03:12:53.298]  Yeah.
[03:12:53.298 --> 03:12:55.619]  And he would pretend that he could do all this stuff.
[03:12:55.619 --> 03:12:56.299]  Right, right.
[03:12:56.299 --> 03:12:58.560]  You know, he'd get in s*** later on.
[03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:00.421]  This is what the liberals have been doing.
[03:13:00.421 --> 03:13:03.822]  They said, we don't want the patriarchy, we should run the show.
[03:13:03.822 --> 03:13:05.603]  And we went, alright, you seem to know what you're doing.
[03:13:06.463 --> 03:13:12.271]  We left them on the job site and there's just been construction mayhem for seven years.
[03:13:12.271 --> 03:13:14.815]  And we're realizing, wait a minute, you were lying.
[03:13:14.815 --> 03:13:16.157]  You don't know what you're doing.
[03:13:16.157 --> 03:13:17.178]  Actually, you know what?
[03:13:17.178 --> 03:13:20.002]  Donald Trump personifies the patriarchy.
[03:13:20.002 --> 03:13:21.564]  We're bringing the patriarchy back.
[03:13:21.564 --> 03:13:22.706]  It was working fine.
[03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:32.499]  Wow, so, so, both of you, I mean, both smart businessmen, both smart media folks, founded your own successful media companies, you know, been around the world.
[03:13:32.499 --> 03:13:37.204]  In your gut, you sit around the table talking to your girlfriend, your wife or whatever, talking to business partners.
[03:13:37.204 --> 03:13:38.505]  Where do you really think the world's going?
[03:13:38.505 --> 03:13:40.167]  How do you think this fight's going to play out?
[03:13:40.167 --> 03:13:44.752]  What are some of the possible scenarios that are positive but also negative, Anthony?
[03:13:46.291 --> 03:13:51.575]  Well, obviously, on-demand digital media is where it's at these days.
[03:13:51.575 --> 03:13:58.539]  People don't want to be told where, when, and what they could be watching or shouldn't be watching.
[03:13:58.539 --> 03:14:00.020]  Perish the thought.
[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:04.023]  So I see it going that way, which opens up a lot more freedoms of expression.
[03:14:04.724 --> 03:14:17.743]  People are able to voice their opinions and ideology without being persecuted or fired because your boss doesn't think what you're saying is good for the company.
[03:14:19.605 --> 03:14:21.586]  There's a lot of good that comes of that.
[03:14:21.586 --> 03:14:36.832]  And again, I see this pendulum swinging, and I really do think that the free thinkers, the actual progressives, which is hilarious that they have that term stapled to them, will take hold again.
[03:14:36.832 --> 03:14:43.954]  And we will be able to discuss things truthfully, which is something we haven't been able to do for years.
[03:14:43.954 --> 03:14:45.155]  We can talk about
[03:14:45.515 --> 03:14:45.715]  I don't
[03:15:02.526 --> 03:15:13.752]  Can you imagine your female reporters or say, yeah, it's shower time.
[03:15:13.752 --> 03:15:15.833]  Let's guys, you know, my wife won't mind.
[03:15:15.833 --> 03:15:20.095]  Let me just get in the shower with my reporter here.
[03:15:20.095 --> 03:15:23.016]  I mean, your wife would kill you alone.
[03:15:23.016 --> 03:15:24.537]  I mean, even if the guy behaved himself.
[03:15:25.253 --> 03:15:26.835]  Of course!
[03:15:26.835 --> 03:15:35.865]  Nobody wants their children showering with some freak that doesn't know what sexuality they are.
[03:15:35.865 --> 03:15:40.190]  This is common sense stuff that has been thrown to the wayside
[03:15:42.138 --> 03:15:47.240]  And it's time sensibility comes back to our society.
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:51.181]  But isn't it also proof that they're just trying to sabotage us?
[03:15:51.181 --> 03:15:52.621]  There's no problem here.
[03:15:52.621 --> 03:15:56.363]  There's not a bunch of trannies going, I had to go to the bathroom with a bunch of men.
[03:15:56.363 --> 03:15:57.043]  It was horrible.
[03:15:57.043 --> 03:15:58.123]  I identified as a woman.
[03:15:58.123 --> 03:15:59.224]  That hasn't happened.
[03:15:59.224 --> 03:16:00.804]  They just know it makes us mad.
[03:16:00.804 --> 03:16:06.626]  So they get in there with like a little pen knife, and they just sort of twist it in the hole and go, this seems to annoy you.
[03:16:06.626 --> 03:16:07.466]  I'm going to twist it.
[03:16:07.466 --> 03:16:09.907]  Here, let's make their young daughters piss in urinals.
[03:16:10.487 --> 03:16:13.608]  Who comes up with this?
[03:16:13.608 --> 03:16:15.809]  It's just willful sabotage.
[03:16:15.809 --> 03:16:21.952]  They're trying to annoy us, and I think it's because they have daddy issues, and we're dad, so let's mess with those guys.
[03:16:21.952 --> 03:16:23.733]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[03:16:23.733 --> 03:16:30.195]  I remember going to Shea Stadium when I was a kid with my dad, and that urinal experience was frightening.
[03:16:30.195 --> 03:16:30.876]  Exactly!
[03:16:30.876 --> 03:16:31.256]  I do too!
[03:16:32.503 --> 03:16:35.144]  I don't want to hear a woman going to the bathroom.
[03:16:35.144 --> 03:16:37.686]  I'm still under the belief that bubblegum comes out of it.
[03:16:37.686 --> 03:16:38.606]  Little cubes of bubblegum.
[03:16:38.606 --> 03:16:39.947]  I don't want to know the truth.
[03:17:00.811 --> 03:17:07.895]  Anthony, you just brought back memories of all the times I was horrified at baseball and football games, staring into those old rotten urinals.
[03:17:07.895 --> 03:17:12.137]  And of course, all the men were also relieving themselves, you know, farting.
[03:17:12.137 --> 03:17:15.478]  I mean, I'm sorry, but it was like a nerve gas room or something.
[03:17:15.478 --> 03:17:17.279]  It was terrible!
[03:17:17.279 --> 03:17:23.082]  And now they're like, yeah, let the daughters experience this wonderfulness.
[03:17:23.976 --> 03:17:29.221]  Listen, that's the crazy part is that, oh my god, I don't even know what to say.
[03:17:29.221 --> 03:17:31.883]  Is it a plan or is it total mental illness?
[03:17:31.883 --> 03:17:32.964]  I mean, which one is it?
[03:17:32.964 --> 03:17:34.405]  Look, they're like Islam.
[03:17:34.405 --> 03:17:35.886]  The left is insatiable.
[03:17:35.886 --> 03:17:37.407]  And you see this with Islam.
[03:17:37.407 --> 03:17:43.693]  Someone has a burqa on, they've got the little garbage bag on their head, and then she's getting 20 lashes because we can see her purple socks.
[03:17:44.053 --> 03:17:45.733]  They are never satisfied.
[03:17:45.733 --> 03:17:47.374]  And the left is the exact same.
[03:17:47.374 --> 03:17:49.835]  They say, we need he, she, and it.
[03:17:49.835 --> 03:17:50.935]  We need a new gender.
[03:17:50.935 --> 03:17:54.396]  And then you check in eight hours later, and there's 15 genders!
[03:17:54.396 --> 03:17:54.676]  And now 50!
[03:17:54.676 --> 03:17:56.376]  You can't satisfy them!
[03:17:56.376 --> 03:17:57.057]  Facebook made 50!
[03:17:57.057 --> 03:17:57.077]  50!
[03:17:57.077 --> 03:18:01.378]  That's insane!
[03:18:01.378 --> 03:18:02.238]  How can there be 50?
[03:18:02.238 --> 03:18:06.039]  I don't think Star Trek has 50 genders.
[03:18:06.039 --> 03:18:08.660]  They didn't have 50 alien species!
[03:18:08.660 --> 03:18:08.940]  Right!
[03:18:10.583 --> 03:18:12.964]  I think Gavin's absolutely right.
[03:18:12.964 --> 03:18:14.544]  They're insatiable.
[03:18:14.544 --> 03:18:24.767]  You never see someone, one of these social justice warrior groups that actually finish the job.
[03:18:24.767 --> 03:18:28.428]  They have an agenda and they go, well, we got what we were asking for.
[03:18:28.428 --> 03:18:29.848]  Let's pack our bags.
[03:18:29.848 --> 03:18:30.368]  We're done.
[03:18:30.368 --> 03:18:39.331]  No, they go, they find other things to get to, find other ways to get under your skin and get their agenda across at the cost of society.
[03:18:39.871 --> 03:18:41.252]  Because it's all about class.
[03:18:41.252 --> 03:18:45.715]  It's all about, I'm smarter than you, and I'm telling you what the word is this week.
[03:18:45.715 --> 03:18:49.738]  Like with black, it was negro, and then it was African-American, person of color.
[03:18:49.738 --> 03:18:54.481]  And so they have the lower classes constantly flummoxed, going, what is it now?
[03:18:54.481 --> 03:18:55.101]  Can I say black?
[03:18:55.101 --> 03:18:55.942]  Oh yeah, that's our new example.
[03:18:55.942 --> 03:18:57.363]  We don't learn reading and writing and arithmetic.
[03:18:57.363 --> 03:18:58.744]  We learn the new words.
[03:18:58.744 --> 03:19:00.665]  By the way, I have to apologize.
[03:19:00.665 --> 03:19:01.686]  I got something wrong.
[03:19:01.686 --> 03:19:05.268]  ABC News reports there's 58 new genders on Facebook.
[03:19:05.268 --> 03:19:06.129]  Oh, sorry.
[03:19:06.129 --> 03:19:08.991]  Well, it probably became 58 from when you said it was 50.
[03:19:10.091 --> 03:19:10.592]  Exactly.
[03:19:10.592 --> 03:19:13.394]  Next month it'll be a hundred and ninety.
[03:19:13.394 --> 03:19:21.001]  We're going to break here in a moment, gentlemen, and this will be your final segment together, and then the answer will continue on unless you want to stay, but I know you're a busy guy.
[03:19:21.001 --> 03:19:23.263]  What else is front and center for you guys we're going to cover when we come back?
[03:19:24.226 --> 03:19:27.387]  Well, I think we're ready to announce that we are coming out of the closet.
[03:19:27.387 --> 03:19:28.907]  We've fallen in love.
[03:19:28.907 --> 03:19:39.790]  It started with some, you know, tickling and stuff and we just fell head over heels and we're moving in together and I'm leaving my wife and we're starting a new family of just orphans.
[03:19:39.790 --> 03:19:41.330]  We're going to own an orphanage in Africa.
[03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:42.470]  Wait, wait, that makes sense.
[03:19:42.470 --> 03:19:45.631]  I hear about the Guardian says there's a lot of folks turning into dogs.
[03:19:45.631 --> 03:19:48.292]  You guys can come out of the closet as two male dogs that are getting married.
[03:19:48.893 --> 03:19:49.816]  Yeah, we're dogs.
[03:19:49.816 --> 03:19:52.204]  And that you're going to use women's restrooms.
[03:19:52.204 --> 03:19:52.565]  Hold on.
[03:19:58.533 --> 03:20:00.514]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:20:00.514 --> 03:20:05.477]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:20:05.477 --> 03:20:09.499]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:20:09.499 --> 03:20:11.060]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:20:11.060 --> 03:20:14.942]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:20:14.942 --> 03:20:19.724]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:20:19.724 --> 03:20:20.545]  He waited too long.
[03:20:20.985 --> 03:20:24.346]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:20:24.346 --> 03:20:25.247]  What did I do?
[03:20:25.247 --> 03:20:32.689]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:20:32.689 --> 03:20:40.852]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:20:41.112 --> 03:20:42.794]  To get your XtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:20:57.672 --> 03:21:04.138]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:21:04.138 --> 03:21:16.749]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:21:17.089 --> 03:21:20.732]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:21:20.732 --> 03:21:27.697]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:21:27.697 --> 03:21:40.426]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:21:40.526 --> 03:21:42.348]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:21:42.348 --> 03:21:48.733]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[03:23:29.479 --> 03:23:36.741]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[03:23:36.741 --> 03:23:45.944]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.
[03:23:45.944 --> 03:23:52.946]  For everything from individual first aid kits to the ultimate family medical bag, go to store.doomandbloom.net today.
[03:23:52.946 --> 03:23:55.227]  That's store.doomandbloom.net.
[03:23:55.227 --> 03:23:56.267]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:23:59.432 --> 03:24:01.532]  By the way, I don't want to compete with our own shows.
[03:24:01.532 --> 03:24:02.453]  That's what we're doing.
[03:24:02.453 --> 03:24:04.313]  And, and, and, because it's just a war.
[03:24:04.313 --> 03:24:06.233]  And I just probably think it's fighting tyranny.
[03:24:06.233 --> 03:24:08.434]  Uh, so we have these guys on to promote the great work they're doing.
[03:24:08.434 --> 03:24:10.374]  I just hope they have a billion viewers a day.
[03:24:10.374 --> 03:24:16.235]  Uh, and then the same thing, uh, Buckley is doing this deal that I'm going to start doing every week with Reddit.
[03:24:16.235 --> 03:24:17.316]  A bunch of Reddit folks want to do it.
[03:24:17.316 --> 03:24:18.196]  He's met with the Reddit people.
[03:24:18.196 --> 03:24:22.977]  Uh, and they'll reach tens of millions of folks where we're going to do these talks for two hours once a week.
[03:24:22.977 --> 03:24:24.217]  Roger Stone exclusive.
[03:24:25.077 --> 03:24:26.518]  He's willing to do two hours tonight.
[03:24:26.518 --> 03:24:29.020]  That's kind of like Trump's secret brain.
[03:24:29.020 --> 03:24:30.101]  Two hours with him tonight.
[03:24:30.101 --> 03:24:31.862]  Buckley's going to be honchoing it.
[03:24:31.862 --> 03:24:32.883]  7 to 9.
[03:24:32.883 --> 03:24:34.825]  While we have an hour of nightly news produced.
[03:24:34.825 --> 03:24:37.306]  So, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:37.306 --> 03:24:39.728]  Some of the stuff, subscription, like the films and the rest of it.
[03:24:39.728 --> 03:24:40.929]  If you want to support what we're doing.
[03:24:40.929 --> 03:24:41.550]  But whatever.
[03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:42.611]  Let me just read this briefly.
[03:24:42.611 --> 03:24:45.092]  This is the London Guardian with a straight face.
[03:24:45.092 --> 03:24:47.915]  This is not unintentional, intentional comedy.
[03:24:47.915 --> 03:24:51.958]  The men who live as dogs were just the same as any person on the high street.
[03:24:52.598 --> 03:24:57.102]  It's easy to laugh at a grown man in a rubber dog suit chewing on a squeaky toy.
[03:24:57.102 --> 03:25:02.346]  Maybe too easy, in fact, because to laugh is to dismiss it, denigrate it, ignore it.
[03:25:02.346 --> 03:25:07.009]  The fact that many of us have found comfort and joy in pretending to be animals at some point in our lives.
[03:25:07.009 --> 03:25:08.891]  And it goes into say how it's a gay lifestyle or something.
[03:25:09.931 --> 03:25:10.932]  Here's the deal, folks.
[03:25:10.932 --> 03:25:17.716]  Our government's financing people that just killed 200,000 plus Christians in Syria and rape women to death, some of them five years old.
[03:25:17.716 --> 03:25:20.718]  The headline, 100 men rape five-year-old to death.
[03:25:20.718 --> 03:25:21.759]  Oh, but no one cares about them.
[03:25:21.759 --> 03:25:25.301]  It's all about, he lives off government welfare and is a dog.
[03:25:25.301 --> 03:25:28.123]  She poured Drano in her eyes and the state pays for it now.
[03:25:28.123 --> 03:25:29.144]  It's beautiful.
[03:25:29.144 --> 03:25:31.466]  And if you dismiss it, you're a bigot.
[03:25:31.466 --> 03:25:34.508]  We're beautiful and smart because we poured Drano in our eyes.
[03:25:34.508 --> 03:25:36.009]  Is this a Clive Barker novel?
[03:25:36.894 --> 03:25:45.781]  Gentlemen, we've got like five minutes to the segment, we're coming back with Kimmy and it'd really go crazy, but Gavin, do we just counter their insanity by just saying whatever we want?
[03:25:45.781 --> 03:25:49.003]  And just, I mean, what do we do to defeat them, Anthony?
[03:25:49.003 --> 03:25:49.324]  What do we do?
[03:25:50.373 --> 03:25:51.834]  Well, I think we're doing it.
[03:25:51.834 --> 03:25:52.634]  I think we're doing it.
[03:25:52.634 --> 03:26:02.120]  And I think just the sensibility of the majority of people that have been quiet for so long and starting to get sick of what they're seeing.
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:03.201]  You know, who cares?
[03:26:03.201 --> 03:26:08.625]  Like you said, who cares about a guy who wants to dress like a dog when there are real problems?
[03:26:08.625 --> 03:26:18.631]  And that comes from the UK, where they're being overrun by third world Muslims and losing this amazing history.
[03:26:18.871 --> 03:26:21.113]  That was the UK.
[03:26:21.113 --> 03:26:23.134]  And a guy in a dog suit?
[03:26:23.134 --> 03:26:33.542]  Like, that's the distractions they're trying to throw at us to keep us off base and keep us from realizing that we're in big, big trouble?
[03:26:33.542 --> 03:26:36.225]  And next we're going to have to make a place for them to be dogs.
[03:26:36.225 --> 03:26:37.165]  I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[03:26:38.587 --> 03:26:42.252]  You hear these journalists talk and you go, no one talks like that.
[03:26:42.252 --> 03:26:47.118]  Like you're in a bar or you see the comments on a website and you go, I agree with all that.
[03:26:47.118 --> 03:26:48.619]  That's how everyone feels.
[03:26:48.619 --> 03:26:52.504]  And then you hear the media, you think, no one talks like that.
[03:26:52.504 --> 03:26:56.950]  Like 60 Minutes on Sunday, they had a thing called Inside Edge and it was all about corruption and Wall Street.
[03:26:57.430 --> 03:27:02.595]  Every single person in the story, from the prosecutor, the journalist, they were all Indian.
[03:27:02.595 --> 03:27:05.699]  But 60 Minutes just plowed through that and didn't even notice it.
[03:27:05.699 --> 03:27:08.461]  And you think, what are your journalistic instincts?
[03:27:08.461 --> 03:27:12.145]  I don't know why they were all Indian, but the story didn't cover that.
[03:27:12.145 --> 03:27:17.250]  There is a major war on Western culture going on in London now, and these losers,
[03:27:18.251 --> 03:27:24.315]  Some random gay dudes put on a dog mask trying to be interesting, and they're not!
[03:27:24.315 --> 03:27:28.017]  There is so much interesting stuff going on, and the free market has handled that.
[03:27:28.017 --> 03:27:35.522]  That's why we have compound media, that's why we have InfoWars, because the supply and the demand will inexorably meet.
[03:27:35.522 --> 03:27:38.364]  What do you expect them to do to try to strike back?
[03:27:38.364 --> 03:27:40.886]  I mean, I know the censor, just get more extreme, more demanding?
[03:27:43.271 --> 03:27:44.512]  Yeah, they're trying.
[03:27:44.512 --> 03:27:50.517]  I mean, they are trying and they've been pretty successful over the course of the last decade.
[03:27:50.517 --> 03:28:03.667]  Thankfully, technology has made it possible for the average Joe to get out there and actually be heard by a lot more people these days without having to go through a broadcast, traditional broadcast
[03:28:04.707 --> 03:28:10.591]  Standards or the typical thing you have to do as an on-air personality.
[03:28:10.591 --> 03:28:12.272]  So I think that helps a lot.
[03:28:12.272 --> 03:28:15.034]  Sure, but that's why they want to bring federal control over the web.
[03:28:15.034 --> 03:28:18.716]  You think they'll be successful, Anthony?
[03:28:18.716 --> 03:28:19.476]  Well, they'll try.
[03:28:19.476 --> 03:28:21.097]  I don't know how successful they're going to be.
[03:28:21.097 --> 03:28:22.298]  It's very difficult.
[03:28:22.298 --> 03:28:27.841]  You know, one thing we've learned over the course of the years, it's very difficult to silence people.
[03:28:27.841 --> 03:28:28.502]  You could try.
[03:28:28.502 --> 03:28:29.963]  You could do pretty well.
[03:28:30.828 --> 03:28:35.574]  But there's going to be a point where people want to be heard and they're going to be heard.
[03:28:35.574 --> 03:28:37.036]  It's exactly what you've been doing.
[03:28:37.036 --> 03:28:38.358]  It's what we're doing here.
[03:28:38.358 --> 03:28:40.040]  And it's what a lot of other people are doing.
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:48.532]  And it's our right as Americans to be able to speak and be heard and listen to opposing points.
[03:28:48.872 --> 03:28:52.713]  And I think that's going to emerge.
[03:28:52.713 --> 03:28:54.014]  Absolutely.
[03:28:54.014 --> 03:28:55.394]  You're going to see a lot more of this happen.
[03:28:55.394 --> 03:28:56.514]  That's who we are.
[03:28:56.514 --> 03:28:58.215]  That's what American culture is.
[03:28:58.215 --> 03:29:01.356]  We left Europe because we couldn't do what we wanted.
[03:29:01.356 --> 03:29:06.358]  We built a new country here and the foundation of this country is do what you want.
[03:29:06.358 --> 03:29:10.539]  And to try to strip that away is un-American and it goes against our own biology.
[03:29:11.024 --> 03:29:14.807]  And notice they're trying to attack us for our greatest liberal, true liberal freedom.
[03:29:14.807 --> 03:29:16.868]  We said, live like you want as long as you don't hurt us.
[03:29:16.868 --> 03:29:20.451]  They go, we want to live like this, but you existing hurts us living like this.
[03:29:20.451 --> 03:29:21.392]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[03:29:21.392 --> 03:29:24.554]  Gavin McInnes, compoundmedia.com.
[03:29:24.554 --> 03:29:27.817]  Anytime you want to pop on, I'd love to get you guys on once a month or so.
[03:29:27.817 --> 03:29:29.498]  Thanks for your great work and thank you for joining us.
[03:29:30.946 --> 03:29:39.389]  We're going to come back now and drill into a bunch of news with Anthony Acumia, the head honcho over there at the operation, doing a great job.
[03:29:39.389 --> 03:29:42.890]  We're going to talk about the election, Hillary, all the breaking news.
[03:29:42.890 --> 03:29:44.211]  I'm actually getting us some news straight ahead.
[03:29:44.211 --> 03:29:46.892]  Stay with us.
[03:29:46.892 --> 03:29:48.292]  We're on the march.
[03:29:48.292 --> 03:29:50.813]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:50.813 --> 03:29:53.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.651 --> 03:30:02.094]  We all know that drinking enough water is essential for the body to function properly.
[03:30:02.094 --> 03:30:06.918]  But you might not know that drinking water at the correct time increases its effectiveness.
[03:30:06.918 --> 03:30:15.304]  Drinking two glasses of water right when you wake up helps to activate your internal organs, flushing out toxins and waste, and speeding your metabolism.
[03:30:15.304 --> 03:30:18.907]  Drink water 30 minutes before a meal to aid in digestion.
[03:30:19.187 --> 03:30:22.130]  And it also helps you feel fuller if you're trying to lose weight.
[03:30:22.130 --> 03:30:27.034]  However, you should avoid drinking while eating, because the fluids will dilute your digestive juices.
[03:30:27.034 --> 03:30:29.856]  Feeling hungry, sluggish, or have a headache?
[03:30:29.856 --> 03:30:35.861]  You should always pour yourself a tall glass of fresh drinking water first, as these are signs of dehydration.
[03:30:36.141 --> 03:30:43.786]  Drinking a glass of water before bed helps the cellular renewal process while you sleep, and it can even prevent stroke or heart attack.
[03:30:43.786 --> 03:30:50.069]  Proper hydration will boost your brain, improve your moods, and give you better physical performance overall.
[03:30:50.069 --> 03:30:52.891]  So stay hydrated, my friends, and stay healthy.
[03:30:52.891 --> 03:30:55.653]  This is Leanne McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week.
[03:30:57.483 --> 03:30:58.403]  Shower Filters.
[03:30:58.403 --> 03:31:00.144]  We're introducing the best yet.
[03:31:00.144 --> 03:31:04.205]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[03:31:04.205 --> 03:31:09.026]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[03:31:09.026 --> 03:31:16.107]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[03:31:16.107 --> 03:31:23.069]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax Shower Filter from ProPure today.
[03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:30.691]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:30.691 --> 03:31:38.932]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:38.932 --> 03:31:44.354]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:44.354 --> 03:31:46.874]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:46.874 --> 03:31:48.995]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[03:31:48.995 --> 03:31:53.175]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:31:57.190 --> 03:32:01.354]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:01.354 --> 03:32:08.821]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:32:08.821 --> 03:32:19.792]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:32:20.272 --> 03:32:28.116]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[03:32:28.116 --> 03:32:31.997]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[03:32:31.997 --> 03:32:42.182]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:48.885]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:32:49.265 --> 03:32:50.706]  That means it's clean.
[03:32:50.706 --> 03:32:51.866]  That means it's pure.
[03:32:51.866 --> 03:32:54.767]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:32:54.767 --> 03:33:08.733]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:33:08.733 --> 03:33:11.414]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:33:11.414 --> 03:33:14.395]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:14.395 --> 03:33:16.676]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.392 --> 03:33:23.355]  You got a lot of powerful monopoly men, a lot of big combines, they're set up for world government.
[03:33:23.355 --> 03:33:27.778]  They know how to use social envy, social warfare, class warfare.
[03:33:27.778 --> 03:33:37.986]  And they've taken our tax money and built public schools and colleges that are designed on record to turn people into basket case mental patients.
[03:33:37.986 --> 03:33:39.587]  And they've done it.
[03:33:39.587 --> 03:33:46.472]  So they can prey on these people but also use them as big armies of zombie-like drooling trendies to try to enslave everybody else.
[03:33:47.546 --> 03:33:48.287]  It really is true.
[03:33:48.287 --> 03:33:50.429]  It really is happening.
[03:33:50.429 --> 03:33:54.654]  And the establishment worldwide is using the left as their takeover arm.
[03:33:54.654 --> 03:33:57.416]  They have compliant people on the right as well.
[03:33:57.416 --> 03:34:02.161]  But it's an amazing time to be alive, and the answer is you getting involved.
[03:34:02.862 --> 03:34:06.206]  And not being scared of these people, and just speaking out.
[03:34:06.206 --> 03:34:09.631]  Because we are the majority of every race, color, and creed around the world.
[03:34:09.631 --> 03:34:10.892]  Don't want to live under all this garbage.
[03:34:10.892 --> 03:34:15.538]  I mean, in the old Soviet Union, they'd take your money and make you work as a slave, but at least you went home and were a man.
[03:34:15.538 --> 03:34:17.340]  A woman was a woman, you had your kids.
[03:34:18.370 --> 03:34:23.392]  They're even taking that away now because they just want us totally alone because they're control freaks.
[03:34:23.392 --> 03:34:26.373]  We're going back to Anthony Cumia, founder of Compound Media.
[03:34:26.373 --> 03:34:33.175]  Of course, he was one of the hosts of the opening of the Anthony Show and a lot of other big programs as well that reached tens of millions of people.
[03:34:33.175 --> 03:34:34.856]  But as he got more serious in things and
[03:34:36.087 --> 03:34:38.268]  Well, they had to kick the most popular guy off the show.
[03:34:38.268 --> 03:34:42.270]  That was on record because he dared criticize Black Lives Matter that's funded by George Soros.
[03:34:42.270 --> 03:34:46.512]  Maybe he'll talk about some of that today with us, but listen, they're trying to get me off the air.
[03:34:46.512 --> 03:34:48.713]  They've kicked me off stages all over the country.
[03:34:48.713 --> 03:34:52.935]  A lot of times they go, yeah, the Beck people say we're going to remove his show if you're not taking off.
[03:34:52.935 --> 03:34:53.295]  And I'm like...
[03:34:54.158 --> 03:34:56.880]  Nobody else does that with Claire Channel Shows, but Glenn Beck.
[03:34:56.880 --> 03:34:58.822]  They go, it's not Claire Channel, it's Glenn Beck.
[03:34:58.822 --> 03:34:59.783]  And that's why I don't like him.
[03:34:59.783 --> 03:35:01.524]  I mean, it's like, dude, just come on.
[03:35:01.524 --> 03:35:03.906]  You like rip off what I cover, that's fine.
[03:35:03.906 --> 03:35:08.350]  And then you mix it all together with weird Oprah Winfrey stuff, and then you want me to disappear.
[03:35:08.350 --> 03:35:09.751]  It's like you're a body snatcher.
[03:35:09.751 --> 03:35:11.052]  You don't want the original there.
[03:35:11.052 --> 03:35:12.173]  Just go be yourself, man.
[03:35:14.141 --> 03:35:14.822]  That's what we're getting to.
[03:35:14.822 --> 03:35:17.206]  Leanne's going to pop in here in a few minutes, just briefly.
[03:35:17.206 --> 03:35:28.043]  If you want to hear more of this information and want to see us continue and have our reporters go around the country and show the anti-free speech people the last two Trump rallies and cover Bilderberg and cover the RNC and DNC...
[03:35:29.810 --> 03:35:30.530]  Buy the products.
[03:35:30.530 --> 03:35:31.211]  It's stuff you need.
[03:35:31.211 --> 03:35:35.053]  High quality, non-GMO, heirloom coffee, heirloom seeds.
[03:35:35.053 --> 03:35:41.437]  We've got really good water filtration systems at the lowest price, very high quality, that cut out all the trash, the garbage.
[03:35:41.437 --> 03:35:42.258]  Be smart, folks.
[03:35:42.258 --> 03:35:44.940]  I mean, you gotta detox, and there's so much stuff in that water.
[03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:47.141]  20% off.
[03:35:47.141 --> 03:35:55.066]  Super Mel Vitality that is just concentrated, thick oil of concentrated herbs that just boost libido, energy, stamina.
[03:35:55.066 --> 03:35:55.967]  Just try a bottle.
[03:35:57.017 --> 03:35:59.778]  It's got almost five stars on third-party sites.
[03:35:59.778 --> 03:36:01.459]  It's an amazing product.
[03:36:01.459 --> 03:36:04.561]  AnthroPlex feeds into it as well.
[03:36:04.561 --> 03:36:08.603]  We got 20% off on our high-quality Survival Shield Nacin Ion on X2.
[03:36:08.603 --> 03:36:10.204]  That's the good halogen.
[03:36:10.204 --> 03:36:11.544]  It's the anti-fluoride.
[03:36:11.544 --> 03:36:15.726]  It's the opposite of that, but in the same family and blocks it.
[03:36:15.726 --> 03:36:17.127]  Check out X2 today.
[03:36:17.127 --> 03:36:22.670]  We also have developed, in two years, a vitamin, mineral, slash amino acid fusion fruit punch drink.
[03:36:23.530 --> 03:36:35.139]  Where you don't drink the soda pop, you know, you don't drink all the garbage, the high fructose corn syrup, you drink this, it's totally natural, you get all the vitamins and minerals and things you need at one point, and it really is high quality.
[03:36:35.139 --> 03:36:36.540]  If you sign up for AutoShip, you get 10% off.

[03:36:49.041 --> 03:36:52.684]  And we have the Hillary for Prison shirt that's our best-selling shirt in history.
[03:36:52.684 --> 03:36:54.806]  You see them all over TV, all over the Trump rallies.
[03:36:54.806 --> 03:36:55.827]  It's wonderful.
[03:36:55.827 --> 03:36:56.928]  You meet like-minded people.
[03:36:56.928 --> 03:36:59.109]  It takes a lot of money to fund this operation.
[03:36:59.109 --> 03:37:00.611]  I don't have George Soros doing it.
[03:37:00.611 --> 03:37:01.752]  We mainly funded ourselves.
[03:37:02.452 --> 03:37:05.374]  I used to do it with sponsorship, but I couldn't expand at that level.
[03:37:05.374 --> 03:37:11.439]  So I got in, and I'm a free market, you know, guy, selling high-quality products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:37:11.439 --> 03:37:16.023]  I want to thank you all for your support and what you've been doing, because we couldn't do it without you.
[03:37:16.023 --> 03:37:18.305]  Super Mel Vitality is back in stock.
[03:37:18.305 --> 03:37:25.030]  And look, maybe you're super conservative, and you like particular shows that talk about the New World Order.
[03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:27.072]  Or maybe you're more libertarian and like this broadcast.
[03:37:27.072 --> 03:37:31.656]  Or maybe you're more of a social liberal, but a fiscal conservative.
[03:37:32.298 --> 03:37:43.762]  There's a different type of broadcast for everybody, but bottom line, we know the people running this country want to make us poor and break this nation so they can dictate terms to us going into this world government.
[03:37:43.762 --> 03:37:46.543]  And that's why now, more than ever, I just beat this drum.
[03:37:46.543 --> 03:37:48.283]  Support free speech or lose it.
[03:37:48.283 --> 03:37:51.284]  Now, Anthony Cumia, I have been kind of ranting today, as I do.
[03:37:51.284 --> 03:37:56.666]  I kind of go manic on air, but there's so many other topics that I'm sure you're raising on your show.
[03:37:56.666 --> 03:37:57.867]  I know you raise.
[03:37:57.867 --> 03:38:01.608]  So I want to ask you now, for the next 10 minutes or so, before we go to Leanne to join us,
[03:38:02.867 --> 03:38:07.309]  What you're talking about on your show today, or why you think so many young people like your show.
[03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:09.030]  Because sure, I've seen your demographics.
[03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:11.731]  You've got people that are 70, you know, 80 years old listening.
[03:38:11.731 --> 03:38:14.172]  You've got a lot of folks that are 18 to 45 listening.
[03:38:14.172 --> 03:38:19.875]  But you also, because I know, have a ton of people, 13 to say 20 listening.
[03:38:19.875 --> 03:38:20.935]  That excites me.
[03:38:20.935 --> 03:38:24.297]  Because they now understand the oppression happening in their schools.
[03:38:24.297 --> 03:38:26.538]  They understand that it's meant to make them guilty.
[03:38:26.538 --> 03:38:29.419]  I'm really proud that a lot of young people are listening too.
[03:38:29.419 --> 03:38:31.000]  That really scares the power structure.
[03:38:32.196 --> 03:38:33.147]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:38:35.293 --> 03:38:43.138]  Obviously going to be talking about Trump clinching the nomination, not that it was any question that he would.
[03:38:43.138 --> 03:38:50.322]  Hillary and those pesky emails, oh boy, she's in a bit of Dutch for that one.
[03:38:50.322 --> 03:38:57.046]  But again, people just don't seem to want to put any responsibility on her.
[03:38:57.046 --> 03:39:04.350]  They will vote for her, they will support her, no matter how crooked or dishonest she comes across.
[03:39:04.730 --> 03:39:16.859]  Well, what I think both of us like doing are taking these stories, whether it's political or just some of these ridiculous entertainment stories or the distractions, and go behind them a little bit.
[03:39:16.859 --> 03:39:22.763]  See what motivates the mass media to put these things out there.
[03:39:23.183 --> 03:39:24.824]  See what their motivation is.
[03:39:24.824 --> 03:39:33.990]  I think people like when the curtains pulled away a little bit and you expose these mass media organizations for what they are.
[03:39:33.990 --> 03:39:36.191]  They're spreading propaganda.
[03:39:36.191 --> 03:39:38.413]  It's what they're doing constantly.
[03:39:38.413 --> 03:39:40.114]  They're a tool of the government.
[03:39:41.875 --> 03:39:42.876]  And it's dangerous.
[03:39:42.876 --> 03:39:43.716]  There you go.
[03:39:43.716 --> 03:39:45.937]  Pulling back the curtain.
[03:39:45.937 --> 03:39:50.960]  To show the wizard back there turning those knobs.
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:54.843]  I don't know if so many people are buying it anymore.
[03:39:54.843 --> 03:40:00.046]  I don't think we're as bamboozled as we were just even a few years ago.
[03:40:00.046 --> 03:40:03.928]  And it's refreshing to see that people are waking up.
[03:40:03.928 --> 03:40:08.991]  Because this is getting very dangerous for our personal freedoms.
[03:40:10.592 --> 03:40:15.334]  We really need to be vigilant and talk about it.
[03:40:15.334 --> 03:40:19.795]  Support shows like yours and the shows that we have here.
[03:40:19.795 --> 03:40:20.896]  That really is the answer.
[03:40:20.896 --> 03:40:22.056]  Just don't do what they say.
[03:40:22.056 --> 03:40:23.296]  They're not our bosses.
[03:40:23.296 --> 03:40:24.357]  They claim there's no First Amendment.
[03:40:24.357 --> 03:40:25.297]  There still is.
[03:40:25.297 --> 03:40:29.598]  And just start disobeying all these unlawful directives from the establishment.
[03:40:29.598 --> 03:40:31.119]  And there's no way they can lock us all up.
[03:40:31.119 --> 03:40:32.860]  I mean, I think we're reaching that critical mass.
[03:40:32.860 --> 03:40:36.181]  I think earlier you guys made that point that just, you know, they tell us what to do.
[03:40:36.181 --> 03:40:37.641]  We don't do it anymore.
[03:40:37.641 --> 03:40:39.962]  Just like the whole Trump chalking situation.
[03:40:41.226 --> 03:40:52.715]  Yeah, when a few years ago it became fashionable to label us, you know, oh he's a racist, he's a sexist, he's a homophobe, he's misogynistic.
[03:40:52.715 --> 03:40:58.460]  That ended the argument because the people were petrified of those labels.
[03:40:58.460 --> 03:41:02.203]  It would cost you your job, your reputation or whatnot.
[03:41:02.203 --> 03:41:04.425]  Now people are starting to go, oh really?
[03:41:04.425 --> 03:41:05.246]  Am I?
[03:41:05.246 --> 03:41:06.427]  Is that what I am today?
[03:41:06.427 --> 03:41:08.989]  And they'll continue to talk because
[03:41:10.509 --> 03:41:11.730]  It means nothing.
[03:41:11.730 --> 03:41:13.410]  It means nothing anymore.
[03:41:13.410 --> 03:41:17.612]  And I don't think there's that fear that they're holding over everybody's head anymore.
[03:41:17.612 --> 03:41:28.676]  And I see that, like I said earlier, as the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel of restriction and fear that we've had hanging over us.
[03:41:28.676 --> 03:41:31.637]  Fear to express ourselves honestly.
[03:41:31.637 --> 03:41:37.679]  Fear that we're going to lose our jobs and our reputation and that's going to be on the internet and never go away.
[03:41:37.679 --> 03:41:38.659]  I mean, I had to
[03:41:39.239 --> 03:41:53.812]  Literally build a facility to broadcast and be open and honest and say things I wanted to say without having that cloud over my head that I was going to be crucified for what I'm talking about.
[03:41:53.812 --> 03:42:02.760]  And that's how dedicated I am to not letting the people that have been in charge for the past decade or so
[03:42:03.257 --> 03:42:04.799]  Get away with this!
[03:42:04.799 --> 03:42:11.188]  I want people to be able to speak openly and honestly without this retribution.
[03:42:11.188 --> 03:42:11.849]  You're in a fight.
[03:42:11.849 --> 03:42:14.092]  You're in a fight for your life, for America's fight, you name it.
[03:42:14.092 --> 03:42:15.234]  You're not laying down.
[03:42:15.234 --> 03:42:17.617]  And we finally stand up, the enemy starts to fall.
[03:42:17.617 --> 03:42:18.398]  Look at this article.
[03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:23.921]  Obama, world leaders are right to be rattled by Trump.
[03:42:23.921 --> 03:42:31.144]  I mean the communist Chinese lecturing us about Donald Trump and saying he's Hitler when they've killed more people than anyone else in history.
[03:42:31.144 --> 03:42:45.709]  I mean it's just all these other Saudi Arabia telling us who we can vote for and then the president running around with Hillary tattling to world leaders as if when Americans get bossed around we're supposed to just bow down and I mean they really have miscalculated.
[03:42:45.709 --> 03:42:46.349]  They've gone too far.
[03:42:47.486 --> 03:42:51.468]  They've gone too far, and people are aware of it, and they're fighting back.
[03:42:51.468 --> 03:42:52.709]  Finally fighting back.
[03:42:52.709 --> 03:43:02.994]  You know, when people talk about Donald Trump and the awful things he's done, it's, oh, Donald told a beauty contest contestant she shouldn't eat so much candy.
[03:43:02.994 --> 03:43:04.495]  And people lose their minds.
[03:43:04.495 --> 03:43:06.716]  Like, this is the worst thing you could possibly do.
[03:43:06.716 --> 03:43:10.558]  And then you have Hillary, who was using her personal email account
[03:43:11.579 --> 03:43:20.288]  To send and receive some of the most top-secret documents that someone in her position can get or send.
[03:43:20.288 --> 03:43:23.752]  And they just go, oh, this is garbage.
[03:43:23.752 --> 03:43:25.114]  It means nothing.
[03:43:25.114 --> 03:43:28.778]  It's the vast right-wing conspiracy again.
[03:43:29.363 --> 03:43:31.065]  They have nothing on Trump.
[03:43:31.065 --> 03:43:36.914]  They have things that he did as a goofy personality builder years ago.
[03:43:36.914 --> 03:43:39.798]  There's no secrets ready to jump out of his closet.
[03:43:39.798 --> 03:43:41.701]  We know about him.
[03:43:41.701 --> 03:43:44.925]  But Hillary, it's obvious she's a liar.
[03:43:45.706 --> 03:43:50.390]  She is pandering to get votes, which she has always done.
[03:43:50.390 --> 03:43:52.452]  And now she's been caught lying repeatedly.
[03:43:52.452 --> 03:43:55.955]  Remember, she said there was not even a separate server or email before.
[03:43:55.955 --> 03:43:56.696]  She's been caught.
[03:43:56.696 --> 03:43:58.057]  She should be put in jail.
[03:43:58.057 --> 03:43:58.437]  And you know what?
[03:43:58.437 --> 03:43:59.759]  People think she's invincible.
[03:43:59.759 --> 03:44:02.121]  At a certain point, the establishment is going to turn on her as well.
[03:44:02.461 --> 03:44:04.082]  Yeah, I think we're seeing that.
[03:44:04.082 --> 03:44:06.504]  We're already seeing that.
[03:44:06.504 --> 03:44:09.907]  Where is all that support for Hillary from people?
[03:44:09.907 --> 03:44:15.151]  You don't really see anybody except her dopey-ass husband that she's trotting around.
[03:44:15.151 --> 03:44:16.832]  The poor guy, let him sleep.
[03:44:16.832 --> 03:44:19.254]  He looks exhausted.
[03:44:19.254 --> 03:44:22.357]  But that's all you're seeing as far as supporting Hillary.
[03:44:22.357 --> 03:44:24.038]  I think people are pulling away.
[03:44:24.038 --> 03:44:27.701]  They see this change coming and don't want to get into the wrong boat.
[03:44:28.390 --> 03:44:33.794]  Now, Anthony, I want to shift gears for you because I mentioned this earlier when you were on, but I actually want to show the article for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[03:44:33.794 --> 03:44:34.914]  I'll describe it.
[03:44:34.914 --> 03:44:37.096]  It's in KXAN.
[03:44:37.096 --> 03:44:41.078]  It's in a bunch of other local news reports.
[03:44:41.078 --> 03:44:47.463]  And they are openly talking about Alamo Draft House, a national chain that's now grown all over the United States.
[03:44:47.463 --> 03:44:57.049]  And they say in their new theaters, they're going to just get rid of men and women's bathrooms altogether and then get rid of most of the toilets for women and make them bend over and use a urinal.
[03:44:57.049 --> 03:44:57.690]  I'm not kidding.
[03:44:58.512 --> 03:44:59.100]  Uh, and?
[03:45:00.802 --> 03:45:01.622]  This is incredible.
[03:45:01.622 --> 03:45:08.924]  They're asking for feedback, and I'm going to go over this, but the reason I raise this is, I brought it up with Gavin earlier, what do you think is behind it?
[03:45:08.924 --> 03:45:15.405]  Because I kind of ignored this for years, because I just thought it sounded so stupid, but now I turn on TV, read a newspaper, it's like another world.
[03:45:15.405 --> 03:45:23.067]  All I hear about is these oppressed people, and so they need to be in the bathroom with me, and then now everyone, men and women, are going to go into a big giant bathroom.
[03:45:23.067 --> 03:45:24.607]  It's one thing if you have individual bathrooms.
[03:45:24.607 --> 03:45:28.468]  So I mentioned this earlier, and Leanne McAdoo is here, one of our reporters, and has the article.
[03:45:28.468 --> 03:45:29.588]  She got upset as a woman.
[03:45:30.533 --> 03:45:32.214]  I mean, she can't go to the movie theater now.
[03:45:32.214 --> 03:45:33.595]  I mean, who's going to do this?
[03:45:33.595 --> 03:45:35.295]  This is crazy town.
[03:45:35.295 --> 03:45:37.857]  What do you think is behind this?
[03:45:37.857 --> 03:45:48.642]  I think, honestly, it's to take traditional values and throw them out the window.
[03:45:48.642 --> 03:45:51.983]  You're taking, look, gender is what it is.
[03:45:51.983 --> 03:45:53.844]  There are men and women.
[03:45:53.844 --> 03:45:57.086]  The second you try to eliminate that,
[03:45:57.546 --> 03:46:09.048]  You're trying to eliminate the basics of our society and what keeps us together as a society, what makes a traditional family.
[03:46:09.048 --> 03:46:14.809]  They hate what is traditional because it's what empowers the people.
[03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:21.351]  It's what made this country great based on what the people in this country have done.
[03:46:21.351 --> 03:46:26.472]  The more you can break that traditionalism apart, the more you can
[03:46:28.393 --> 03:46:40.309]  I mean, if you can say that someone being a man or woman is hurtful to someone else might not identify, that's saying my identity can't exist because of what you say you've invented.
[03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:45.195]  That is the most bigoted, anti-human, anti-liberal thing I could imagine.
[03:46:45.956 --> 03:46:49.677]  It's just so freakazoid and they keep getting crazier by the month.
[03:46:49.677 --> 03:46:50.617]  I wonder what's coming next.
[03:46:50.617 --> 03:46:53.178]  I mean, here's KXAN Austin, and it's in all the articles.
[03:46:53.178 --> 03:46:55.839]  Alamo Draft House seeks feedback on gender-neutral bathroom.
[03:46:55.839 --> 03:46:59.540]  They say their new design will hopefully eliminate conflict.
[03:46:59.540 --> 03:47:00.520]  Yeah, eliminate conflict.
[03:47:00.520 --> 03:47:02.120]  That's a little joke on us.
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:02.941]  It's meant for conflict.
[03:47:02.941 --> 03:47:07.642]  Then it goes on to say, they're a type of urinal both men and women can use.
[03:47:07.642 --> 03:47:09.362]  It's new territory.
[03:47:09.362 --> 03:47:11.443]  And it's a huge nozzle.
[03:47:11.443 --> 03:47:12.963]  Leanne McAdoo described this for people.
[03:47:12.963 --> 03:47:15.084]  I mean, this is what this cult wants us to be under now.
[03:47:16.181 --> 03:47:29.534]  Actually, I can't even... I can't even make out from the diagram exactly how they are expecting women to now just rearrange our anatomy in order to make this work.
[03:47:29.534 --> 03:47:31.476]  That women can now pee standing up.
[03:47:31.476 --> 03:47:35.420]  Like, how did this all of a sudden... Where does this come from?
[03:47:35.420 --> 03:47:36.361]  People are mental patients!
[03:47:36.841 --> 03:47:41.943]  It's just, it's like overnight that they are trying to completely rewrite how science works.
[03:47:41.943 --> 03:47:46.104]  So when I have a baby someday and I ask the doctor, well what is it, a boy or a girl?
[03:47:46.104 --> 03:47:49.986]  And he's gonna say, you know, well you just gotta wait till find out what it decides it is.
[03:47:50.928 --> 03:47:51.529]  That's a good point.
[03:47:51.529 --> 03:47:53.371]  Don't point the walls, you know, pink or blue.
[03:47:53.371 --> 03:47:56.555]  You just sit there and you wait for the government to tell you.
[03:47:56.555 --> 03:48:06.766]  Right, well, and that's the whole dehumanization thing because if they can take away mother, father, brother, son, daughter, then it's all, you're the legal, you're the legal guardian of this
[03:48:08.453 --> 03:48:09.334]  Humanoid.
[03:48:09.334 --> 03:48:11.495]  I mean, it might not even be a person here eventually.
[03:48:11.495 --> 03:48:12.095]  They might rearrange that.
[03:48:12.095 --> 03:48:13.236]  And they're getting us ready for clones.
[03:48:13.236 --> 03:48:14.876]  They're getting us ready for kind heroes.
[03:48:14.876 --> 03:48:16.677]  This is just getting us ready for body augmentations.
[03:48:16.677 --> 03:48:18.879]  You see the newscast, your kid will soon have a chip.
[03:48:18.879 --> 03:48:23.841]  I'm all for technology, but not like having a chip like my cell phone that tracks me.
[03:48:23.841 --> 03:48:26.543]  Anthony, let me ask you this question.
[03:48:26.543 --> 03:48:32.626]  When you talk to folks just on the ground in New York or Florida or wherever you're visiting folks, I mean, are they getting that this stuff's going on?
[03:48:34.278 --> 03:48:37.681]  Yeah, but look at how all this stuff has been presented over the years.
[03:48:37.681 --> 03:48:40.903]  You're talking about putting chips in people and children.
[03:48:40.903 --> 03:48:46.587]  It's always presented as a convenience and new technology to help you.
[03:48:46.587 --> 03:48:51.031]  No one ever goes, hey, the government wants you to go to this building and have a chip put in you.
[03:48:51.031 --> 03:48:52.672]  People would go, what, are you out of your mind?
[03:48:53.172 --> 03:48:58.816]  Yet, we've been presented with our phones, which is literally a tracking system.
[03:48:58.816 --> 03:49:07.682]  It puts out to the world what we eat, when we sleep, where we go, our families, our friends, our political affiliation, all this stuff.
[03:49:07.682 --> 03:49:12.465]  If you told someone years ago that you would carry a device with all your information on it,
[03:49:12.745 --> 03:49:15.086]  Pictures, all your preferences.
[03:49:15.086 --> 03:49:17.607]  You'd say, get out of here, I'm not going to do that.
[03:49:17.607 --> 03:49:21.369]  Well, it's always presented as a convenience.
[03:49:21.369 --> 03:49:23.850]  You need this and we eat it up.
[03:49:23.850 --> 03:49:25.250]  It's a doppelganger.
[03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:28.292]  Wow, the way you put that, it's so true.
[03:49:28.292 --> 03:49:33.494]  It literally now, the new iPhones for a couple of years, tracks your heart rate, when you eat, where you go.
[03:49:33.494 --> 03:49:34.114]  I mean.
[03:49:34.114 --> 03:49:37.035]  Soon we won't be able to live without it.
[03:49:37.035 --> 03:49:37.455]  So, I mean.
[03:49:39.483 --> 03:49:47.474]  After a little time goes by and it's been this convenience that now you can't even leave the house without your phone, you lose your mind.
[03:49:47.474 --> 03:49:55.926]  So what they do then is say, well, do you realize this could be used, like you say, it tracks your health, maybe your heart rate, this, whatever other biometrics.
[03:49:56.286 --> 03:50:00.731]  Do you think that at some point won't be used to deny you insurance?
[03:50:16.326 --> 03:50:28.116]  Right, and that's what I'm saying, like, this is so new, this whole transgender thing, it's really still, you know, in a state of confusion, and yet they are rearranging bathrooms, they're writing federal laws, like, where is this going?
[03:50:28.116 --> 03:50:29.317]  Where is this gonna end?
[03:50:29.317 --> 03:50:32.019]  I mean, we're just now witnessing the beginning of this.
[03:50:32.019 --> 03:50:38.264]  They admit, in the Pentagon documents, we've covered it 30 years ago, the globalist plan to make us asexual, where finally there's just no sex.
[03:50:39.125 --> 03:50:40.807]  You're not allowed, and we're going to drug you.
[03:50:40.807 --> 03:50:44.051]  THX113, and I see Anthony Cumia nodding his head.
[03:50:44.051 --> 03:50:47.014]  We're going to come back with himself and Leanne, straight ahead.
[03:50:47.014 --> 03:50:47.915]  Then David Knight's coming up.
[03:50:47.915 --> 03:50:53.462]  I shot a special report that is so important, where Donald Trump destroys the New World Order.
[03:50:53.462 --> 03:50:56.065]  We're going to be airing that as well with Bernie Sanders, too.
[03:50:57.808 --> 03:51:08.270]  Extend your life with ExtendoVite, a 7-herb combination made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, hawthorn, ginkgo biloba, valerian, and milk thistle.

[03:52:57.330 --> 03:52:58.371]  My name is Jay.
[03:52:58.371 --> 03:53:03.313]  I'm 26 years of age and I just want to thank the makers of the One World Whey Protein Powder.
[03:53:03.313 --> 03:53:08.276]  After having chronic abdominal pain and pressure for months, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.
[03:53:08.276 --> 03:53:13.659]  The medical doctor told me there was nothing I could do to treat it other than taking pain and nausea medication.
[03:53:13.659 --> 03:53:19.622]  Then I came across an ad for One World Whey on the radio and read the claims that it can help with all types of inflammation.
[03:53:19.622 --> 03:53:24.965]  I took the One World Whey Protein Powder every day for a month and the chronic pain and pressure sensations went away
[03:53:30.568 --> 03:53:31.409]  Nature is kind.
[03:53:31.409 --> 03:53:35.731]  When we consume foods we're designed to eat, then she gives back health when it was once lost.
[03:53:35.731 --> 03:53:40.234]  One World Way consistently supports the body's production of glutathione and overall repair.
[03:53:40.234 --> 03:53:44.597]  Glutathione stops inflammation, removes heavy metals, and toxins of all kind.
[03:53:44.597 --> 03:53:48.219]  When inflammation is gone, the body can complete its healing process.

[03:53:50.421 --> 03:53:52.922]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[03:54:01.927 --> 03:54:03.008]  Anthony Cooney is our guest.
[03:54:03.008 --> 03:54:04.649]  We've got to get him back up more often.
[03:54:04.649 --> 03:54:06.151]  Really had a lot of fun talking to him today.
[03:54:06.151 --> 03:54:07.031]  David Knight's coming up.
[03:54:07.031 --> 03:54:13.456]  They're going to air a special report I shot that's going viral all over the internet.
[03:54:13.456 --> 03:54:14.657]  Tea Party News has picked it up.
[03:54:14.657 --> 03:54:15.638]  A bunch of other huge sites.
[03:54:15.638 --> 03:54:17.359]  It's going to get tens of millions of views.
[03:54:17.359 --> 03:54:20.622]  Trump exposes globalist coup inside America.
[03:54:20.622 --> 03:54:22.043]  I want to change it to over America.
[03:54:22.043 --> 03:54:23.744]  Elite in full panic mode.
[03:54:23.744 --> 03:54:24.765]  We're going to air that report.
[03:54:24.765 --> 03:54:26.006]  It's about seven minutes long.
[03:54:26.006 --> 03:54:27.487]  The next hour when David Knight takes over.
[03:54:28.268 --> 03:54:30.410]  Also, we've got a lot of other big news.
[03:54:30.410 --> 03:54:40.898]  I should have got into TSA and 70,000 people missing the flights in the last year, and how they're demanding more money from Congress, and the border's open, and they're letting jihadists in.
[03:54:40.898 --> 03:54:48.663]  So we'll talk some about that, but just finishing up, Leanne, you had one other point you were going to make to Anthony on the whole thing about women being forced to use urinals.
[03:54:48.663 --> 03:54:49.944]  It's going to be weird, man.
[03:54:49.944 --> 03:54:50.505]  I already see it.
[03:54:50.505 --> 03:54:51.826]  You walk in, there's like women in the restroom.
[03:54:51.826 --> 03:54:52.546]  It's like, what the?
[03:54:52.546 --> 03:54:53.287]  What's going on here?
[03:54:53.567 --> 03:54:55.708]  Well, there's just a story that came out.
[03:54:55.708 --> 03:55:04.853]  A Saudi man shoots the doctor shortly after the doctor delivered his wife's baby because he didn't want a man to see his spouse naked.
[03:55:04.853 --> 03:55:14.299]  So, I mean, here you have people who are so terrified of having anyone see anything beyond a woman's eyes and now you're going to force them to use all the bathrooms?
[03:55:14.659 --> 03:55:15.480]  I mean, it's a mental illness.
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:17.281]  Saudi Arabia is completely mentally ill.
[03:55:17.281 --> 03:55:18.282]  And I'm bigoted for saying that.
[03:55:18.282 --> 03:55:19.483]  No, they're complete fruits.
[03:55:19.483 --> 03:55:21.105]  The Nazis were crazy.
[03:55:21.105 --> 03:55:22.146]  The Aztecs were nuts.
[03:55:22.146 --> 03:55:23.447]  People go crazy.
[03:55:23.447 --> 03:55:27.490]  Why not admit Saudi Arabian people under this government are nuts?
[03:55:27.490 --> 03:55:30.253]  Anthony, I want to get some into the TSA.
[03:55:30.253 --> 03:55:35.537]  We're almost out of time, but we were getting into all this, and I forget the point before I went to break, but there's just so much going on.
[03:55:35.537 --> 03:55:37.359]  It's like crazy people are taking over.
[03:55:38.784 --> 03:55:40.245]  Yeah, the TSA thing.
[03:55:40.245 --> 03:55:48.712]  I mean, not only are the lines ridiculous, everybody that goes to the airport realizes there's gotta be a better way.
[03:55:48.712 --> 03:55:50.794]  And it's not working.
[03:55:50.794 --> 03:55:58.761]  I mean, there's something like a 98% failure rate when they test the TSA agents with explosives.
[03:55:58.761 --> 03:56:00.023]  They've never caught one terrorist!
[03:56:00.888 --> 03:56:02.390]  So it's not even working!
[03:56:02.390 --> 03:56:08.938]  We're all waiting on these lines and it's a dog and pony show to make us feel good and feel safe?
[03:56:08.938 --> 03:56:10.420]  It's not working.
[03:56:10.420 --> 03:56:13.804]  Well, I mean, in Europe you go over there now and it's mainly the jihadis that are running the security.
[03:56:15.247 --> 03:56:22.813]  That whole, I don't know what kind of psychopath you'd have to be to fly out of De Gaulle Airport at this point.
[03:56:22.813 --> 03:56:27.957]  They have people on the airport's payroll that are jihadis.
[03:56:27.957 --> 03:56:29.559]  I don't understand.
[03:56:29.559 --> 03:56:31.180]  You don't want to offend people?
[03:56:31.180 --> 03:56:32.701]  You'd rather blow up at 37,000 feet?
[03:56:34.182 --> 03:56:35.463]  They're clapping at their own...
[03:56:54.827 --> 03:56:58.969]  Extermination, which is ironic, but they are.
[03:56:58.969 --> 03:57:10.094]  I can't understand people that applaud and feel good about their culture, their history, their ancestry being erased.
[03:57:10.094 --> 03:57:10.894]  I don't get it.
[03:57:11.806 --> 03:57:14.387]  Well, it's progressive and loving to hate yourself.
[03:57:14.387 --> 03:57:15.707]  The truth is, I mean, I'm here to say it.
[03:57:15.707 --> 03:57:16.887]  I never used to bash the left.
[03:57:16.887 --> 03:57:18.467]  I didn't like them, but I was just more libertarian.
[03:57:18.467 --> 03:57:19.968]  These people are demons.
[03:57:19.968 --> 03:57:22.028]  I mean, and they're mentally ill.
[03:57:22.028 --> 03:57:24.309]  And it's like Gavin was saying, they have daddy issues.
[03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:27.649]  They just want to overthrow everything because they can't build anything.
[03:57:27.649 --> 03:57:30.250]  So they see the civilization and they get scared by it.
[03:57:30.250 --> 03:57:31.990]  Like, oh, freedom.
[03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.470]  What do we do?
[03:57:32.470 --> 03:57:33.511]  Bring in the jihadis.
[03:57:33.511 --> 03:57:35.171]  You know, put beekeeper suits on the women.
[03:57:35.851 --> 03:57:39.172]  Right, and they'll wait to collapse our society until they can disarm us.
[03:57:39.172 --> 03:57:44.433]  Well, we're fighting back, and the world is waking up, and I just want to thank our guests for joining us.
[03:57:44.433 --> 03:57:46.333]  Closing comments, Anthony, it's great having you.
[03:57:46.333 --> 03:57:47.374]  Thanks for the time.
[03:57:47.374 --> 03:58:03.277]  Well, when you look at what's happening at the Alamo Draft House and what we've seen over the past ten years with trying to squash people's freedom of expression and voicing their opinions, it's doing away with identity.
[03:58:03.837 --> 03:58:06.480]  They don't want us to have an identity.
[03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:13.089]  And traditional identities of family, a man, a woman, the kids, is a bad word.
[03:58:13.089 --> 03:58:13.849]  You can't.
[03:58:13.849 --> 03:58:16.353]  That's looked at as something terrible.
[03:58:16.353 --> 03:58:19.677]  Meanwhile, when you look around the world, that's what built it.
[03:58:20.037 --> 03:58:24.481]  That's what built all the amazing things, yet now it's a bad thing.
[03:58:24.481 --> 03:58:30.206]  So all these little tricks that you see, they're trying to do away with people's ideas.
