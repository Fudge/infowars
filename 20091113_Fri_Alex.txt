[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:33.520 --> 00:40.880]  to mexico do some surfing is former minnesota governor jesse ventura of course a star of films
[00:40.880 --> 00:49.040]  like the running man predator and many other films he's hosted a msnbc national television show
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.600]  he's hosted nfl football there's not much this guy hadn't done and now he's got a huge
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.760]  show they're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter their big number one promoted
[00:59.760 --> 01:06.160]  show and i'm seeing that now in the media that's conspiracy theory created by jesse ventura i'm
[01:06.160 --> 01:11.040]  a consultant on it i'm in some of the episodes i'm very honored to be involved in it and to give
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.080]  you the inside scoop he starts the media blitz tomorrow to give you the inside scoop is jesse
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.720]  ventura with us for the next hour we may twist his arm a little bit in the next hour to take
[01:20.720 --> 01:25.840]  some phone calls but we'll see governor it is good to have you here with us hi alex great to be here
[01:25.840 --> 01:36.400]  again i guess i guess i should call you huggy bear and i'll explain that for a moment now alex
[01:36.400 --> 01:42.640]  has been good enough he uh he appears in a couple of the episodes of conspiracy theory that we did
[01:42.640 --> 01:48.960]  and so because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial
[01:48.960 --> 01:55.120]  buy we went back to the old starsky and hutch show and you i remember huggy bear don't you the guy
[01:55.120 --> 02:00.720]  that always brought the information to starsky and hutch yes well that's you now alex you're
[02:00.720 --> 02:07.760]  so you're our huggy bear well i'm honored to be your huggy bear um you've not been able to talk
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.440]  about the show till now they've unleashed you you barely talked about it on larry king live
[02:13.440 --> 02:20.640]  last week but now you've been given the green light to to give people a a a a foretaste or a
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.560]  idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes and so we're all ears governor i mean tell us
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.680]  about some of the episodes well first of all um when i went on larry it was because you know it
[02:31.680 --> 02:38.000]  was election night and larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections which
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.320]  i'll get i'll do this right now to me why do they even have off-year elections it's hard enough to
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.640]  get people out there to vote uh have them all on your they do that so that they get a small voter
[02:50.640 --> 02:56.000]  turnout because it's easier to control small numbers and so that's why that happens pretty
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.080]  much but that being said um that's why it was on larry was mainly for the the election stuff not
[03:02.080 --> 03:07.840]  so much a promotion of the show because i'll be going back on larry later on the end of the month
[03:07.840 --> 03:13.040]  right when it gets to the debut date which of course is december the second on the coup channel at
[03:13.040 --> 03:20.000]  uh ten eastern nine central and uh so i'll be going back on larry then and at that point in time
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.440]  it'll be a promo for the show so i just did larry where they promoted a little bit but it was mostly
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.880]  on voting but uh or on the vote bill but governor hold on we're about to go to break and i want i
[03:30.880 --> 03:34.800]  don't want to stop you i want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.360]  the episodes because i've consulted some but i still only have a few pieces of the overall
[03:39.360 --> 03:44.560]  puzzle and i know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective
[03:44.560 --> 03:49.760]  probably the first television show ever that's actually from people who questions perspective
[03:49.760 --> 03:54.240]  that doesn't mean that you or i or anybody buys all of what's being said out there so i want to
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.960]  talk about that when we come back in just a minute but in the one minute we've got what is your take
[03:58.960 --> 04:05.280]  on republicans sweeping uh all over the country and obama's plunging approval rating well i
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.760]  don't think it's so much republican sweeping uh as you know they lost that uh that congressional
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.320]  race up in that heavily republican district in new york that hadn't gone democrat yeah but the
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.200]  democrats threw that they threw that i mean they had their well maybe so well to me the
[04:21.200 --> 04:29.040]  elections are truly irrelevant and as far as obama's ratings falling um that's a natural occurrence
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.280]  you know i don't want to throw water on the fire or anything for those people that you know for
[04:33.280 --> 04:40.480]  whatever reason but i at one time had 72 percent approval ratings well certainly by the time you
[04:40.480 --> 04:47.840]  get out of office might actually dip below 50 later you're right when you have to make hard
[04:47.840 --> 04:54.560]  decisions when you make those hard decisions people some people aren't gonna like it and a lot

[08:30.080 --> 08:37.920]  december the launch of his long-awaited television show conspiracy theory on tru tv here to tell us
[08:37.920 --> 08:44.160]  dates and times and inside details first on this radio show when jesse called me back friday evening
[08:44.160 --> 08:48.960]  and said okay i'll do your show first i was extremely honored and so governor i really do
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.880]  appreciate uh you coming here first to talk about it i know the media blitz starts later today and
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.760]  tomorrow uh but we but we were finishing up when you got cut off by that break you were talking
[08:59.760 --> 09:05.040]  about you're not surprised obama's approval ratings dropped yours went from the mid 70s to the
[09:05.040 --> 09:12.000]  high 40s and but but but that was four years later my issue yeah that's true alex but it's
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.040]  going to happen you know that the honeymoon wears off the hard decisions have to be made
[09:17.600 --> 09:23.520]  people many times disagree with those tough decisions and your approval rating starts to fall
[09:23.520 --> 09:29.600]  the positive for me the way i always looked at it was like this i was in a three-way race not a
[09:29.600 --> 09:38.720]  two-way race i won with only 37 percent so even if my approval says fell all the way to 45 that was
[09:38.720 --> 09:48.240]  still eight points higher than what i won with sure and george w bushes went from 92 uh to 39
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.880]  but again that took seven he had to have been lower than 39 yeah some approval ratings had him at
[09:54.880 --> 10:01.280]  25 i mean there's so many votes yes he would sell with the hardcore republicans i i in the end i can't
[10:01.280 --> 10:07.280]  see him even getting over 30 percent approval rate well i know congress just a political gift from
[10:07.280 --> 10:14.160]  his party exactly i know that the overall congress both parties had an 11 percent when he left
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.480]  office and it's now going back down that direction again my point is obama's approval rating has
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.920]  broken records according to the major pollsters for falling the fastest in the first year of a new
[10:23.920 --> 10:31.280]  administration and and now he's losing his base he the cbs news last night reported he is putting
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.640]  in 40 000 more troops in afghanistan and jesse i know you've researched this and are well read on
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.160]  this subject let's talk about this right now and then get into the show there's 12 times the opium
[10:42.160 --> 10:48.400]  12 times coming out of afghanistan of what was coming out eight years ago and even the bbc admits
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.400]  our troops are guarding the opium so quote the taliban doesn't get it no that's so the banks can
[10:54.400 --> 11:00.960]  launder 500 billion in smack every year governor ventura your take on this war i well to me welcome
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.640]  in my lifetime now how wonderful it is welcome to another vietnam
[11:09.040 --> 11:15.680]  it's that simple it's going to accomplish nothing guys are going to die over there on a constant
[11:15.680 --> 11:22.640]  basis as they have in iraq and you know welcome to another vietnam when they when this is all over
[11:22.640 --> 11:30.720]  and done with i will i i do it right now alex i sit back and go how is this how is jesse been
[11:30.720 --> 11:38.400]  to a benefiting from these two wars and i can't think of a thing and yet we've got people out there
[11:38.400 --> 11:44.160]  protesting whether people should be able to go see a doctor or not if we wouldn't have fought these
[11:44.160 --> 11:53.040]  two wars we'd have plenty of money for health care wouldn't we absolutely and and my point is
[11:54.160 --> 12:02.480]  wars why you know wars are the most destructive thing mankind can do and when he engages in them
[12:02.480 --> 12:09.680]  it has no benefit it's like herman goring said the best thing a farmer can get out of a war
[12:09.680 --> 12:16.480]  is to be able to come back on the same farm you left before the war started that's the best outcome
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.800]  the very best there will be nothing more than that and when is this country going to wake up
[12:24.560 --> 12:31.040]  you know i sit back and i'm i i i can't i can't see i'm speechless because i'm i'm bitching about
[12:31.040 --> 12:37.280]  it right now but i cannot believe that people aren't protesting these wars and now we're sending
[12:37.280 --> 12:45.360]  more troops in to accomplish what the russians couldn't win there and we're so stupid and our
[12:45.360 --> 12:54.160]  ego is so powerful that we think we can well they can't win the state of objective to bring
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.600]  democracy and freedom to afghanistan but if the objective is to destabilize the region
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.800]  and have bases to menace iran and china and in the state of objective you know the real
[13:04.800 --> 13:10.400]  objective is to launder drug proceeds then it's mission accomplished they just need to sit there
[13:10.400 --> 13:16.080]  if that's indeed what it is alex then you will be you're absolutely correct it's mission accomplished
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.640]  if that's what they're accomplishing out of this i can't prove that that's what they are
[13:20.640 --> 13:27.760]  aren't doing at this time but certainly from a base perspective of jesse ventura american citizen
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.920]  i don't understand how i benefit by these wars one bit or any of the rest of us benefit by
[13:33.920 --> 13:38.560]  them one bit okay here's an example then we'll get into the tv show sure i know you've been busy
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.200]  with you know producing the television show and flying all over the country and we'll talk about
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.440]  that you are really working hard on this a lot of work a lot of time a lot of energy a lot of money
[13:47.440 --> 13:54.480]  money that i wanted but at the same time it came out two weeks ago new york times that
[13:54.480 --> 14:02.480]  mohammed karzai's brother is the head opium king pennant afghanistan and that he is a cia operative
[14:02.480 --> 14:09.200]  on cia payroll and that basically so is mohammed karzai and that our troops are guarding his
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.000]  poppy fields and i was driving down the road a few months ago and heard bbc report the same thing
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.600]  before the new york times did and i already knew that but to hear them report that oh we guard the
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.000]  opium because if we don't guard it another taliban group will get it and then they'll get too much
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.400]  power that's what they're telling the troops we guard the opium to win the war you know the cia
[14:30.400 --> 14:37.280]  got caught with opium in in uh in southeast asia in vietnam we're now in columbia putting bases in
[14:37.280 --> 14:43.520]  anywhere there's drugs our troops are there to eradicate the other guys drugs and protect
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.640]  the drug kingpins that launder their money through you through us and european banks and and after
[14:50.640 --> 14:57.360]  that the fact that that's how the cia gets their revenue so that they can then do operations that
[14:57.360 --> 15:04.560]  they can keep away from congress because if they have to do operations that require them to get money
[15:04.560 --> 15:10.400]  from our tax money then they have to be forward enough to let congress know what they're doing
[15:10.400 --> 15:17.680]  with the money but if they're getting money via illegal drugs and making all sorts of money
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.200]  out of that end of the world they then don't have to declare any of that to congress and that's when
[15:23.200 --> 15:29.280]  they can do these dirty jobs that the american public will never know about governor jesse vintera
[15:29.280 --> 15:35.040]  that is the nail on the head absolutely i hadn't even thought to make that point all those tens of
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.560]  billions in unaccountable money that these private interest on their operations so that they don't
[15:40.560 --> 15:49.360]  have to be accountable to the congress absolutely in fact in 96 that came out on c span with the cia
[15:49.360 --> 15:55.360]  inspector general testifying that the cia brought in the crack cocaine epidemic
[15:58.320 --> 16:04.240]  well that that i don't know that you know about that alex i don't i can only speak to what i know
[16:04.240 --> 16:11.760]  about and and uh you know you're better well right on it than i am well no i mean i mean you know
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.960]  as much or more than i do you just brought up the key point that they're funding their black
[16:14.960 --> 16:20.400]  operations with this oh yeah no i i i felt that and that for a long long time but that's
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.880]  that's the simple way to do it that's how you keep it out of the public eye that's how
[16:25.520 --> 16:30.000]  that's how you can get money to do political assassinations like in the old days when they
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.840]  used to attempt to kill castro okay i'm gonna shut up if they do that if they get money from
[16:35.840 --> 16:42.480]  congress then they have to submit reports and it has to be far more above board but if they get the
[16:42.480 --> 16:47.520]  money from somewhere else which can be dirty drug money will then make them spend it on any
[16:47.520 --> 16:52.080]  operations they want to do and they don't have to be accountable to the american public or the
[16:52.080 --> 16:57.120]  congress for it absolutely governor we've got you here to talk about the tv show but i'm gonna stop
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.760]  getting off in other issues i apologize but it's always interesting to hear your your truthful
[17:01.760 --> 17:07.840]  perspective because you're absolutely right on on those issues uh where to start with the tv show
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.720]  i mean i've seen the one promo clip where you went out to harp and they and they threatened to
[17:12.720 --> 17:17.840]  arrest you and then suddenly the equipment went dead uh let's go through the seven episodes and
[17:17.840 --> 17:23.120]  give people an idea what's coming up well uh hopefully i can remember them all i'll tell you
[17:23.120 --> 17:29.280]  we got we it was so hectic shooting them that sometimes i had to jump from one episode to
[17:29.280 --> 17:35.760]  another episode and uh that plays games with your mind because you're focused in on one thing and
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.480]  then you know the next half a day you might be doing something for a completely different
[17:40.480 --> 17:46.800]  let me ask this what's your favorite what's your favorite episode um i would say my favorite one
[17:46.800 --> 17:53.840]  would would be 9 11 because i think 9 11 was the original one that i took to the two tv people
[17:53.840 --> 18:01.600]  to sell them on this show and so it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far
[18:01.600 --> 18:07.280]  so i would have to say that that that one is the most satisfying although they all are pretty much
[18:07.280 --> 18:12.880]  and i'll put it to you this way the way that i'm going to explain it is quite simple alex people
[18:12.880 --> 18:19.520]  can choose to believe the conspiracies are not all seven of these and they're all fairly modern day
[18:19.520 --> 18:24.640]  the one thing two channel wanted to do we don't go back to kennedy we don't go back they wanted
[18:24.640 --> 18:32.320]  to keep this first series within the last decade pretty much and uh you can choose to believe them
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.640]  or you can choose not to believe them but i'll guarantee you this if you watch the show you're
[18:36.640 --> 18:44.400]  going to get scared oh even if even if they're not true there is still the element that they
[18:44.400 --> 18:52.080]  may be they might be and they could be and maybe they are and that should be enough to wake people
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.920]  up and scare them this is the first show that i've ever done in my career where i got scared
[18:57.920 --> 19:04.400]  and i don't get scared easy i remember a few weeks ago i ran into and we were checking in at the
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.120]  hotel and you walked up and you were shaking your head and you said alex you were there with your
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.400]  son tyrell who's working on the show as well doing a great job you walked up and you said alex
[19:14.400 --> 19:19.040]  when i go to bed at night my head's spinning with all this information this stuff is scary oh yeah
[19:19.040 --> 19:25.760]  yeah no i we went into some places that uh you know you think is only fantasy land but uh
[19:26.400 --> 19:32.640]  it could very well be reality land and uh it's stuff that people don't even think about don't
[19:32.640 --> 19:37.440]  deal with in their daily lives you know that's one of the main things is people people out there
[19:37.440 --> 19:41.680]  have to earn a living they have to make a living for their family so they haven't got time to go
[19:41.680 --> 19:47.760]  delving into the underhanded stuff that government might be doing and it's interesting alex that
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.960]  we started this show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the conspiracy
[19:52.960 --> 19:57.760]  and then allow the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one he or she would choose to believe
[19:57.760 --> 20:03.520]  hold it there god of rite governor this is a key info i believe obama is creating runaway inflation

[24:19.040 --> 24:23.440]  all right going back to governor jessie ventura this is a short segment long segment coming up
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.440]  he'll be with us a little bit into the next hour we're going to open the phones up specifically
[24:28.240 --> 24:36.720]  only for governor jessie ventura at 1-800-259-9231 quick question or comment for the governor coming
[24:36.720 --> 24:41.680]  up okay you got cut off again by the satellite i'm making this going to break start over start
[24:41.680 --> 24:48.240]  over governor with the point that you were making about the tv show well initially alex we started
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.680]  off to do the show with the concept that both sides of the of the conspiracy would be told if
[24:53.680 --> 24:59.680]  there were two sides many times there may be multiple sides but the two major sides and then
[24:59.680 --> 25:04.400]  we'd let the viewer decide well then the show had to go through a metamorphosis if you will or an
[25:04.400 --> 25:11.200]  evolution whatever you want to call it because when one side does not cooperate one bit it is
[25:11.200 --> 25:17.120]  pretty hard to tell their story and that was the case of the united states government i i did an
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.680]  interview the other day a print interview and the person asked me and i said well you know the
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.960]  government hasn't cooperated at all and they said this includes when obama's taken over i said there's
[25:28.960 --> 25:34.400]  been no difference i said it hasn't made one bit of difference because we started the show george
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.960]  bush was still the president and the show's been in the works and i've been working on it for a
[25:38.960 --> 25:47.680]  year now basically or better and uh and the government cooperated nothing zero silks we
[25:47.680 --> 25:53.120]  could not even get a spokesperson out for the government well we do get a few former government
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.840]  people who are now no longer working for the government who had courage enough to come out
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.520]  and talk to us and offer their opinions but no one under the government would cooperate with the
[26:03.520 --> 26:10.400]  show at all so then the show became simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.440]  and now the viewer gets to see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.240]  occasions on the different conspiracies that they're involved with and by the way we've got
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.720]  governor jesse ventura's with us uh talking about the new tv show that's coming up in
[26:24.720 --> 26:30.720]  december and january called conspiracy theory on true tv again jesse ventura is our guest
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.920]  how much can you tell us about the 9 11 episode because i know that more and more as you went out
[26:35.920 --> 26:43.440]  and tried to talk to them no one would and jesse ventura navy seal governor you know
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.200]  fighter uh is a lot more intimidating and a lot more effective than when michael more and i'm not
[26:49.200 --> 26:55.040]  against michael more kind of ninnies around uh i mean this is some dynamic confrontations
[26:55.040 --> 27:00.000]  uh in many ways michael more probably got more cooperation than i got
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.880]  but let folks in a little bit none i got none when it came to 9 11 no one from the government
[27:08.880 --> 27:15.440]  would talk to the show no one from the 9 11 commission would talk no one representing any
[27:15.440 --> 27:21.280]  type of government agency would talk uh you know i don't want to wreck the show by saying what we
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.680]  did where we did it and do all that because i want people to watch the show uh the show came
[27:27.680 --> 27:36.560]  about like this a victim came to me and a victim pleaded with me the a victim who lost her daughter
[27:36.560 --> 27:43.840]  and her potential grandchild her daughter was pregnant and she died the day the infamous day
[27:43.840 --> 27:51.760]  of 9 11 and her mom you know came to me feeling that i was the person with this show who could
[27:51.760 --> 27:57.440]  bring to light the fact that we need a real investigation of 9 11 and not the one that they
[27:57.440 --> 28:04.320]  did and so it's a natural progression then when when when it's brought to me the next person i want
[28:04.320 --> 28:10.240]  to talk to is someone who is there someone who actually went through 9 11 which we were able
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.000]  to do also at the show and then from there the progression goes to someone who was there during
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.400]  the cleanup you know the almost 300 days that it took to clean up the mess and what went on there
[28:22.400 --> 28:29.040]  did an investigation to crew there we have but the person who identified and saw the black boxes
[28:29.040 --> 28:35.440]  which of course the government tells us were not found unbelievable again i don't want to give away
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.320]  too much but i want people to watch that's why i'm just going to talk i'm not going to give
[28:40.320 --> 28:46.400]  specifics of the show alex because i want everyone to enjoy the show and i shouldn't i and i won't
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.280]  narrate it before it goes on the air no no no that's but i mean you're giving us a lot here
[28:51.280 --> 28:56.000]  and i know a lot of the inside baseball and obviously i'm sworn to secrecy i'm just telling
[28:56.000 --> 29:07.680]  folks i'm surprised you're able to get this on air jesse because i've got i've i made a gentleman's
[29:07.680 --> 29:14.160]  bed at the start of this show that it would never see air i see i felt we would complete them all
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.920]  but i felt strongly that at some point in time someone wouldn't allow it and so far it's full
[29:19.920 --> 29:26.160]  steam ahead now we do have to wait till december second because that's the airing again of the
[29:26.160 --> 29:32.800]  first show which is you know that's a couple weeks away yet three weeks away in fact i remember in

[34:11.120 --> 34:15.280]  all day tomorrow today you couldn't i couldn't get there in time so it has to be tomorrow but
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.240]  oh well we'll pass on it this time i'm certain there'll be more storms especially after learning
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.920]  about harp absolutely uh you know i have the director of harp on one time and and he admitted
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.280]  oh we we turned the atmosphere on fire with it at night it starts laughing and then somebody on the
[34:31.280 --> 34:37.680]  line cut the line off and my producer saw this and during the break a uh air force officer came on
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.840]  and said you can't talk about that anymore so the military was bossing the uh the uh civilian
[34:43.840 --> 34:48.640]  scientific head of harp around well what's interesting and of course for those that don't
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.840]  know what harp is harp is way up in alaska and that's one of the shows we go up to visit it
[34:53.840 --> 35:01.840]  photograph it and it's it's a group of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50 000 watts of
[35:01.840 --> 35:09.040]  energy up into the biosphere i should say a low radio low frequency sounds up into the biosphere
[35:09.040 --> 35:15.840]  which does cause a heating now alex let me ask you this does could that possibly contribute to
[35:15.840 --> 35:22.400]  global warming absolutely in fact the scientists we've interviewed this could be much more
[35:22.400 --> 35:29.520]  contributor of global warming than us driving our cars around well as you know secretary of defense
[35:29.520 --> 35:34.800]  cohen in 97 admitted to the army times they did have weather weapons then and i've interviewed
[35:34.800 --> 35:39.520]  the former father of weather weapons been livingston and clearly i believe this is a
[35:39.520 --> 35:44.960]  false flag attack we have had a lot of strange weather and that naturally occurs but there's
[35:44.960 --> 35:50.240]  been a lot of that's that's going to be that's the opening show alex the opening show december
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.640]  second is on harp and i think people are going to find it a very interesting show uh i went all
[35:56.640 --> 36:04.000]  the way up to alaska and went to this location and we jumped into a helicopter and bear this in mind
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.080]  distinct and not airplanes out of the air and uh it's a very interesting thing going on up there
[36:14.080 --> 36:20.080]  it's the government it falls under let me put it this way it falls under the military the air force
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.040]  and yet it is given the distinction of being an unclassified research center yet i was not
[36:27.040 --> 36:33.600]  allowed in now bear in mind i used to have a top secret security clearance with the united
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.680]  states government during my six years as a member of underwater demolition team 12 and seal team one
[36:40.800 --> 36:48.400]  i was also a mayor and a governor and yet i was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified
[36:48.400 --> 36:54.240]  research center if it's unclassified anybody should be able to go in there
[36:56.240 --> 37:01.280]  well that's a good point uh jesse on this specific subject we can get into more detail
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.480]  because this has been released to the media i want to play this clip and then ask you about
[37:06.480 --> 37:12.400]  this is a one-minute clip of governor jesse ventura being stopped at the gates he's about to just
[37:12.400 --> 37:20.000]  i guess bull is way on in there and uh suddenly the equipment goes dead and i talked to the crew
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.600]  this really happened so they were using some type of electronic warfare jamming system here it is
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.880]  ladies and gentlemen really need to go through the air force well we did we got stonewall and
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.800]  this is strictly a research facility clearly there's something going on here that they don't want
[37:38.800 --> 37:43.520]  people to know about there's a lot of cool science that we do with the specific come on man i'm a navy
[37:43.520 --> 37:49.600]  seal the military don't do things unless it has a military purpose and a military purpose is
[37:49.600 --> 37:57.040]  destruction and wage and war it's a stalemate or is it back up a little bit from the day some of
[37:57.040 --> 38:03.680]  people come through here and i get denied something i do the opposite of getting intimidated i get
[38:03.680 --> 38:14.720]  angry jesse is about to walk right on through when suddenly the camera equipment begins to
[38:14.720 --> 38:24.240]  go haywire something is interfering with the audio and video this is more than unclassified that's
[38:24.240 --> 38:33.920]  bullshit all right now that was that aired on cnn we the potty language was cut out but but but i
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.440]  don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress so tell us what you can about the harp episode
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.840]  because this is amazing well you know we were but we were denied access as i said and you know
[38:45.840 --> 38:51.120]  even though the security clearance as i've had in my life and holding the position of governor i
[38:51.120 --> 38:56.240]  guess alex the only way i guess i can get in there is to run and get reelected to something again
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.960]  you know then maybe i would be high enough in the government that they would let me in and see
[39:00.960 --> 39:08.320]  what they're doing there but that aside uh and then we did have some problem now it made it seem
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.400]  i don't know what caused our cameras to go bad i do i am not going to specifically sit here and
[39:14.400 --> 39:20.400]  say that they jammed them that they did something to them i will simply state that our audio and
[39:20.400 --> 39:27.840]  our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate who what was responsible we never
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.160]  were sure uh we never were sure or positively found out but to be specific and correct me if
[39:34.160 --> 39:37.920]  i'm wrong because i was just talking to some of the crew while we were shooting separately back in
[39:37.920 --> 39:44.720]  los angeles they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital recordings it was even
[39:44.720 --> 39:52.240]  distorting i mean this wasn't just one one rig to have separate malfunctions the same malfunctions
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.160]  you're talking about one in a billion one in a trillion i mean this is bizarre i don't know
[39:58.160 --> 40:05.280]  i don't know but all i can say is that we did run into complications and what caused them or why
[40:05.280 --> 40:11.120]  we were never able to ascertain but you know and then when we were and then later on all the
[40:11.120 --> 40:17.120]  equipment later were fine and we never had any more problem with it the rest of the shoot well i
[40:17.120 --> 40:24.240]  want to say clearly on the record that from the scientists we've interviewed harp is designed
[40:24.240 --> 40:33.120]  to be a weapon it can heat the atmosphere it can direct those huge rivers of vapor of condensation
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.120]  of water as weapons and the chinese brag the russians brag you can hire their government funded
[40:39.120 --> 40:45.440]  companies to control the weather for you this is let's let's remember something too alex there were
[40:45.440 --> 40:52.640]  treaties signed back in the 1970s that governments would not use weapon or would not use weather or
[40:52.640 --> 40:59.680]  nature for war and we were one of the people that signed these treaties and i think that's an
[40:59.680 --> 41:06.560]  important issue right here if we sign treaties that we won't use things we won't use nature to
[41:06.560 --> 41:13.680]  permit war and and then we might very well be violating the very treaties we've signed well
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.640]  that's a great point and you made the point to me privately that well alex why are we signing
[41:18.640 --> 41:27.520]  treaties for weather weapons if they don't exist that's true also so you know and and i think people
[41:27.520 --> 41:33.360]  are also going to enjoy there's another part of harp that we haven't mentioned today that will be
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.800]  the most terrifying of anything we've talked about and i'm going to leave that up in the air
[41:38.800 --> 41:45.440]  because harp is going to be to my knowledge the first episode december 2nd again our shamelessly
[41:45.440 --> 41:51.520]  promoted ten o'clock eastern nine o'clock central on the true channel harp will be the first episode
[41:51.520 --> 41:56.800]  to my knowledge if they change it then i don't know about it and there is something in harp
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.560]  beyond what we've even talked about alex that is more terrifying than what we have talked about
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.840]  and i know what it is but i'm going to keep my mouth shut it this is coming up you know finishing
[42:07.840 --> 42:12.960]  up before we get into the other episodes during the break we were talking you you're saying you
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.680]  made the bet with your crew and i remember you telling me privately in the car you said
[42:17.680 --> 42:23.440]  we'll see if it's going to air i don't think it will but but we'll see i'm going to try well i
[42:23.440 --> 42:30.000]  i did a gentleman's bet with my crew in task basically i said i i bet you no money involved
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.600]  just a gentleman's bet that we will complete all of these we will do all seven episodes
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.080]  uh and and we'll finish them all but i said i still don't believe they will see the light of
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.840]  day that they will be aired and so far i'm losing the gentleman's bet but there's still about three
[42:47.840 --> 42:54.720]  weeks to go and i hope that i do lose it i do not want and i'm i'm a competitive person i do not
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.800]  like to lose anything but i'm hoping that i lose this bet i don't want to win this bet
[43:02.560 --> 43:07.840]  well i hope that uh you do lose the bet as well because i've been involved in a few tv productions
[43:09.040 --> 43:14.560]  one of them this way alex if it doesn't see the light of day the show that we've completed
[43:15.120 --> 43:19.280]  then i need then i need to come back on your show and we need to ask why
[43:19.280 --> 43:24.080]  why we need to at that point start addressing i believe the first amendment
[43:25.600 --> 43:31.360]  i agree with you well i i don't see how they're gonna air something that's more than fair from
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.080]  our perspective and from what i've seen and i know you're an honorable person this is a
[43:36.080 --> 43:43.040]  extremely fair leaning towards our perspective because as you said you couldn't get the other side
[43:43.040 --> 43:48.480]  to come out and debate there's nothing but stonewalling it isn't even a debate alex we couldn't
[43:48.480 --> 43:54.640]  even get them to come out and make a comment the government wouldn't talk to us plain and simple
[43:54.640 --> 44:00.480]  they wouldn't talk on harp they wouldn't talk on 9 11 they wouldn't talk on anything that
[44:00.480 --> 44:07.200]  involved the government and and their involvement in any type of conspiracy or whatever the conspiracy
[44:07.200 --> 44:13.360]  is you cannot get anyone from government to participate or talk in any manner it's that
[44:13.360 --> 44:19.920]  simple and people need to understand that's the scary thing overwhelmingly scary thing about
[44:19.920 --> 44:26.160]  doing this whole show is the fact that government doesn't happen to have to cooperate they act
[44:26.160 --> 44:32.080]  like we work for them and i believe they've forgotten something and we've forgotten something
[44:32.080 --> 44:38.000]  they work for us that's the way it's supposed to be but in this country i believe those roles
[44:38.000 --> 44:43.520]  have switched now and the government views us working for them rather than the way it's supposed
[44:43.520 --> 44:51.920]  to be well that's just an incredible point that things really are backwards now in this nation
[44:51.920 --> 44:57.440]  in this country and if they do allow this to go on television which it looks like it's going to
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.680]  happen is that the system is so arrogant that they don't even care if we know the truth now
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.840]  i'm seeing george soros and al gore and bancai moon of the un openly say we're going under
[45:09.840 --> 45:15.200]  world government openly saying it's a new world order openly stating it's about population reduction
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.200]  one child policy la times reports there's going to be a tax on owning a dog or cat
[45:21.200 --> 45:25.840]  because they eat meat which has a carbon footprint you got the global warming episode
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.240]  we're going to talk about that i mean they're really coming out in the open so is it that
[45:30.240 --> 45:34.000]  they don't have total control of the media and this and so you're getting through the
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.520]  chink in the armor or is it they're so arrogant now they don't care if governor ventura goes out
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.480]  and tells you how screwed you are they might even sit back and you know roast some march mellows and
[45:44.480 --> 45:51.760]  laugh at us i don't know alex i i'm not in contact with any of these quote unquote people so i have
[45:51.760 --> 45:57.280]  no idea oh by the way you got global warming is the is the last one that i list to you of the
[45:57.280 --> 46:02.640]  we do a is global warming a conspiracy that we were both here trying to remember all seven
[46:02.640 --> 46:07.600]  episodes and finally it came to me so i thought i'd shout it out well you got it right there
[46:07.600 --> 46:12.320]  because that was the seventh one that i like i said when i shot these things they were not in
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.560]  sequence always and so it can get pretty confusing it was a lot like governing where you
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.280]  go from one meeting one hour to a completely different meeting the next dollar no no i know
[46:23.280 --> 46:28.720]  it makes your head spin especially when you're really into the minutiae let's get into 2012
[46:28.720 --> 46:34.480]  then we'll get into secret societies manchurian candidate big brother in global warming 2012
[46:34.480 --> 46:42.480]  obviously three days from now on friday the huge movie is coming out where woody heraldson kind of
[46:42.480 --> 46:48.160]  plays the conspiracy theory type i i know heraldson so we're trying to get him on the show in fact
[46:48.160 --> 46:55.360]  that may happen but what's your whole take on the real 2012 and the serious in-depth research you
[46:55.360 --> 47:01.040]  did and then separately in the show i know you get into without saying too much whether it's
[47:01.040 --> 47:06.640]  real or not the elite think it's real and they are getting ready i mean to me i think in fact i
[47:06.640 --> 47:11.360]  wish i was in that episode i've been told i'm not to me that's going to be one of the hottest episodes
[47:11.360 --> 47:18.080]  well it is and and uh let me just put it this way and again i'm not going to go in and and make it so
[47:18.080 --> 47:25.040]  people won't watch by telling everything that happens but uh it goes far beyond let me say
[47:25.040 --> 47:31.920]  this the bayan calendar now the bayans were very intelligent people way ahead of their time when
[47:31.920 --> 47:38.400]  it came to understanding the planets and the solar system and the heavens they truly were because
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.520]  i've learned this even with all of our modern technology today the mayans are right on our
[47:45.520 --> 47:53.760]  technology for the most part cannot prove them wrong under most things so here you had a culture
[47:53.760 --> 48:00.640]  that took place many many many years ago that was very very bright when it came to space and
[48:00.640 --> 48:09.040]  and this 2012 show goes beyond the mayan calendar it goes to some things that we know are actually
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.440]  real and completely backed up by nasa and that's where i'll leave it right there because i want
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.120]  people intrigued i want them to watch the show and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives
[48:22.320 --> 48:26.720]  are you knowing what you now know doing the deep research are you concerned about 2012
[48:26.720 --> 48:34.560]  uh i'm concerned yeah i'm concerned over over things that i have learned yes i'm very concerned
[48:34.560 --> 48:41.520]  over them and i'll end when later on when the show's all air alex will and and i don't have to try
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.520]  to intrigue a listening audience anymore i'll be glad to come back on the show and openly talk
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.640]  about what concerns me after it airs absolutely that'd be a great radio interview and also talk
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.120]  about how much hit the cutting room floor you guys have done a ton of work i mean they've been working
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.760]  your butt off oh yeah i've been here here i'm trying you know how it works in the country alex when
[49:03.760 --> 49:11.200]  you try to retire and quit that's when your agent finds your jobs but when you're looking for the
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.280]  jobs for 20 years they can't find you anything no i've been to uh i've been to LA so many times
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.800]  i can't remember since summer i've been to anchorage Alaska i've been to san francisco i've been to
[49:22.800 --> 49:30.400]  oklahoma city kansas city uh new york multiple multiple times and i've lost track of few a few
[49:30.400 --> 49:35.600]  of the other places that i've been to but uh the most unique was the thing going up the anchorage
[49:35.600 --> 49:43.280]  to learn about harp absolutely and uh again i'm a huggy bear let me interject alex of which i
[49:43.280 --> 49:51.360]  up until about four months ago i didn't even know what harp was didn't even know what it was this
[49:51.360 --> 49:55.760]  has been quite a journey for you i know your son began to really get you into this five six years ago
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.600]  and obviously i gave you some films and and that helped you along your journey and then you described
[50:01.600 --> 50:06.400]  it to me at the hotel that now it's like the top of your head's blown off the whole world's opening
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.240]  up and it's quite a journey isn't it governor well it sure is and and the exciting thing that
[50:12.240 --> 50:17.520]  i'll tell people when people say to me why do i like to study this why do i like to look at it
[50:17.520 --> 50:24.480]  because these are things that very well can be real and when you read a writer like say tom
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.480]  clancy of vince flinn they're marvelous books but they're simply figments of their imagination
[50:31.280 --> 50:37.840]  they're carrying food carrying you through on their imaginary trip i would rather look into and
[50:37.840 --> 50:44.240]  read about real history and hopefully get educated on it so that we that we're not stupid enough
[50:44.240 --> 50:50.240]  to allow ourselves to repeat it which over and over i see it happening we were our stupidity
[50:50.240 --> 50:56.720]  is just unbelievable how we can be duped over and over again absolutely i mean really a conspiracy
[50:56.720 --> 51:02.800]  theorist is someone with an alternative history view we'll be right back so many people do not get

[52:16.400 --> 52:22.560]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of
[52:22.560 --> 52:29.120]  us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[52:29.120 --> 52:35.200]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.240]  government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[52:40.240 --> 52:44.880]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[55:07.520 --> 55:13.440]  and it's a one hour show we're doing seven conspiracies and naturally i'd like to say this
[55:13.440 --> 55:19.200]  can we get completely into the conspiracies and everything about them absolutely not you can never
[55:19.200 --> 55:26.720]  do that in an hour so we focus on just certain portions of the conspiracy which i think people
[55:26.720 --> 55:31.280]  will find it especially your your listening audience alex are going to find it very interesting
[55:31.920 --> 55:37.520]  and so it's going to be airing every every wednesday uh in december and january or are
[55:37.520 --> 55:43.280]  they going to skip one on christmas i have no idea i'll be gone surfing at that time and i'll
[55:43.280 --> 55:50.240]  leave all of you up here to take the repercussions from it what are you going to do if i come
[55:50.240 --> 55:55.200]  parachuting in when you're out there surfing well and i'll know everything hit the fan up here
[55:55.200 --> 56:00.480]  because i know that if you're not doing your daily radio show then the united states don't exist
[56:00.480 --> 56:10.320]  anymore now is my bunker ready next to your bungalow i don't know you know i'll tell you that
[56:10.320 --> 56:16.080]  baham my my neighbor fernando he had to take a 40 foot weld on there and it took him six months but
[56:16.080 --> 56:23.200]  it would have taken him a year had there been good waves absolutely absolutely okay we're
[56:23.200 --> 56:27.200]  going to come back and take phone calls but right now let's get into the global warming episode
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.320]  okay i mean just give us a little taste of that well the big thing on global warming to me is
[56:32.320 --> 56:39.440]  this cap and trade legislation uh it's nothing but bait and switch it it's a legislation that's
[56:39.440 --> 56:46.240]  designed to make money not solve the problem and if if global warming is indeed a problem
[56:46.240 --> 56:52.880]  then why is the solution simply money making that that does nothing to address the actual problem
[56:52.880 --> 56:58.480]  and that's the key of what we try to expose and this is the cap and trade legislation for what
[56:58.480 --> 57:05.360]  it is and the fact that there are 30 000 people with phd's and science degrees that simply are
[57:05.360 --> 57:11.920]  not buying into global warming and it doesn't seem to be that they get any type of uh their opinion
[57:11.920 --> 57:18.000]  is not being aired at all and that's right very one-sided opinion well yeah when al gore says
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.680]  all scientists agree it's man-made and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven
[57:23.680 --> 57:29.360]  by the sun and by nuclei from space causing cloud condensation i mean i'm not going to give away
[57:29.360 --> 57:35.760]  who you interview in the film but this is going to be a powerful death blow uh one more nail on
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.560]  the coffin against the uh greenies that want to taxes i mean it's come out that al gore is made over
[57:40.560 --> 57:46.720]  a billion bucks so far off this i mean he owns a cap and trade company that you've got to buy
[57:46.720 --> 57:52.560]  carbon credits from i mean how obvious is this well again it comes down to the legislate whether
[57:52.560 --> 57:57.520]  i'm not i'm not a scientist alex so i'm not going to beat my head against the wall on whether it's
[57:57.520 --> 58:04.560]  real or not but a good way to look at things is always view something not from what someone says
[58:04.560 --> 58:11.680]  but from what someone does and the cap and trade legislation is fraudulent because you can have a
[58:11.680 --> 58:17.520]  company that's that's supposedly polluting they don't have to change at all they can simply pay
[58:17.520 --> 58:25.120]  money and buy other people's and trade so that till they get under and they'll still pollute the same
[58:25.120 --> 58:30.480]  but then they'll be able to say that they're not well that right away is fraudulent and if that's
[58:30.480 --> 58:35.600]  fraudulent then what else is fraudulent i tell you that's a key point take the weakest part of
[58:35.600 --> 58:41.600]  their argument break their neck right there that's why we love you governor stay with us america's
[58:41.600 --> 58:49.680]  number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade we are the gcn radio network

[58:54.880 --> 58:59.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.200 --> 59:04.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.320 --> 59:09.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.960]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.960 --> 59:20.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[59:20.240 --> 59:24.880]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:24.880 --> 59:30.240]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[59:30.240 --> 59:34.160]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.160 --> 59:39.760]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup

[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:21.360]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:28.480]  all right in this five minutes we're going to get into secret societies manchurian candidate
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:34.480]  and big brother the three episodes we haven't given you a little
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:42.880]  little teaser on it premiers december second true tv tell everybody about it folks because i
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:47.280]  think this is going to be the not just ferris but leaning towards our view of any television
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:51.200]  show ever on mainstream tv i think this is a bellwether because the establishments beginning
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:57.920]  to realize that they become obsolete by never discussing this information so television's
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:04.320]  losing ratings and the internet's exploding governor jesse ventura uh getting into manchurian
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:08.560]  candidate secret societies big brother what do you want to talk about first well i guess
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:16.320]  let's go manchurian candidate uh that this one is going to be a very this one is a very terrifying
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:24.960]  show uh we all know that mk ultra was real the document states so so there's no gray area there
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:32.400]  that the government was in the business back in the 50s 60s and 70s of attempting to control people's
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:38.480]  minds and and attempting to manipulate them and to use them to their advantage both militarily
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:44.400]  and whatever well all indications are that those programs have been re-ramped up again and they're
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:51.600]  back on a high level again and uh that being said that's what the manchurian candidate deals with
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:57.040]  of course and that we've all heard the story uh one of the interesting things i'll say is the
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:05.760]  the guy who shot john lennon fits it perfectly art david chap because contrary to popular belief
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:11.840]  Chapman was no Beatles fanatic if you go back in his history in fact his favorite artist was
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:20.000]  Todd rungren who's hardly a beetle and uh when he shot lennon he he had three ways to escape
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:26.160]  immediately central park down into the subways and then just get lost with everybody instead
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:30.640]  he stepped back in the shadows and started reading the book to catch her in the ride
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:36.720]  which is a classic mind control when they torture them under the drugs and in one of the systems
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:41.200]  they then become obsessed with the trigger word when mcveigh got pulled over he said get the chip
[1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:45.760]  out of me and was foaming at the mouth and then the most famous mind control scientist ever jolly
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:52.560]  and west was his doctor with him every day until the day he was executed and i'll tell you this
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:58.800]  governor studying the fordhood shooting i can't say it was a mind control but it has every earmark
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:05.360]  he's a psychiatrist the fbi and cia were funny you should say that alex because amazingly when i
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:11.840]  when it first happened scarily that's the first thing that popped into my head unbelievable
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:17.440]  that you say that because that's the exact first thing that popped into my head when i when i first
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:23.600]  heard about the fordwood shootings and when i started then reading about the whole situation
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:30.160]  how the guy never had it in his background and then now the cia and fbi are watching him and he
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:34.880]  has this fake history that suddenly began and then commanders and people said bust him and
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:40.960]  they wouldn't do it same thing with 9 11 then he's a psychiatrist he has that whole history once
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:47.120]  you've studied mind control he just fits every piece fits and i wouldn't say this last week i
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:52.080]  mean i knew that was going on thursday but now more and more of the pieces are coming out and
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:57.920]  man the hair on the back of my neck just stands up anyway enough manchurian one of the last two
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:04.960]  shows okay we got to go to break we're going to come back and briefly get into uh into secret
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:11.200]  societies uh and big brother watching big brother so we'll talk about that but governor

[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:18.320]  it's alex jones and the gcm radio network
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:28.320]  governor jesse ventura he's worn a lot of hats but now he is fighting the new world order and i
[1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:31.760]  don't want to put words in his mouth but the governor i think it's safe to say i mean you now
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:37.760]  know there's a world government there is an elite the question is how evil are they are they monolithic
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:43.120]  what is their main goal i mean is it's fair to say that you're now officially uh not they're
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:48.800]  labeled a conspiracy theorist but i mean you question jfk you question 9 11 you question harp
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.720]  you're not buying the kool-aid they're selling is that fair to say well let me put it this way
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:02.800]  irregardless of anything it sure is interesting stuff and uh you know we we do we do a show on
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:08.400]  the bill de bergs and i i do understand that they're real i guess the thing that upsets me the most
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:16.560]  was i made it to governor and they never invited me and i would and i i guess maybe i got a run
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:21.520]  for office again then so i get invited to this thing to find out what the hell goes on inside
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.080]  there well they would have invited you if you would have gone along with the cia when they
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:31.680]  set you down at the governor's office two weeks into office but i mean you're not selling people out
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:37.920]  you're a swashbuckling you know loose cannon for freedom uh but uh well i mean what is your view on
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:42.160]  the new world order then because i know your anti-establishment and let me put it this way then
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:49.120]  i also look at it from a different perspective alex i believe in evolution the science of evolution
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:57.600]  and maybe this is evolution you know when you look at it that we will evolve and that maybe it
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:04.160]  won't fully be here in our lifetimes but a hundred years from now because of the fact with technology
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:11.920]  the way it is the world gets smaller and smaller and smaller and i guess let me just for the sake
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:17.520]  of argument state that there would be one good thing if there was a one world government you
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:24.640]  know what that would be there could be there couldn't be wars then could there but see governor
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:30.800]  that is i mean i mean literally if you wouldn't have one country fighting another country no
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:36.240]  but that's not their plan oh i understand that alex don't don't for a minute think i'm naive
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:41.760]  but i am saying that there is the chance that this could be almost an evolutionary thing
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:48.480]  that we will evolve to the point where there may well be a one world government and there may be
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:55.200]  no way around it well jesse then the important thing alex is what will that government be well
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:00.880]  that's the issue here is that they always pitch it that we were hunter-gatherers we were agrarian
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:06.560]  we formed villages and city states the nations that empires and the next phase is star trek
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:11.360]  that we've been implanted with psychologically the image of the global galactic empire and we're
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:17.120]  always fighting green aliens you know the cling on so we've got to do this the issue is they built
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:25.520]  this world government in stealth and denied that it existed until it was too late to really stop it
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.280]  and now they're coming out going yeah we're going to tax everything you do we're not going to let
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:34.080]  you have more than one kid and yeah we want to carry out eugenics on you and we're going to
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:39.520]  carbon tax you and ban chi moon writes editorials saying the carbon taxes for the new world order
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:45.760]  and it's for a bunch of corrupt ceo's and bankers to play emperor and so if the people of the world
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:50.720]  ever wanted to create a world government and it was democratic and under the republic system
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:56.960]  then that would be one thing but but this thing was created by a corrupt group of criminals
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:02.160]  and it's a world tyranny that's why every ounce of my body and being just like
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:09.840]  thomas jefferson said i i swear eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.400]  and and jesse i know you i mean don't you swear i alex i wholeheartedly agree with you i'm not
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:24.560]  going to dispute anything you've said i won't but the point is and you're correct if it was so good
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:31.200]  why would they do it in secret and that's a very very valid point to make uh the the point we have
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:36.640]  to make if it's inevitable that we're going to come under one world rule then we the people have to
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:41.360]  ensure that we're we have uh that we're players in the game that we have dogs in the fight
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:47.920]  and i don't want to be under the communist chinese alex is making sure we got a dog in the fight
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:53.360]  no no i hear you i but but instead so we never have a dog in the fight they just say there isn't
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:57.360]  a world government meet your world government i mean they're still saying world government
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.640]  doesn't exist so that we can never demand representation interesting was i was out at
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:10.000]  that new denver airport right the new one in denver yes and on and on the plaque that that
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:17.360]  they have out there on the bottom of it it says the new world airport commission and there isn't one
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:25.120]  nothing nothing of that name is in existence and there's murals of nazis put that on the
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:31.520]  dedication plaque at the dead that big denver airport the new world not the colorado airport
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:38.000]  commission not the denver airport commission but the new world airport commission and they
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:46.800]  have paintings of nazis killing children above it they're not nazis i disprove that well there's
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:52.640]  people in fascist style uniforms milling people are not nazis you know how i disprove that alex
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:59.120]  how the guy's carrying an ak-47 i saw it right away i said this can't be a nazi the nazis didn't
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:04.320]  have that weapon yeah but i don't think the artist knows that the collision cop is in is an eastern
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:10.720]  block weapon i noticed it hey hey jesse i want to take some calls in time it is let's take some
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.680]  calls but but a plug right here in the middle of this conversation i'm going to mail you i've
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:20.560]  forgotten to mail you fall of the republic because this details from the globalist own
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:25.280]  statements that they are setting up a tyrannical world government that they engineered the banking
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:31.520]  christ by the crisis by design and that they are setting up a citizen spy force police state system
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:36.400]  so i hope all the listeners will get a copy of fall the republic at info wars dot com the online
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:41.200]  video bookstore and support what we're doing here but also show it to everyone you know because
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:47.840]  this film exposes the wider agenda and alex let me shamelessly add in please watch my television
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:53.520]  show because if we get such an overwhelming audience response it'll force them to buy it up
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:15:00.400]  for another deal and we'll be able to get that much farther into it then and then like the x files
[1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:06.080]  i get the spin off like the lone gunman there you go okay now we're getting into real inside
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:11.120]  baseball look this show is important and i want everybody to tell their friends and family and

[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:46.800]  going to come from a place where the government is a i'll just put this the government is able to
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:54.400]  do it and work around the constitution we have found that out and we will air that on the show
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:16:00.880]  to where you will clearly see how the government has looped the constitution in which establishing
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.680]  big brother on you can we say the different federal groups you talked to or just leave
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:13.360]  that alone i don't think i talked to any federal groups again there was no cooperation from the
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:17.360]  government well you talked to their minions though you talked to their gestapo they're their
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:24.000]  their their ground pounders their citizen spies well yes we did do that we'll just leave it there

[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:30.400]  ventura giving you the inside scoop jesse why did you give this show first the inside scoop i was
[1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:33.760]  very honored when you called me and said you were going to give us the exclusive one well for a
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  number of reasons alex your participation in the show was exceptional and we appreciated it and uh
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:46.160]  you know you flew out to la a couple times and all that to participate and uh so why not i
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:52.800]  reward the people that reward me and uh and so that that's a reason for it plus you have the
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:59.280]  listening audience the base market that this show is designed for i would be crazy not to come on
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:04.960]  your show with my show because you know i'm not going to lie we're out for success on this show
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:10.000]  i hope this show is hugely successful yeah but but i know the tv shows you turned down i mean i
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.360]  don't i don't know if you want to say it but you're you're turning down something with 30 million
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.440]  viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the country i i'm just really honored
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:21.920]  you can because i know you're turning down a bunch of really huge media interviews but but doing
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:28.080]  our shows we appreciate it well no problem and like i said that uh you know uh uh you're you're
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:34.080]  a wealth of information alex that we can always rely upon and uh you know so doing your show is
[1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:39.200]  just simply the left hand wash in the right hand well folks we're going to post this interview up
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:44.000]  at info wars dot com over 200 000 people a day get the free podcast get it share it with everybody
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.160]  we're going to post a youtube video of it share it with everyone because if this show can be a big
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:53.920]  success the system may start letting more of this on the air as the internet culture takes over the
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:00.160]  mainstream media we can beat the globalist if they can't beat us they're going to try to join us
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:04.400]  and we can slow down this whole system that's what tweedie bird always said if you can't beat
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:09.840]  them join them well well well if we can beat them they're gonna have to back off and believing we
[1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:14.960]  can expose these people is half the battle believing you can win or as gi joe says knowing
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:19.360]  it's half the battle i believe taking action is half the battle resistance is victory matt in
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:25.360]  illinois you're on the air with jesse ventura go ahead matt well mr vinter um how you're doing
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:32.960]  oh pretty good um i wanted to know i don't have a tv i i gave up watching tv a long long time ago
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.760]  because i didn't like being treated like i was stupid and it sounds like you've got a really
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:44.000]  good show and i'd like to know if there's any plans to put it on the web or or somehow that i'll be
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.640]  able to watch it i don't know at this time but then again i'm not a good web person to talk to
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:55.840]  but i certainly will inquire to find out what the options are about doing it over the web or
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:00.720]  whatever i don't know but at this time i have the only thing i know is he's starting december
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:06.480]  second yeah matt thanks for the call i'll tell you this time warner is putting a lot of their stuff
[1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:12.320]  on youtube now most tv shows are there after the series runs then it's up there with commercials
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:17.040]  on youtube uh i would imagine this is made for the internet i would imagine you're going to be able
[1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:22.080]  to see it officially on the internet after at arizona tv go to a neighbor's house and watch it uh let's
[1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:26.880]  you know the mind control box but we're going to use the mind control box to deprogram people
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:32.720]  marianne in iowa you're on the air with governor jesse ventura go ahead hi it's a pleasure um i i
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:38.320]  just want to say i hope this wakes up the american people and uh i praise you for doing that um i
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:43.600]  wanted to make a answer quick question going to make a quick comment uh representative mike pens
[1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:51.200]  from uh uh indiana republican the other day i was watching the health voting on cstan and he said
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.640]  and i wrote it down because i was freaked out by it he said it seems a few elite in a far
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:02.960]  distant country can run our lives for us and i know immediately i thought of bill the burger
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:07.440]  not that and i was going to ask you which i think you've already answered were you going to do a show
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:12.160]  on the bill the burgers and the secret societies you didn't answer that hold on you mean senator
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:18.400]  de ment admitted that that foreign bankers run our country i mean that's amazing quote and i wrote
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:24.480]  it down it seems a few elite in a far distance country can run our lives for us okay let's get
[1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:30.560]  jesse's take on that well it there's certainly that possibility and yes we definitely do a show
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:36.320]  on the bill the burgers which i was happily kind of i knew of them but i didn't know as much about
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:45.600]  them and here's the interesting little sidebar for it we had a governor are you still there
[1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:55.360]  see that i know that sound that's us that wasn't ron paul the other day okay that's our phone system
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:00.640]  i want that on record tell you it's looks like living in a clown house or something um
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:05.360]  um just calling back and letting him finish his point
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.440]  it's it's always when i got huge guest on to ron paul jesse ventura and and
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:18.960]  the standard operating procedure hell i can call him on my cell phone get him on that way
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:29.600]  um we've got general stubble bind coming up with dr rima labo part two of the interview we started
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:33.280]  last week
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:41.760]  and i do have a lot of other news that we're going to be covering as well
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:45.280]  but hey it's the miracle of technology ladies and gentlemen we're
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:51.200]  we're 50 years ago 60 70 80 years ago you couldn't even do stuff like this
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:03.520]  and um it's kind of the hallmark of this show now that that's what we do it's how we do it
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:08.320]  okay governor got you cut off there when you were going to add a point about bill derberg
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:12.720]  go ahead it was it was either that alex or they're cutting us off now they're on to us
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:19.840]  you know no what i what i was going to add was that just a simple side light to the show and then
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:28.400]  i got to run is that uh we were interviewing a gentleman on the bill derberg episode and and uh
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:34.400]  he had to travel from europe to do the interview with me in new york and we had to delay it a day
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:41.520]  because when he went to the airport he was on the no fly list now he this this person is not a
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:45.520]  terrorist why would he be on the no fly list and who has the power to do that
[1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:52.240]  well that happens to even congressmen now if they get crosswise and and you're not
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:58.160]  you're not charged there's no judge there's no jury and now they're saying if you have bad credit
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:06.720]  you'll be on the no fly list or a ticket of a felony or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:12.240]  governor but then you lose your rights isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:17.680]  form of government i would like to think so and and you know and as i said earlier alex it's
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:22.560]  it's just the case of uh you know the big brother and in this case it was dealing with the bill
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:27.440]  derbergs that we have this particular guy we were going to interview and he was coming from a foreign
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:34.960]  country to here and he was on the no fly list over there and to my knowledge he's not a terrorist so
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:40.400]  you know it's interesting that how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting them on this no fly
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:47.200]  list if you simply out of say a different political persuasion or whatever it might be well governor
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:51.520]  you've got to get to a meeting in downtown minneapolis so we've only got four more minutes left
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:57.040]  with you let's take two final calls quickly gary in washington than mark in minnesota gary are on
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:02.720]  the air with jessie ventura where to be here with you i have a very important piece of information
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:08.960]  for the governor and i have a big question for both of you first piece of information shake maps
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:15.440]  shake maps is a product of us geological survey earthquake hazards program if you look at the
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:22.160]  shape shake map in seishwan when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over china on may 20th
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:30.640]  2008 the shake map is the exact same shape as the harp weapon that's point number one and
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:35.200]  then i will get the point number two okay what's your final point is we got to go here in a minute
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:41.600]  okay so check out the shake maps final point there's too much fragmentation on the info war
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:47.040]  prison plan at birth there's oath keepers 911 truth odd at the fed lp gun owners skywatch
[1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:54.560]  i would recommend both of you join and help create a constitutional defense fund alex and
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:59.920]  sir we can't do it all hold on a minute and people act like jessie ventura alex jones or ron paul
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:06.880]  have magical powers we put our let our pants on one leg at a time to freedom is fractured it's good
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.680]  that we're not all unified because that makes us hard to stop uh governor you're comment on that
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:16.720]  well and the other thing is too is that how do you do it it's like when i was the third party
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:22.480]  candidate in minnesota i tried to bring all the third parties together so we could consolidate
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:27.120]  and become a force against the other two parties i got news for you it's like hurting cats
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:33.040]  in fighting and i couldn't even bring them together on an issue that we all agreed upon
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:39.440]  and that was campaign finance none of us none of us took dirty money and it just fractured
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:44.400]  like nothing and so i just threw my hands up in the air and i said it may be impossible to
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.280]  make alex makes a great point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at him from
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:54.720]  different directions yeah it's a spirit of liberty shrink government bring accountability
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:00.480]  final call for governor jesse ventura from his home state minnesota mark you're on the air go ahead
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:06.800]  hi you can hear me yes i can go ahead hi mark hi hi i bought it for you jesse i appreciate both
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:11.360]  you guys as a work and uh quickly uh a couple questions about i can't wait for your show to
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:15.440]  come out i'll i'll look forward to watching that and i'll tell people about it my friends and
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:21.440]  why not a couple ideas for the show maybe you could look into uh the uh patent issue where people
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:28.240]  uh individuals developing free energy and anti anti gravity technology that the government then
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:33.600]  beams it a national security risk you know jesse that's a great idea if it gets picked up for another
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:38.800]  season is look at cold fusions and we will take that under consideration but we got to get picked
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:43.360]  up first we only did seven for right now yeah we got across that bridge before we we have to come
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:48.880]  to that bridge before we cross it uh anything else mark yeah one last thing i just saw an article
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:55.440]  on uh world met daily about the data centers being set up by data saying homeland security department
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:59.680]  and i'm very concerned about that they collect all our information all communications and store
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:06.880]  and uh this is another instrumental loss of liberty watch my show on his big brother watching
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:12.240]  and all that and uh you'll learn how they get away with it and how they loop the constitution

[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.400]  bye to you when we go to break so just hold one moment but i wanted to say in closing it's been
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:25.360]  great working with you i hope the show airs looks like it is they've started promoting it they're
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:29.760]  unleashing you to promote it so i think that's the green light but as you said we won't believe it
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:36.000]  airs until we see it go on december 2nd on true tv so spread the word but did you ever think because
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.760]  i know all about this stuff and i still can't believe it i'm still flabbergasted i am psychologically
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:46.960]  speechless a lot of times i can still babble some words out but it's hard to articulate
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:52.000]  the nsa says they're taking over the whole internet they may shut it down during crises like bird flu
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.080]  or swine flu the nsa is going to intercept all internet traffic they're building nsa centers
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:04.000]  in san antonio in new york and florida and minnesota and california and just admitting
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  they're reading everything we're doing so they go from we're not spying on al-qaeda
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.960]  to we are spying on al-qaeda to we're spying on you and we don't need no stinking warrants did you
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:19.440]  ever think that would happen well it will happen because yeah i i can believe it happening alex

[1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:21.760]  today and i'm very very excited to have him on this is an abbreviated visit but we're going to
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:27.520]  get him back on for a full 30 minutes or maybe even an hour and he's of course from newark new
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:33.280]  jersey he's a tenured superior court judge in new jersey and now an analyst on fox news channel
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:39.680]  he has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has freedom watch from fox news studios
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:45.040]  which is an internet television show and he also is the guest host for glenn beck i wish he was
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:51.520]  uh the the the person doing that show because he is the real bona fide he wrote an editorial
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:56.880]  last week pointing out that the republican health care plan was almost as bad as the
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:04.320]  democrats and he is a constitutionalist right up there with ron paul and so he's somebody i
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:11.840]  actually agree with on like 98% of stuff instead of glenn beck 90% because that 10% is a big area
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:17.200]  and so here for about 15 minutes to talk about health care uh the big government takeover of
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:23.120]  health care extra judicial these boards decide what to do and to talk about the cap and trade
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:28.880]  which i believe has a good chance of passing the senate both of these are now in orbit like icbm
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:35.760]  space stations about to drop nukes on our republic and judge andrian napolitano is
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:40.640]  there fighting it valiantly judge it's great to have you with us well thank you alex it's good
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:47.440]  to be home with you there's so much happening uh what's more important cap and trade and the total
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.240]  micromanagement of our life by special interest with al gore set to make the money or the government
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:57.200]  takeover of health care oh boy that's that's really a particular poison alex it's all it's
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:03.200]  all part of the same big government mentality uh your kind comments about the piece i wrote was
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:08.880]  really uh from a monologue that i gave while filling in for glenn beck which i'm also doing
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.800]  later today at five o'clock eastern by the way on fox news channel in which i argued that we don't
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:19.600]  have a two-party system in this country we have a one party one political party called the big
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:27.440]  government party the republican branch likes war and deficits and assaulting our civil liberties
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:34.240]  and the democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes and assaulting our commercial liberties
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:40.000]  but the mindset is the same the heck with the constitution the heck with the bill of rights
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:45.120]  the heck with inalienable rights the heck with even the laws that we write we know what's better
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:52.080]  for you than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you how to obey or else cap and
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:36:00.880]  trade is one manifestation of that obama care is another manifestation of it i was furious last week
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:09.040]  when i saw that even the republicans even so-called conservative republicans not ron paul but many
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:14.720]  in the republican leadership in the house introduced obama care life which basically
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:22.320]  presumes a federal role in health care of which there is none under the constitution tells insurance
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:28.080]  carriers you can't refuse to cover people because of pre-existing injuries that's a very nice thing
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:33.360]  but there's no power for the congress to mandate it that's got to come about by the uh by the free
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:38.240]  market bribes the states to change their court system so they would basically go to the state of
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:44.640]  new jersey and say we'll repave the garden state parkway and the new jersey turnpike if you put
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:51.120]  taps on the limits that juries can award uh injuries against doctors and medical malpractice
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:55.680]  lawsuits if you and i went to a state and said i'll give you money if you change our laws we'd
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:04.400]  be arrested for bribery so this was all the same mindset of we in washington can micromanage the
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:12.240]  private free choices of individuals back home and i condemned it and i do so again today judge
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:18.880]  andrew napolitano is our guest uh today judge what you're talking about and reading over the
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:25.520]  legislation it's like groundhog day but on a bigger scale it's chicago or new york big city
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:33.280]  crime boss a machine doling everything out it's like with the takeover of general motors it even
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:38.400]  came out in congressional investigations as you know because you covered it that people that gave
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:44.880]  money to obama cronies or to the democratic party they got to keep their dealership and got to keep
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:50.480]  their client list but if you didn't if you'd ever gone against them or hadn't paid the protection
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:56.320]  money you lost your dealership even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and made
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:02.320]  millions of dollars a year and so now you have this tenth amendment destroying federal power
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:11.040]  coming in uh with these unelected panels and it just goes on and on and on and on and i fear it
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.280]  can pass the senate i'm hearing some of the republican leadership saying oh no it won't
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:19.680]  they said it wouldn't pass the house in the last two weeks well they did say it wouldn't pass the
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:26.160]  house and it did pass by by a two vote margin and and you know you really can't tell what politicians
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:32.400]  because they'll they'll the leadership will bribe them remember the first time tarp the so-called
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.640]  troubled asset relief program went through the house it was defeated i remember i was on the
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:47.600]  fox business network at the moment to fist in air just emoting joy shouting the beast is dead
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:53.840]  but i was naive because the leadership came back and bribed by you know we'll build a courthouse in
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.000]  your district your friend wants to become a federal judge he's got it just vote for us on tarp
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:03.040]  eventually people uh changed their vote i fear that the same thing will happen with respect to
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:09.440]  obama care the government the executive branch the leadership in both parties in both houses
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:16.000]  will bribe those who are wavering and give them something else that they want in order
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:21.360]  to secure their vote but you also raise a very important issue about the delegation
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:30.640]  of federal power to non-elected groups this is what fdr did and fdr is the model for president
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:39.840]  barack obama fdr had over 500 groups throughout the country appointed by local politicians
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:46.400]  who decided what prices and wages were there's a famous case in my home state of new jersey where
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:53.520]  an eastern european immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and price group
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:40:03.360]  declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a man's suit this guy charged 35 cents
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:10.080]  literally a nickel cheaper than what the unelected local board said he could charge he was arrested
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:16.400]  by the fbi he was indicted by a grand jury he was put on trial in federal court in newark
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:22.400]  and he served a three month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents less
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:29.680]  than what the local board allowed him to now transform that into modern day practice of medicine
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:36.400]  you will have a board of bureaucrats not even physicians bureaucrats that will be between you
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.320]  and your physician you will lose your privacy you will lose the freedom of choice because the
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:49.520]  bureaucratic board will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:54.960]  to address your ailment and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or he can
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.360]  prescribe and that's all in there and that's why they're saying they're going to get all these
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:04.560]  hundreds of billions out of medicare and medicaid by reducing the care tom dashill wrote a book
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:10.080]  admitting if you're old you don't deserve it you don't need it people are really about to find out
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:15.840]  who these eugenicists are who these control freaks are that inhabit the democratic party
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:21.280]  in some extent the republican party in the five minutes we've got left with judge andrew napolitano
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:28.880]  joining us today in a very busy schedule i want to shift gears now to war you talk about the
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:35.200]  republicans won endless war and the democrats won a nanny state you together uh to death but look at
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:41.440]  obama he's increased troops before in afghanistan he's now saying he's going to send 40 000 more in
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:46.960]  that we're never going to leave there's over 300 000 international and afghan troops there now
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:54.160]  i see absolutely no difference between the parties just different rhetoric i i must reluctantly
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:42:00.000]  agree with you i say reluctantly not because i don't like to agree with you i i i do but because
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.600]  i i was naively expecting that we would not see this kind of build up under him that we saw under
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:11.440]  george w bush but think about it war is the health of the state when when we fight a war people will
[1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:15.760]  look the other way when our taxes are raised and when the government takes away their freedom
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:20.800]  because they accept the illusion that by fighting the war the government is somehow keeping them
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:28.000]  safe presidents love war because it lets them escape the confines of the constitution it lets
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:33.040]  them become a little bit of a prince it even causes judges sometimes if the president does
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:39.280]  something under the guise of war making to look the other way and defer to the executive branch
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:44.320]  fortunately the supreme court did not do that under bush years under the bush years that every
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:50.640]  single time his war making powers were challenged in the courts and made its way to the supreme
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:57.600]  court of the united states he was zero and six before a supreme court that was appointed largely
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:03.200]  by republicans judge were you surprised to rely on the supreme court to save us because their
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:07.520]  life is injured and you don't know which way they're going to go and because it takes too long
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:13.520]  for the issue to get to them and too much harm can happen between time of the time presidents wage war
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:18.240]  and the time their war powers are challenged in the courts were you surprised that obama flip
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:23.760]  flopped so strongly and went from being anti-patriot act to zealously defending it wanting to
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:29.520]  expand it and complete warrantless wiretapping complete secret arrest complete i mean i mean
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:34.160]  he's he's going further than bush on the police state i didn't think that was possible i didn't
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:39.760]  think it was possible either and i was absolutely crushed when i heard it he obviously was not my
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:46.160]  candidate of choice but i took a little bit of internal uh intellectual solace in the fact
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:52.400]  that at least we were getting a president who would respect the constitution how wrong i was
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:59.200]  his disrespect for the constitution may not be couched in as harsh and obvious and over
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:06.880]  terms as in the bush years but it's just as bad just as destructive and just as willing to overlook
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:12.960]  specific restraints written in the constitution to restrain the president as were many of his
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:18.240]  predecessors well i've talked to a lot of what will accept it exactly i've talked to a lot of
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:23.280]  lawyers and judges and i wanted to briefly see if you agree even though a lot of conservatives
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:27.600]  didn't like obama true paleo conservatives libertarian types like ron paul and yourself
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.720]  because he is a constitutional lawyer and practice it for ten years as a professor
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:39.120]  people expected that obama would try to at least on the surface restore some of the bill of rights
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:47.280]  but instead you know he's saying constitution it's just a gd piece of paper i i too expected that he
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:52.000]  would show more respect for the constitution i read some of the lectures he gave at the university
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:57.440]  of chicago law school i could have given some of those lectures myself when i taught constitutional
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:02.880]  law seat and hall law school in newark and a tellerware law school in wellington delaware uh but
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:08.320]  you know something happens when you don the mantle of power and that's something is a
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:13.840]  disdain for the restraint on your power a disdain for the natural law our respect that we have
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:19.280]  natural rights beyond which no government can go a disdain for the constitution itself a disdain
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:24.480]  for our inalienable rights same as natural rights and a disdain for the bill of rights they just
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:32.560]  just simply don't care they will steal from the rich to give to the poor to create a class of people
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:38.160]  dependent upon them who will continue to vote them in office so they can continue to be taking
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:43.440]  care of cradle to grave by a federal government that doesn't have one iota of constitutional
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:47.600]  authority to do all of this well said final question i'm going to let you go because i know
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:51.920]  you've got to fill in guest hose for glenbeck tonight congratulations on your huge success
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:56.720]  as your star rises because you're the bonafide constitutionalist we really really appreciate
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:05.360]  you judge andrew napolitano but in closing i would like to get you to comment a on just
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:10.800]  how special george washington and andrew jackson were they got all this power and then did give
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:16.000]  it up they wanted george washington to be a king you know these were amazing founding fathers we
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:22.320]  had and what would they think of what's happening today where noah satellite information service
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:31.600]  the federal government admits the coldest winner so far in the last 50 years the the the the third
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:36.000]  coldest in the last hundred meanwhile they're openly announcing that they're that they're
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.600]  going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste and tax it when humans exhale it can you can you end
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:46.480]  with speaking about our founders compared to the material we've gotten washington today
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:54.000]  and what they would think of taxing what plants breathe the the founders tried to do two things
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:59.680]  with the constitution one was to create a federal government strong enough to protect us from
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:04.240]  invasion and to do national type things like run a post office and make sure that there's
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:08.720]  trade between the states the other was to restrain the federal government so that it wouldn't
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:14.560]  interfere with our personal liberties they specifically gave us a constitution that kept the
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:20.320]  federal government away from any type of relationship with individuals because they knew that the
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:27.280]  greatest threat to freedom comes not from your enemy on the outside who you can see and look at
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:33.280]  but from the smiling face of the government on the inside who are queens but it's going to take
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:39.280]  care of you and presidents like george washington whose closest advisor alexander hamilton wanted
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:45.040]  him to be king and andrew jackson who basically said to the supreme court you know they've gone
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:50.480]  ahead and made their their federal bank let them find the money and put them on the deposits in
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:56.480]  the federal bank these were people who understood that there were natural limits on what government
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:03.040]  can do and written limits on what the federal government can do and they stuck to those limits
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:08.800]  the present government and its predecessors you know from lincoln to wilson to f dr to
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:14.880]  george w bush to barack obama has so distorted out of proportion what the federal government is to
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:20.400]  do that the founders would would not recognize it at all and would probably want to take up arms
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:24.480]  against it what are you covering tonight and then we'll let you go i hope you're going to be covering
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:28.240]  the health care and cap and trade because it's exactly what we're talking about we're talking
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:33.760]  about health care we're talking about the the state of the economy we're talking about the
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:42.240]  government subpoenaing media entities wanting to know who earns how much money because they have
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:48.800]  to decide whose income taxes to audit next you're kidding wait a minute they're not just
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:55.040]  the federal government is subpoenaing media people to their subpoenaing media companies
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:49:01.600]  to find out who earns what and what their social security numbers are this is getting so bad so
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:08.560]  quickly far worse than any of us imagined and the present president hasn't even celebrated his first
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:12.800]  year in office yet well since you brought that up about tonight since you brought that up let me
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:17.760]  just ask you now uh senator lamar alexander's gone to the floor and talked about he's confirmed
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:24.800]  there's an enemy's list he warned him and said look i worked for nixon don't do this uh it's
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:30.640]  been reported i am on the enemy's list i'm going from memory i think you are too but what is it
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:38.160]  i mean this is crazy it is scary to to know that there's a real enemy's list and uh this is i mean
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:44.880]  is this not illegal judge well it's illegal for the president to to compile a list of people who
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:49.760]  disagree with them on the basis of their political opinions and their outspoken words that was
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:57.200]  specifically written into the privacy law in 1974 enacted and signed into law by president ford shortly
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:04.480]  after uh president nixon resigned these are restraints expressly enacted to restrain the president
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:09.280]  but this white house just like it doesn't respect freedom of contract just like it doesn't respect
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:15.920]  freedom of speech just like it doesn't respect privacy doesn't respect this either well i tell
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:20.720]  you it's scary and everybody should pray for the people that are on that list myself included uh
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:25.840]  judge what's the best website for people to visit to find out about all things judge napolitano

[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.040]  for the people but anyways well let's get let's get back to gold here um you know I was just
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:33.200]  reading today gold holds firmly above $1100 an ounce of cnn money and it's just been just a hot
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:38.720]  market I I need to tell you gold is falling today because the dollar is I'm sorry gold is rising
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:43.440]  today because the dollar is falling and we have another another drop in the dollar right now the
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:52.320]  dollar index is at 75 19 and gold has reached a high today of 1118 dollars and 50 cents so far
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:56:00.320]  I need to say that it would have been something if we had 1120 dollars an ounce or 1110 and we
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:07.280]  backed off down into the 1050 1060 range again I could say maybe we're we're at the end of this run
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:14.640]  but we're not gold has been holding real strong holding firmly American barrack I say American
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:19.040]  barrack because when I was a stockbroker I was selling it as American barrack now it's called
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:26.240]  barrack now has to shut off shut down any of its hedging and for those of you who don't understand
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:30.400]  what hedging means in the gold industry when you're in the mining business it means that you're
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:35.680]  selling short your reserves that are sitting in the ground you're looking at today's prices you
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.800]  think that this is a good time to do it you sell your gold that you haven't even mined yet knowing
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:45.440]  what your production is going to be because you've done core samples and you deliver later when the
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:51.760]  contracts come due barrack was one of the largest sellers of gold all the way through the 1980s going
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:58.000]  into the 1990s in the 2000 it was one of the central banks tools in order to keep the gold
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:04.720]  prices down you can go to gata.org and find that out right now I need to tell you that the market
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:10.480]  is hot it is hot hot hot in gold and I don't expect it to change the dollar is going to be
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:15.760]  falling as these central banks of the world decide to get into gold and get away from paper currency
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:21.440]  and if the manufacturers of the money in these countries aren't telling you enough to get into
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:27.600]  gold I don't know what you need right now we're sitting on a US paper currency fiat system that
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.360]  seems to be eroding away while foreigners are sitting on reserves that are just surmounting it
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:37.920]  in the trillions of dollars and they want out they want to get away from the united states
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:44.240]  government and it's and it's a printing press that seems to be going full speed ahead we do have

[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:06.160]  wait like they did at blacksburg and other places she charged in and took this guy out so she certainly
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:12.800]  deserves a lot of praise for that but they've changed the story too many so many times who
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:17.120]  knows what's going on for six hours they said this guy was dead then they said he was alive
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:24.320]  so our hearts and prayers go out to all of those at ford hood and not just in texas but in orlando
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:28.480]  florida just terrible okay we're going to break here in a few minutes but he'll be with us for
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:36.320]  several segments and i'm really excited about this interview because i uh saw the article in
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:42.960]  mclatchy newspapers uh not this sunday but last sunday and it dovetailed with professor black we've
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.000]  had on the federal regulator former federal regulator and so many of john perkins that we've
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:54.320]  had on confessions of an economic hitman all these other insiders talking about golden sacks
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:59.200]  just just really involved in a lot of amazing behavior but the headline is how golden sacks
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:05.200]  secretly bet on the u.s housing crash and to go over that is the author the investigative
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:09.600]  reporter award-winning investigative reporter greg gordon and he's written for some of the

[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.240]  maybe later we could talk about a few of those but to talk about golden sacks secretly bet on
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:34.720]  us housing crash is greg gordon greg thanks for coming on with us my great pleasure we're about
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:40.720]  to go to break but just in a nutshell uh this is one of the most in-depth detailed investigative
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:46.640]  reports i've seen on the banking industry and goldman sacks this is just amazing job thank you so
[2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:55.760]  much uh in a nutshell what did you discover well we wanted to find out uh how golden sacks
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:03:02.240]  got out when nobody else did and and so the first story of the series is really about how
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:09.840]  goldman was was i'm selling off uh at some stage it became a sell-off we don't know exactly what
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:18.000]  that date is but in 2006 and 2007 goldman sold 39 billion dollars of of bonds essentially bonds
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:26.240]  backed by risky mortgages in the united registered in the united states um and uh these uh uh securities
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:32.800]  many of them have gone south and and then in addition goldman was peddling uh more exotic
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:40.240]  securities uh many of which were tied again to risky mortgages in the united states offshore
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:47.520]  and at the same time goldman was betting in these dark markets uh through uh uh devices that are
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:52.800]  known as credit default swaps but they're basically insurance like bets uh you're buying a little
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:58.240]  insurance policy on on some specific thing and they were they were betting that the housing
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:06.560]  market would go south and these bonds would all lose value so they start quietly dumping on the
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  market uh triple a rated paper that was tied to derivatives or exotic instruments as they're
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:20.000]  called and at the same time betting against it after they dumped it man that is uh that is amazing
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:30.160]  well i want to be clear they were making bets that on on similar uh uh but not exactly the same
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:34.560]  security but on similar issues so in other words they were betting that the housing market's going
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:39.600]  to go bad and if the housing market goes bad all these all these mortgages are going to go south
[2:04:39.600 --> 2:04:44.640]  that because or many of the mortgages because uh people were going to find themselves underwater
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:49.360]  in their houses we know people people across the country have homes that are that are worth less
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:53.120]  than their mortgages sure sure that's been well documented we're going to break come back in a

[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:13.040]  he's written multiple parts in a detailed series the first of which we've been covering off and
[2:08:13.040 --> 2:08:18.480]  off the last week and a half Hal Goldman secretly bet on the us housing crash let me just read you
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:25.440]  a couple lines from Greg Gordon's syndicated article it says uh the piece together to piece
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:30.720]  together Goldman's role in subprime meltdown McClatchy reviewed hundreds of documents sec
[2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:35.920]  filings copies of secret investment circulars lawsuits and interviewed numerous people familiar
[2:08:35.920 --> 2:08:43.600]  with the firm's activities and then they go through in this article piece by piece uh
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:53.280]  uh Mr. Gordon did exactly how this was done and so just stating in layman terms what do we know
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:59.920]  Goldman Sachs did they are the only big group to get out of this you talk about how this was used
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:06.320]  against their competition like Bear Stearns and others all these other groups went belly up but
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:14.240]  Goldman Sachs came out smelling like a rose record profits record bonuses at the same time we see an
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:20.720]  over representation of Goldman Sachs alumni in regulatory and government positions and I want
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:25.280]  to get into that with you as well but I know as a journalist you just want to stay to the facts
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:30.080]  but I also want to talk about these documents that you got a hold of but I mean let's go through
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:36.800]  uh exactly what's happening here and and and where this is going and let me say that it's not an
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:44.000]  accident that so many Goldman executives go on to senior jobs and in the in the government
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:53.200]  because Goldman for for decades has encouraged its its members once they you know have attained
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:10:00.400]  uh their wealth uh to to go and do spend some time doing some public service go and work for
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:05.440]  the government so you know it sounds noble but the problem is that when the guys get into the
[2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:10.400]  government they end up being treasury secretary uh or head of the commodities futures trading
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:16.640]  commission which uh regulate some of these uh derivatives as you call them that are that are
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:25.680]  traded uh you know outside the normal markets um you you create appearances at the minimum
[2:10:25.680 --> 2:10:32.240]  they're they're very awkward and and and in some cases disturbing now here you had Hank Paulson
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:39.200]  being serving as a treasury secretary at the end of the bush administration last fall in September
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:46.480]  when when everything blew up and it seemed as if every decision every key decision that was
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:54.080]  made maybe it's just a coincidence but it seems as if every key decision uh where Goldman Sachs
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:11:01.360]  was a stakeholder the decision benefited Goldman Sachs they took over Bear Stearns when Bear Stearns
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:08.000]  collapsed and Goldman uh had uh had contracts with Bear we don't talk about this in the series but
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:15.040]  it's true and and Goldman was able to you know settle out when when JP Morgan took over Bear Stearns
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:21.600]  and that was a deal arranged by by uh uh Paulson and then and then uh Lehman Brothers which was a
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:27.280]  big Goldman rival was allowed to go under and that is going to be a decision that will be debated
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:35.760]  for a very long time but when Lehman's collapse caused a lot of uh uh disturbance in the in the
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:41.040]  markets and and there've been uh there's been a running debate about whether Lehman should have
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:48.160]  been rescued with the rest of them uh Lehman had had really had heavily in subprime and lost heavily
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:55.840]  and then uh the decision was made to bail out AIG the American International Group and Goldman had
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:03.760]  placed 20 billion dollars of these insurance like bets with with the AIG you know American
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:11.440]  Insurance or International Group the American International Group and so uh Goldman got paid
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:17.920]  off out of this money uh others rescue money from the government Goldman was paid 12.9 billion
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:27.280]  dollars and over eight billion dollars of that related to its its secret bets uh hedging its uh
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:35.200]  subprime and other you know related risking mortgage backed securities and and and it's also
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:43.040]  noteworthy noteworthy that when these uh the this 12.9 billion dollars was paid off it was a
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:50.960]  hundred cents on the dollar so it was decided that even the officials at AIG wanted to offer
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:56.400]  considerably less money to the various uh counter parties on all these bets it was holding and by
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:02.800]  the way AIG made a dreadful mistake because AIG did not reinsure all these bets it just assumed
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:07.520]  that the housing market was going to go up forever and when it turned south all of a sudden instead
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:13.760]  of just getting these nice premiums from Goldman and I presume Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers every
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:19.520]  year you know paying paying uh maybe a hundred million dollars a year in premium so that they
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:26.560]  could have this insurance all of a sudden AIG had this they had this you know it's reimbursed them
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:33.680]  off and and pay off maybe uh 50 60 billion dollars and it it didn't have the money and that's when
[2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:42.080]  everything melted down well so Goldman Sachs really uh always benefited uh from the decisions
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:46.240]  that were made by its by the government officials including its alumni
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:51.920]  Greg Gordon's our guest he's an investigative journalist with McClatchy Washington
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:57.600]  Bureau and there's several parts in the series one is how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:03.360]  housing crash another Goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes another one mystery
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:08.240]  why did Goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought now now let me just be clear on this
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:16.880]  reading over these pieces you have Goldman Sachs 2006 2007 everything supposedly wonderful the
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:21.840]  housing market's going to keep going up forever anyone who says that's not the case is a conspiracy
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:27.120]  theorist we must give everyone a loan even if they don't even have a job or lie on their application
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:34.560]  it's the american way meanwhile they're putting out promotions saying housing's great these
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:43.280]  these instruments were selling are wonderful while betting against similar instruments
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:53.920]  did the Goldman Sachs massive shorting did that contribute to the overall bubble beginning to
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:15:00.560]  burst because because that gets into a whole another area not only are you know are they
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:05.520]  telling people these these derivatives are great while they're separately betting against them
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:13.200]  secretly but did their shorting contribute to the bubble beginning to deflate well a couple
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:18.720]  things alex one the word derivatives they were sold generally offshore but the stuff they were
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:26.240]  selling here and and even to offer to foreign customers but they were they were registering
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:31.600]  and selling them here were bonds they were good old high yield bonds rated triple a
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:39.680]  rated triple a but yet goldman was hedging them secretly hedging them and when you when you
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:43.360]  the second thing is i just want to mention when you talked about goldman promoting the fact that
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:49.040]  the housing market was doing so well i've seen reports that goldman's chief economist was warning
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:56.640]  that that the that a bubble was approaching but that strikes me as is also very inconsistent or
[2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:02.240]  odd in that goldman had these triple a ratings on these securities of course they got him from
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:07.360]  ratings agencies but they always hedge their bet i mean i mean i mean sure they're out here selling
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:12.640]  him but didn't they also mention ooh there might be a problem you know irrational exuberance down
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:19.680]  the road so oops see i told you so oh look all my competitions destroyed now oh look i'm making
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:25.920]  record profits oh look we're so noble we happen to have our people all over federal regulation
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:33.200]  systems ooh man we're becoming the you know the only player now gee we sure screwed up we sure
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:40.960]  screwed up into all this money and power and you know the thing about they they always hedge their
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:48.640]  bets these were triple a and i asked golden sacks can you give me another example of triple a
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:54.320]  securities that you hedged like this and they did not provide such an example they said we
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:59.200]  hedge in a lot of our markets etc but to be betting the other way at the same time you're
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:05.600]  selling something is triple a the question is should they have told the investors we also are
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:11.200]  betting that the housing market's going to turn south because it was a risk factor right in they
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:16.400]  list the risk factors in all the perspectives which go to investors before the and he were talking
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:24.560]  about by the way pension funds insurance companies foreign banks union health and welfare funds
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:30.240]  institutional investors goldman says it only sold these securities to institutional investors
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:38.560]  so so the question is that when when they were peddling these things why didn't they disclose
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.040]  that they were also betting the other way and would the investors then still have purchased
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:47.360]  these securities if they knew that goldman was betting that the housing market was going to
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:53.120]  turn south because one of the risk factors said you know it could really impact these securities
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:58.400]  if the housing market especially in california and florida where things were red hot and we're
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:05.440]  we're usually about 40 45 percent of every bundle of securities that coldman and others sold
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:11.840]  came from those states and came based on mortgages that were usually were written in those states
[2:18:11.840 --> 2:18:18.720]  and so so what would have happened to the sales of these securities if goldman had acknowledged
[2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:24.560]  two investors that disclosed informal filings with the sec or in the circulars they they passed
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:30.720]  around uh on the deals they did in the cayman islands what would happen would they be able
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:37.520]  to make these sales and that's a big question well i mean here's an example i have a gold sponsor
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:42.400]  and i have the gold sponsor on the air and i really believe gold was going to go up the last six
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:50.560]  years from 300 bucks an ounce to a thousand and it has you're a smart guy but but if so i mean it's
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:56.080]  simple i mean i tell people i believe this is great doesn't mean it's perfect nothing's a silver bullet
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:02.000]  silver and gold is as close as you get but then if it came out that i was internally
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.400]  betting against gold to go down which i believe it's going to continue to go up for a while
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:14.080]  if i was wrong that'd be okay but if it came out that i knew it was going to go down and i was
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:19.200]  telling people oh it's great here by it i could get a lot of trouble for that the question is will
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:24.720]  goldman sacks get in trouble or do they have so many of their people in regulatory positions and
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:30.000]  larry summers running the white house economic area that that they're not going to get in trouble

[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:40.720]  and he is here with us uh today okay the question that i posed when the break was
[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:46.560]  does goldman sacks get in trouble for this i mean there's not even that i know of an
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:54.240]  investigation being done and the sec is filled with goldman sacks people and uh i remember
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:59.920]  paulson it's in my film follow the republic he's up there testifying and they say you were at
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:05.920]  goldman sacks how did you congressman stern is asking him from florida how did you give
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.880]  your company money and he goes oh i got a waiver from and he said where'd you get a waiver from
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:16.480]  and he said i got a waiver from the treasury department from himself i mean it's just where does
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:23.120]  this go or do they just continue to get to write the rules because i interviewed a professor uh
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:30.560]  yesterday that you quote uh in your article and uh he said he said that it that that that all of
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:36.240]  this is just continuing that that the same people that set all this up are just continuing and so
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:44.880]  nothing's being reformed you're talking about laurence cutlercroft of boston university i believe
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:51.680]  yes um and uh there are a lot of questions about i'm not covering the reform process
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:55.520]  because i've been doing this but there are a lot of questions about whether the right reforms are
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:04.000]  being done uh congress did create a commission uh to investigate the the crash the causes of the
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:11.200]  crash uh they also we also have the securities and exchange commission which has uh is trying
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:17.120]  very hard right now to make amends for for really blowing the bernie made-off investigation for
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:21.920]  years i mean there just was a big inspector general's report that came out last week that
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:29.040]  talked about uh at least six instances in which sec investigators had the had right under their
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:35.680]  nose opportunities to to expose this gigantic ponzi scheme that has hurt so many people and each
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:41.520]  time they they missed it they missed the the obvious failed to take the obvious investigative
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:46.400]  step that would have exposed the whole thing and made off basically kept shaking his head saying boy
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:50.880]  i was lucky that time so we're going to have to see whether the sec which right now under mary
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:59.520]  Shapiro its new chair is going to look at at goldman and really at all the investment banks
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:06.320]  and and whether or not they properly fully disclosed what they knew about these risky
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:13.120]  mortgages and one of the last piece of the series i looked at goldman's relationship with new century
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:19.840]  mortgage a company that really was one of the classic high flyers in this sort of go-go industry
[2:27:19.840 --> 2:27:27.920]  a new century in the mid 90s was a a small company doing some subprime mortgages which were a little
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:34.960]  bit riskier than the traditional mortgages and maybe had about 300 million plus in sales and a
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:44.240]  decade later new century's revenues approached 60 billion dollars in one year which is a staggering
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:52.240]  they were the number two behind ameriquest and a new century had about nine deals in which they
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:28:00.160]  sold or their mortgages ended up in pools of of securities that that goldman sacks sold as high
[2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:10.960]  yield bonds and in addition goldman sold off new century related securities offshore in at least
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:18.720]  three deals so we we i tallied up about five billion dollars plus in in mortgages from new
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:26.080]  century and i i think the numbers a bit higher and maybe quite a bit higher that goldman was was
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:35.200]  peddling in you know after converting them into bonds or other securities and and new century
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:42.960]  i got inside new century i looked at a 550 page federal bankruptcy examiners report by the way
[2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:53.440]  the only one done on any defunct mortgage company from that era and i got networked into a bunch
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:29:01.120]  of former new century employees and they described how essentially all the lids were removed from
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:10.800]  the mortgage lending process late in this in this uh uh you know really red hot housing market right
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:16.960]  as it crested that's when there weren't enough borrowers to keep up with the wall street demand
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:27.680]  and so the the lending criteria the credit criteria just began to become yes it disappeared
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:33.440]  in the thin air so this is systemic fraud from top to bottom i mean that's what it's been one of
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:38.400]  the things i just won't mention this alex and that is that like other wall street firms goldman
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:44.080]  hired contractors to look over these mortgages stay there we gotta break we gotta break we'll

[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:31.840]  greg gordon has written three parts that i see in the series there may be more how goldman secretly
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.640]  bet on the us housing crash goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes mystery why did
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:40.880]  goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought i want to briefly in the 10 minutes or less that we have
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:46.000]  left with our guests today go over some of that we'll give you the latest on the shootings around
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:51.920]  the country unfortunately in florida and texas some new developments there okay going back to
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:56.720]  greg gordon greg you were trying to say something as we went to break i was just going to mention
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:03.360]  that the wall street firms as you would expect them to do hired contractors to look over pools of
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:13.040]  mortgages before they they were actually purchased and it's very interesting what happened here i've
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:19.360]  managed to find some of the people who were looking over these loans including a former
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:25.280]  project manager who would not be identified for fear it would ruin his career who said that
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:32.320]  he watched as the number of loans that were reviewed in each pool the percentage of loans
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:39.360]  declined steadily from me from really a hundred percent at the beginning to 10 percent or less
[2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:45.440]  at the end so they weren't looking at but a small sample of the loans at the end then you had the
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:50.480]  problem of the of the reviewers these are some of these people were very experienced have been
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:55.520]  in the lending business for 1020 years and they'd look at a loan they'd say hey this this person is
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:36:02.400]  a landscaper making ten thousand dollars this person's a is a hairdresser claiming ten thousand
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:10.080]  dollars a month and and and this person here is a was a checker at walmart claiming five
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:15.360]  thousand dollars a month in income and they're getting these big loans but how do you justify
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:21.200]  this we have to stop this loan because this is not legit and they'd be told no we have to follow
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:26.480]  the guidelines of the mortgage lender and this mortgage lender this particular kind of loan
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:32.640]  is a what's known as the stated income loan the stated income loan became known later on
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:41.840]  as a liars loan there was no verification of the of the credit qualifications so we had fraud
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:48.080]  engineered into the system so here's the issue we see made-off go to jail we see ken lay get
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:55.920]  convicted but looking at this it seems as if their crimes are smaller diminutive are dwarfed
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:02.720]  by these bigger institutional hedged frauds where they all kind of you know pass on the guilt to
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:08.560]  each other and then everyone just acts stupid and you know there's no king pin made offer or or ken
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:17.440]  lay but in the aggregate it's it's it's it's galaxy's bigger and you can't get rid of these people
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:24.320]  they run the system still i mean are we just drifting towards destruction well i don't know
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:29.440]  whether we're drifting towards destruction but it's it's clear that this was a chain of profit
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:36.560]  that began from a real estate agent through the appraiser the mortgage broker the mortgage lender
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:44.960]  the securitizer and the and the ratings agencies you couldn't have done this however at this scale
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:50.400]  without the ratings agencies who bestowed these triple a ratings on these securities and without
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:57.280]  wall street which which turned a fairly nominally sized market into a $2 trillion market so so
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:02.000]  they're the kingpin so so the buck stops with the with the with the regulators or
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:08.960]  i'm not going to get by but i'm not going to i'm not going to make any predictions what the
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:14.480]  regulators are going to do not after the made-off case uh we'll see whether they are willing to go
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:22.240]  in there and subpoena as goldman sacks to find out exactly what bets and what the the chronology
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:30.160]  was uh the timing of all these secret bets and what they were and what people knew most important
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:35.040]  perhaps probably what did people know while they were making the secret bets did they know they
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:38.880]  were peddling toxic waste and they needed to insure themselves and that's why they bought
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:45.520]  20 billion dollars in insurance like bets with aig or or was this just uh as they as goldman sacks
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:54.080]  would put it that were they just positioning repositioning their portfolio it's it's just
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:59.280]  mind blowing to see something like this at this magnitude going on and no one's been brought to
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:06.560]  justice to add insult to injury record profits for goldman sacks record bonuses and it's going on
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:14.560]  at these other big firms bonuses at aig bonuses at jp morgan bonuses all around while the real
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:23.680]  economy goes belly up in unemployment skyrockets that's correct well we'll have to see uh we'll
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:29.120]  have to see whether we get an investigation you asked me before about about the uh what goldman
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:35.360]  is doing now and it is it is interesting and sad to note that like the other wall street firms
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:41.440]  goldman sacks this 24 karat wall street firm has been reduced to going into court around the
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:49.520]  country and and filing papers to seize the homes of people who borrowed uh on subprime mortgages
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:53.920]  and who would never many of them would never been able to get these loans if wall street hadn't
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:57.920]  created such a big market now they're losing their homes and why these people because their
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:02.960]  credit is so filed up will never be able to qualify to buy up to to get another mortgage again
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:09.840]  well it's a predatory vertical integration of the economy uh strip mining is is the way i would
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:15.200]  describe it but but certainly goldman has come out better than anybody in this a lot most of
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:20.000]  their competitors are dead and gone they've made record profits they've got their people
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:27.280]  everywhere in every regulatory agency in the white house and so it paid off i mean it looks like
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:33.760]  this paid looks like uh you know why did uh why did that famous gangster rob banks because that's
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:37.840]  where the money was and i guess nobody will even point the finger at them and so they'll
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:46.000]  i mean i guess that's it they win let's let's say this in fairness uh and and you know nobody's
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.480]  feeling terribly fair toward goldman's wanting to be terribly fair toward goldman sacks because
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:55.600]  they're making so much money in this horrible climate right now economic climate but but
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:00.800]  goldman this is this is not the only market goldman was in and they're very smart they get the best
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:04.640]  in the brightest out of ivy league schools and they're very smart they make a lot of money in a
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:11.520]  lot of places what's what's uh uh drawn our attention is just the fact that goldman wasn't
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:16.960]  a small player and they got out they made it out safely and nobody else really did
[2:41:18.720 --> 2:41:23.120]  and they just so happen to have all the regulators well amazing and and and now
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:27.520]  they're running around you've got to investigate and report on that one of the most aggressive
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:34.560]  groups uh correct me if i'm wrong going after people's houses well there was a disturbing
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:42.480]  example uh a couple named uh tony and ceilia becker from san jose at a 1500 square foot house
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:48.480]  and they took a couple of mortgages out to support a jewelry business that have been hit with the
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.440]  wildfires and other things that happen in california and and uh they were they were having some
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:58.000]  financial problems they took these mortgages out to free up some cash to try to keep their
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:03.280]  business afloat and they fell behind nonetheless on the payments when the second wildfire kind of
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:08.720]  wiped out the whole area around their around their business and so they needed to they've
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:14.480]  discovered a clause in the mortgage that allowed them to negotiate uh to defer some of the loan
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:20.640]  payments and they needed to negotiate with their lender to get this deferral the only problem was
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:26.560]  nobody would admit to being the lender the goldman had bought the mortgages from a subprime lender
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.360]  and and denied that it owned the mortgages which might have been technically true because they
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:36.240]  were stuck in the trust at the time but they knew where they were and and this couple wrote a letter
[2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:42.960]  to goldman's chairman none other than henry paulson at the time 2003 and it took three years
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:50.320]  before a sort of an obscure goldman subsidiary acknowledged at a court hearing that yes goldman
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:55.200]  held their mortgage and then it took another three years until just a couple months ago
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:43:01.040]  they finally got a concession from goldman goldman gave them a new mortgage at five percent interest
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:06.560]  now this couple it was a novel case because they had some claims of investment lost claims against
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:10.800]  goldman it's mother wall street firms and goldman settled up with them but the question is how could
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:17.200]  goldman take so long just to acknowledge that they that it owns their mortgage yeah how can you
[2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:24.000]  well i mean i've got a mortgage and over the years it's been sold i think five times and
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:28.960]  then i would have them threatening me over escrow money and i'd say i paid that bank and then they
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:34.880]  wouldn't say who bought it well another company now has it send your check here send your check there
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:39.280]  you know make your wireless payment here make your wireless payment there and then i read about
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:47.120]  it's been on cnn where people actually own a house but then they say paperwork wasn't filed right and so
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:55.040]  banks come in and start repossessing i mean this is crazy it's a very common problem a lot of these
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:44:00.720]  a lot of these wall street firms did not always file papers in the local with the local registrar of
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:06.320]  deeds uh it's called an assignment of mortgage and it makes clear who the mortgage holder is
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:11.840]  and a lot of times they didn't file these papers uh properly so many people when they try to modify
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:15.920]  their mortgage or refinance or whatever they run into all kinds of problems because they can't figure
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:21.360]  out uh you know the title companies they want to know who who has the mortgage who are we paying
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:25.040]  off how are they going to get a pay off figure if you can't even figure out who owns the mortgage
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:31.840]  and it just goes on and on and on and instead of more transparency it looks like we're
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:36.400]  looks like we're getting less well i guess we're going to see more in this series or are you done
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:41.280]  writing about the goldman sacks for now we got a lot of leads in response to this series we'll see
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:46.960]  if any of them uh turned fruitful but we're i'm trying to find i'm following a number of them
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:52.480]  right now trying to see where they go we'll see if we can some can get up some good uh follow stories
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:56.960]  okay greg gordon with the classy newspapers award-winning investigative journalists and i

[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:28.160]  guaranteed to be a prozac head psychiatrist at fort hood they're trying to spin into terrorism
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:35.760]  it could be that could be a staged event we'll find out later as bob Chapman said it is too early
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:41.600]  right now for me to sit here and tell you that i don't have any idea what's going on i'll tell you
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:52.080]  this it stinks to high heaven my nose is rarely wrong and it's telling me that this stinks bad
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:57.360]  and if we keep seeing more shootings and they turn out to be on drugs or turn out to be army
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:07.360]  psychiatrist or you know it just very very suspicious right now and uh we are we are looking at that in
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:14.960]  detail meanwhile we've got distractions in and around this story uh the big talk on the fake
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:19.280]  conservative stations you know they don't want to talk about the global carbon tax treaty they
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:25.040]  don't want to talk about all the really serious issues or how the republicans are in bed with
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:30.560]  goldman sacks jp morgan the private federal reserve just as much as obama no they're all
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:34.480]  oh we're the conservatives we'll be back in power in the next year and a half in congress and we'll
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:40.160]  fix it all yeah let's see if that happens when they get in just like we'll see if it happens
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:45.520]  when obama got in and then when i'm attacking the republican congress in a year and a half when they
[2:46:45.520 --> 2:46:51.280]  get control of the house which they're probably going to do i'll be called a commie again i'm being
[2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:57.040]  called a right wing extremist right now because i don't like the political whore that reads off a
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:02.880]  teleprompter who's barack obama no i'm a constitutionalist i'm a truth teller i'm somebody that just
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:09.200]  tells the truth lets the chips fall where they may we make a mistake we admit it we're right we
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:15.360]  trumpet it we're here you can judge us by our track record by the fruits of what we produce what we
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:23.840]  create what we do but this indignation of the citizenry getting mad having their political
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:31.200]  angers dissipated like a steam valve on ridiculous crap obama's giving a speech yesterday they load
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:38.640]  his teleprompter i've gone and pulled the video up with prepared remarks he reads off the the i'm
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:45.040]  not defending obama but i'm not going to spend all day on some puppet and ask the listeners
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:52.320]  what do you think of obama not caring about the troops what do you think of obama being disrespectful
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:58.880]  to him that's a mind game the media is playing with you this guy gets up there reads off a
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:05.200]  teleprompter says oh our hearts go out to everybody who was hurt you know after he said thanks to
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:10.240]  congressional medal honor winner and thanks to the people that are there two minutes in he talks
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:16.800]  about the shooting as if he's the president as if he's running anything it's all about it's obama
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:24.640]  and everything stops with obama and obama really runs things that way in three to seven years
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:32.720]  whenever he leaves office whether he's one term or two it can all be blamed on him and then we'll
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:38.400]  get another fake right winger and then in four day years it can all be blamed on him again and
[2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:44.640]  then we'll get another democrat and then we can build them up and tear them down and make it all
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:49.920]  about how they're making the decision obama's making the decision on whether to increase troops
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:56.720]  in afghanistan they've already sent in two groups of troops they've increased it right at 40 000 more
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:01.840]  but they make it all about a debate will there be more after that and what decision will he make
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:10.960]  will he make the right decision it's just all a big theater game no doubt about it it means nothing
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:21.360]  it means absolutely nothing did the media make a big deal about it when obama's controllers
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:24.240]  six months ago wanted to make veterans pay for their own medical care
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:32.080]  no because the establishment doesn't care about the veterans they're scared of the veterans they
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:37.600]  don't like you they use fake patriotism to control you that's why they're banning a lot of veterans
[2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:43.200]  from owning guns are veterans with guns dangerous you bet they are some are dangerous to criminals
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.400]  some are dangerous to their wives and kids that's just the way it is to be an empire with a bunch
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:54.480]  of trained killers coming back and living amongst us you don't take my guns because a bunch of trained
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:50:01.440]  killers may go crazy at any minute and you sure don't blame the whole military because a small
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:07.600]  percentage of them are going to go cuckoo for cocoa puffs and fly over the cuckoo nest that's why
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:12.240]  i've got my guns some crazy vet goes running around trying to shoot a bunch of people i'm
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:17.600]  going to go out and deal with them it's not because i'm macho or tough folks it's what you're supposed
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:22.560]  to do i don't know how they turned this country into a bunch of cowards and how it's amazing that
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:28.320]  this female cop went and shot this reported lunatic four times didn't kill him they said he
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:32.720]  killed him for six hours and they're all marveling that a cop would just run in and shoot somebody
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:37.840]  what do you think cops did 20 30 years ago they didn't need all the gear and all the crap
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:45.440]  but a woman is now tougher than the average cop and i just don't even know what to say about it
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:51.920]  anymore it it again it makes my head spin that at every other major shooting two three four hours
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:57.120]  they make the cops wait while the shooter runs around killing everybody i guess the feds give
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.360]  that order so the kill rates higher now maybe the cops aren't counting

[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:38.880]  hi alex long-time listener here i just want to pass on the observations that the official
[2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:43.920]  countdown to judgment day tea party tour rally after attending the abalone rally this morning
[2:54:43.920 --> 2:54:47.440]  and hearing just a few of their host speakers it appears that the tea party movement's been
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:52.480]  hijacked big money republican agents who are pushing the pro-military pro-war agenda of the
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:57.440]  old bush neocon regime they have speakers promoting u.s. aggression against radical islam
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:01.440]  terror and the main guy running the tea party tours pushing his book which supports the neocon
[2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:06.400]  fallacy of a total islamic attack on 9-11 the majority of this abalone crowd does not know
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:10.720]  your work and if you mentioned 9-11 was an inside job they spit in your face and they spit in my
[2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:16.000]  face today and consider you an abominoid i made the mistake of passing out tear storm fires
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:20.480]  about false flag tear but these area veterans and local dais air force base folks can't accept
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:25.440]  that the u.s. military has been hijacked the tea party tour will not have speakers who expose
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:31.200]  the new world order and that the elite insiders control are behind 9-11 say they demonized cindy
[2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:36.400]  shiham and the abalone crowd brooder when her name was mentioned they never speak of the phrase
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:41.600]  new world order this tea party caravan is headed to austin at five o'clock your where you're at
[2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:48.720]  today you need to be there and push 9-11 truth absolutely i mean what's happened is this is
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:56.320]  what glenbeck's for he guides and takes the ron paul revolution he's taken it over only by ron paul
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:01.840]  coming out public not attacking beckon others but stating the true principles can we take control
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:06.320]  of it back but i mean this is why the leader in power they know how to control the left
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:13.040]  obama was meant to take control of that glenbeck rush limbaugh create a fake clone on the right
[2:56:13.040 --> 2:56:21.520]  right two wings on the same bird and again the mainline tea party people there is no new world
[2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:26.800]  order the carbon tax isn't global government glenbeck a few weeks ago attacked the british
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:32.240]  lord that came out and said global government i mean come on glenn so see he does that at key
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:38.160]  points he admits things that are true and then goes back on them that's why i like lou dobbs
[2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:42.160]  a lot better i mean he doesn't go as far as back on some issues but he's consistent
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:47.040]  and isn't involved in backstabbing that i've seen and that's why his house is getting shot up
[2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:52.160]  but i appreciate your call um look it's not going to matter if they take over the tea parties
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:57.440]  people are finding out about world government the economy is collapsing we're there educating
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:04.480]  people about the real threat the best film to give a neoconoid who are the real obama supporters
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:09.840]  the bush people just held over into obama they should love obama he's keeping all the neocons
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:14.560]  and the defense department give them fall the republic this it shatters the left right paradigm
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:21.520]  they've never been exposed to this they're like they're like blind people who've never seen trying
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:26.880]  to describe something to them and trying to describe the way the seashore looks they've never
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:33.600]  seen they they can't interface they can't understand they can't begin to even realize what
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:38.080]  we're trying to say to them if you just argue with them they think you're liberal you're coming
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:43.200]  go don't get me mousy tune you know they don't want to hear bush triple the size of government
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:49.040]  they want to believe the lie but if you say hey this film exposes obama which it does
[2:57:49.040 --> 2:57:54.800]  but it also exposes bush and the whole agenda watch this that's why ted's gonna run some ads
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:58:00.000]  on national radio for the neocons because we need to deprogram these people and the left this film
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:06.160]  has been to deprogram people in the control left right paradigm who think that inside the box
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:10.800]  you know inside this little contained area that's the whole world we're gonna go no
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:18.720]  look for yourself it's much bigger it's much more sophisticated and a lot of them won't wake

[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:03.600]  where are you joining us from i am joining you from london i'm a bit i'm a bit trepidatious
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:06.880]  about this interview because i'm always worried about where it's going to go but i mean but it's
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:11.280]  great to hear from you again you know we had this amazing adventure what when was it back in the
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:17.760]  year 2000s where we snuck indian grove together yes yes and then i wasn't supposed to talk about
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:24.480]  how you later went in there for liability purposes and then people asked me later well why is john
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:29.520]  ronston saying he also snuck in so they thought that i guess that's a journalistic issue of
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:34.640]  you guys snuck in later that day that evening after i went in and then i wasn't supposed to talk
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:40.800]  about that and then later you did talk about that and that became quite a big question out there for
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  people yeah i know i was worried at the time i speak in completely frankly that if i admitted
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:52.560]  that i snuck in and trespassed we might have trouble getting our documentary on television
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:55.920]  yeah because of the way that we you know went about gathering the material
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:03:00.720]  uh so i just kind of kept quiet about it and and but then when my book came out when them came out
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:05.680]  i didn't make going in but of course to this day to this day there's loads of people who think that
[3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:09.760]  i didn't go into the indian grove and i faked the whole thing you know including people on prison
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:15.760]  planets you know in the forum and so on well don't feel bad john because people think i a didn't
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:23.280]  sneak in or be that they let us in but no we did indeed i separately snuck in then later that day
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:28.880]  you reportedly snuck in there and uh i i did see it about 100 yards away and why about you
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.400]  yeah absolutely in fact we we we walked past each other and when we were surrounded by all that
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:40.560]  kind of strange devilly iconography and all those kind of you know owl sculptures and and you know
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:44.960]  we walked past each other basically you know just keep walking just keep walking as it was a mad night
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:50.400]  i still look back on that as being one of the probably the strangest nights of my life and one
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:58.400]  of the most enjoyable well i think one of the big issues here is folks can't believe that i was able
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:02.800]  to sneak in and shoot that footage that you use in your television program because so many other
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:07.840]  people got caught got busted but every time you read about a cbs news reporter or a people magazine
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:13.840]  reporter or vanity fair they walk up to people and start asking reporter questions what do they
[3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:19.840]  think is going to happen there still is there's a weirdness though to us getting in because we
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:25.920]  both knew that in the in the days preceding our arrival there were kind of fbi guys all over the
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:31.200]  the local town and so on but by the time we arrived they'd all cleaned out and we did we just
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:36.080]  walked in very easily i walked up the drive given the security guard to kind of i rule the world
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:40.560]  wave you know wearing creppy clothes and you went in through the undergrowth but we both got in
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:45.680]  incredibly easily my my guess is that these days you know since your documentary and my book and
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:50.960]  documentary is going to be a lot harder to get into bohemian girls that you know maybe we we spoiled
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:55.840]  the party for any other i believe we have in fact they've reported that the security is out the
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:05:03.760]  wazoo now john ronson stay with us hey folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about oxy

[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:17.920]  is you know i thought what i saw was kind of stupid and you thought what what we saw inside
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:24.000]  bohemian grove was you know proofers of satanism and so on and i didn't but what we agree on is
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:29.200]  that the participants in the ritual at bohemian grove seem to take it really seriously and that's
[3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:36.640]  a really interesting question yes you were there in the crowd as they were engaging in the mock
[3:09:36.640 --> 3:09:43.040]  human sacrifice the effigy of a boy and i mean were the old men not grinding their teeth and
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:50.720]  making sexual pleasure noises were they not in a raptured state well they did seem to i don't
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:55.760]  know if i used those exact words i didn't think kind of sexual pleasure or something but they did
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:10:03.440]  seem to be like really into it you know like really uh intense about it and and you noticed that and i
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:09.760]  noticed that and and it was strange that i came away thinking you know frankly that i was the most
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:15.440]  sane person in the entire redwood forest because i i didn't agree with with you and mike's interpretation
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:21.520]  of the ceremony but also i could see that you know that the participants were taking it just as
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:26.560]  seriously as you were and i and i did find that very odd and in fact that was the kind of germ of
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:32.000]  the idea you know this idea was kind of bubbles of craziness at the house of power that eventually
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.080]  led on to be writing the minister at goats you know really the minister at goats was kind of
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:42.880]  began to form in my mind that nice when we were at bohemian grove well i mean from from from meeting
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:52.960]  you out at waco more than 10 years ago to today i've seen you in bbc and cnn interviews that you've
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:58.480]  changed your views because 10 years ago you laughed there was no global government there was no secret
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:03.360]  room there wasn't a plan and then three or four years later i'd see you say no there really is a
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:08.320]  builder bird group they really do want a world government uh but but you can differ on what
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:13.680]  their plans are or argue about are they really in control now they're openly announcing a global
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:18.960]  carbon tax a world government we're going to pay our taxes to a private bank of the world
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:24.400]  they have the framework convention on climate change they're saying al gore is a
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:32.320]  profit and that his new movie is about how it's a global religion of the earth and i mean john a
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:38.240]  lot has changed what's your view now on the new world order does it still not exist well i mean
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:42.720]  what you're saying now about kind of what stuff might have leaked out of you know recent builder
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:47.680]  bird meetings i don't know i've not read the minutes uh of the last few years meeting so i
[3:11:47.680 --> 3:11:53.680]  can't comment on that but the reason why i said that i felt that you know their agenda was to an
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:59.200]  extent a creation of world government is because that's what one of the founding members of the
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:04.960]  builder bird group said to me on the record it was it was denise healy lord healy who was one of the
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:10.080]  you know the first people to set up builder bird again and he said to say that we were striving
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:16.400]  for a world government is exaggerated but not wholly unfair those those are his actual words
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:22.880]  he said because basically you know builder bird was set up post second world war and they saw the
[3:12:22.880 --> 3:12:27.840]  you know that the last thing the world needed was a politician who was too much of an ideologue
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:31.840]  you know they didn't want any more hitlers so they kind of figured a world government
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:37.040]  where politics wasn't really in the hands of politicians it was much more about the flow of
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:41.840]  capital you know that that seemed to have been the reason why builder bird as a kind of centrist
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:47.600]  globalist thing was was set up so yeah so so that there we are not in disagreement either
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.000]  but john you i mean the mainstream media is still out of one side of their mouth
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:55.760]  says there's no such thing as a world government and then out of the other side of their mouth
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:00.400]  they say yes it's a great thing and it's going to be non-democratic and authoritarian
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:06.080]  because we the wise men know best i.e. financial times of london headline and now for world
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:12.480]  government i mean here is the new york times two weeks ago ban kai moon and it says uh ban kai moon
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:23.920]  again is the author of this and he went on to say in the article that global government
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:30.960]  is what we need he goes on in the article to say one world government is what we need and
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:36.320]  that carbon taxes will be the funding mechanism for this i mean this is authoritarian this is
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:43.120]  unelected this system is not democratic and you find out the very same wise men that created hitler
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:50.320]  and created musolini are the very wise men that created Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein or their
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:56.880]  sons did well my my theory about bildberg is that their vision back in the early 1950s post the
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:05.360]  second world war uh was in in their minds quite idealistic they thought that a safer way of running
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:12.640]  the world having just lived through musolini and hitler a safer way would be to de ideologue
[3:14:12.640 --> 3:14:17.920]  the politicians and to put power in the hands of business they because businessmen only care about
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:23.360]  the flow of money they don't care about politics and ideologies but of course you know what what the
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:29.520]  last 50 years it's taught us is that CEOs can be just as corrupt as politicians and frequently are
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:34.000]  so you know that that's my view on bildberg is that it was an idealistic vision which like all
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:40.640]  idealistic visions went wrong well have you read where it's been declassified now that hitler was
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:47.680]  on mi5 payroll and so was musolini i don't know anything about that i can't comment on that because i
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.720]  don't know nothing about it i'd be interested in reading the link yeah that's london guardian
[3:14:52.720 --> 3:14:59.280]  which you write for times of london i mean we already knew this from millner group declassified
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:06.160]  documents and uh but uh yeah no well i mean you know about edward the eighth being a nazi right
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:12.720]  well yeah i mean there's no question that that a whole load of the you know ruling gentry of
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:17.840]  britain and during the rise of the nazi party you know loved the nazis and they were constantly
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:21.840]  inviting the nazis out for the british ruling classes and you know putting them up for tea and
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:26.000]  you know it's a wonderful novel about that called the remains of the day so you know there's there's
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:30.880]  no question that that was going on uh you know the mitzvah i can't remember which mitzvah it was it
[3:15:30.880 --> 3:15:35.440]  so what happened is the british said you go ahead and attack we're going to back you and then they
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:41.600]  flip-flopped at the end and that's why the deputy furor flew over rudolf hesson got captured the
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:50.080]  issue is john it's all been declassified now and it was all staged hitler was set up so so this this
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:56.000]  corporate group of bankers that set up bilderberg prince Bernhardt the nazi and all the rest of them
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:01.120]  this is all a big giant joke i mean you know about prince philip and all his calls for eugenics i mean
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:06.000]  you've certainly heard those statements i mean have you read the white house science are his own
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:11.600]  publication eco science calling for putting poison in the water to sterilize us have you seen this john
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:19.920]  i know nothing about that but and also you know i i firmly believe that you know we know that there
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:25.760]  that some of the uh some of the founders of the bilderberg group you know did have nazi ties i
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:33.680]  think it was uh i think it was was it just a question as well or just yes yes but i put my
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:38.960]  personal view and you know this is the kind of non-conspiratorial view is that that's not an
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:44.240]  important fact and you know the important facts was that these were people who were kind of idealistic
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:49.920]  globalists i mean that's but hold on bilderberg has released 1954 documents from their founding
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:54.160]  after all these years saying that it didn't exist where they said we're going to create a european
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:16:58.640]  union we're going to create a global government i mean you know this whole time they've been lying
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:05.200]  about it and then now at the final moment they spring on on the public well that's interesting
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:09.760]  that would be interesting to read definitely i mean that doesn't surprise me the idea that you know
[3:17:09.760 --> 3:17:14.080]  that there's a single currency and a european union was kind of high on bilderberg's agenda
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:20.320]  back in the 50s that doesn't surprise me at all all right well instead of instead of alex jones
[3:17:20.320 --> 3:17:27.520]  barking questions at john ronson at john ronson dot com let's start getting into uh the men who
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:34.000]  stare at goats that was the the the sequel to them i guess international bestseller back
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:38.960]  in paperback all over the world right now the movie is out doing very well uh what was the
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:46.480]  research you did on the book a and how accurate to the book is the film well okay well i mean i
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:50.720]  as i said i think the book really began even i didn't realize it that night when you and i
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:56.000]  were together in behemian grove because it did really you know you and i couldn't have interpreted
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:18:00.640]  you know the the ritual differently that we saw behemian grove we had a completely different view
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:05.680]  but the one thing we agreed on was that the participants these men of wealth and power
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:10.400]  seemed to be like really into it and i thought to myself you know my god you know this is not how
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:16.320]  i would spend my summer vacation having a mock human sacrifice in the forests of northern california
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:21.280]  seemed like a very weird thing and so i thought well you know what what is you know what are the
[3:18:21.280 --> 3:18:26.480]  weirdness what are the irrationality can be found in in the corridors of power so the first thing i
[3:18:26.480 --> 3:18:31.120]  did was was uh with my producer john sergeant was kind of looking to remote viewing now there was
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:38.080]  something kind of tangible that was out there a little bit and and um post 9 11 i i met uh urie
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:42.000]  geller um you know urie geller with the spoon bending and so on and he'd always claimed to have
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:46.480]  been a secret psychic spy working for the cia and kind of nobody believed him because they sort of
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:52.880]  figured that the cia wouldn't wouldn't do that uh so post 9 11 uh they thought that the cia were
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:58.240]  sensible you know we may be nuts but the cia is surely sensible uh so post 9 11 i met urie geller
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:03.360]  and and and he said to me he was very mysterious and finally he took off his dark glasses and he
[3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:10.880]  said to me uh if you repeat what i'm about to tell you i will deny it and i said okay and he said
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:19.200]  i have been reactivated and i said by who he said i'm not going to tell you and said okay i will
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:26.640]  tell you just one thing the man who reactivated me is called ron so i went off on a journey to try
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:32.000]  and find ron and i never found ron although i've got a suspicion as to who he probably was and but
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:36.240]  on the way to finding ron i met tell me how long i can go on because this because this is the story
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:40.880]  that i've gone through i don't want to hear it john ronson when we come back i mean obviously you are
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:48.400]  the reporter uh in the big movie out in theaters right now obi won kenobi plays you i know how
[3:19:48.400 --> 3:19:53.920]  about that as you can probably as you're as you're uh as the people watching the sky can probably
[3:19:53.920 --> 3:19:58.480]  tell it's very appropriate because when i look mister liao there is a you and mcgrevinist tonight
[3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:05.200]  you look just like me when you hear the words water purification what comes to mind if it's

[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:22.640]  for the men who stare at goats so you were getting into the story which is shown in the
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:28.640]  movie of where you're meeting with the with the former black ops commander and he's saying so you
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:34.960]  were a psychic soldier and he says yes jedi warriors please continue john ronson yeah well
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:38.560]  basically what what we discovered through our research that the remote viewers which i'm sure
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:42.640]  loads of you listeners know about the site you know the team of psychic spies were really just
[3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:50.080]  a tip of of an iceberg and the iceberg was mainly the spin called remote influencing and i first
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:54.880]  got to hear about this when i was in hawaii uh interviewing a man called glenn weaton uh he
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:59.840]  said he was part of a secret unit called project jedi and i said what's project jedi he said well
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:05.840]  it's a series of levels he said level one teaching the soldier to eat only nuts and grains for a
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:12.400]  month and i said okay what was level two he said level two was invisibility and i said well that's
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:17.680]  quite the leap from level one and i said well actual invisibility he said well yes but after a
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:22.880]  while we adapted it to just to just try to find a way of not being seen and i said like camouflage
[3:25:22.880 --> 3:25:27.680]  and went no and i said what was level three he said level three was intuition he came to a fork
[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:32.560]  in the road you go left you go right you go right and i said what was level four and he said level
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:40.080]  four was stopping the heart of a goat just by wanting the goat's heart to stop so really it was
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:47.440]  this one interview with glenn weaton that opened up this whole secret world of of of military
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:52.480]  intelligence craziness where they really did have rooms full of goats and they brought in these
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:58.960]  martial arts guys to try and kill the goats just by staring at them and you know they say that
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:03.200]  sometimes a goat fell over but you know i i think probably because it was suffering from some sort
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:08.160]  of pre-existing medical complaint or maybe it was just kind of bored of being stared at for
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:14.960]  you know days on end by martial arts gurus from Ohio and and then what what the book the minister
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:20.160]  goes goes on to do is really look at how some of these ideas didn't really die out but but mutated
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:25.440]  and came alive again in the form of different types of interrogation techniques at guantanamo
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.800]  and and abu grabe and so on the movie's lighter and doesn't and doesn't go into these darker areas
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:36.480]  it's more common well john i want to continue from there we're talking to john ronston john ronston
[3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:43.440]  dot com he's the author of men who stare at goats and them uh but expanding on that uh john you
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:51.360]  talk about tip of the iceberg i've been studying globalist and if you went deeper down the rat hole
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:56.080]  deeper down the rabbit hole you would find that the reason those old men were getting so
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:03.760]  upset or focused on the mock human sacrifice that you thought was silly was because they
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:12.000]  understand it was all symbolize and was symbols of something much much deeper and that all of
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:17.920]  this system is just simply the surface of something look at skull and bones that video abc news
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:24.000]  got with them screaming and yelling and worshiping satan and you know practice mock murders of young
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:31.040]  girls look at the rod rose and bam video right it was shot like a cross you know right right yeah
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:38.000]  but i mean that's my point john is that they take it serious because the real ritual was not
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:44.320]  the image of the boy being burned it was whatever happened behind those black curtains across the
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:50.800]  water that's when the old men really got upset and really started growling and and breathing
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:55.600]  heavily next to me and it wasn't one or two or three or four the whole group around me were
[3:27:55.600 --> 3:28:00.800]  doing this mike hanson is not getting with me witnessed it and so i mean i'm telling you
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:06.720]  these people are out of their minds they're crazy and so you or i normal people look at this and it
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:13.120]  looks ridiculous this is not ridiculous to them well again this is why i kind of agree and disagree
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:17.680]  with you because where i disagree with you because i'm not you know conspiratorial minded because i
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:23.200]  is is that i believe that what we saw at bohemian grove was all that was going on that night i don't
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:29.280]  believe there was anything going on behind the curtains however where i do agree with you
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:33.920]  is that the the people who go to skull and bones and goes to bohemian grove
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:39.280]  do seem to be into this idea of ritual and symbolism i i agree with you there and so you
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:45.840]  have to ask yourselves well why and one person actually who was involved with skull and bones
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:51.680]  said to me that uh uh actually the woman she said that her interpretation of the of their kind of
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:56.080]  being inter ritual was that it kind of gives you a sort of mandate you know sort of gives you a
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:29:00.480]  kind of sort of sense of superiority in a mandate to put yourself in a position of power and that's
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:06.960]  why these ivy league universities um you know do all this kind of stupid crazy stuff and and why
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.000]  these ideas live on in the in you know in when they get into the business world in places like
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:18.880]  bohemian grove but i don't believe at all that what we saw was any kind of actual human sacrifice it
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:23.280]  was just a pappy and actually i'm not i'm not saying i believe a national human sacrifice
[3:29:23.280 --> 3:29:28.240]  was going on i'm saying more was happening than meets the eye and think about your statement
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:33.520]  i don't believe anything was happening behind the curtain you know that's kind of a philosophical
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:38.800]  worldview on the planet itself i believe there is something going on behind the curtain
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:44.000]  and nine times out of ten when we pull the curtain back the real shows going on behind
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:50.080]  the curtain john ronson i mean look at how you wrote minousteric goats just all this insane stuff
[3:29:50.080 --> 3:29:58.400]  going on we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:33:13.360 --> 3:33:22.720]  so what you're saying is that you were a psychic spy a jedi warrior i'd heard that the u.s government
[3:33:22.720 --> 3:33:27.360]  was training psychic soldiers and that lin cassidy was the best of the best i've been
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:34.160]  reactivated i'm on a mission i could come lin's story was unbelievable crazy and completely true

[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:22.880]  mind
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:48.880]  i went looking for a story and my friend lin brought me an adventure
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:55.760]  it's okay we're americans we're here to help you what happened i think i just ran him over oh crap
[3:34:59.600 --> 3:35:05.040]  the man who jango used funds from the project's black budget to procure prostitutes that's a line
[3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:11.680]  and to get drugs for himself and his man that well the hooker thing is definitely a line
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:20.640]  all right the minister at goat's fame out in november 6 doing quite well in uh movie theaters
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:26.000]  around the country and john ronston's the big star he's the big reporter interviewing these
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:30.960]  guys did you actually go to the middle east and run over people i mean i mean did all of that happen
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:36.240]  no that part didn't happen uh pretty much everything else happened uh there's the pete
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:41.760]  distraught her up the screenplay kind of added a sort of body movie uh element to it uh but i
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:46.160]  didn't really kind of you know i didn't learn and grow much at all i was always a kind of bit of
[3:35:46.160 --> 3:35:51.920]  a cynic when it came to the existence of these paranormal powers um but so but so peter made
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:55.840]  the urn McGregor character have kind of more adventures than i had in the middle east but
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:02.080]  everything else is in the movies and well i get the idea i meant to go see the movie this weekend
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:05.920]  when you agreed to do the interview but i just didn't get around to it i do intend to go see it
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:10.400]  but i get the idea from the trailers and some of the sneak peeks i've watched online and also
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:17.040]  have read the book uh that that the film makes fun of a lot of it but also implies
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:23.040]  there could be something there like he is cloud bursting he is breaking up the clouds with his
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:27.600]  mind there are some delusionals here in austin that go out on hilltops and think they're doing
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:34.400]  the same thing uh i mean does the film imply that george plunie really does kill this goat or
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:39.120]  it doesn't really it kind of toys with us and i think that's something that's really nice about
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:42.960]  about the film you know when you read my book when you read the minister go you know you know
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:47.200]  that that my view is that none of these none of this stuff worked at all but peter kind of toys
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:52.560]  with the possibility that it works but i think in the end you kind of think that that the george
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:56.960]  plunie character is a kind of bit of a buzz light year as a as a radio DJ over here called
[3:36:56.960 --> 3:37:01.280]  simon mail described in the other day you know he thinks he has all these powers but he doesn't
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:06.800]  so when you see in flashback the goat being stared at and then falling over you don't believe
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:11.760]  that that necessarily actually happened you just believe that he believes if it happened so so i
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:16.560]  think by and large even though grand heads off the director of the film is more inclined to believe
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:21.840]  in the paranormal than i am uh you kind of come away thinking that it's probably not true
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:30.080]  but everybody's had dreams that come true or had premonitions of family dying or being hurt
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:37.120]  or maybe everybody i know has uh mr ronson are you saying you don't believe that there's any
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:43.120]  of this going on in the world anything that we don't understand that's happening if i say yeah i
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:49.440]  don't believe that at all i'm going to come over like like the world's worst magic sucking commotion
[3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:55.280]  but that's sort of what i feel you know i wish it weren't true i would love that to be these other
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:00.640]  levels that we could all you know go to you know especially when we die but i'm just not sure of
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:09.280]  it alex magic sucking chromogen that's me that's that's in the middle name chromogen hey you ran
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:16.960]  into uh david ike yeah i saw i saw him uh in the toilet queue at he threw a airport last week and
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:21.680]  you know like you you know neither you nor david like particularly liked my book them because it
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:27.760]  was anti conspiratorial uh but nonetheless it was just delightful to see david ike and we we
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:32.080]  practically gave each other a big hug and i sort of think well in the end you know we may
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:36.480]  kind of utterly disagree but we but we had a kind of adventure together just like i did with you at
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:42.240]  behemian grove and in the end as we kind of turn into old men that's kind of the stuff that matters
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:49.920]  right i guess we are getting older yeah and it's like you know so so the fact that you know david
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:54.160]  ike was very happy to see me and i was happy to see him and we kind of buried any political
[3:38:54.160 --> 3:38:58.320]  differences and you know differences in the outlook of the way the world works and it was just
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:05.280]  just really nice john am i wrong in saying though you have on say a scale of one to ten weird ten
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:10.960]  you're a zero when it comes to believing conspiracy theories that you've gone from like a one over to
[3:39:10.960 --> 3:39:17.360]  a six or seven i mean from what i've seen of you on television or maybe that's the role you play
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:24.720]  when you're on mainstream tv because they're so dried out and stale that that you look like a
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:30.560]  conspiracy theorist but when i see you on television you seem to be admitting there's a world government
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:35.120]  forming and that there is some cover-ups and corruption i mean you don't discount at all
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:39.760]  well there's nothing i've said for instance in the interview to you today that i you know regret
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:43.760]  i mean i you know i know that that was build up both agenda because one of the founders of the
[3:39:43.760 --> 3:39:48.960]  build up a group said it to me that they you know the original agenda was was some form of world
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:54.000]  government or certainly kind of single community throughout the world and i agree with you i completely
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:58.800]  disagree with you that the bohemian group ritual proved that there was any kind of weird satanism
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:04.000]  or anything kind of really dark and crazy going on but you know i agree that there was a weirdness
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:08.800]  there that they were really really into it in a way that you know i thought it was just nuts
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:14.080]  and you know what what i really like about my book the minister at goats is that it's sort of
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:18.240]  i think both sides get something out of it you know the skeptics like me get something out of it
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:23.920]  because it just shows how the foolish and absurd human behavior can be which is sort of an anti
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:29.840]  conspiratorial thought right because conspiracy theorists need to believe that people are so brilliant
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:34.000]  and so Machiavellian that they can plot these amazing conspiracies but but i think what the
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:38.480]  minister at goats says is that no people are just nuts trying to walk into walls and do all this
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:44.640]  kind of stuff however conspiracy theorists like you i'm also glad to say like the minister at goats
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:51.200]  because it does show that there's stuff going on as as you said behind the curtain but this the term
[3:40:51.200 --> 3:40:58.640]  conspiracy theorist is been produced and is employed to automatically say this person can't
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:03.600]  prove what they're talking about i was called a conspiracy theorist 10 years ago by several
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:08.480]  newspapers for saying the gulf of tonkin was staged to get us into vietnam it's now declassified
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:13.360]  it's now been declassified that the united states government created al-qaeda in the Taliban
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:18.880]  you can call me a conspiracy theorist i said the carbon tax would be used to set up a world
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:23.840]  government and to fund it and then it would come after a controlled economic collapse that's now
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:31.360]  mainstream news so i don't get into tuba cabras and aliens and dimensional gates and things i
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:37.840]  can't prove but then i get mixed in with the people that do cover things they can't prove but you
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:43.840]  know there's other conspiracy theorists that get hailed as our saviors take the cover of news week
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:50.880]  the thinking man's thinking man al gore's new plan for the planet a eco profit gets real
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:58.080]  and it goes into saying he's a prophet and his new film is about how it's a religion look
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:03.280]  look i happen to know there's not a consensus on man-made global warming i happen to know the
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:08.960]  majority of scientists say it's a fraud i happen to know carbon dioxide is in a toxic waste
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:15.920]  and then ice core samples show uh that the earth had much higher levels of carbon dioxide 200 000
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:22.160]  years ago i happen to know that until four years ago the ice caps of mars were getting smaller
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:27.840]  they're now getting bigger because the sun just cooled off into one of the most dormant cycles
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:34.400]  ever recorded in 300 years so i'm not the conspiracy theorist because i track what nasa says and what
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:40.480]  climatologist says and common sense when al gore points a camera at a polar bear and says polar
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:45.040]  bears can't swim they're dying when when they're the greatest land swimmer on earth and hunt from
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:52.720]  the ice flows i know it's a lie when they say my suv is melting ice caps on mars and on the moons
[3:42:52.720 --> 3:42:58.000]  of saturn and jupiter i know it's a load of crap not just because i empirically know with the evidence
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:03.280]  al gore and his people have written perspectives up how this is all just a big business to hijack
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:11.520]  control the entire planet john ronson well i haven't i haven't i really can't get me to
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:15.520]  refute all of that in the space of about 30 seconds i don't know if you have the floor
[3:43:15.520 --> 3:43:19.200]  hey too much no i'm not going to but i can ask you a completely different question can polar bear
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:25.120]  swim i have a real problem with the 9 11 truth thing i'm wondering are you oh wait wait is that
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:31.440]  against your religion in your religion or if you're a fake greenie do you believe that uh
[3:43:31.440 --> 3:43:38.640]  that polar bears can swim is the prophet wrong are we gonna have riots hold on are we gonna
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:44.080]  have riots in los angeles in francisco and london if i was to paint a picture of a bomb on his head
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:51.440]  uh there is only one prophet and there is only one god his prophet is is al gore
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:44:00.240]  well you know i like some okay well yeah as always you're kind of actually is is is stunning and
[3:44:00.240 --> 3:44:05.040]  it's something that i find kind of quite amazing about you but i can't answer oh come on one of the
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:09.200]  reasons why i can't answer that step is because frankly i don't think i've been so busy with
[3:44:09.200 --> 3:44:13.200]  with these other projects i'm working on how many looks into the whole global warming denial
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:18.400]  movement and i just don't feel in any way equipped to talk about it the denial movement okay you
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:22.320]  brought up 9 11 truth what's your problem with that i was just just when you were saying all of
[3:44:22.320 --> 3:44:25.280]  that stuff a little thought popped into my head and i've always wanted to know your response to
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:33.920]  this actually so i ask you it's built into the 9 11 truth belief is that you know the media the
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:39.840]  mainstream media people like me just wouldn't be interested you know we just don't want to reveal the
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.080]  truth of the matter because we're all sort of part of the you know part of the conspiracy
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:50.320]  and i think if there was any evidence if there was any clue that 9 11 was an inside job every
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:55.440]  single journalist in the world would just be jumping on that story really dying to yeah i yeah i'm
[3:44:55.440 --> 3:44:59.920]  absolutely certain that because it would be the world's greatest story you know okay so you're asking
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:05.760]  me a question yeah i'm asking the question that you know it's impossible to rationally believe
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:10.720]  the every journalist in the world who would have any kind of okay that's a statement that's a false
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:17.040]  statement the establishment selects and promotes journalists in the controlled left and controlled
[3:45:17.040 --> 3:45:23.040]  right paradigm that already fit into the world view and buy in to the official story and believe
[3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:29.120]  there's never anything behind curtains okay yeah but hold on hold on hold on there have been a lot
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:33.840]  of reporters that have gone public they've been ridiculed or fired underwriting laboratories
[3:45:33.840 --> 3:45:39.200]  kevin ryan got fired one of their chief engineers there are policemen on tapes and get back they're
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:44.720]  going to bring down seven uh the bbc reported building seven had fallen before it fell then
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:49.200]  they lied and said they didn't say it then they said oh it was an accident then they admitted
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:54.960]  roiders had given them that just like the news media printed that lee harvey oswald had been
[3:45:54.960 --> 3:46:00.560]  captured before his name was even out in dallas they got the names wrong because of time zones
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:07.520]  uh in asia that's confirmed uh when you look at norad standing down when you look at the hijackers
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:15.600]  trained at u.s military bases it actually was in ap roiders uh the san jose mercury news that the
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:20.960]  head colonel over the head base said look i trained hijackers at my base i don't know what happened
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:27.280]  but these guys were were working for the u.s government okay so i know a passport came out
[3:46:27.280 --> 3:46:32.320]  of one of the buildings unscathed and was found by the fbi in those hundreds of thousands of tons
[3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:38.640]  of wreckage that i mean come on john come on john i mean gulfa tonkin was staged it's not a conspiracy
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:43.680]  theory operation northwoods is declassified where the government planned nine eleven style attacks
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:48.640]  bubba all i'm saying is the look six of the ten commissioners have said the entire thing was a
[3:46:48.640 --> 3:46:53.760]  fraud and a cover-up why isn't that in the news more john granted it's been in the washington post
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:46:58.720]  but nothing ever happens well i sort of wish not i wish i wish i'm bought up nine eleven game
[3:46:58.720 --> 3:47:01.840]  because we've been you know the likes of me and the likes of you have been through this stuff is
[3:47:01.840 --> 3:47:05.440]  zillion times over the years but i still but i still don't don't think you answered like an
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:09.600]  original question which is that you know i i you know work within a world of the mainstream media
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:13.760]  especially on the left and i know that journalists on the left and journalists on the right would
[3:47:13.760 --> 3:47:20.160]  win a poll at sir the size of the building if they could somehow provide okay take mom got
[3:47:20.160 --> 3:47:24.720]  take take that mom be out guide to guardian one of your colleagues he writes articles a year ago
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:30.720]  saying i'm a cook there's no world government and then he publishes and signs a letter from 200
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:36.240]  top journalists calling for a one world government i mean they're intellectually bankrupt john
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:43.280]  i mean you can't have it both ways world government's good world government doesn't exist
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:49.040]  i'm not saying you're doing that i mean you at least admit they're saying it
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:54.320]  but if you were a good little globalist you'd come on here and say no alex doesn't exist
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:47:59.040]  and then write a book about how great world government is well as i said earlier in the
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:02.800]  interview about my view about world government is that i think it was that this kind of you know
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:07.040]  what they consider to be a kind of idealistic vision in the early 50s that sort of you know
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:14.080]  history shows has turned sour because what nobody expected was that ceo's would would you know behave
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:20.320]  in a in a psychopathic and selfish never never that hey hey listen the time we got left john
[3:48:20.320 --> 3:48:23.680]  ronston.com and i'm going to try to twist your arm for five more minutes after this
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:26.960]  break just the whole hour because this is too great having you on i want you to be able to
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:33.680]  ask me some questions too but did you get to meet george cloney or ewing McGregor or any of these
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:39.840]  great actors uh yeah good i did i went i went onto the set and i watched them film it for a few
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:45.200]  days in Puerto Rico and then i went around the various premiers you know in venice and and and
[3:48:45.200 --> 3:48:52.960]  canada and and uh london and toronto and uh so yeah i spent some time with them pretty nice guys i
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:49:00.080]  hear that they all were now do they think it's ridiculous or do any of them buy into this stuff
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:06.720]  well um i think the only person well the only two people i know who like in the kind of core of the
[3:49:06.720 --> 3:49:12.000]  movie he did believe in the paranormal stuff uh with jeff bridges i mean he's he's certainly a
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:17.280]  believer and he's got on very well with jim chanon who's the real guy who he plays in the movie uh
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:23.520]  and grand tesloff the director uh he says even though he has never seen any paranormal stuff
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:28.160]  happening you know he wants to believe that it that it can and actually i think a lot of the
[3:49:28.160 --> 3:49:31.680]  people who like the movie like it because it's got a sort of warm heart to it and it's got a
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:37.280]  humanity to it whereas my book is a bit more sort of cynical all right shifting gears quickly in in
[3:49:37.280 --> 3:49:41.840]  in case you can't because i know you got family hold over another five to finish up tell me about
[3:49:41.840 --> 3:49:48.000]  them right here with me oh then you mean about the movie yes yeah well it got optioned you know
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:53.280]  back in about five years ago at the same time as the menace don'ts got optioned and you know
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:59.200]  nothing's really happened since and you know that out there jack black was attached to to be in it um
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:05.120]  but you know god knows you know edga who's supposed to be directing us is directing another movie at
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:09.280]  the moment and i just i just hope that you know when he finishes his other movie he turns his
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:15.520]  attention to the wonderful you know project that is then but you know i can't force him as much as
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:20.720]  i like to well i think the fact that one of your books has already been made into a major movie
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:24.640]  and doing quite well at the box office i would hope that that would because even though it's
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:30.480]  going to be a huge hit piece i would uh i would like to know what they're writing i mean if my
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:34.800]  character is going to be in there and what great evil type of person i'm going to be in them in
[3:50:34.800 --> 3:50:39.280]  the movie them if that does happen well i think if it does happen and if there is a character
[3:50:39.280 --> 3:50:45.600]  in that that's kind of inspired by you uh you will love it i think i think it will be a completely
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:51.360]  lovely uh portrayal because you know movies especially these kinds of movies you know they
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:57.600]  don't want to sort of just attack people you know i think you'd be delighted by portraying this
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:01.040]  say one john stay there i want to come back and talk about what you're doing in the future then

[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:30.160]  writing for other big publications here in the us two best-selling books everything you do hits the
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:36.560]  zeitgeist what's coming up next for john ronson well i'm writing another book but i can't really
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:42.720]  talk about what it's about i'm i'm worried that if too much information gets disseminated then
[3:54:42.720 --> 3:54:47.440]  it's going to be hard for me to get you know access to things and so on but you know i'm writing a
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:53.440]  good new book can i just say at risk of setting you off on a very very long monologue can i just
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:59.760]  can i just read out a tweet that i just got from somebody sure okay actually mom bio was referring
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:07.600]  to a will counsel to solve environmental issues not a one-world government who said that uh a
[3:55:07.600 --> 3:55:14.160]  tweeter who follows me called socialist scully socialist sully i guess that that his his tweeting
[3:55:14.160 --> 3:55:20.640]  name probably will put you off look look look here's the deal builder bird controlled public
[3:55:20.640 --> 3:55:24.800]  they're laughing in the control room look i'm tired of the crap there's a world government
[3:55:24.800 --> 3:55:30.720]  being set up and the same reporters that attack me then write articles saying how great it is
[3:55:30.720 --> 3:55:35.840]  and no mom biot said we need a world government to solve our problems and then this liberal
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:41.440]  who's a fake twisted and goes he's not for world government he's for a loving world government
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:47.760]  it's not loving did you see the article that was written in the financial times of london
[3:55:47.760 --> 3:55:54.080]  where it called for a tyrannical world government no but god that sounds like a very aggressive
[3:55:54.080 --> 3:55:59.040]  journalist guys pull it up pull it up it's it's it's and now for world government
[3:55:59.760 --> 3:56:05.680]  ft.com well the financial times said this time we had a tyrannical world government
[3:56:08.880 --> 3:56:13.840]  that's so my son is really laughing because that sounds like the most horrible article ever
[3:56:13.840 --> 3:56:21.040]  that he said he said yes it's been secret yes we kept it secret from you it's called and now for
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:29.120]  world government by gideon reikman but he said it's got to be authoritarian for your own good
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:36.160]  what's wrong with that by the way i think he's one of the editors there i am interested by the way
[3:56:36.160 --> 3:56:40.080]  in the in the kind of notion of authoritarianism and that is something i'm looking at in a new book
