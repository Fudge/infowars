[01:01.520 --> 01:07.520]  of the film cartel land that's one of the most daring documentaries i've ever

[01:15.920 --> 01:22.200]  sundan sundance film festival best documentary award as well he will be
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.560]  joining us coming up to look at what could happen in america what's already
[01:26.560 --> 01:31.040]  happening in the united states under this phony drug war we'll have strong
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.880]  criticisms of the drug war and strike directly at the root of it that is
[01:35.880 --> 01:42.000]  helping degenerate our society into a dark-age bedlam bonnie harry's launching
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.800]  a new initiative today the food babe and we've got a bunch of news we're going
[01:45.800 --> 01:49.520]  to break down on the fight for health freedom the fight be able to choose the
[01:49.520 --> 01:55.080]  food we eat and labeling a lot of breaking news on that front that said
[01:55.080 --> 02:03.840]  interspersed with those guests today i'm lining up right now either at the
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.920]  bottom of this hour or in the fourth hour during overdrive and if not tomorrow
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.480]  a gentleman that comes highly recommended by sheriff richard mac and by
[02:12.480 --> 02:20.960]  others who is running for sheriff down in houston in harris county and he can
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.960]  give us the inside scoop on exactly what's going on down there with this
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.680]  police officer the sheriff's deputy that was shot dead friday and it took the
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.840]  mainstream media until today to even begin to say oh it might have been
[02:33.840 --> 02:41.880]  racially motivated this is all the white house this is all msnbc mtv pushing
[02:41.880 --> 02:49.800]  this and triggering mentally ill people to take action and it goes both ways we
[02:49.800 --> 02:57.600]  saw the attack that took place with roof in charleston killing nine people and as
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.640]  this tit for tat begins to snowball it can get out of control very very
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.320]  quickly but why would the social engineers be pushing this obviously it's
[03:08.320 --> 03:14.480]  divide and conquer but more importantly they want a brand revolution not as
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.960]  going after criminals in government not in actually going for the head of the
[03:18.960 --> 03:26.800]  snake that's above obama the offshore central banks but to then have revolution
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.920]  be focused on the average cop on the beat and that's because a revolution
[03:31.920 --> 03:40.720]  pointed at the police will fail because it's not a just revolution shooting
[03:40.720 --> 03:48.280]  people in the back is discrediting it's murderous it's pathetic I don't care if
[03:48.280 --> 03:54.240]  it's a crazed psycho cop or a crazed psycho racist black guy white guy whatever
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.640]  on its face I'll have no part of that revolution I will have part in the new
[03:59.640 --> 04:07.000]  renaissance and a rediscovery of what made civilizations great I know the
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.680]  ideas I promote will win the fight for the hearts and minds all I need is a
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.200]  chance to present them to the public and we'll win that's why they fight tooth
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.600]  and nail that's what the Clinton White House paper show at their library that
[04:21.600 --> 04:27.240]  world that daily sued and got last year that they're obsessed with stopping
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.800]  alternative thought controlling the alternative left controlling the
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.280]  alternative right to stagnate debate and shut down free speech and that's what
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.360]  political correctness is all about so when we come back the latest here's from
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.600]  the London Guardian central banks can't save the markets from a crash and they
[04:46.600 --> 04:51.760]  shouldn't even try all this and more straight ahead I'm Alex Jones this is

[05:26.520 --> 05:32.040]  are we really more free when the Persian army demanded king Leonidas and his

[08:39.880 --> 08:45.480]  revolution in their hearts the children start to march
[08:45.480 --> 08:53.160]  George Soros is directing them problem reaction solution welcome ladies and
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.240]  gentlemen welcome thank you for joining us on this 31st day of August 2015 this
[08:58.240 --> 09:05.880]  Monday transmission we're gonna do a fourth hour of overdrive today within
[09:05.880 --> 09:10.640]  the next two weeks we're gonna launch the fourth hour live every day co-hosted
[09:10.640 --> 09:17.160]  by myself most days but many days it will be my reporters their guest special
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.160]  guest and others co-hosting the fourth hour that will be a roundup of news the
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.680]  latest breaking news video clips special reports it's gonna be very very
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.400]  powerful and I'm just getting the reporters warmed up to it I mean they
[09:34.400 --> 09:38.400]  like the idea but I'm getting them eased in to the deep water of live radio
[09:38.400 --> 09:44.760]  slash TV by having different reporters host the show so the fourth hour will be
[09:44.760 --> 09:50.800]  hosted by Jacari Jackson and Joe Biggs the dynamic duo today and I was going
[09:50.800 --> 09:56.960]  to have this sheriff's candidate down in Harris County down in Houston on my
[09:56.960 --> 10:04.680]  shelf but I thought why not just get him on with these guys and of course Richard
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.480]  Mack he comes highly recommended from Richard Mack from a lot of other folks
[10:08.480 --> 10:13.400]  if you go to his website he's a former Marine police officer you name it Carl
[10:13.400 --> 10:19.160]  Pittman he's got the endorsement of Sheriff Arpaio and he is running for
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.520]  sheriff down there in the county where the sheriff's deputy in the very sheriff
[10:24.520 --> 10:31.760]  department he's running for was just executed Darren go forth so I've been
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.360]  talking via text with Carl Pittman and it comes highly recommended from retired
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.600]  Army Colonel filmmaker Chuck undersea as well knows him it was Chuck put me in
[10:40.600 --> 10:43.920]  contact with him yesterday so it looks like we're gonna have Carl Pittman on
[10:43.920 --> 10:47.480]  either in the fourth hour today or tomorrow the reason I'm excited about it
[10:47.480 --> 10:57.120]  is he sounds acts just like a David Clark a really smart focus patriotic not
[10:57.120 --> 11:00.880]  left not right a constitutionalist says he wants to restore the Bill of Rights
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.520]  and Constitution that's the type of sheriffs and police chiefs we need in
[11:05.520 --> 11:13.000]  this country not little federal minions that basically just repeat all Southern
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  Poverty Law Center garbage because make no mistake George Soros is overthrown
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.280]  more than 15 countries in the last 30 years the last one was Ukraine two years
[11:24.280 --> 11:31.360]  ago George Soros has openly tried to crash the US dollar repeatedly on record
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.080]  he's proud of it George Soros is a wanted man in multiple European countries
[11:37.080 --> 11:44.440]  George Soros is funding the racist kill the cops kill the white people black
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.400]  lives matter movement that is being given so much attention and support by
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.760]  the White House and that's being done to build revolution as attacking local
[11:55.760 --> 12:02.440]  government so the feds can come in as the Savior period this is a destabilization
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.960]  operation in many departments are intimidated by this so they're rolling
[12:07.960 --> 12:10.880]  over and telling the feds you come in and you tell us how to run our
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.760]  operations and you tell us how to hire and who to fire and we'll do whatever you
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.600]  say and basically become federalized and embed BATF agents in every major unit
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.480]  I mean it's a nightmare scenario it's happening right now and this is the
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.160]  intimidation this is the political correctness this is the takeover are
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.040]  there problems in departments across the country absolutely is there
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.960]  militarization that's a problem absolutely but it's the globalist that
[12:37.960 --> 12:44.200]  set up that culture shut it up to fail give them all the federal riot gear the
[12:44.200 --> 12:49.600]  m-wraps the sound cannons the microwave guns and then tell them the tea party and
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.000]  veterans of the enemy and then they have the media promote some isolated but
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.480]  truly disgusting events and very questionable events of police officers
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.560]  killing innocent people and then they project that and make it racial wrapped
[13:05.560 --> 13:15.400]  up in class envy a classic bona fide 110 percent destabilization communist
[13:15.400 --> 13:19.040]  tactic and if you look at where Obama and Reverend Wright and all these people
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.280]  come from it is directly out of the communist manifesto it is directly out
[13:24.280 --> 13:28.960]  of Bill Ayers it is directly out of rules for radicals Saul Alinsky who
[13:28.960 --> 13:34.000]  dedicated his book to Lucifer who Hillary Clinton wrote a bunch of letters to
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.040]  praising his tactics how did Obama get his cousin Odinga the prime
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.880]  ministership of Kenya there was no such thing as a Prime Minister ship was an
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.400]  elected president when he and his Muslim minority couldn't get elected
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.840]  president Obama told him in an open letter start riots don't stop and they
[13:52.840 --> 13:56.320]  will give you a position in the government and they did that's what
[13:56.320 --> 14:02.960]  these tactics are is terrorism don't use that term lightly and bullying true
[14:02.960 --> 14:10.520]  terrorism is violence or the threat of violence for a political or economic
[14:10.520 --> 14:19.920]  aim look up the classic definition and that's what you'll find and this is
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.600]  horribly evil people with unbelievable wealth George Soros isn't just worth 10
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.200]  billion folks he's got accounts all over the world he's well known to be one of
[14:29.200 --> 14:34.160]  these shadow elites and I use Soros because he's the he's the most visible
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.800]  arrogant head of all this but beneath that beneath that iceberg tip there's a
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.520]  giant organization the Ford Foundation the Carnegie Endowment the Bill
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.680]  Melinda Gates Foundation with Warren Buffett there is all the acorn type
[14:52.680 --> 14:59.160]  groups and organizations battleground Texas all these groups are pushing for
[14:59.160 --> 15:10.080]  a cultural clash are pushing for a major crisis out of which the feds
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.720]  themselves controlled by offshore interest can come in as the saviors and
[15:13.720 --> 15:21.480]  again Forbes says that Soros is worth $24 billion and then it gets into how
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.480]  George Soros is the winner of Obama's war on coal shutting down almost half our
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.720]  coal power plants turns out Soros is invested in the alternatives to that
[15:30.720 --> 15:37.720]  see how these people operate they are mafia kingpins who else could be a
[15:37.720 --> 15:44.240]  Nazi collaborator a hound sniffing out hidden Jews and teaching the Nazis the
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.440]  Jewish tactics to hide their wealth and escape but George Soros when he was 14
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.760]  15 and 16 and then not getting in trouble and basically running the
[15:53.760 --> 16:01.480]  Democratic Party today it's outrageous and you don't hear a word from the
[16:01.480 --> 16:04.840]  Jewish organizations about it because they're bought and paid for and
[16:04.840 --> 16:14.000]  controlled by the very same interest it's sickening truly sickening I mean I've
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.880]  got more videos we could play for you I've seen more than 20 black lives
[16:20.880 --> 16:27.240]  matters videos from Texas and New York and Missouri where they say pigs in a
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.480]  blanket only good pigs have wings let's give pigs wings that means angels you
[16:32.480 --> 16:40.040]  kill them outright chance deck the halls with dead cops fall a la la la la and then
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.440]  the cops are being shot they are being killed on a weekly basis when they're in
[16:44.440 --> 16:48.440]  their patrol cars when they're pumping gas when they're at accident scenes and
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.520]  all that's going to make the police do is freak out even more and get even more
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.920]  paranoid of people in general but black folks particularly to where they will
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.960]  slow roll and will not respond in your neighborhoods and you'll be fed on by
[17:01.960 --> 17:07.680]  criminals and yes they will then be paranoid and will lash out and will be
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.920]  heavy-handed and it will create incredible friction and divide and conquer
[17:11.920 --> 17:17.480]  that'll be visited upon innocent people and that's exactly what George Soros and
[17:17.480 --> 17:21.000]  the Democrats want because that will then drive you even more to the
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.560]  Democratic Party's rebranding as a pure racial organization like they were in
[17:26.560 --> 17:30.680]  the days of the Klan but this time for black people Hispanics and others and
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.200]  they'll coddle and they'll have TV shows about how your victims and how they're
[17:35.200 --> 17:38.360]  going to get the bad cops and how they're going to federalize them when the
[17:38.360 --> 17:44.240]  whole time they played the entire paradigm and there is a new video out
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.680]  today black lives matter chant called disgusting by police leader CBS News
[17:50.680 --> 17:58.280]  Minnesota David Clark and they marched yesterday and chanted pigs in a blanket
[17:58.280 --> 18:04.680]  fry them like bacon what officers and others say they find offensive is also
[18:04.680 --> 18:13.720]  particular free speech when you start saying kill people which some of these
[18:13.720 --> 18:21.160]  groups actually said we you know we need to see dead cops when that gets pushed
[18:21.160 --> 18:28.240]  it is no longer free speech but all that has to happen is the police have to
[18:28.240 --> 18:31.840]  realize that they need to get their house in order in many cases they
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.520]  understand they've been set up they don't understand that globalization is here
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.920]  the local takeover of states counties and cities is here and the social
[18:40.920 --> 18:50.200]  engineers need to have a way to again brand the civil war they're going to
[18:50.200 --> 18:54.720]  start as racially based and then that's the smoke screen for the UN and the
[18:54.720 --> 19:01.160]  globalist in phase two to come in with the new reconciliation UN run government
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.680]  which is actually being proposed right now to have the UN come in oversee our
[19:05.680 --> 19:10.560]  elections open our borders up the popes coming to speak probably in the middle of
[19:10.560 --> 19:16.840]  more stock market collapse more racial tension you can see all this being being
[19:16.840 --> 19:23.680]  lined up right now and just last week two cops got shot and killed in racially
[19:23.680 --> 19:29.800]  motivated activity is clear and we see the reporter and the cameraman killed
[19:29.800 --> 19:34.200]  and the guy wants to start a race war he says and the media won't even call it
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.120]  racially based can you imagine of a white guy went and did this you never
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.720]  hear the end of it which we didn't with a charlton situation which again he said
[19:42.720 --> 19:47.600]  he was doing it because of the race war that he saw from his perspective from
[19:47.600 --> 19:53.400]  MSNBC so they're triggering both sides to do this it's an example of mass
[19:53.400 --> 19:59.840]  mind control we'll be back and tell you where it's all going stay with us honey
[19:59.840 --> 20:03.520]  why are there fish swimming in our bathtub aren't they cute you need more

[23:55.880 --> 24:23.320]  and take it. One of the chants heard from protesters is being called
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.520]  disgusting by rank and file St. Paul police officers police Federation
[24:27.520 --> 24:31.880]  leaders say the threatening refrain is divisive and dangerous and won't lead
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.920]  to improve police relations as Bill Hudson explains March organizers say
[24:35.920 --> 24:42.820]  they're not about to apologize. By most accounts it was a peaceful march down
[24:42.820 --> 24:47.480]  Snelling Avenue though intended to disrupt leisure to deliver a message of
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.200]  justice. We weren't surprised that it was peaceful but we were glad that
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.760]  everything worked out right. But along the way protesters broke into a pointed
[24:55.760 --> 25:04.200]  refrain. What some may find offensive is also free speech what's ironic here is
[25:04.200 --> 25:09.200]  that marchers were being protected by the very officers targeted in the chant.
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.160]  Statements and chants like that are just ignorant you know I find it absolutely
[25:13.160 --> 25:18.160]  disgusting. Officer Dave Titus heads the St. Paul Police Federation he called it
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.880]  dangerous and outrageous rhetoric especially coming just hours after a
[25:22.880 --> 25:30.720]  Texas deputy was gunned down in cold blood. I don't think chanting or you know
[25:30.720 --> 25:37.040]  singing chants that are basically promoting killing police officers is
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.200]  peaceful. March organizer Rashad Turner says there's a big difference between
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.800]  words and actions. It definitely wasn't a threat you not enough they would have
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.040]  received it differently if we just said maybe on a stick or something like that
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.200]  but you know we're out there chaining we're using our voices. Rhetoric that
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.600]  doesn't appear to have stopped with a march. That's enough. A couple of words or
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.600]  one. All right and that is some of the mild stuff that's being pushed but but
[26:01.600 --> 26:05.720]  here's the deal. These Black Lives Matter groups are useful idiots. They're
[26:05.720 --> 26:09.720]  run by the social engineers at the Ford Foundation, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.760]  the White House, Hillary, they're all connected. George Soros funds the whole
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.200]  thing. This is meant to create bad race relations. We are in a restaurant or
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.880]  drive down the road people beating on your car blocking the road. I mean we've
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.600]  had some of the Black Lives Matter thug types black and white show up and
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.880]  threaten to attack our reporters. Reporters have been attacked all over the
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.840]  country including black reporters. It's an excuse to go out and act like thugs
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.120]  and I'll just say it you look at the actual Black Lives Matter group not
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.360]  protesters against police brutality or problems they're very legitimate. I'll be
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.200]  honest it looks like a bunch of lazy stupid super overweight dumb couch
[26:48.200 --> 26:53.240]  potatoes and I'm not attacking folks to get overweight but on average those
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.520]  people probably weighed 350 pounds in Minnesota. I mean they've been sitting
[26:57.520 --> 27:05.000]  around on a couch on welfare watching TV all day watching MSNBC actually
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.080]  believing white people are hiding under the table they're gonna come out and
[27:08.080 --> 27:14.680]  kill them and it's just so sad to watch these spoiled brats who are entitled
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.920]  including all little white politically correct yuppies that have I've seen in
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.120]  countless videos you know chanting deck the halls with dead cops and pigs in a
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.880]  blanket you know fry them like bacon and I see the comments online the tweets
[27:28.880 --> 27:33.840]  time to start busting caps in them time to start killing cops you know people
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.960]  praise on Twitter. Watson's on vacation for the next week but if our riders want
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.160]  to go to Twitter that's a story right there I saw it this morning and this
[27:43.160 --> 27:46.320]  weekend I forgot to tell you people praising the dead cop that'll teach
[27:46.320 --> 27:49.880]  these cops how to behave no it won't it'll make the cops become more
[27:49.880 --> 27:59.440]  militaristic more paranoid. Again the central government wants to start a
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.680]  race war in this country as I've been saying for many years and they're gonna
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.200]  start it right when the economic collapse starts to act like the
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.200]  collapse is caused by the riots by the destabilization they'll also probably
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.880]  start a foreign war right when the collapse comes notice what's happening
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.080]  off the coast of China notice what's happening in North Korea notice what's
[28:19.080 --> 28:22.560]  happening in Ukraine notice what's happening in Georgia right now the
[28:22.560 --> 28:29.320]  world is moving into chaos by design and that's why I get so upset we need to
[28:29.320 --> 28:36.440]  stop this this is stupid all lives matter and all black lives matter you
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.680]  want to get upset about some dead black people maybe a couple hundred black
[28:41.680 --> 28:44.640]  people get shot and killed in questionable circumstances by the
[28:44.640 --> 28:52.920]  police and that's too many but I mean we've talked about it 50 plus percent of
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.720]  black people never get born in this country they get aborted and they're
[28:55.720 --> 29:02.160]  targeted for that but I can't get any of these leftist black people to care
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.600]  because it's too much fun to tune into Al Sharpton and to be manipulated to be
[29:07.600 --> 29:14.240]  played with to be absolutely scammed and for the police as well I'm gonna talk
[29:14.240 --> 29:22.000]  about this in the second hour drug culture is bad drugs attract bad people
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  it's got a lot of bad things connected to it and by making drugs illegal in the
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.880]  30s it made it lucrative it made it criminal and it made it get worse and
[29:32.880 --> 29:40.240]  no one can deny that criminal central banks are shipping drugs in and using
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.720]  the drug war to corrupt the police so we'll talk about problems with the
[29:43.720 --> 29:48.440]  police in the second hour okay but the answer is not randomly shooting cops
[29:48.440 --> 29:57.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.600 --> 30:02.800]  here's a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs cocaine production
[30:02.800 --> 30:07.120]  plummets after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website theantimedia.org
[30:07.120 --> 30:10.440]  according to data released by the United Nations cocaine production in that
[30:10.440 --> 30:14.200]  country declined by 11% in the past year making the fourth year in a row of
[30:14.200 --> 30:17.680]  steady decrease it was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.400]  Bolivia and only three years after that progress was finally made the strategy
[30:21.400 --> 30:24.960]  employed by the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.160]  did not involve strong armed police state tactics instead they work to find
[30:29.160 --> 30:32.400]  alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more
[30:32.400 --> 30:36.360]  money Bolivia has adopted a policy where coca cultivation is allowed in
[30:36.360 --> 30:40.280]  traditional areas alongside alternative development and others said Antonio
[30:40.280 --> 30:43.880]  de Leo from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime the US is still involved in
[30:43.880 --> 30:46.880]  Afghanistan and look at the heroin production coming out of that area it
[30:46.880 --> 30:50.640]  has skyrocketed is the United States really against the war on drugs or is
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.160]  it just against the people who use them Rob do reporting for info wars dot com

[33:13.240 --> 33:33.000]  choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones I have worked tirelessly for 20
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.800]  years to fight the construction of the police state to stop the globalization
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.200]  of the federal government and the globalization of local police through
[33:43.200 --> 33:50.000]  the federal government we did succeed in forming the public of the danger but
[33:50.000 --> 33:59.640]  we failed in stopping the transformation but just as homeland security was set up
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.680]  to supposedly protect us from al-qaeda now our government openly funds al-qaeda
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.880]  and ISIS and tells us that homeland security is mainly for veterans gun
[34:09.880 --> 34:16.440]  owners in the tea party and Christians and the IRS publicly openly nakedly
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.000]  targets and persecutes Christians second amendment groups veterans groups
[34:21.000 --> 34:32.800]  there is a war on veterans on police on gun owners on property owners on
[34:32.800 --> 34:41.080]  Christians on libertarians because we aren't compatible with this new
[34:41.080 --> 34:50.440]  collectivist world government system and that's why it's so wonderful to have
[34:50.440 --> 34:56.280]  all of these different black sheriffs and people running for sheriff around the
[34:56.280 --> 35:05.120]  country who happen to be black because it absolutely sabotages the narrative
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.440]  that if you're a quote minority you can't be in the liberty movement plus
[35:10.440 --> 35:14.760]  I've heard this particular man running for sheriff down in Houston give a
[35:14.760 --> 35:22.720]  speech and I mean David Clark gives a better speech than I'd say a Richard
[35:22.720 --> 35:28.280]  Mack it's not because they're black it's because they really get what's going on
[35:28.280 --> 35:37.680]  and they come across really strong because if we ever get the people out
[35:37.680 --> 35:43.560]  there that love liberty together it's over for the globalist and I know that's
[35:43.560 --> 35:49.520]  obvious but that's why they're pushing racial division it's so disgusting how
[35:49.520 --> 35:56.840]  how how naked it is the word is naked it's so obvious they're doing it they
[35:56.840 --> 36:04.240]  admit they're doing it it's so diabolical it's criminal it is sedition to
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.360]  spend thirty three million dollars in Ferguson alone in the last year and a
[36:09.360 --> 36:22.000]  half to have sorrows combined with the media openly trying to create just
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.400]  absolute hysterical feverish hatred at at at injustice that is blown out of
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.360]  proportion towards the only issue in the world and then to point that
[36:35.360 --> 36:42.080]  politically at local government it's so crystal-clear what this is meant to do
[36:42.480 --> 36:48.200]  and it lets you know that we have seen only the beginning can you imagine with
[36:48.200 --> 36:53.360]  the Obamacare and the borders open and the power plants getting shut off and
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.240]  the attacks on the Second Amendment outside of law and the funding of ISIS
[36:58.240 --> 37:05.240]  in al-Qaeda and the world government being announced the lawlessness of the
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.800]  people that have grabbed control of our government why are they now in a
[37:10.800 --> 37:16.360]  campaign demonizing state government because they know when things get really
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.680]  bad the avenue to stop it will be the states getting together and saying no
[37:20.680 --> 37:24.680]  to the captured federal government they know that's the main constitutional
[37:24.680 --> 37:29.120]  avenue and so they're already preparing it like it's Civil War two in the
[37:29.120 --> 37:36.000]  narrative where the average Democrat that you talked to think 1776 was when
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.960]  the South was defeated or when Hitler was defeated people think for the July
[37:42.960 --> 37:47.480]  we've gone out in Austin we've gone out in California and trendies believe that
[37:47.480 --> 37:54.680]  that the American consciousness is the Civil War or is World War two and then
[37:54.680 --> 38:01.720]  they project our war with the Nazis back on to America and imply that the
[38:01.720 --> 38:07.840]  police and white people are all Nazis this is the Hollywood narrative and it's
[38:07.840 --> 38:18.560]  so incredibly ash backwards but when you've got an ignorant public that can't
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.960]  tell you the three branches of government that can't tell you the state
[38:20.960 --> 38:27.720]  capital on average they can't tell you who the vice president is in many cases
[38:27.720 --> 38:34.840]  there's a new video on info wars calm that mark dice went out and it shot in
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.360]  Southern California where people believe the Loch Ness monster has been
[38:40.360 --> 38:47.960]  captured and is being held at SeaWorld this is the same place he goes to the
[38:47.960 --> 38:56.400]  university into the beachfront boardwalk or eight out of ten people say put gun
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.240]  owners in forced labor camps or eight out of ten people say ban the bill of
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.840]  rights for Hillary and these aren't people that can't speak English these
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.400]  are articulate people he goes yeah we want to put them in you know forced
[39:09.400 --> 39:12.640]  labor camps and take their guns and imprison them and the Democrat guy goes
[39:12.640 --> 39:19.840]  you don't tell me buddy I'm ready these are folks lusting after power lusting
[39:19.840 --> 39:28.320]  after political correctness and they will do whatever they're told by the
[39:28.320 --> 39:34.760]  establishment because they don't have a worldview they regurgitate whatever
[39:34.760 --> 39:41.640]  they're told and more and more of this country is filled with people like this
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.360]  who are just a tomatons who want to sit on the couch and get their welfare check
[39:47.360 --> 39:56.640]  all day that's the pressure from below and the pressure from above the pressure
[39:56.640 --> 40:06.600]  being driven down by the less than one tenth of 1% of the ultra rich to play
[40:06.600 --> 40:12.320]  the giant unwashed mass off against the liberty the property the engine of
[40:12.320 --> 40:18.280]  freedom that's left in this country this is a consolidation war and it's so
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.200]  essential for viewers to understand this is not talk this is not hyperbole this
[40:24.200 --> 40:33.440]  is not talking points or rhetoric I do not have the vocabulary to describe to
[40:33.440 --> 40:44.240]  you how real this is and how diabolical this is and how serious this is the
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.520]  globalist plan to bring in another 30 40 50 million illegals baptize them into
[40:48.520 --> 40:54.640]  socialist communist ideology Bill Ayers, Bernadine Smith, Saul Alinsky ideology
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.320]  they will stage terror attacks they will blame it on the liberty movement and
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.040]  they will have a purge and they will arrest hundreds of thousands of
[41:04.040 --> 41:09.280]  veterans police patriots you name it if we don't get involved and get aggressive
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.280]  that's where they want to take us they say they want to arrest us they say they
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.040]  want to come after us they say they want to kill us and this happens in most
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.320]  other countries when they become corrupt and collapse why then don't people
[41:23.320 --> 41:30.000]  understand it's happening here they hate better clingers but if we use their
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.320]  attack to wake people up we can rally humanity and absolutely defeat them
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.480]  politically and we're on the verge of that right now they can feel it they
[41:39.480 --> 41:46.840]  can see it that's why you're seeing a bum rush to the finish line pulling out
[41:46.840 --> 41:53.680]  every stop and we can't be mad at these zombies that think the Loch Ness monster
[41:53.680 --> 42:01.280]  was captured or who don't know what the 4th of July is almost everyone he talked
[42:01.280 --> 42:04.360]  to what's for the July it's when we succeeded and then defeated the South
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.720]  it's when we beat Hitler that's because that's not taught that's not in the
[42:09.720 --> 42:18.400]  culture that's not promoted it's those ideas that then or the fruit of more
[42:18.400 --> 42:26.240]  equality later I want to go to this piece I'm going to the economic news it's
[42:26.240 --> 42:36.200]  just the fact that we're getting police shot every week sometimes every day and
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.520]  we've got camera people getting killed and and reporters getting killed and
[42:41.520 --> 42:48.120]  it's all basically racially motivated and you've got a dig in the media to even
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.240]  find where it's being said Sheriff blames anti-police rhetoric for killing of
[42:52.240 --> 43:00.000]  white police officer well it's beyond anti-police it's racist it's being
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.240]  pushed and this young man who was obviously had problems was manipulated
[43:04.240 --> 43:14.240]  into believing he was doing something valiant and you've got folks saying oh
[43:14.240 --> 43:23.760]  we're just joking talking about killing police it's all just free speech and now
[43:23.760 --> 43:27.960]  this gentleman will be sent to death row undoubtedly and spend 20 years waiting
[43:27.960 --> 43:36.320]  to be given lethal injection but let's go to this marked ice piece then we're
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.800]  gonna come back and get into central banks can't save the markets from a
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.920]  crash they shouldn't even try here is the marked ice piece probably saw on the
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.920]  news that this morning the hunters did capture what they have called the
[43:50.920 --> 43:56.000]  Loch Ness monster Nessie really and we're we're just asking people if they
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.920]  think you Nessie should be set free is that really fair to keep her in
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.880]  captivity like this no I think they should just let Nessie free I mean well
[44:04.880 --> 44:08.160]  supposedly if they found her like that's messed up to keep an animal like
[44:08.160 --> 44:13.040]  probably didn't check the news it's no yeah it's like it's I mean there's
[44:13.040 --> 44:16.960]  occasionally the marine biologists will find these old animals that have
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.920]  thought to been extinct and so they they did capture the Loch Ness monster 17
[44:21.920 --> 44:28.800]  foot long and a lot of people are saying that it's it's really unfair to keep
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.760]  Nessie in captivity these people will sign it back into the wild yeah yeah I
[44:33.760 --> 44:36.480]  think because it's like you know animal rights like it's the same thing as
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.200]  humans like let them be free you know it's like not right as I said that to
[44:41.200 --> 44:47.120]  keep you know a special being like a special animal like it like keeping and
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.360]  like show them off to people it's like no let the animal be free and let you know
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.920]  other people enjoy the view and let you know it doesn't be in nature basically
[44:54.920 --> 44:59.320]  so what's your reaction to the discovery and the capture I'm actually
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.960]  surprised because I didn't even know it because I'm not from here so I never
[45:01.960 --> 45:06.720]  really watched near the news and I'm just surprised that they found Loch Ness
[45:06.720 --> 45:15.240]  monster but yeah that's what we thought to firm authentic today a
[45:15.240 --> 45:20.800]  platysaurus dwelling deep within the waters of the lock really captured this
[45:20.800 --> 45:25.920]  morning really getting people's reactions to this historic find they should
[45:25.920 --> 45:31.520]  turn it loose and leave it alone yeah Peter is demanding that Nessie be set
[45:31.520 --> 45:37.440]  free immediately you agree with their states yes I mean it's a wild animal
[45:37.440 --> 45:40.880]  just like any other animal there's probably another one out there
[45:40.880 --> 45:48.000]  well his wife or her husband yeah yeah you know it's kind of funny how men
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  dust things sometimes we're just doing everything they see something they don't
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.960]  understand and what do they do with it they grab it drag it away and put it
[45:55.960 --> 46:04.760]  in a zoo yeah so we're gonna free free messy you agree I agree thank you on the
[46:04.760 --> 46:14.400]  news today that they actually I can't do this in the straight face well we were
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.880]  gonna try to tell you that they found the Loch Ness monster to see what your
[46:18.880 --> 46:22.240]  reactions were but I can't hold her couldn't hold a straight face so we're
[46:22.240 --> 46:27.760]  gonna go talk to someone thank you so a lot of people are are calling for Nessie's
[46:27.760 --> 46:33.280]  return into the wild absolutely in Loch Ness do you think it's unfair to keep
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.440]  her in captivity after she was free all these years to roam absolutely how
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.240]  SeaWorld deals with their orcas in general is disgusting watch blackfish
[46:43.240 --> 46:47.320]  it's really eye-opening well this isn't an extremely endangered species we're
[46:47.320 --> 46:53.000]  talking about the worst the only one really known in existence is it fair
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.760]  to to study her or pause again these people are actually smart compared to
[46:58.760 --> 47:01.880]  the usual ones because at least they have an argument for why it's showing how
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.040]  gullible they are and how they'll sign on to anything but they've got all these
[47:06.040 --> 47:09.840]  movies coming out about bullying of handicapped kids and stuff and then I
[47:09.840 --> 47:12.760]  was researching them there's three major movies coming out in the next year
[47:12.760 --> 47:15.840]  about this documentaries well two of our documentaries one of them is a film
[47:15.840 --> 47:21.360]  based on true story and all of it at the end is financed by Soros groups to ban
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.000]  free speech and get hate speech bills passed where if someone says what you
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.280]  said hurts their feelings then you don't have free speech and you notice the
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.280]  feds have directed the cops to try to like stop people filming in public as
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.240]  well that violates the First Amendment so there's this major war on legitimate
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.280]  free speech and it's done with this whole politically correct backdrop you can
[47:45.280 --> 47:49.240]  see the whole video at info wars.com Loch Ness Monster found and captured
[47:49.240 --> 47:56.400]  alive absolutely ridiculous and again we're just illustrating absurdity there
[47:56.400 --> 48:01.280]  another report Obama has declared open season on cops University of Texas removes
[48:01.280 --> 48:07.360]  Jefferson Davis Woodrow Wilson statues Obama has renamed a mountain from a US
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.880]  president to a native name and again it can sound nice on the surface but that's
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.280]  what communist regimes do is start renaming everything I mean this is this
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.880]  is this is not good it's just sets the precedent that they control reality and
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.880]  he's because you know the president gets to name things he's God Obama makes
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.840]  waves by renaming third largest peak Bernie Sanders blames financial elite
[48:30.840 --> 48:34.520]  for economic crisis

[48:47.200 --> 48:54.480]  confiscation there's another article by Ron Paul many blame the crash on China's
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.600]  recent currency devaluation it is true that the crash was caused by a flawed
[48:59.600 --> 49:06.400]  monetary policy however the fault lies not with China's central bank but with
[49:06.400 --> 49:12.280]  the US Federal Reserve and Paul's article breaks that down we've got a bunch of
[49:12.280 --> 49:17.240]  experts on that concur with that in the last few weeks that that it's the
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.520]  Federal Reserve's massive over printing and issuance of dollars worldwide
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.440]  that's pushing these huge bubbles we're gonna be breaking that down after the

[55:23.080 --> 55:26.040]  some quote free health care if you can jump through all the hoops but their
[55:26.040 --> 55:30.720]  wife doesn't illegal immigrants in many cases not in all cases but many cases
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.680]  are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have said
[55:35.680 --> 55:42.240]  Trump and of course he was attacked for saying that that's just some of the
[55:42.240 --> 55:47.880]  news on that front up at info wars.com here is the big economic news central
[55:47.880 --> 55:51.880]  banks can't save the markets from a crash and they shouldn't even try
[55:51.880 --> 55:59.320]  alarming data from China was met with a soothing hint about monetary policy but
[55:59.320 --> 56:04.440]  treasuries cannot keep pumping cheap credit into a series of asset bubbles
[56:04.440 --> 56:11.360]  and interesting how this featured article at the London Guardian does not
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.600]  say who wrote it so I guess that means it's from the editorial board of the
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.120]  Guardian and you read this it sounds like something Ron Paul would say
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.280]  something I would say as the common sense begins to basically permeate out
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.640]  that you're not gonna be able to pump up bubbles with just fiat currency and fiat
[56:29.640 --> 56:34.960]  derivatives and fiat counterfeit instruments that those won't feed you
[56:34.960 --> 56:42.080]  those won't actually power a society but the globalists that are in control are
[56:42.080 --> 56:48.160]  actively trying to shut down the real jobs the real farms the real energy the
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.720]  real manufacturing base and only allow economic development in zones that are
[56:53.720 --> 56:59.040]  exempt from taxation basically controlled by them this is a takeover this
[56:59.040 --> 57:05.520]  financial crisis is orchestrated and as it intensifies get ready for new calls
[57:05.520 --> 57:11.840]  for more too big to fail infusions of taxpayer money which gives the globalist
[57:11.840 --> 57:18.120]  first use of all the fiat money then they pass it on to us as it loses value
[57:18.120 --> 57:22.440]  like children clinging to their parents stock market traders turned to their
[57:22.440 --> 57:25.600]  central banks last week as they sought protection from the frightening
[57:25.600 --> 57:30.040]  economic figures coming out of China surely they asked the central banks
[57:30.040 --> 57:34.640]  would ward off the approaching boogeyman as they had so many times since the
[57:34.640 --> 57:41.040]  2008 crash the US Federal Reserve came up with the goods the president of the
[57:41.040 --> 57:46.200]  Federal Reserve the Bank of New York hinted that the interest rates rise may
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.800]  be expected next month was likely to be delayed they're gonna keep the QE going
[57:50.800 --> 57:56.920]  as we predicted a signal that borrowing costs would remain at rock bottom was
[57:56.920 --> 58:02.920]  all it took and again they act like the feds doing this because we want it they
[58:02.920 --> 58:07.480]  keep dangling it out there till we beg for it so they can say it's our fault
[58:07.480 --> 58:13.040]  when this all happens and the article goes on it's excellent it breaks it all
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.720]  down financial Times reports Beijing's abandoned large-scale share purchases so
[58:19.720 --> 58:25.560]  that means they're gonna let their market go down and disrupting major ad
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.480]  revenue online apples ad blockers rile publishers it blocks all the ads on any

[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:42.520]  ladies and gentlemen we are here broadcasting worldwide thank you so
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.040]  much for joining us on this Monday edition I am your host Alex Jones we
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.760]  have the documentary filmmaker we're gonna have the trailer for you as well
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.040]  for a film I saw about a month ago here in Austin Texas it's won a bunch of
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.200]  awards and the film is cartel land just to show you what the drug wars done in
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.560]  Mexico as really a warning to where this society in this country is going as
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.800]  well as the economy breaks down and as illicit black market systems are the
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:24.520]  only place people can make money you had a bunch of guns in the mix that only
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.760]  criminals have the general public doesn't have it you have corrupt police
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.040]  forces that are bought and paid for by the cartels and the CIA it is a
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:41.600]  disastrous disastrous mix so we have the director of cartel land joining us
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:49.880]  coming up and that's Matthew Heinemann cartellandmovie.com but a very
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:57.240]  powerful film very very disturbing as well so that's coming up in the next
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.840]  segment then we're gonna have Vani Hari the food babon with us covering health
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:08.360]  issues food issues activism because the movement to have GMO labeling the
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.080]  movement to not buy GMO processed garbage is destroying the globalist right
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.960]  now it's one of the main areas if not the main area that we're having success
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.520]  and she's right at the tip of the spear and it's really a testament to what
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.320]  voting with our dollars does that's why the globalists are in a race to show
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.440]  everything up because if the left and the right ever wake up the fact we're
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.880]  in a controlled paradigm if we ever wake up the fact that both parties are
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.280]  controlled we ever wake up to the fact that the same people that run the white
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.960]  supremacist groups run the liberal and socialist and communist and Jewish
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.000]  groups and other organizations and then it's a controlled dialectic it's game
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.800]  over and that's what I'm here to try to people to do is to think outside the
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:03.000]  box and to really see and understand the overall manipulation that is taking
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.440]  place and unfolding we will do the fourth hour the entire fourth hour today
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:17.040]  again I did the fourth hour for about five years for the first 12 years or so
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.840]  I did three hours every day 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and for about five years I did a
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.000]  fourth hour but launching the nightly news and my other administrative duties
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  it was just too exhausting but a lot of stations kept carrying the fourth hour
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.280]  and I thought you know we're getting five hours a day on satellite for TV four
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.520]  hours during the day an hour at night for the nightly news we just set all that
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.600]  up why not just have the fourth hour and truly get my reporters who are smart
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:56.680]  folks out of the box of taping shows we do the nightly news live sometimes they
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.320]  get really good after say a five-hour marathon nightly news we do that you
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.720]  during elections and things sometimes a 10 hour long so we'll just start throwing
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.320]  everybody in the deep end of the pool every weekday in the fourth hour some
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.520]  days I'll be there some days you know I'll post the whole hour and have a
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:19.560]  special guest but a lot of days most days it will be Leanne McAdoo jacari
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:26.200]  Jackson Darren McBreen David Knight and the rest of crew will have some of the
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.880]  writers in here we'll have guest sometimes we'll have activist guest in
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.320]  sometimes we'll randomly get some folks off the street bring them in here think
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.080]  see what they think about what's going on we'll premiere a lot of stuff in the
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:45.200]  fourth hour as well it's gonna become probably the best hour of TV radio that
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.160]  we do every day so the fourth hour is on satellite TV and radio it's back find
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.760]  showtimes listings the tales and info wars.com forward slash show we'll be
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.760]  right back.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.040]  strong arm police state tactics instead they work to find alternative crops for
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.640]  farmers to grow that would actually make them more money Bolivia has adopted a
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.640]  policy where coca cultivation is allowed in traditional areas alongside
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.480]  alternative development and others said Antonio de Leo from the UN office of
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.160]  drugs and crime the US is still involved in Afghanistan and look at the heroin
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.560]  production coming out of that area it has skyrocketed is the United States

[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.080]  until dawn right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:22.080]  the occupied zone the chair is against the wall the chair is against the wall
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.440]  John has a long mustache John has a long mustache it's 12 o'clock
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.400]  Americans another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on or
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.760]  behind the lines this is your song
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.480]  but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.800]  make trouble for them people that had guns and think they wanted to just took
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.960]  them away where we education camps that's what they call it so part of it
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.280]  we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.720]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize the kids belong to whole
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:09.480]  communities. I have decided we really need camps for adults. And we need to have camps that you all run.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.600]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register now they were
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.100]  taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:24.680]  built assembly centers. What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:31.760]  happening? Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.760]  military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.680]  law enforcement techniques. These people are radicalized and they don't support
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.600]  the United States and they're disloyal to the United States. It's our right and
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.080]  our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.720]  This is what we're doing here and let's not kid about it. We're building a domestic
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:07.320]  army because the government is afraid of its own citizens. Put your gun down, really.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:14.840]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones. Are you
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:22.640]  some kind of a constitutionalist? If you are receiving this transmission you are
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:39.320]  the resistance. Red Dawn came out in the early 1980s and it parallels
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.240]  historically what's happened to other countries that have been infiltrated
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.840]  that have been taken over. In this case by a communist invasion from the south
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.000]  and of course it's fiction. But many times fiction parallels reality. We have
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Central and South America in massive decline collapsing. Mexico's been a
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.280]  failed state for about seven, eight years. It's my view that the phony drug
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.920]  war along with poverty and corruption of the government and the military, I've
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.120]  had a lot of professors on the concur, is what has allowed Mexico to become a
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.000]  failed state with more than 100,000 dead that we know of in the last decade. That
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.200]  violence is now accelerating upwards of a third of Arizona has signs saying do
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.120]  not enter these areas controlled by cartels. Our government can't and won't
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.760]  stop what's happening. The CIA has been caught working with the cartels
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.320]  shipping a lot of the drugs in. Now about a month ago I went to the local
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.840]  theater local art house theater the Arbor in north Austin to see a film
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:53.960]  cartel land cartellandmovie.com and I had followed the vigilantes in Mexico
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:59.440]  getting arms and defending themselves. I had followed the cartel and the
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.640]  government's response but to see the footage and the shootouts and the
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.040]  deaths and the safe houses and the police cooking the drugs and all of it
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.560]  added multiple dimensions to it. I've got to say it's one of the most powerful
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.080]  documentaries I've ever seen. Matthew Heineman joins us to the bottom of the
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.160]  hour. I'm gonna play the trailer for cartel landmovie coming up here in a
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.880]  few minutes and no I'm not invested in it no I'm not selling it I mean I'm
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.760]  promoting it because you want to see what the drug war is this is it and it
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:39.560]  was so fair he didn't show the paramilitary folks on the Arizona side as
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.640]  just hillbilly racist he showed them as human beings and there's a little
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.400]  undercurrent of some racial stuff because that's honest that's there. Basically
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.280]  he found what I found going to Arizona going to South Texas going over into
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.040]  Mexico my reporters going over into Mexico but but we've done nothing
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.120]  compared to what he did I mean you talk about dangerous I've seen a lot of
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.480]  combat footage the trips have sent back that have been in combat two three four
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:13.120]  tours and they didn't see this much action so this guy deserves a purple
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:20.160]  heart and a bronze star for bravery if journalism issued such awards. Matthew
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.800]  Heineman thank you so much for joining us all I can say is congratulations on
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.000]  what you've produced it's really amazing tell us about how you made part
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.440]  one in part two and those two parts and just your view on the drug war and
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.680]  where all this is going. Yeah well thanks thanks for having me on I really appreciate it you know I think with
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.320]  with Cartel and I really wanted to take this issue of narco violence and take it
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.840]  out of the headlines and put myself right into the middle of the action you
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.880]  know there's been a lot of sort of glorification of drug violence and TV
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.440]  shows and movies and you know I really wanted to take an apolitical look and
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.120]  and see how this narco violence was affecting everyday people and then the
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.440]  response of everyday people rising up to fight back and then you know what
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.840]  happens when when when they do so and so you know I was embedded with these two
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:17.000]  different groups one in Arizona one in Mexico over the course of a year and you
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.720]  know embarked on this journey that that I never could have imagined or predicted.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:30.480]  Continue to break down this this saga or this quest. Yeah I mean you know I
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:38.560]  think it's it's really really complicated this issue of you know the
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.400]  drug wars and you know my goal was not to sort of do a big policy film or be the
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.960]  definitive film on you know the drug wars my goal was to tell a human story
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.240]  through these characters through these citizens who you know taking the law
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.800]  into their own hands to fight for what they believe in you know and at the heart
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.800]  of this film are these two men Tim Naylor fully on the US side and El Doctor a
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.840]  small-time physician in the state of Mitra Khan in Mexico who are leading
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.400]  these two different vigilante groups you know they're both 55-year-old men they
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.280]  both believe that the government has failed them they both have quote-unquote
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.080]  taken the line to their own hands to to fight with for what they believe in you
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.040]  know obviously the circumstances are different in Mexico the violence is
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:31.520]  visceral it's real you mentioned in the intro you know hundred thousand in
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.640]  between eighty and a hundred thousand killed since 2007 twenty thousand plus
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.240]  people disappeared since 2007 in Mexico you know whereas in Arizona you know we're
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.360]  not seeing that that same type of violence and in the you know the vigilante
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.760]  fight is a little bit more a fear that these Mexican drug wars will sweep its
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:58.360]  way across their borders but it is the fear and the concern and the preparation
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.480]  that stops it from completely taking over we have had homes burned down severed
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.960]  heads a lot of drug war crime in the Southwest I don't think it's as anywhere
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.480]  near as bad as Mexico I agree with you but I think that's what's so powerful
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:17.280]  about your film and so refreshing is that you don't give any commentary you
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.000]  show what they're really saying and you get the humanness of all the different
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:31.080]  factions in Mexico the factions over here and it's just nauseating but at the
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:37.400]  same time exhilarating to actually be like a fly on the wall I mean all I can
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.240]  say is just an amazing job thank you so much I mean you know I think to me one
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.040]  of the big problems in America one of the biggest problems in America is how
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.720]  polarized media has become how you know people on all sides of the political
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:57.920]  spectrum are fed information that they don't necessarily trust and you know
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.720]  that's why you know I really you know I'm my own personal beliefs my own
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.520]  political beliefs but that's not that's not important you know I think what's
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.040]  important is to tell a truthful and honest story and to let the people with
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.560]  whom I spent time tell the story themselves and that's what I tried to
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.960]  do you know I think you know my opinion my views are not important what's
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.560]  important is is to show what's happening and I think that's the beauty of
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.160]  documentary film is to open people's eyes to a world that they've never seen
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:34.000]  before I don't want to give the film away but I have a personal question
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.800]  obviously you've got one of the founders of the vision landing movement and he
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.620]  comes off as a really good guy and then later you discover that he's not
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.640]  completely perfect but then I looked over to my friends that would be and I
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.400]  said I don't want to give it away spoiler alert but but he looks over to
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:59.120]  us well I don't want to give it away but what I'm getting at I looked over and
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.960]  I said I bet he's already basically broken up with his wife but then you
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:09.360]  never really find out if he broke up with her before or after or if he's
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.240]  cheating on his wife right in front of the cameras if you don't mind I prefer
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.400]  not to try to get into it too much that you know I think I think one of the
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.800]  beauties of the film is that the film you know unravels in a way that you you
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.320]  can't really necessarily script or imagine and so I'd like to let the
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.080]  viewers sure but that's a pretty good teaser I just gave you hadn't I'll
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.200]  take what I can get let's talk about how the film's doing and I haven't really
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.520]  followed that I know it won a bunch of awards tell us about the awards at one
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:46.200]  and then where folks can find it sure so the film premiered at the Sundance
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:52.800]  Film Festival you know I was very lucky to win the best director award and
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.120]  best cinematography award at the Sundance Film Festival it's played at
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.520]  festivals all across the world and then it opened in movie theaters in early
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.600]  July you know playing theaters all across the United States it's still
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.000]  playing in some theaters in different places and you know I think the best
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.680]  way to find out information about the film is our website cartelandmovie.com
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:21.680]  or Facebook page facebook.com slash cartel and in early October it will be
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:28.320]  out on iTunes and video on demand and so people will be able to get it online
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:36.000]  and then eventually be on A&E in 2016 well all I can say is for people that
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.440]  haven't seen it I don't normally get filmmakers on and gush over it especially
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:45.360]  you know stuff that's more mainstream but this is not mainstream had you ever
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.000]  made a film or been involved in something this dangerous before I'm not
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.480]  you know I'm not a war reporter I've never ever been in any situations like
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:57.600]  this before you are now I mean you're a seasoned war reporter spending a year in
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:04.280]  what I saw torture bases getting shot at stuff blowing up I mean man I tell you
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.480]  yeah you know I it was it was absolutely terrifying and I don't think I was
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.440]  necessarily prepared for what I was gonna see you know through the process of
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.600]  making this film I found myself in shootouts between the vigilantes and
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.080]  the cartel you know torture chambers meth labs places I never could have
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:27.120]  imagined being and you know at first I think you know one of the interesting
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.240]  things about the film is you know at first it seemed like a very simple
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.840]  story a very simple story of you know everyday citizens rising up to fight
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:41.720]  back against an evil cartel and over time those the lines between good and
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.960]  evil became ever more blurry shows how the corruption takes place yeah and it
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:54.920]  you know shows the corruption between the cartels the government and you know
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.960]  ultimately the vigilantes without giving too much away and I think that's
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.880]  that's what's so scary especially in Mexico is that you know there's an
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.320]  absolute lack of rule of law you know what we see is the failure of government
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.160]  institutions and I think one of the saddest things for me is to see the
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.200]  suffering of everyday people the suffer the suffering of everyday citizens
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:25.960]  living in this lawless world you know and the fear there's a there's a young
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.120]  woman in the beginning of the film it's a really dramatic scene in which the
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.640]  autodefenses take over town the military comes in and disarms them and
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:43.360]  then this the citizens comes around the army and to defend the autodefenses to
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.560]  defend the vigilantes there's a young woman who's screaming face to face with
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:52.840]  the army and we later find out that she both of her parents were killed by the
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:58.520]  cartel her brothers were killed by the cartel and she was too scared to go to
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.680]  the police she's too scared that the police either were the cartel or being
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:08.680]  paid by the cartel or were directly working at the cartel and so you know
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:15.800]  that's the world in which this movie begins and it's a very scary world
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.240]  expanding on that I know when my reporters have gone into Mexico and
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.520]  covered drug houses and things like that the FBI shows up wants to debrief them
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:33.080]  afterwards have you ever been approached by the FBI the CIA not not not
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:39.480]  correctly as of yet I'm surprised you haven't I mean you've seen a lot of
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.360]  stuff nobody else has seen how did you get them to trust you so much I mean
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.600]  they bring you into autodefense torture centers they I mean the police cook
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:55.760]  methamphetamine in front of you how did you get them to trust you so much I think
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.400]  you know what with the film like this that you know the biggest thing is
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.880]  access and you know I really didn't want to tell a story through experts or
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.760]  talking heads or you know government officials I want to tell the story through
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.560]  the eyes of the vigilantes themselves and in terms of getting under trust me I
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.240]  think there's a variety factors I think for one being honest and truthful with
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:22.240]  your intentions you know I wasn't trying to as I said earlier I wasn't trying to
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.880]  bring an agenda you know I was very clear with them that I wanted to let them
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.960]  tell the story and to follow the journey as it naturally happened a filmmaker
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.600]  mentor of mine once said that if you end up with a story that you started with
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.760]  then you weren't listening along the way and I you know I think that's good
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.640]  advice for life and I think it's good advice for filmmaking is you know being
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.560]  being open to the story changing but you know another thing that I think really
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.160]  helped was they were risking their lives they're dying fighting for this cause and
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.800]  I you know I was right alongside them to do so do excuse me right alongside them
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.360]  filming them and I think that's how you were able to do it correct me if I'm wrong
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:04.880]  you were in at the beginning of the rebellion of the peasant uprising against
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.200]  the corrupt police against the cartels the battles the defeats when they were
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:12.520]  pure and then you're with them for over a year as things start to degenerate
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.520]  that's why you were already in because you were in from the start yeah I
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.040]  wasn't in from the absolute beginning but about there as they're you know you
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.520]  know early on and I think yeah as I said you know they're risking their lives and
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.960]  by me being alongside them there's a level of respect that I had with them
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.280]  that you know I was willing to risk my life and the life of my crew to tell
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.800]  the story and so I think that's so upsetting as you see how brave the
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.480]  Mexican people are they're smart they're funny and they have a failed culture and
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.040]  I look at America on average we're so soft I don't care what color we are I
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.400]  mean if we start collapsing like that we're gonna be in deep trouble and you
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.200]  know the veneer of civilizations very thin of the drug war continues in my
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.920]  view and our society continues to break down I think we could become like
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:04.400]  Mexico who know I mean you know let's hope not and you know I I'm an eternal
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.400]  optimist you know I believe in the goodness of humanity and you know I
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.600]  want to believe that you know at one point I want one day this this corruption
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.760]  and this violence in Mexico will stop you know we think about 9-11 you know I
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.760]  don't know the exact numbers I think it was roughly 3,500 4,000 people that were
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:28.160]  killed and look you know look how much that changed the course of America you
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.000]  know here in Mexico we have we have you know almost 100,000 people killed I mean
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.200]  it's a war that's happening in the country just south of us and I really
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:43.440]  hope that through the cartel and I can pull people's eyes that were absolutely
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.080]  I'll talk about your next project we're gonna go to break you gotta leave I'm
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.560]  gonna come back and actually play the trailer and have some final comments
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.400]  well again we have the director of cartel land on with us right now but you
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.000]  didn't set out to make something libertarian based I understand that
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.020]  it's not political you don't demonize the paramilitary militia that's on the
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.680]  border there's some good groups some bad groups I've been there I've looked at
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.080]  it seems like you chose a group from about what I've seen that really
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.240]  represents what these paramilitaries are really like the ones I know there's a
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.800]  few bad groups out there but they're really few and far between I don't know
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.280]  how you're gonna get this on A&E I know they financed it and it's a hit film you
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.160]  won Sundance Film Festival two different categories this just doesn't fit with the
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:29.320]  narrative that anybody that's concerned about an open border is a cook I mean you
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.000]  really show what's going on there and the drugs coming across and the coyotes
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.520]  coming across so I just don't see how this fits with the kind of Ford Foundation
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:45.720]  narrative again I don't I don't believe you know I don't know what your
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.520]  political background is I probably should have done more background research
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:52.320]  before coming on the show but I don't think it frankly matters I don't think
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.800]  it matters what my background is I think you know as a journalist as a
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.800]  filmmaker you know your job is to tell a truthful story yeah you did that and
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.920]  that's so rare just to then see that it's gonna be on mainstream TV you know
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.600]  A&E and various people are respected is I think you know this there's no
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.400]  judgment that's brought into this you know and I wish the world could could
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.720]  work more often sure but nobody's seeing this is gonna want us to have an open
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.520]  border with Mexico I can tell you right now I mean I'm a libertarian I want open
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.160]  borders if we didn't have all this high welfare to draw in people that are just
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.600]  gonna be dead beats so I mean all I'm saying is you put out a really truthful
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.600]  film from my research and I just think that's really rare and I think and so
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.600]  kudos to Sundance kudos to A&E kudos to everybody I mean if mainstream TV starts
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.840]  going this direction they'll have ratings again because people just want the
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:48.480]  truth yeah you know and I think you know regardless of politics I think the I
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.000]  wish media and I and I hope with Cartel and you know what are you doing if
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.080]  you're preaching to the choir what are you doing if you just attract you know
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.000]  one sector of America I think with media and journalism and film you know you
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.120]  should be attracting all sides and I think if we're all talking together
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.080]  rather than all you know siloed and talking in part and maybe some good
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.640]  can happen and I think that's you know that was my goal with this film is that
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:17.160]  hopefully sure you know we can attract audience
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.440]  you're just from you're breaking up a little bit we're gonna let it
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.560]  restabilize for a moment again we have the director of cartel land cartel land
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:32.240]  movie comm Matthew Heineman in closing serve your skype's back any other parts

[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.640]  few different films you know I might make another film in this space you know
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:52.320]  to be honest I'm not totally sure so we'll we'll see I'm excited to keep

[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:09.400]  the bug of wartime journalism I don't know if I have you know I guess a little
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.040]  bit of me has probably you know every time I see the film I get a little bit
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.480]  of the adrenaline rush but you know I love my family I love my girlfriend you
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.800]  know I don't know if I want to keep putting myself over this so we'll see

[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.040]  early morning Virginia news shooting we now know more about the shooter Vester
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.480]  Lee Flanagan he exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.360]  by his inability to use a teleprompter he was also reprimanded for wearing a
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.920]  president Obama badge during an election report in the report his supervisor
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.400]  writes this is a clear violation not only of shirts County policy but of
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.960]  standard journalistic ethics journalists and particularly reporters who
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.360]  appear on television must abide by a different standard president Obama
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.160]  responded saying guns are worse than terrorism what we know is that the
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.960]  number of people who die from gun related incidents around this country
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.240]  dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism the president added Trump
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.160]  responded by saying the problem is not guns it's mental illness which echoes
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.680]  the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan show how about

[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:36.520]  I want to open the phones up after I play several reports here on what you
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:42.000]  think about the shooting last week of the TV reporter and the cameraman now
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.760]  the cold-blooded murder of this sheriff's deputy in Houston and are you
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.400]  watching the same news I'm watching reading the same papers I'm watching I
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.840]  mean there's hardly any news out there this is racially motivated the
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:59.760]  Associated Press is still acting like the sheriff's department is out of bounds
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.640]  for saying they believe it's connected to the national rhetoric being put out by
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.440]  black lives matter I mean you better believe that if it was a white guy
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.700]  running around shooting black people like with the charlson situation they
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.520]  would be saying it was racially motivated and then blaming all white
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.920]  people but we're not blaming all black people for this we're blaming mentally
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:28.880]  ill unstable haters and they need to be decried and explained to that this
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.880]  isn't good when black people get murdered and cold blood it's wrong when
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.040]  cops get murdered and cold blood it's wrong when white people get murdered
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.400]  it's wrong it's just wrong I don't sit there when nine blacks get killed and
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.040]  go yeah well there's one for the white team I go there's one for the globalist
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:52.440]  who just orchestrated us getting in a fight with each other and that's why
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.760]  I've been harping on this because you see movies like cartel land the
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:01.440]  globalist want to convert America into a police state drug war zone that's why
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.040]  the government ships the narcotics in but the government with the big banks
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.240]  ships it in from the top we have the congressional hearings in the 60s the
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.840]  70s and the 90s we have the declassifications we have the big
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.880]  banks that have admitted to laundering hundreds of billions a year they
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.600]  control it then they have Hollywood act like the drug cultures cool there's a
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:26.080]  lot of money associated with it so young people get involved your daughters
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.920]  become prostitutes it degenerates the society and now our economy is based
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:38.320]  on the prisons and the drug war so you get involved in gangbanger culture MTV
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:46.160]  pushes it acts like it's underground the cops take the bait try to shut down the
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.640]  gangster rap everybody then thinks it's super cool it goes white hot super
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.200]  platinum the young people all start dressing like prisoners with their pants
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.080]  hanging down around their butts the cops are trained that's the enemy you're
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:05.800]  trained the cops are the enemy and then you have a full-on war in America which
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:13.160]  has been on slow burn but I believe we're about to see a slow motion race
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:20.000]  war a slow motion drug war that makes the 80s carnage and crime rates soaring
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.400]  look like a walk in the park all the signs of destabilization are there we're
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.600]  going into a depression we have all these problems and the system wants to
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:37.080]  brand it as racial so the globalists don't get the blame and so the middle
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.640]  class whether they be black or white calls for law and order and gives up
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.800]  their rights because so many citizens and so many cops are getting killed then
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:51.000]  they're gonna stage terror attacks blame it on the Liberty movement and have a
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.640]  roundup of the Liberty movement they'll also be a roundup of the leftist black
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:01.000]  movement and I'm telling you that's where this is going I told you long before
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.200]  this started reading the manuals reading the documents reading the
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.720]  restricted info that we got from our sources published here confirmed to be
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.720]  accurate that the only way they could pull this off looking at their battle
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.480]  plan was with what you're now seeing so we were able to project forward the
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.440]  enemy battle plan it's actually easier than connecting the dots so I want to
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.760]  take a few phone calls on this issue has the race war already begun and how do
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.040]  we short circuit it I think you do like what happened in Charleston black folks
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.480]  white folks Hispanic everybody coming together prayer vigils putting flowers
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:45.600]  at the church decrying this little drughead maggot that did it well let's
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.760]  hear some people decrying what this latest comeback did shooting this cop
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.800]  turns out didn't even know him hadn't done anything and he cowardly shot him in
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.440]  the back people say oh I'm sick of the cops good let him die how would you like
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.320]  it if it was somebody you knew your neighbor your dad this guy had two
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:07.480]  children he was involved in the community he had a good record and he's dead
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.040]  executed all these leftist that call for killing cops you're against the death
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:15.880]  penalty for people found guilty but you it's okay for you if a cop gets killed
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.400]  and I'll tell you something it's because you've never been involved in real
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.560]  violence you've never seen real stuff go down and so your little kids thinking
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.200]  it's tough to sit around talking about killing people it's not tough it's not
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:33.040]  cool and when and here's here's the key if things unravel in this civilization
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.720]  like it's starting to do it's gonna be you soft people out there and all you
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.280]  people on the left that one of these free government goodies when the
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:47.320]  liberties gone when the prosperity is gone the New World Order is not gonna
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:53.800]  take care of you they have no respect for you you're useless you're stupid as
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.440]  long as you stay under their control I want you to be free I want you to wake
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.040]  up I want you to get involved I want you to see outside the box I want you to
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:09.400]  be empowered I'm a prideful person I'm not saying that's good but I have pride
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:16.920]  in humanity pride in you pride myself I want to believe in you and that's why
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.760]  when I see MSNBC MTV putting out weaponized media saying only whites can
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:29.760]  be racist being white inherently is bad whites deserve what they get blah blah
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.320]  blah it makes me so sick because the people running that are consciously
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:41.800]  evil and have a plan to bring this country down and you have movies like
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:48.760]  Django and all the rest of it that is meant to inflame racial division meant
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.080]  to sell the idea that white people are inherently bad and that you've personally
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.120]  been wronged so you can go out and find some white people to kill and that's the
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:03.600]  message that Hollywood wants to be put out and it's all part of this climate
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.320]  being pushed with all these movies coming out at once focusing on police
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.400]  suppression focusing on police abuse not because they're going to reform the
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.200]  problems that are real that we've tried to reform for 20 years but because they
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.080]  want to have a clash of civilizations now let's go to this trailer because I
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.920]  mentioned it for cartel and here it is there's an imaginary line up there
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:41.400]  between right and wrong good and evil I believe what I'm doing is good and what
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.560]  I'm standing up against is evil
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:41:02.600]  it's the cartels they're the ones terrorizing their own country and now
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:17.600]  they're starting to do it over here
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:31.480]  the cartel scouts keep getting away
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:48.760]  they're taking back what is theirs from the cartel this way should be done up
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:42:05.720]  here too but it touches me drop them you saw me
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.240]  we're not going to become the criminals that we're fighting
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.920]  with who do you work
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:55.360]  and again it just came out about a month and a half ago it's already pretty
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.640]  much left the theaters but I thought it was a very powerful film it deserved to
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.440]  be recognized it deserved to get some attention here because you find out that
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.240]  the vigilantes on the US side and on the Mexican side are basically the same
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:16.120]  people they have the same views the same beliefs the same desires it's the
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:20.560]  opposite of a Robert Rodriguez movie where Don Johnson is dressed up as a
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.840]  white racist sheriff shooting pregnant West Mexican women in the stomach that's
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.480]  not real that's not going on that's not happening it's Mexicans that have
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:38.440]  killed over a hundred thousand Mexicans but the political correct crowd would
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:42.080]  somehow try to imply that it was America's fault that's why the White
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:49.960]  House it came out in the memos CBS News three years ago they shipped those guns
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.880]  down there so they could blame the violence on the Second Amendment when
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:01.400]  the drug cartels are buying full auto from Europe and from the big banks
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:04.360]  turned out a lot of those guns that got shipped down there ended up getting
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.640]  used by the citizens to fight off the drug cartels and to restabilize and
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:13.840]  take back control of the communities the problem is the cartels then just kill
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:18.680]  the leadership of the good vigilante groups or have the government put them
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:24.400]  in prison and then take their number two guys who they've bought off and put them
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:30.280]  in charge and that's the cycle of corruption and it's happening here in
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:36.360]  this republic and the system needs to cut it off now we need to decriminalize
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.640]  drugs across the board now that doesn't mean sell them to kids it means
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:46.680]  treat them just like big pharma stuff control it tax it regulate it it'll
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.160]  take the criminal element out but the big central banks on the main ones
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:57.080]  running it that's why they lobby to keep the drug war going police departments
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:02.160]  are addicted to the money as well it's corrupted many police departments it's
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.080]  going to corrupt the whole nation if we don't stop it now I have a big
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.720]  announcement I'm going to be making I'm going to play this video that breaks it
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:24.440]  down if we don't do this I will be able to fund the launch of the info war to
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.560]  hundreds of UHF VHF and cable systems they've got more than 50 that are
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:33.040]  showing interest we've got six or seven that are already signed on already
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:39.240]  currently taking it just as we turned it on three weeks ago it's well worth it
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.960]  if we reach 50 UHF VHF and 50 cable systems I think it'll be a lot more than
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:48.280]  that we already have places like Houston we're on basic cable that's a huge feet
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.920]  and they also have a broadcast station down there and we've got a lot of
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.560]  stations lining up pick it up what I don't have is the infrastructure for
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.920]  affiliate relations to work with the stations what I don't have is enough
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.520]  reporters or writers we have enough to do it basically but when you add all the
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:12.400]  money in for the closed captioning satellite feeds legal other issues like
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.880]  that we're going to expend all the capital this operation has and that's not a
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:24.080]  good position to be in you want to have some backup because we deal with the
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.160]  occasional dirty trick the occasional problem things we have to handle I mean
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.640]  any business any operation needs really six months of capital we got a couple
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.520]  months of capital and if I do this and if you don't support us I'll expend that
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.320]  which I'm ready to do because I'm not going to sit here and have half
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.320]  measures I'm going to go all out against the globalist we're going to skip this
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.360]  network break be the last one I skip today
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:55.160]  but I do need your support and I do need your help we are in the face of the
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:00.680]  globalist we're basically vigilante media we transcend the labels we're for
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.760]  basic freedom you have a right to private property a right to not be forced
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.400]  to take vaccines a right to not have your guns taken a right to be sovereign a
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.000]  right to not have foreigners come in and get everything free to be a political
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.840]  group to vote you into slavery I don't care what color you are where you're
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:22.800]  from you have basic rights we promote basic pro-human ideas we promote common
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:29.920]  sense we promote life you got left wing got right wing no there's the life wing
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.120]  and there's the death wing and the globalists are the cult of the death
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:41.680]  wing that's the wings they fly on it's what they live by they are predators
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.920]  they love death they love disease they love fraud they love squalor they love
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.320]  a dumb down population they can feed on like cattle I don't think you're cattle
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.160]  I don't think I'm cattle because when I think of you as cattle I've just
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:00.080]  dehumanized myself that's a power trip it's easier to laugh with the dumb down
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:05.160]  masses I actually cry I laugh on the surface because it's not funny it makes
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:13.040]  me sick it's gallows humor I know I'm right I know I'm dead on I know I
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.480]  understand the enemy's operations I've read their books I've read their white
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:21.080]  papers I've studied the New World Order I know their game plan we've accurately on
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:26.960]  so many fronts predicted what they're going to do they can't stand it and now
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:34.160]  this operation needs to go to the next level now and believe me I was sitting
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:38.960]  around talking to my dad last night at my grandmother's 90th birthday or lunch I
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.080]  should say before the radio show and I said I know I can go to 40 million a
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.800]  week we're reaching and if it does that it'll be a hundred million I know I can
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.000]  get so big and so damaging to the globalist they're gonna come after me but
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.880]  I said my shelves won't let me not do it it's not about showing off it's not
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.560]  about wanting to fight it's about knowing that I am aiding and abetting the
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:06.480]  New World Order if I don't go into this 110% and I've got a trump card and
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.000]  that's Jesus Christ and so it's whatever God's will is will happen to me I'm at
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.160]  peace the only selfish thing I ask God is to protect my children and I will a
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:20.920]  hundred percent never submit never back down never give in never sell out I
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:25.720]  commit before God Almighty and all I ask is you the listeners and viewers to
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.440]  understand that none of us are perfect none of us have all the answers but of
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:35.440]  our hearts right and if we want justice and if we take action God will lead God
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.920]  and direct us even if you don't believe in God the universe energy whatever
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.880]  providence it works it's real the enemy knows it they worship the God of death
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:50.440]  and of disease and a fraud and of oppression and a balkanization and
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:58.120]  divide and conquer it's easy to be evil it's easy to play those games I know
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.080]  how the new order works I wanted to come in here and play their tactics even
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.400]  today I could shoot to the high levels in their organization they've tried to
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:11.960]  hire me so many times makes my head spin that's what they do they get you to
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:18.080]  join them I'll never join them ever and that's the commitment but it's joining
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.840]  them to not go 110% I didn't want to grow this operation eight years ago I
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.200]  wanted to stay small I wanted to just underground reach millions of people
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.560]  make films I knew how dangerous it was and I looked at myself in the mirror one
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:37.120]  day and I hit my knees and I just said God I don't want to be a coward help me
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.480]  be strong help me go all the way and that's what we've done and now I'm
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.600]  gonna go even closer to the gates I'm gonna go all the way in right into the
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:51.800]  throne room of the New World Order right up front in front of the kings of this
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:57.960]  age and let them know as imperfect as I am I stand for life I stand for justice
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.760]  and I'm not afraid and whatever happens to me that's in God's plan so believe
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.640]  me I don't want the work I don't want the hassle of more reporters and more
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.240]  writers and more stuff and more things I got to worry about and more things I
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.320]  got to deal with but I'm gonna do it because I'm going for broke all-in
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.360]  doubling tripling quadrupling down because I'm not gonna sit there when
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:25.240]  I'm 75 with my heart failing in some hospital wishing I'd have gone all the
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:30.560]  way wishing I'd have fought harder wishing I would have done more I'm gonna
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:36.080]  do it now but I need your help to do it so join me in this fight let's go to
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:40.400]  this piece we're putting out we're posting it to info wars dot com operation
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.080]  money bomb 2015 email it Twitter it Facebook it it's going up on info wars
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:49.400]  dot com right now help us get this video out to everyone and make it go viral so
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:54.800]  we can raise a million dollars to reach 400 million more people if we reach 20
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.520]  million more people a week which is just doubling the audience most of them
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:02.280]  to in and out in the aggregate that'll be about 400 million people in the next
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.400]  year that's how many we're talking about in Mexico the US and Canada that
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:12.920]  potentially we can hit but the derivatives of this once once once we
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:18.420]  launch this I'm gonna turn the satellites on in Europe Africa Asia once we
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:22.920]  get the money I plan to take profits if we're able to put this on TV with a few
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:27.960]  ads per hour and make money I intend to go worldwide with this now let's go ahead
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:32.480]  and go to this break down
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.920]  totalitarianism comes in many different flavors throughout history it can come
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.120]  from the right wing the left wing it can come from religious cults it can come
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:49.520]  from a foreign invading army and in the modern 21st century it's basically
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:55.520]  coming from political correctness masquerading as the Renaissance masquerading
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:02.840]  as liberalism it seeks to shut down free speech and the controlled globalist
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:08.520]  left has willing accomplices in the Republican Party and other
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:12.240]  conservative and libertarian organizations and groups throughout the
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:17.840]  world the robber barons that control this planet are not free market they
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:23.520]  are monopoly men who seek to have systems free of competition controlled by
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:30.000]  offshore combines above the law the main mission of info wars dot com and my
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.880]  20 years on air is to shatter the left-right paradigm and to get the
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:40.880]  public to become aware of what's really governing and controlling society on a
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:46.880]  mass scale bottom line we have reached that legendary colossal moment in
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:54.120]  history where the next thousand years of human development our very destiny is
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:54:00.800]  being decided that's why we're launching operation money bomb 2015 the first
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:05.320]  money bomb I've done in three years because we only do these if they're
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:09.480]  critical to be able to build up our infrastructure and with the money we
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:14.920]  raised from this we will be able to stay on the satellites and get on UHF VHF
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:20.320]  and cable stations across North America reaching tens of millions of more people
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:25.960]  right at the time they're receptive and looking for answers starting September
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.680]  16th through the 17th we're going to broadcast live from 11 a.m. on the 16th
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:39.640]  through 2 p.m. on the 17th for 27 hours with an amazing lineup of guests
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:45.560]  investigative journalist documentary films and more we are seeking to raise a
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:52.920]  million dollars so that we can reach 400 million extra people potentially in the
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:57.000]  next year because if you do the math and if you look up the numbers that we're
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.680]  already getting from affiliates and from the internet and from YouTube and from
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:06.680]  Facebook and all the platforms we are reaching 20 million people a week if you
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:13.040]  put all that together over a year that's upwards of 200 million different
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:18.800]  individuals around the world is how the algorithm metrics come out so I simply
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.600]  want to double that in the next 12 months after launching this money bomb
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.360]  just the satellites the closed captioning under federal law and other
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.720]  regulations will cost us right at $39,000 a month which if you add it
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:39.160]  together is over $400,000 a year alone when you talk about cameras crew
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:45.960]  studio million dollars is only a portion of what we need to do this but it's an
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.280]  important part to ensure with the collapsing economy and the hard times
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.600]  we're going into that we have the funds it takes to keep this beacon of truth

[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:16.200]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:23.080]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:41.880]  here's Paul Watson the key report we're gonna talk about racism according to
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:47.360]  MTV's Francesca Ramsey it's impossible for black people to be racist Ramsey
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.960]  claims that the dictionary definition of racism the hatred or intolerance of
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:56.820]  another race isn't the true meaning of racism cuz it's just the dictionary
[02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:01.520]  really isn't that convenient so it's okay for social justice worries to claim
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:05.960]  just look at the dictionary definition when it comes to feminism are you
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.240]  morons who are too stupid to look at the definition of feminism with no
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:15.560]  mention of the fact that radical feminism in practice has virtually nothing to do
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.320]  with the dictionary definition of feminism but suddenly different rules
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  apply when you're talking about racism Ramsey says black people can't be
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.680]  racist towards white people only prejudice reverse racism is not a thing
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.360]  first off that has no legal basis whatsoever according to the 1968 civil
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:37.480]  rights act and the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act a
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.200]  racially motivated hate crime carries the same punishment no matter the race
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.960]  of the perpetrator or the victim secondly she claims it's only racism if
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.880]  it's backed by a major institution when a person of color discriminates or
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:54.640]  stereotypes of white person because of their race in the United States they
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.040]  don't have the institutional power to back them up and say that those feelings
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.400]  are okay oh you mean like affirmative action major institutions of learning
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.000]  giving African-Americans college places based on their skin color and not their
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.560]  academic achievement in favor of whites is that racist Goldsmiths University a
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.800]  major institution refusing to fire student diversity officer Bahama
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:24.240]  staffer after she banned white people from attending a college event is that
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:31.120]  racist black on white crime the major institution of media routinely ignoring
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.320]  or downplaying the fact that black people are 27 times more likely to attack
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:41.040]  white people than vice versa while collectively blaming all white people
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.600]  when one nutcase goes on a rampage is that racist only white people can be
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:51.600]  racist really black people are racist or the most racist people there any other
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.680]  race on this planet was it not racist when Bryce Williams shot dead Alison
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:02.000]  Parker live on air in order to create what he called a race war was it not
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.360]  racist when a gang of black radicals called for lynching whites and killing
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:12.720]  cops just days before deputy Darren go forth was gunned down in cold blood was
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.840]  it not racist when the major institution of media refused to identify the
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.080]  suspect as black was it not racist when a black couple beat this white woman while
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.560]  yelling wrong hood bitch
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:35.680]  is it not racist for the major institution which is MTV to endlessly
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.280]  make TV shows and YouTube videos lecturing white people about how racist
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:47.800]  they are seriously this channel is called MTV news music television news yet
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:53.440]  over half of the previous 24 videos have been about racism plus it's completely
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.960]  inaccurate to claim that only major institutions wield power in today's
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:03.360]  society Twitter outrage mobs wield huge power we see them getting people fired
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:08.080]  and destroying people's lives all the time and almost every time that happens
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:12.400]  it's white people being publicly shamed for saying something politically
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.560]  incorrect good people can unintentionally say and do racist things but not if
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.680]  you're killing white people to try and start a race war no that's not racist at
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.120]  all is it or just wind up supporting racist institutions and practices without
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:28.680]  even realize that's a lot like black lives
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:33.680]  full reports up on info wars calm we have to stop doing with the politically
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.600]  correct people tell us they're nobodies on power trips that want to get it
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.800]  society at each other's throats so they can play the part of the savior and the
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:48.800]  referees so they need to be rebuked okay they are the racist they are the fraud
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.160]  they are the joke they know what they're doing it's time to treat them with
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:05:00.680]  disdain not to coddle or grovel to them that's the answer on Sunday crews remove
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:05.360]  the Jefferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson statues from the UT main mall since the
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.840]  church shooting in South Carolina the black lives matter movement had been
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:13.040]  calling for the removal of Confederate flags and civil war statues from across
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:17.680]  the country but did you know 12 US presidents own slaves including Ulysses
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.360]  Grant now let's look at Woodrow Wilson here's a president that intentionally
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.400]  prolonged World War one at the behest of the Carnegie Endowment for an
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.120]  international peace so America could be fundamentally changed and if you look at
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.280]  the transfer of wealth that has taken place since then a case could be made
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.640]  that Woodrow Wilson is probably the biggest purveyor of slavery in the
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:39.280]  United States he also signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 the Federal Reserve
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:42.840]  is still printing up free money and bailing out banks the policies that he
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:47.360]  signed back in 1913 are keeping us all debt slaves today but you won't find any
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:50.960]  mention of Woodrow Wilson the Federal Reserve Act or debt slavery in the
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:54.360]  mainstream media you can see video of the statues being removed on the Alex

[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:31.080]  getting the yoga mat chemical as a die-car bottom-eyed out of Subway's
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:35.960]  famous bread last year over a hundred thousand of you signed this petition and
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.640]  without you Subway would have never made this change I thank you so much for
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:45.280]  making that happen but I'm not here today to talk about yoga mats or shoe
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:50.440]  rubber there's an even bigger issue that we need to address at Subway I've been
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:54.960]  working with several experts and consumer advocacy groups for the past year on
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.760]  this very important issue and we are now ready to take action and we need your
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:04.440]  help Subway is serving us meat that is raised with antibiotics and this is
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:09.240]  irresponsible that's because antibiotics are being routinely fed to farm
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:13.320]  animals not to treat diseases but to fatten them up and make them grow bigger
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:18.480]  on less food almost all of the antibiotics in the US about 80% of
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:24.080]  them are fed to farm animals this overuse of growth promoting antibiotics is
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:30.040]  creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population when animals
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.600]  are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics they become a breeding
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.160]  ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria and it's spreading to humans we now
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.840]  have bacterial infections that only a few years ago could be cured and are now
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:48.680]  not responsive to any known antibiotics thousands of people are dying and
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:53.440]  experts believe it's going to get worse some major food companies have taken
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:58.400]  action by committing to stop this practice meanwhile Subway headquarters
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:04.080]  is silent on the issue this April we sent a letter to the CEO of Subway Fred
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:09.040]  DeLuca asking him to engage with us to discuss opportunities for them to step
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.040]  up as leaders and to commit to eliminating these antibiotics from their
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.080]  chicken suppliers and eventually to eliminate these antibiotics across all
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.520]  supply chains including their turkey, beef and pork Subway has a responsibility
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:27.040]  to make this happen join us and sign the petition at foodbabe.com
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:33.120]  Subway meat I know together we can make this happen
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:39.880]  now foodbabe is only one of hundreds of prominent activists in North America but
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.640]  she's probably had more than I don't know 20 or so successes with initiatives
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:49.240]  getting chemicals out of the beer you name it because this audience and other
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.480]  audiences take action contact these different industries and then once a
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.920]  big operation like McDonald's or Subway does the right thing then basically
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:03.600]  everybody else follows suit and if you look at the social engineering of the
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.680]  globalist and of the big petrochemical manufacturers they're putting their
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.960]  toxic waste as additives in the food it's not just fluoride in the water and
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.000]  again they're cutting the fluoride in the water by half they've banded as a
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.560]  pesticide they've gone from laughing at us ten years ago to having to take action
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:29.520]  between all age being removed out of more and more plastics this is a microcosm
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.000]  of every other political and socio-economic and cultural phenomenon
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.320]  when we take action but it comes from the grassroots you don't see the
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.680]  establishment right wing or left wing coming up with really effective grassroots
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.880]  campaigns they're like oh tax carbon that plants breathe but ignored genetic
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:52.840]  engineering and all the rest serious stuff that really is damaging our
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.040]  environment and our way of life we're part of the planet what affects the
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.200]  planet affects us and so people are always saying to me on the street yeah
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:06.200]  you know you're against the forced vaccines you expose GMO you're against
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:09.960]  you know fluoridation always things but then you're not for carbon taxes and
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:14.420]  you're not free well because it's a scam China if we shut down our power
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:19.360]  plants has dirty plants and more of it goes into the air I want clean plants we
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:24.040]  have them they're shutting them down they show you water vapor and you know in
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.560]  the winter hot water they were coming out of a smoke stack and go look at the
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.680]  smoke there is nothing there but water and carbon dioxide now they know they
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:36.760]  can't get you to list that as a pollutant so they list carbon dioxide the
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.240]  point is is that the elite don't care about the planet they sell their whole
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:46.400]  agenda they do but that's not what they're doing I want my great great
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.560]  grandkids to have a planet I want yours to have a planet I'm concerned about all
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:57.400]  this genuinely and what makes me upset is all these George Soros funded groups
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:04.960]  could care less now Vani Hari food babe.com forward slash Subway meat this
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.280]  is such a big deal because you can feed turkeys chickens cows pigs what you know
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:14.880]  whatever species you're farming in a really unsanitary really horrible
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:20.320]  environments and if you give them steroids and if you give them hormones
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.040]  and you give them other chemicals you and you give them these these toxic
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.920]  antibiotics they will get fat they will get bloated even in you know piles of
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:35.960]  excrement and bugs all over the problem is that's unethical and torturing an
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:41.080]  animal but then you're eating that and it's being passed on and that's what's
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:45.440]  linked to obesity health problems the rise of superbugs she just talked about
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.120]  that and then every time she comes on particularly this show and launches an
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:52.920]  initiative they have articles attacking her saying she's not a scientist she's
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.600]  not a she is holding up studies and news articles and admissions she's just
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.320]  articulate attractive smart knows how to engage in public relations and is a
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:09.640]  focal point of somebody that cares and so they want to change the subject from
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:16.320]  what she's saying to oh look it's just some pretty woman notice how again in
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:20.400]  the political correct world if she was pushing something the system wanted that
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.680]  would be decried but because she's pushing something they don't want they
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:28.680]  engage in sexist type activities towards her I mean I don't care what
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.160]  Kelly are if you're a woman or a man of your fighting for liberty and fighting
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.040]  so that I don't have to go through a minefield to find meat for my kids won't
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.720]  you know be sick all the time and again there's been massive pressure the last
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:49.360]  15 years on synthetic bovine growth hormone in the milk that's made kids
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.440]  have all sorts of weird growth disorders that's caused all sorts of premature
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:15:00.240]  puberty all sorts of problems if you want to go get a prescription take
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:03.360]  growth hormone that's your issue there are some health risks obviously but
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.440]  should we put our children on it and because of activists I remember 15
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.720]  years ago 16 years ago when they were suing Fox News out of Florida for
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:15.240]  running a report about it when they would come after you if you criticize
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:19.560]  roundup and do a slap suit notice we've come so far now that's not really
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:25.920]  happening because we're on the March we're winning now that's my intro to
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:29.560]  that Bonnie Hari talk about your new initiative but why don't you talk about
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.120]  some of the successes you've had others have had I mean it looks like an
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:36.760]  avalanche of success McDonald's is getting ready to basically go out of
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:41.000]  business a lot of animals think Tyson instantly backs off and says we'll stop
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.920]  buying tortured chickens I mean it's gone from belligerence to like they're
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:52.880]  basically capitulating in many fronts while still using PR firms to come after
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:59.480]  you myself and others yeah there is an absolute avalanche of change happening
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.880]  thank you so much first of all for having me on here Alex I really appreciate
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.040]  it's been a little while I went off the book tour and I needed to take a little
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:10.800]  break it but I'm back at it and and I'm back at it with this campaign because
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:14.640]  really what's really important here everything I've learned about the food
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:21.040]  industry every single thing it all goes down to Monsanto the GMOs the corn and
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:25.200]  the soy that we're feeding all these animals and when we feed our animals
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.880]  things that aren't healthy they got to keep them healthy and really inhumane
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:34.160]  environments and that's what's happening with the antibiotic issue you know
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:38.000]  animals are given antibiotics for disease prevention that means that
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.640]  perfectly healthy animals before they even get sick get a low dose of
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.200]  antibiotics to just keep them in these really horrible environments eating
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:51.760]  food that they weren't meant to eat and in being you know basically tortured in
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:58.560]  a way then you've also got the fact that these antibiotics they found increase
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:03.600]  the meat on these animals it actually helps them grow faster which actually
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:09.640]  produces more meat for the industry and so these two practices experts believe
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.600]  and it's not only me who's saying this I'm working with several different groups
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:17.800]  that are pressuring Subway right now everyone from the NRDC to Friends of the
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:23.240]  Earth Consumers Union US Perg fact I mean I have them all listed here Center of
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:27.760]  Food Safety you always act in coalitions and then the mainstream media acts like
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.200]  you're just out here on your own making this up yeah yeah they do do that and
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.240]  it's it's it's not even the mainstream media it's the people that the food
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.600]  industry and the chemical industry have paid to be experts in the same type of
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.600]  folks that say that they can drink roundup but then when they're asked to on
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:48.280]  camera won't do it yeah oh absolutely and that's you know there's a really great
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:53.000]  example of that happening very recently where professor was quoted in the
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.080]  Atlantic New York Times NPR and all articles critical about my work who is
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:03.200]  actually paid by Monsanto even though he told reporters when he was being
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:08.160]  interviewed that he has no ties to Monsanto so you know thankfully because
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:12.120]  of FOIA requests and other things this information's coming out about how these
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:16.680]  so-called experts are tied to industry but what's really interesting is this
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:21.360]  issue really affects all of us whether we are vegan vegetarian whether we eat at
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:27.000]  Subway or not the overuse of antibiotics can affect us because we can be
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.560]  subjected to these superbugs or antibiotic resistant bacteria in our
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:36.760]  water in our soil on other food that you eat so it's everywhere because the
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.880]  overuse of antibiotics it's breeding superbugs yes absolutely over 80% of
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:48.960]  the antibiotics used in this country is used on animals they say and Subway is
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:53.840]  one of the largest corporations in the world they they own I think close to
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.200]  six billion dollars worth of purchasing power from the meat industry and when I
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:03.240]  launched this campaign last Monday on the heels of many other campaigns that
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.320]  were also launched not only did we get over 30,000 signatures in just a few
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:13.800]  days but Subway was forced to respond by the end of week so late Friday night
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.360]  they came out with a small concession saying that they're going to try to
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:25.040]  remove antibiotics from their chickens by 2016 but won't talk about to us or
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.040]  reporters or anybody about any other further details when it comes to the
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:34.760]  turkey the beef the ham etc. and that they sell and so what we're really
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:38.680]  looking to do now with this this campaign is not only get more people to
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:42.760]  sign these petitions that you know if you can head over to foodbabe.com
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:47.800]  Subway meat and lend your voice I really appreciate it but even more so go to
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:52.360]  Subway's Facebook page tweet at them ask them for more details we deserve a
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:56.600]  formal commitment absolutely we need to be concerned about our food and the
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:00.720]  garbage in the Senate this is about a global awakening if you're worried

[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:15.280]  actually seen or heard this to think I'm making it up here's Patrick Moore a big
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:20.400]  chemical lobbyist connected to Monsanto who'd gone around for years saying he
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:26.600]  would drink a glass of Roundup or glyphosate and then it was safe enough to
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:31.560]  drink and when the reporter I guess with CBC asked him to do it he won't do it
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:36.300]  and then I have CBS News saying mercury is good for your children that's what
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.760]  the industry says so take your vaccines well I'm no rocket scientist but
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:44.920]  glyphosate is connected to cancer very poisonous that's been known forever they
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.160]  suppressed that the studies back in the 80s and mercury is one of the most
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:53.800]  deadly heavy metals in the body but here is that famous clip from I guess
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.080]  about two years ago where he was confronted said all right here's a
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.720]  glass of Roundup bud go ahead and drink it here it is do not believe that
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:07.160]  glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer you can drink a
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.560]  whole quart of it and it won't hurt you you want to drink some we have some here
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:15.960]  I'd be happy to actually not not really but not really I know it wouldn't hurt

[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:26.800]  medical watcher for human matter mercury containing vaccines may help not harm
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:30.880]  kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.960]  wise by concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:39.000]  the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.440]  offices that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:46.080]  behavior and mental performance and if you have a business you didn't build
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.840]  that and two plus two equals five and under Obamacare it's free which it's
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.960]  not and everything else and nobody's coming after your guns either
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:59.800]  Vani Har this is a short segment 18 minute long segment coming up we can
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:03.440]  really flesh this out in some of the latest news but food babe.com forward
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:07.800]  slash subway meet folks need to get your latest promo video they just send it out
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.440]  on Twitter Facebook they need to contact Subway because it seems like every time
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:17.960]  we take action now they're caving in and so many ads I see for fast food now or
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:22.520]  grocery stores period or advertising we're fresh we're organic we're safe it
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.240]  seems like we're reaching a critical mass moment. Yeah you know finally people
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:32.160]  because of the subway campaign last year that I actually announced here on the
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.520]  day that I launched it to get out azodicarbonamide the yoga mat chemical
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:41.200]  out of Subway bread finally open people's eyes up to eating fresh isn't
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:45.720]  really eating fresh and now people need to take pay attention to the meat
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:51.600]  because 7.6 billion sub million subs are sold every single day by subway they
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:55.880]  are the largest by number of chains of restaurants even though they're losing
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:59.200]  money just like McDonald's I think they lost more money last year than even
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:04.280]  McDonald's from the reports that I just read and so this is really a shift in
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:09.120]  consumer perspective and there's a whole like snowball revolution of changes
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:13.080]  happening where these corporations are starting to remove artificial food dyes
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.600]  they're starting to go antibiotic-free they're starting to offer more organic
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:22.480]  options but we've got a long way to go and unfortunately some of these brands
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.040]  have lost so much of our trust that I don't know if they'll even survive and
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:31.960]  and really you know you see that with McDonald's you see that with Subway and
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:36.520]  and there's so many other trust issues happening with Subway as it is and so
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:41.960]  we're really at a critical moment here where our voting with our dollars our
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:46.360]  petitioning these companies are making more and more people aware of these
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:52.160]  issues is really creating a shift in momentum in terms of conventional food
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:57.560]  that was poorly raised full of toxins to now food that is organic and real and
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.440]  whole and that is really what we need to go back creating a whole new economy for
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.960]  us where that food can now be exported up and reading how we have to import most
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:09.800]  of our organic food and the farming associations aren't even telling
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.480]  farmers hey you can be making a lot of money with organics because there's
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:17.960]  such a culture controlled by big pharma and by the big industries to not let
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:21.760]  farmers know this yeah and you know you look at Chipotle and they're having to
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:24.880]  get some of their beef and pork from other countries because we just don't
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:30.480]  have enough here that's raised humanely that isn't antibiotic-free and so we're
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:34.840]  you know now outsourcing our food and we need to go back and take a look at our
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:38.800]  farmers here and see how we can change their practices from within and that's
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:44.160]  how these type of campaigns start to do that once huge companies like Subway and
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.520]  others like McDonald's and Chick-fil-A and others who have actually that scales
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:51.520]  the whole market it's like when Walmart carries your product it's sad I mean we
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:56.960]  make them cave in it's over we'll be back GCN radio network
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:02.600]  here's a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs cocaine production
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.880]  plummets after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website theantimedia.org
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:10.240]  according to data released by the United Nations cocaine production in that
[02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:14.000]  country declined by 11% in the past year making the fourth year in a row of
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.480]  steady decrease it was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:21.240]  Bolivia and only three years after that progress was finally made the strategy
[02:30:21.240 --> 02:30:24.760]  employed by the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:28.960]  did not involve strong armed police state tactics instead they work to find
[02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:32.200]  alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:36.160]  money Bolivia has adopted a policy where coca cultivation is allowed in
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.080]  traditional areas alongside alternative development and others said Antonio
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:43.680]  de Leo from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime the US is still involved in
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:46.640]  Afghanistan and look at the heroin production coming out of that area it
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:50.480]  has skyrocketed is the United States really against the war on drugs or is

[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:33.280]  situation going bonnie harry the food babe is with us i've got a bunch of
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.720]  medical food news cannabis news i want to run over with our anthony gucci
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:44.040]  already's here who's our food and health reporter in studio with bonnie
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.760]  harry the food babe launching another initiative let me ask you this question
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:54.840]  food babe talk about globalism or all these other things that are being pushed
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:00.280]  by the establishment once the people turn against them it doesn't matter how
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:04.920]  much support they put behind it it's over to me i keep saying this this really
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:09.720]  is the model of how to bring down so many other things that are being force
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:14.440]  fed from the top down all these initiatives coming to a head i mean
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.760]  sure monsanto shot down mandatory labeling in california other states but
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  just the process of the public being educated made them go out and make their
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.120]  right decision anyways so it doesn't matter if they stole those elections
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:29.640]  stole those those referendums which i think they did the evidence is
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:33.960]  overwhelming the battle in the court of public opinion
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.400]  is what is going to end up bringing them down so how do you expect this to now
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:41.480]  flesh out what do you think the next shoe to drop is and how do you think they're
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:45.400]  going to strike back so i think what's happening right
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:49.800]  now is you've got an interesting situation you've got major fast food
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.560]  chains losing money hand over fist every
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:56.520]  single quarter you've got the conventional food sector
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:01.240]  losing money or staying stagnant the only companies that are continuing to
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:05.400]  increase in growth or organic and natural and when they increase in growth
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.240]  or they increase in just consumer demand
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.000]  what i see happening now is these multi-billion-dollar
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.400]  conglomerates are actually buying up these corporations we've seen
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:21.160]  Hormel by applegate which is an organic sustainable
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:26.120]  meat brand we've got general mills by an annies we've just got coca-cola who's
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:29.720]  investing in suja juices that are the green juice company
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:34.840]  and so really these major corporations i don't know if they'll ever be gone in
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:37.720]  terms of like the big major food corporations
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:40.920]  or or if they're going to just continue to buy
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.160]  up consumers and eventually you know we're going to end up
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.000]  buying coca-cola products or pepsi products or general mills products
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.760]  because they're going to buy the entire organic food sector right now if you
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:56.120]  look at the capital just collectively between pepsi
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:00.280]  and coca-cola they could buy all of the organic food system today
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:04.600]  if they wanted to so that's pretty scary so that's how they're striking back
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:08.360]  and we see that with the tpp the multinational model they come in they
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.400]  buy them up then they change the rules and laws
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:14.920]  so you can't keep gmo out of your country and you can't label
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:18.840]  and so they buy it up then they change the laws and no matter how many companies
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:22.920]  we try to go patronize or support they just buy those up so that's
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:25.800]  that's how the empire is going to strike back
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.560]  that's exactly what's going to happen and and what we can do
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:33.800]  as consumers it's just shape their products and hold them accountable when
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:36.840]  they do buy these different organic and natural brands
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:40.520]  to make sure they don't change now some organic brands have changed
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:43.320]  dramatically when they've been bought by these bigger
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.080]  corporations i'll give you an example camels bought plum organics which is a
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:50.440]  baby food company was 100 organic and now they have
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:53.960]  non-organic meat products and dairy products in target
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.280]  so like people are buying plum thinking it was organic or healthier healthier
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:00.600]  than the alternative of gerber and other things
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:05.080]  but now they're they're watering down their food and so it's really important
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:08.600]  for us to always stay on our toes read ingredient labels
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:12.120]  and make sure these companies don't change their ingredients and practices
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:15.960]  after they've been bought by these major conglomerates
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:18.600]  one of the other big angles you're looking at right now and then i've got
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:22.360]  anthony gucciardi here with some breaking news to get your take on
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:25.800]  yeah the other big angles that i'm looking at right now is false
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.160]  advertising you know just this morning i learned of
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:33.000]  chipotle being sued in san francisco because
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.680]  they are under the impression consumers are under the impression that it's
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.120]  completely gmo free however their meat some of their
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:44.200]  meat is raised with gmo feed and then also they're still serving coca-cola
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:47.800]  that's full of gmo's and so consumers are now
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:51.720]  contacting lawyers and saying you know what it's not all gmo free this is
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.480]  this is false advertising and they're suing even the good guys that are trying
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:59.560]  to do the right thing and so i've seen that start to happen
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:03.480]  as well as i see what's happening right now within
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.520]  awareness that's happening in terms of understanding what's gmo free and what's
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.920]  not and and there's a lot of different false
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.440]  advertising going on i'll give you another example is boar's head products
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:18.920]  this is a major meat deli provider you see in every grocery store across
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:23.160]  america they have signs up because they want to jump on this bandwagon of no
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:26.680]  artificial ingredients and they have signs up that say no artificial colors
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:30.760]  but when you look at some of their meats they have artificial caramel coloring in
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:35.000]  it level three and level four that's considered a carcinogen by the national
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.920]  toxicology program that's tested these compounds within this
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:42.920]  ammonia-based dye that's widely used in the food industry and they're adding it
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:47.080]  to meat to color meat that you know loses its color because it's so
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:49.480]  processed
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.680]  so there's a lot of chameleon behavior going on absolutely people are trying to
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.280]  you know ride this wave and say they're natural say they're artificial free but
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:01.080]  they're not quite there yet and so it's up to us
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.000]  you know activists and other consumers who are becoming aware about all these
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.240]  different intricacies to like speak up and make sure people know about it
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:12.360]  anthony get your you've got a bunch of news basically integrated into what
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:15.560]  she's saying i do have a lot of news and also i want to say there is a lot of
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:19.000]  deception and labeling for example i've pointed out before
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.360]  someone can call something like an organic line i could say anthony's
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.320]  organics and that could just be a registered trademark it doesn't
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:27.880]  actually mean it's an organic product so that's another thing
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:31.480]  i've seen products called you know such and such organics when it's actually
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  not even organic ingredients in it but i think just eating well and trying to
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.000]  eat organic and trying not to eat total crap you're already
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.840]  better than 98 percent of the population you know just drinking clean water
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.360]  real purified water yeah that's one attack i hear is oh none of it's perfect
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:49.320]  you can never do it just go with everything bad that used to be my
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.840]  attitude no no we change it by trying to make our
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:54.920]  lives better and others lives better incrementally
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.200]  exactly because listening to all this it's super overwhelming for the
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:01.400]  average person the average person doesn't even know really what a gmo is
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:05.000]  or how to know if they're eating gmos so when we talk about all these things the
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.040]  corporations are doing buying up all these organic companies which is going
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.680]  on it's almost impossible to catch every little
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:13.880]  angle even with these things like the registered trademarks where it says joe's
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.880]  organics and it's not even organic but just buying organic and trying your
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:20.440]  best to be healthy is key and i think it is
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:23.160]  motivational to think about how much you're avoiding because look at this
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.640]  study study gmo soy accumulates cancer causing for maldehyde this is a new
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:31.160]  study in a groundbreaking new study published in the peer reviewed journal
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:34.360]  agricultural sciences researchers have found that when soy is
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:37.480]  genetically engineered it disrupts the plant's natural ability to control
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:41.400]  stress and sparks the production of carcinogenic for maldehyde
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:45.160]  the new research led by mit trend biologists the researchers discovered
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:48.280]  that the accumulation of maldehyde the known carcinogen
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:52.360]  and a dramatic depletion of glutathione which is essential for your overall
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:55.320]  production of the liver an antioxidant necessary for cellular
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:58.760]  detoxification is a result of genetic tinkering with soy plants so they're
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:02.120]  messing with with soy modifying it they admit they
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:04.600]  don't know what's happening they admit they don't know what's going on
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:08.360]  former epa scientists are voicing their opposition against this everyone is
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.680]  freaking out about this new study and we're still sitting here eating it
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.760]  we know it's causing from maldehyde to develop in the accumulation when they
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:19.160]  mess with the soy but we're still eating it
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:23.160]  that's why like alex was saying earlier we're being forced to import soy from
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:28.040]  romania because it organic soy because people aren't buying the gmo's anymore
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:32.280]  the house of cards is crumbling we are definitely crazy the only farmers we
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:34.760]  know because we're in farming and ranching family business
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:41.560]  still is organics real organic and you got to get the certifications
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:44.760]  and there'll be farmers going out of business because all they know how to
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:49.160]  do is deal with monsanto or archer daniels midland they don't know
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.840]  that the free market is the way for them out because you'll go to the
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:56.200]  farmers market you'll go to one of these
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:00.360]  uh you know events where they got the blue ribbon pigs and the rest of it
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.920]  the fair and it's all sponsored by monsanto and it's only their farmers
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.920]  that are there so they are using the ignorance of folks to
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:13.080]  continue this and america is exceptional in that we are
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:16.840]  exceptionally unhealthy we have exceptional amounts of gmo
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:21.080]  vani harry i've seen the statistics but aren't we in the top two or three
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:25.160]  worse nations for additives and gmo don't we lead the world
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:30.760]  in a gmo toxic dumping ground no absolutely and we're one of the only
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:34.920]  countries that doesn't label gmo's even though 65 other countries do russia
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:39.800]  china india most of uh you know some countries i just
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:43.640]  went to tanzania and rwanda they don't even allow gmo's to be
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:46.040]  grown there and they're getting a lot of pressure to be
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.560]  from their neighboring countries to grow it and from monsanto and it's it's
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:53.640]  you know going to those countries that people think like people are starving
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:57.880]  and people are really worse off without gmo's going there and actually
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:01.320]  visiting and seeing how they farm and seeing what they're doing
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:05.800]  is really inspiring because not only do they have an amazing biodiversity of
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.800]  so many different crops not just corn and soy and canola but like
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:14.200]  everything under the sun from cabbage to avocados to carrots and everything
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:16.920]  being grown there that they can i mean they're like
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:20.440]  they're absolutely had the most rich soil and if
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.480]  i can't even imagine sweet potatoes roses you know most the roses you get it
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.160]  from africa i mean yeah i mean i can't even
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.880]  imagine the devastation that would happen if they started this
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:36.600]  monoculture type crops there that would just degrade the soil
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:40.760]  um time after time and just strip it of all that's amazing nutrients and so
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:44.360]  it's really inspiring to see some of these countries like buy back and say
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:48.840]  no to monsanto and it's it's really great that that's happening but
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:52.920]  we're we're like you know what's what's really crazy to me
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:57.080]  is that we are one of the countries that has the most rights out of any
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:00.760]  citizens across the globe and the right that we don't have is a right to know
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:04.280]  what's in our food and they go beyond that though they'll ban our right to
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:06.440]  know what's in our food with the dark act which
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.480]  past the house and is now going to be voted on next month by the senate
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:13.480]  which says literally mandatory labeling of gmo's
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.560]  will be illegal and that was pushed by the very representatives that are paid
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.360]  off yeah that's in case the state does have a referendum and says no we're
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:22.680]  going to label yeah the feds are saying no you can't
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.360]  which texas may do i mean vermont already has it mandatory gmo labeling so
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:29.800]  this will be the feds coming in and saying no you're not allowed to know if
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:34.040]  gmo's are in your food period and this is everyone and everyone needs to know if
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:37.400]  their senator votes for that that they are complete traders to american
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:39.800]  rights well you know it's the number one trend i saw
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:43.320]  earlier on facebook of all billions and billions of boasts it's the number one
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:46.120]  trend right now and it makes you wonder well gee how are these people doing
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:49.480]  this is because they're obviously not acting in our best interests meanwhile
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:52.840]  we have articles like monsanto kicked out of Greece and Latvia
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:56.520]  gm ban sweep throughout europe i mean europe is done with this scotland and
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:59.880]  germany recently booted gmo's out of their country citing fear of gmo crops
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.000]  contaminating their food supplies and concern over putting their food and
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:07.080]  beverage industries in jeopardy now Greece and Latvia are telling monsanto
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.720]  exactly what they can do with their gmo crops the tide is turning a tipping point
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:15.000]  just became evident through new actions of two additional european countries who
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.800]  have had enough of the biotech strong arm and the
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:22.360]  africans used to love the west when they saw the western medicine men
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:27.800]  you know 60 70 80 years ago but now the african leaders say we know you're
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.560]  stacking traits in there with your terminator genetics and others that
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:35.400]  are going to end our agriculture and the africans are reading statements to
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:39.320]  shareholders from 10 years ago and more from monsanto admitting
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:43.800]  the plan is a genetic monopoly so the africans understand we get seeds out of
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:47.240]  what we plant over and over again you're conquering us with this
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:52.520]  we don't want it and then our media goes dumb africans don't want our free food
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:55.640]  well yeah because they take the vaccines and get sterilized
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.320]  they've already experienced how wondrous it all is
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.080]  to be under this they don't want to be destroyed and they also attack the
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.200]  argentinians because the argentinian children would develop these massive
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.640]  tumors being around the monsanto gm of sore fields and things like that and
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:12.600]  they always go oh they're crazy they're third world idiots they don't know what
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:15.560]  they're talking about the villagers but they believe in myths they think their
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:20.680]  gods are doing it yeah they actually they actually accuse them of
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:25.880]  mishandling their chemicals right like mishandling their chemicals like
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:30.120]  first of all if the chemical is harmless you if you miss it i mean it's
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.400]  just it's so ridiculous what they've done to an entire
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:36.200]  truth is it gets in the well water it gets in the well water
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.640]  yeah and was that part you're gonna finish
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:42.520]  yeah so this is a new study i got a bunch of studies today it seems like a
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:45.720]  new one comes out every day study children exposed to gm of soy
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:50.440]  pesticides suffer serious genetic damage a 2015 study has shown that
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:52.920]  children exposed to pesticides used to grow gm
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:55.880]  soy suffer serious genetic damage research for
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:47:58.840]  wait a minute you mean weed killer might not be good for my children yeah who
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.400]  would have thought right oh you're crazy you're insane the
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.840]  argentinians are crazy researchers from the national university of rio
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:08.440]  quarto cordoba compared children who lived close to a gm
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:12.040]  soy field growing area in argentina to children who lived in another city in
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:15.160]  cordoba that was not adjacent to gm soy fields
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.560]  genetic damage in the group of exposed children was 44 percent higher than in
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:23.400]  the unexposed children living less than 500 meters from crops
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.160]  routinely sprayed with glyphosate and other pesticides they had serious
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:30.280]  serious genetic damage amazing and we're going to be back in the next
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:32.840]  segment and finish up with these news items before we do that i wanted to have
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:36.600]  vani harry the food babe finish up launching our new initiative last week
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.200]  already having an effect last week he wrote an article drugs picked it up
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:44.040]  uh had been out for a day and then and then they responded about the inhumane
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.440]  killing of the chickens another example there
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:49.800]  they've gone from an arrogant wall of invincibility vani
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:54.520]  to now really responding uh that is just so exciting i guess gandhi's right
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:59.000]  first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you then you win
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.680]  vani in closing in the next few minutes what else is on your radar and
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:07.080]  what can we do to get uh the the biggest uh you as you said fast food chain
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:11.160]  out there in the u.s at least subway to get the antibiotics out of their meat
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:16.600]  yeah you know 23 000 people die every single year in the united states 700
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:19.480]  thousand worldwide because of this issue because of
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:24.200]  superbugs we're being exposed to it in our water in our soil and in our food
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.520]  and we really have an obligation as consumers as
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:33.800]  humans to protect antibiotics so that when we want to have them we want to use
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:37.160]  them to fight off super or any type of bugs we
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:41.240]  should be able to do that and right now we're in situations where that's just
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:44.920]  not possible a million americans are affected every single year by this
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:48.120]  issue my dad personally was affected by this issue was
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.840]  you know was um affected by antibiotic resistant bacteria when you use that
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:56.920]  number you're you're using their number i mean it's a lot higher than that
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:00.840]  yeah well yeah i am using their number so who really knows what the real figure
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.600]  is and what they might be hiding from us but i'll tell you this you know
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:07.960]  i was talking to the former general of the u.s army
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:12.600]  westley clark at uh the democratic national convention a few years ago
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:16.280]  and he said to me i said to him you know what's the biggest food issue for you
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:20.440]  and this is a u.s army guy right like a smart guy you expect some like basic
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:23.800]  kind of response but he said it's this issue he said
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:27.800]  that if we don't address this this could wipe out the human race and that is
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:31.800]  really the truth and so we all need to go
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:37.560]  ask subway to submit a formal policy first of all to open up the discussion
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:40.440]  so that we can learn about what they're doing because they're they're making
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:44.760]  these very vague statements that you know make us cautiously optimistic that
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:49.160]  they are are listening but we really need to see a formal statement like
[02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:52.440]  their competitors you need to see a capitulation to life
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:55.880]  and join the life wing not the death wing food babes thank you so much we'll

[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:36.360]  because we were able to expand build the new studios hire more crew
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:41.240]  with the revenue coming in from the sales and info war store.com
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:47.560]  info wars life.com prisonplanet.tv subscriptions and outside advertising
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:51.240]  the country's in freefall advertising revenues down across the board

[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:58.280]  so we're doing okay in the face of this depression but
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:04.440]  really don't have the money to expand and finish going on television
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:07.480]  this will reach incredible amounts of people this is the best bang for the
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:10.360]  buck it'll be self funding once we get on more
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.960]  tv stations u-h-f v-h-f which are already
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:17.240]  turning us on it's officially i haven't announced the coordinates and
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:20.280]  done the rollout yet i'll do that on the 16th but
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:23.720]  stations are already there it's already happening so i want to thank them
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:27.240]  but people understand used to do this on like a hardcore show now
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:30.440]  people go i guess this stuff's true we better put it on air

[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:38.520]  normally you're flipping through you come to three hour show of this
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:42.360]  or the nightly news people are like what in tarnations is this

[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.640]  and they say it's going to alternative media all that means is competition
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:57.000]  and we are the biggest slice of that competition
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.160]  and we're here to shake things up and what we do goes a long way so

[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:18.680]  plug for maybe one minute in the first hour i'm the worst
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:24.920]  at actually plugging and trying to fund us speaking of drug resistant bugs and
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:27.720]  stuff i personally have my backup coil silver
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:33.000]  silver bullet at infowarslife.com we have some other specials 10% off
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:36.520]  one of our hottest products methylcobalamin vitamin b12
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:40.200]  that's 10% off right now you talk about clean good energy
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:43.480]  that's what it does for me briefly Anthony Gutiarty before we go to break
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:47.080]  come back with five minutes on more news then Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson are
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:50.440]  coming in with some huge breaking intel the situation in
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:53.960]  Houston and the war on police at the White House is running
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:57.720]  tell us why secret 12 is so special while i take some
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:02.120]  secret 12 is awesome because it's methylcobalamin which is the medical grade
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:05.160]  b12 that you would usually inject with yourself into yourself
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:07.640]  but obviously you don't inject it you take it under the tongue and then it has
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:10.760]  adenosylcobalamin which are two of the most bioavailable
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:14.760]  bioactive forms of b12 and there's a ton of it in it it's it's mega bang for
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:17.960]  your buck i mean just to get into it it's 41 000 of
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:21.640]  daily value so this is a super form of b12 that is
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:24.760]  super powerful super it's not synthetic it's alive it's not
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:28.120]  synthetic i've tried this there's no sugar in it sweetest thing ever tasted
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:32.600]  yes it is pure b12 methylcobalamin adenosylcobalamin
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:36.360]  powerfully bioactive and i've tried the synthetics i've even
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:39.320]  tried the injectable synthetics just to see the difference and i can tell you
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.080]  the synthetics make me feel lethargic it make me feel gross we did it
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:45.880]  together yeah we wouldn't saw we wouldn't saw one medical
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:48.040]  doctor i wouldn't saw another one of them gave you synthetic
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:52.200]  other one of them gave you real b12 which is literally made from cyanide
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:56.200]  by the way yeah a derivative a base of it so anyway nothing for me
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:59.400]  it made me feel like crap but this actually makes me feel good
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:02.120]  remember you had 10 bottles of it they gave you through a nine
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:05.000]  yeah i don't even want this and they're expensive too
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.800]  the injectable stuff you get from the doctor is like a hundred dollars
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:11.320]  what this is this is 10 off right now in info wars life.com
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:13.960]  i use it every day just put it in my protein shake or you put it in a glass
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:16.520]  of water or take it right away to get a bigger effect under the tongue but i
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:20.360]  just put it in water i mean it's amazing and and this is a
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:22.520]  product we never really pushed or promoted it's true it's already one of
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:25.800]  the top sellers because it sells anyway because people try it and they go oh my
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:28.360]  gosh no one has ever put out a bottom of b12 we
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:31.400]  know like this no it's absolutely the most bioavailable
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:33.240]  out there i i love it i take it every single day

[02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:56.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:56.280 --> 03:00:08.200]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:12.200]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.200]  the ar-bac live final segment i'm going to be hosting when anthony gets you
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:27.480]  already then joe biggs and jacari jackson are coming in the studio to break down the race war
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:32.280]  the media is starting and now police chief sheriffs and others are saying this is the
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:37.000]  white house running this which is good because it's true that means they may back off but
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:44.520]  it lets you know what a reckless crazy revolutionary government we've got run by a bunch of billionaires
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:48.520]  that wants to have some class warfare breakdown where we all kill each other
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:52.040]  do you think america is dumb enough to buy into this anthony
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:56.680]  i don't think america is dumb enough to buy into it i think a lot of americans are force fed
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:00.840]  and ideology they don't even believe in but they think everyone else believes in it so they want
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:06.040]  to fit in with the pack with the herd but what they don't realize is it's a facade it's artificial
[03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:10.120]  facade it's an artificial mind prison that is pushed like that video you played earlier from
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:14.200]  mtv that's absolutely insane no one in the right mind would agree with that i think if you polled
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:19.080]  people 99% would disagree but they see it on tv they think it's big they think it's cool
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:24.440]  they think they're in the movie entourage where everyone is just in la and it's awesome and holly
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:28.520]  was cool and everyone's so cool and we want to be well hollywood is collapsing yeah meanwhile
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:32.600]  it's totally disgusting over there they don't realize that though they it's a facade they want
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:36.360]  to be part of it they don't want to be looked at by their peers as an outcast that's why so many
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:40.600]  people are afraid to voice their actual views i mean if you went to a grocery store how uncomfortable
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:44.600]  would you feel saying hey uh sir that's that's gmo you know most people will never do that they
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:48.600]  want they they know it's bad but they don't want to be outcast by people by the way i see a pregnant
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:52.840]  woman with her husband on the street i stop and say look into vaccines i've seen you do read read
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.880]  the insert and my family kind of gets tired of they go oh my gosh can my kids can you just stop
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:02.120]  they used to now they get it and they warn people you tell everybody that's the difference you're
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:05.240]  willing to talk to anybody and i'm willing to talk to most people well here's the thing
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:10.520]  if i'm late or something i won't do it but i am not aiding and abetting the enemy if i
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:14.760]  i don't want to spend my time and warn somebody and have them laugh at me or whatever but i got to
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:20.280]  do it to help them or it's on me i mean if i do people were drinking some poison out of a well
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.320]  i have to tell them it was poison in it well it's always weird when we talk to people because
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.840]  you'll be like hey that fluoride is bad for you in the top one it's not true you'll you'll
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.840]  reference studies from harvard and everything that that can't be true and then they look it up and
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:36.120]  they freak out people either don't know or they just pretend to be part of the ideology that
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:41.240]  and exactly by the way i'm not in people's business i hear gunshots at the neighbor's house or whatever
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:46.120]  you know out in the country i don't call the cops if i if stuff's going i i i mind my own business
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:50.200]  but it's my business and people are poisoning themselves because it's going to come back on
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:54.040]  me and my family i have a responsibility to warn people or how about if you let your kids hang out
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.720]  with some other family and they serve a bunch of junk to them or you know give them whatever so
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:01.320]  you should go take your vaccinations and do this and this and this it is your friend it is your
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:04.760]  business my children go to a great school you know they were homeschooled for a long time but they
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:09.240]  wanted to play sports and things they got to a nice little private school great people but still
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:15.080]  some of the kids there tell them oh you don't take vaccines you're going to die it's illegal not to
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:19.560]  take vaccines it just shows the brainwashing right from the other kids it doesn't even it doesn't
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:22.920]  even matter whether or not we're going to talk about the health issues of the vaccinations it's
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:28.280]  your choice to do it or not do it but overall i think people don't buy into any of these ideologies
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:32.840]  i don't think people buy into that mtv video i think it's just contrived and it makes it seem
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:37.240]  like everyone thinks it's true when it's on television because it's a magic box illuminated
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:42.360]  in front of you sure and the government is saying that cops inherently are racist and want to kill
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:49.000]  everybody again mindlessly applying it to a group setting the standard that the media is god just
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:53.880]  like obama says i'm going to alaska i'm going to change the name of a of a mountain since when
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:58.120]  can the president do that since when does the first lady tell us what our kids need at school
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:02.280]  and i bet that guy that killed the cop is going to have something to say about it oh you know
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:06.840]  well black lives matter remember that one guy that was tried for like raping a woman or whatever
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:10.680]  and he's like black lives matter well another guy killed the two white kids and then said the same
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:14.280]  thing it's it's totally insane it means nothing but they think that they have people on their side
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.120]  with that one in reality well it's like the clan getting filled with the same rhetoric but just
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:22.440]  against another group would think well this is a black guy so i had to lynch him yeah it's it's
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:27.080]  wasn't black you know i mean it's white cop i had to shoot him it's artificial racism it's not even
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:31.480]  there it's there's not even real racism right now it's all artificial in the sense there's obviously
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:36.360]  real racism but the the race were artificial mindset of black lives matter and all that is contrived
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.360]  well that's coming up and they've got the clips the latest pigs in a blanket fry them up pigs with

[03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:16.840]  live below the poverty line is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the

[03:08:45.640 --> 03:08:50.360]  talk to him about this recent shooting how he reacted to that and also some of the other things
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:54.040]  that are going on in other departments that we see around the country whether that's around
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:58.600]  in ferguson or up in washington with some of these other shenanigans going on so we'll talk
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:03.160]  about all that and also one of the things that we want to talk about before we go too much further
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:09.160]  is the info wars money bomb that's coming up it's coming up very soon the 16th 17th it's going to be
[03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:15.080]  a 24 hour excuse me 27 hour broadcast i'm going to be on the course joe biggs i'm really interested
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:20.840]  to see what joe biggs is going to say because he he he does a lot of kind of co-hosting but
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:25.640]  when you get into that host chair joe what do you think you're going to be talking about well
[03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:29.800]  i'm going to try to get some exciting guests on you know i've got three hours to cover and it's
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:34.920]  going to be during the peak hours of midnight to three a.m so it should be interesting those are
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:38.840]  always the interesting hours you know because i'm sure we're going to get some very interesting
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:44.200]  callers coming in with some uh highly entertaining topics to discuss so yeah that that midnight to
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:48.760]  three or i guess pretty much uh that midnight to around five or six you get very interesting
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:53.160]  callers i mean on anything if you have a local radio station and those are always the people
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:58.280]  who come in have very uh interesting things to say yeah exactly so it will be fun and like
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:04.200]  you said we're trying to raise a million dollars so we can reach 400 million and essentially help
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:08.600]  widen this broadcast so we can reach more people get more people awake so they can find out what's
[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:12.440]  going on and it's amazing the amount of people we're already reaching at this point in time just
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:19.240]  imagine the 400 million people getting informed on a daily basis about what's going on in the world
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:23.640]  truly not the lies that the mainstream media is telling you and it's very exciting because we've
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:28.760]  seen a lot of growth on twitter on facebook on youtube the alex jones channel is growing and
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:33.800]  we definitely encourage you to subscribe to that but enough of all all that so let's talk about
[03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:37.480]  some of the issues that are going on i know we're talking a little bit off camera about some gun
[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:42.760]  issues and we have this article that's on info wars dot com it's one of the top articles new york
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:49.800]  times barrow massive gun grab the only way to impact violent crime so you know joe as much as
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:54.040]  these people these gun grabbers say that we don't want to take your guns they're saying right here
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:57.880]  we want to take your guns just like you weren't there but it was before you worked here we went
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:02.200]  out to the alamo and out alex gave that speech and they said nobody's trying to take your guns
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:07.560]  why simultaneously handing you a flyer saying let's ban assault weapons it's like we don't
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.400]  want to take your guns like it says here on this paper that you want to take our guns away well
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:16.040]  the interesting thing about it is the growth of social media the fact that people are so informed
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:21.640]  quickly now about what's going on versus how it used to be before you know twitter facebook all that
[03:11:21.640 --> 03:11:26.680]  so it seems like there's a lot more gun violence going on when at the in actuality a lot of the
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:31.240]  stuff's pretty much the same it's just that now everyone's got a camera with a phone with a camera
[03:11:31.240 --> 03:11:35.400]  in it everyone can upload to twitter really quick instagram whatever it may be and get something
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:39.080]  out that normally people wouldn't even hear about it would be covered in the news but because social
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:45.800]  media is so strong these outlets are being forced a force to cover these different shooting scenarios
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:50.680]  and things like that and of course you're going to have people out there like virginia try to use
[03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:56.280]  an incredibly horrible situation that happened and hijack it to use it to push gun control
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:01.160]  yes because just that point you brought up what used to be a local news story can easily become a
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:06.600]  national if not international news story overnight and it's very unfortunate these incidents happen
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:12.120]  but when you have a situation like i think it was back in 2012 a 12-year-old oklahoma girl
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:16.760]  somebody broke into her home she was home alone she shot the guy that wasn't you know international
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:21.560]  news that a young lady used a firearm to defend herself or any of these other situations and i
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:26.200]  know you know this very well with this recent shooting at the recruiting offices you know
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:30.360]  yes that did get a lot of media attention but they quickly dropped it because they didn't want to
[03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:35.800]  talk about that this building full of highly trained men weren't able to protect themselves in the
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:39.880]  gun-free zone sign on the door didn't stop a single bullet that i'm aware of yeah and then you have
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:44.200]  the the department of the army coming out releasing statements saying that it's a security threat for
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:47.960]  patriots for people to go out there and stand guard because they feel it's their their obligation
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:53.640]  as an american citizen to go out and help protect the ones that aren't able to protect themselves
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:56.760]  it's just like if you're driving down the road and you see someone being beat you're going to pull
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:00.680]  over and help that person it's so ridiculous joe when we're talking about the people who can't
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:04.440]  protect themselves these are our military men exactly they shouldn't be a soft target
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:09.640]  why are we making them it blows my mind and when we went out there you spent more time than i did
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:14.040]  but we went out there and people's wives would come up to us you'd say hey my husband can't come
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:17.320]  out here and say anything to you officially but i just want to say i really appreciate they're
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:22.760]  trying to buy us donuts and pizzas and want to take us out you know wherever to the steakhouse yeah
[03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:27.160]  yeah but you know it's interesting there's another article up right now actually by
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:33.080]  steve watson info wars dot com poll 60 of americans against more gun control more than two
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:37.560]  thirds say shootings are a mental problem and that's one of the big issues is the fact that
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:42.600]  there is a mental problem going on that you have these doctors who push these psychotropic drugs
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:49.480]  and they don't ever have to to be responsible for those actions of those drugs the adverse
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:54.040]  reactions i used to have to take that stuff when i was in the military it made me suicidal it made
[03:13:54.040 --> 03:13:58.920]  me crazy out of my mind and the day that i flushed that stuff down the toilet i never once
[03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:05.080]  acted out again i never once got crazy that stuff is bad and that's what we need to stop we need to
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:09.880]  stop worrying about banning guns we need to start getting to the root of problems and getting rid of
[03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:15.080]  these drugs that really make people go mental and yeah because everybody says well you know you
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:19.720]  all these guns people kill each other i mean king leonidus in the 300s as we all know they
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:24.760]  use rocket launchers and ak-47s no they went out there with swords and spears and they killed
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:30.360]  people shots yeah it's whatever works it's banning the gun is not going to eliminate the problem i
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:34.760]  just saw this article today i can't recall if it was on drudge or not but it's about a woman who
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:39.240]  drowned two of her kids in a bathtub in like the third one escaped and got away are you gonna ban
[03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:44.040]  the bathtub now of course not you understand that this was an incident of a mentally ill person i
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:47.800]  don't know if she was on drugs or not but a mentally ill person who used whatever was in
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:52.680]  her means to commit her offense i mean yeah i mean just just imagine a world where there are no guns
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:58.360]  back in biblical times when there was anything like that can't enable yeah use a rock i mean
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:02.280]  someone's gonna find someone someone has ill intention someone has hate in their heart and
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:10.040]  they really want to cross that line from sanity to just going you know back crazy and doing something
[03:15:10.040 --> 03:15:13.560]  they'll do it if there's no gun they're gonna i mean you could literally i could use this microphone
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:18.760]  and just bludgeon someone yeah so i mean we're but we ban microphones and we had the the article
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:22.680]  i think was a couple years ago that blunt objects like hammers and baseball bats we're killing
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:27.560]  record numbers of people fbi's own number you're more likely to be stabbed to death and shot with
[03:15:27.560 --> 03:15:33.880]  a real assault rifle you know at least in this country yeah i just don't get people's logic when
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:38.520]  it comes to that people when one of these tragedies happens people start thinking with their emotions
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:42.040]  they're not using facts they're not sitting back and going all right how's this going to affect
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:47.480]  us as a country if we really do try to ban guns now you're taking someone's right to protect
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:51.800]  themselves or property and their family away from them because of a few bad people out there who've
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:56.760]  made bad decisions and the bad people aren't going to give up their guns no exactly that's why
[03:15:56.760 --> 03:16:01.400]  they are criminals by definition yeah and anybody says they say they point out someplace like the
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:07.480]  uk well we took the guns away well uk also has our numbers of muggings home invasions all this
[03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:12.360]  other stuff just because these offenses aren't being committed at the same numbers with firearms
[03:16:12.360 --> 03:16:16.600]  these crimes are still happening and the flip side of that you look at someplace like Mexico
[03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:21.560]  where it has very low civilian gun ownership but the cartels obviously didn't get that memo
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:25.560]  they're riding around with guns you know hanging journalists from flagpoles and doing all types of
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:29.720]  crazy things yeah criminals love gun control and that's all that's going to do is give them an edge
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:33.880]  in the game yeah you're going to give them that upper hand that they need to continue to go out
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:37.960]  and do stuff because if i'm a criminal and i'm sitting down in my car driving through and i'm
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:42.040]  going to you know do a home invasion if i know everyone on this block doesn't have a gun i'm
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:45.720]  going to feel pretty good my odds are pretty good this guy might have a baseball bat i might have to
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:49.720]  do a couple ducking and dodging but at the end of the day if i can dodge that first swing i can
[03:16:49.720 --> 03:16:54.520]  you know put around them so that's how they're going to think i need to be i want to know that
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:16:59.320]  when i'm at home and i hear something bang or knock over in the door open up i can go out there
[03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:05.800]  have my firearm and be responsible i don't have to shoot the guy but i can at least show that gun
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:10.920]  and make that guy rethink his decision about coming into my home and turn away yeah and that's
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:15.560]  a lot of times that people forget it is a deterrent you don't always have to shoot the guy because
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:20.680]  they go out they watch james bond shoot somebody 300 yards away with a little ppk i mean it doesn't
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:24.680]  really work like that in real life you know you can just pull a gun out on somebody who's entering
[03:17:24.680 --> 03:17:29.320]  your home and they say whoa it's really not that serious anymore yeah they're going to rethink their
[03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:33.000]  life decisions at that point in time they're going to find god really quick and they're going to get
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:37.560]  out of there yeah and they're going to hopefully make the right decision to never do that again
[03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:41.320]  because they've been given a second chance you know everyone thinks that if you have this gun
[03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:45.960]  you're going to automatically just be pulling the trigger i have a gun with me all the time and i
[03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:50.600]  don't have any desire to wave it around do anything it's there purely for my protection
[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:54.280]  and if i were to see something happen like an active shooter situation and i was there and
[03:17:54.280 --> 03:17:59.720]  i had my concealed i can help the situation out because when seconds count some police officers
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:03.400]  aren't going to be able to be there until after it's too late and then there's a body count yeah
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:08.440]  and that's not knocking the police no just saying they can't be everywhere at every time and what
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:14.360]  you're talking about people with these firearms one of the big arguments against open carry is
[03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:19.000]  that if it's legal everybody's going to do it well my home state of oklahoma passed it back in
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:24.440]  2013 i believe is when it came law became law and when i go home you know christmas or you know
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:31.320]  summertime i went here in may i've seen since it passed in 2013 two people open carry who weren't
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:36.280]  police officers it's not some big deal you know if you want to i'm glad you have that right to do so
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:40.040]  but it's not the thing that everybody's gonna run out and do it yeah i mean i have the ability
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:44.520]  to open carry all over the place but i mean i don't do it i use good judgment i mean we we do a lot
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:49.720]  of open carry marches you and i and a lot of the the people around here in texas and it's more
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:56.680]  for opening dialogue with people people who don't quite understand anything about guns we can use
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:01.400]  that as a platform when we go out there and we we we walk around and we use good judgment you know
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:05.320]  we don't have our hands on the trigger it's at the low ready pointed down we're not having it up in
[03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:09.880]  the air the muzzle flashing around you know we're trying to do the right thing we engage in conversation
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:13.320]  and speak to people about the second amendment at the end of the day we usually open up a lot of
[03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:18.120]  eyes and inform a lot of people on subjects like because i guess there's a lot of a stigma from
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:22.040]  people who haven't actually been to one of these rallies or actually seen it in their city so you
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:25.720]  know somebody on la or whatever who's never encountered something like this they think it's
[03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:30.680]  you know people running in fear for their lives i mean i've been to conservative number 20 open
[03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:35.160]  carry rallies i've never seen anybody run in fear for their life there's some people may cross the
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:40.680]  street but nobody runs up and like the world's about to end none of that's going on so when we

[03:26:11.880 --> 03:26:16.680]  bottles he showed me everything that he had he didn't even know that we had a tv show slash radio
[03:26:16.680 --> 03:26:21.480]  show wow that he was being given the products the info wars life products by the fire department
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:25.480]  down the road and that's what got him on there so he just had the link to the store and i was like

[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:50.120]  country so definitely check that out info warshop.com now we have this clip that we alluded to earlier
[03:26:50.120 --> 03:26:54.920]  the new york times barrow and whenever the guys are ready we can run that clip and this is basically
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:26:58.920]  a clip of we hear all these people saying we don't want to ban your guns this is somebody saying we
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:02.600]  want to ban your guns and it's not just this guy i mean he's some some pundit i mean but you have
[03:27:02.600 --> 03:27:09.000]  people like feinstein you have guys like bloomberg and everybody else holder running these things
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:12.520]  and they say they want to take your guns away or brainwash you into thinking about your firearms
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:17.160]  in a drastically different way so i believe we have that clip let's go ahead and take a look um
[03:27:17.160 --> 03:27:21.400]  hillary clinton made her comments about gun reform what do you make of that i'll start with you josh
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:25.480]  well i mean it's the it's what i would expect a democratic presidential candidate to say but you
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:29.960]  know if hillary clinton becomes president she will be a president facing a republican house at least
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:34.600]  possibly also a republican senate so i you know i i don't think that there will be significant change
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:39.400]  in gun policy if hillary clinton is president i mean we already have a democratic president now
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:43.080]  and we haven't had significant change on it but i would also note the things that we talk about in
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:47.480]  the united states are so at the margins on this stuff that i i wonder about how much they would
[03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:51.800]  really impact gun violence if you did something like australia did where you really take away
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:56.760]  massive amounts of guns that people have reduced the rate of gun ownership substantially in society
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:01.800]  you could have a big impact on on violent crime but i mean changes with with background checks
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:05.960]  will will help at the margin but i wouldn't expect that to have big impacts well didn't this last
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:11.880]  shooter pass a background check he went to a retail store a local gun retail store like an academy
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:15.880]  sports or whatever it may be went through the exact paperwork that i would have to go to you
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:21.400]  just recently and more to that you were there you were witness to this i just bought a Glock at a
[03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:27.000]  gun show what was it two weeks ago and i sat down there and did paperwork this gun show loophole you
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:31.560]  can go i went in there i'll put i have a concealed carry license and i had to fill out paperwork
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:35.240]  for this firearm yeah exactly i watch you fill it out they call it in to make sure that everything
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:41.720]  was copacetic everything's good the call comes back through you're good to go yeah i mean so
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:46.440]  you know the virginia may are coming out saying that we need these stiffer background checks i mean
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:49.960]  that that's not going to do anything at the end of the day all you're going to do when they when
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:54.280]  they do a massive gun sweep you know what's going to affect you and i the law-abiding citizens
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:57.720]  it's not going to affect their criminals who are going to get nobody's coming to take take your guns
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:02.440]  like they didn't do it door to door during hurricane Katrina a abc news you can go google that right
[03:29:02.440 --> 03:29:07.160]  now and see how they have the police and national guard going door to door taking people's houses
[03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:11.400]  i think they even punched some old lady in the face to get her little uh you know revolver
[03:29:11.400 --> 03:29:15.960]  whatever she had on her just completely ridiculous and am i saying it's imminent is it going to
[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:20.280]  happen next week no i'm not anticipating that to happen next week i'm just saying it has
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.600]  happened before and that's not something we want to see happen again especially with

[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:37.960]  down in harris county that's in the houston area a very short section of his biography
[03:33:38.520 --> 03:33:43.480]  he joined the united states marine corps in july of 1981 as an infantry marine
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:48.920]  he also had experience as a black and hispanic with the black and hispanic gangs and the mexican
[03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:54.360]  mafia this is uh investigating them and it led him to become a california superior court qualified
[03:33:54.360 --> 03:33:59.880]  expert on gangs and narcotics this is just a very short section of his biography and we definitely
[03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:04.760]  thank him for joining us today how you doing today carl i'm doing excellent how are you gentlemen
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:11.320]  doing very well very well so um before we get into anything else we know that we had this shooting
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:15.640]  that happened just this past week and very unfortunate uh very cowardly act to walk up to
[03:34:15.640 --> 03:34:19.640]  somebody and shoot them when they weren't expecting it at the gas station of all places
[03:34:19.640 --> 03:34:26.520]  so what is your initial reaction to that carl well you know i being a professional peace officer
[03:34:26.520 --> 03:34:32.600]  i've learned not to jump to conclusions but uh the very best thing that we can make out of this
[03:34:32.600 --> 03:34:39.880]  this was just a callous cowardly act uh and apparently targeted at uh deputy go forth uh
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:45.400]  for the very reason that he was simply wearing a uniform that's right and you know we've
[03:34:45.400 --> 03:34:49.800]  reported a lot on the police brutality other things going on in the country and i always try to
[03:34:49.800 --> 03:34:53.640]  put that disclaimer out there when i talk about police i'm not talking about all police officers
[03:34:53.640 --> 03:34:58.840]  i say that this officer that did this particular action are these officers that that may be the
[03:34:58.840 --> 03:35:03.720]  case but it's not all law enforcement and even for those officers that i have an issue with
[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:07.960]  it's no means to go up and shoot somebody in the back of the head you know that's definitely not
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:12.920]  the type of recourse that we want to see going on in our communities now carl so tell us a little
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:19.080]  bit about yourself and what makes you want to run for the sheriff's office down in the houston area
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:26.440]  well you know uh to cut straight to the chase uh i believe our country is in deep deep trouble
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:33.480]  and it is in deep trouble because many of our leaders have completely ignored the constitution
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:39.320]  and we are watching this from washington and trickle down through government we've seen this
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:47.400]  happened as you mentioned in my uh my bio there i uh am a veteran united states marine and i took
[03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:55.080]  an oath a long time ago actually when i was just 17 years old that that to protect and defend the
[03:35:55.080 --> 03:36:01.960]  constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestics and to provide
[03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:10.280]  you know the this idea that we in america have taken for granted everything we have and i think
[03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:16.840]  we've gotten soft and i think we need to return to law and order and i think that if we do these
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:23.160]  things we have a great opportunity to salvage america and bring it back again yeah we have this
[03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:27.160]  generation of entitlement that's coming up now where people feel like they should just be given
[03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:32.120]  everything no one really wants to work hard for anything and people just want to complain and
[03:36:32.120 --> 03:36:35.320]  you know everything needs to be politically correct people are afraid to kind of get up and
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:42.760]  stand up for something and really be what an american is truly all about okay that's exactly
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:49.160]  right now mr pitman so you you're a law enforcement officer is there anything that you see in the
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:55.160]  country as far as how certain situations have been reacted to you know namely ferguson or any other
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:37:00.360]  place around the country that you would if you have the power you would change as far as maybe
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:04.520]  engaging the public use of tear gas rubber bullets is that a all-purpose thing in your
[03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:10.040]  opinion or what are your thoughts on on that well you know i think long before it comes to that i think
[03:37:11.720 --> 03:37:19.240]  leadership and law enforcement must develop relationships with the public so we start to
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:25.480]  change this mentality that police officers are out there to simply harm them and put them in jail
[03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:31.720]  you know some of the ideas that i have is working with youngsters so that they never see the doors
[03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:36.920]  of our jails because i think that's a success uh there are some people out there that regardless
[03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:43.960]  of what we do we're not going to make them happy and uh so of course they're going to be anti-law
[03:37:43.960 --> 03:37:49.320]  enforcement and that's just the way it is but we never shy away from doing our duties so you
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:56.040]  know if we have an option that we can remedy a situation without using deadly force we surely
[03:37:56.040 --> 03:38:01.560]  ought to use that there's no doubt in my mind about that our our desire is not to harm not to
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:08.920]  harm anyone and not surely not to kill anyone but so often the people that we deal with dictate
[03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:16.040]  how these uh incidents come to a conclusion now what things are being done if any about this uh so
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:20.120]  called just black radical group calling for the killing of cops that this apparently happened
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:26.120]  just a couple days prior to uh officer go forth being executed you know anything about that well
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:32.200]  you know i i don't know which uh group you're speaking of but i can tell you you know as uh
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:38.440]  listening to various things uh you know minister lewis farrakhan is literally called for this uh the
[03:38:38.440 --> 03:38:45.960]  execution of whites uh the the new black panther party has surely talked about uh going out and
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:51.800]  hurting and harming and killing police officers so you know this is the society that we live in
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:58.360]  and because we've watched lawlessness has become accepted uh even in the white house you know we
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:05.720]  have a president that is not willing to stand up for law and order and that is a sad sad thing and so
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:11.960]  i think we're going to see more of this uh but as a leader and here in harris county it would surely
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.400]  be something that i will do as sheriff and something i do just in my normal activities you go out and
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:23.320]  you talk to people you develop relationships and uh you know there has to be an element of trust
[03:39:23.320 --> 03:39:28.200]  if the community doesn't trust the police and the police don't trust the community you're going to
[03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:32.840]  have these types of things happen and they're going to happen more and more frequently that's
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:37.560]  kind of what we noticed in in ferguson there was a lack of that leadership boots on the ground by
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:42.920]  the police officers talking with the protesters at the beginning when we first got there right jacari
[03:39:42.920 --> 03:39:47.000]  yes you saw these guys rolling up in m-wraps and you know they've got all their tactical gear on
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:51.400]  and then you're sitting there you know with you know shorts on and flip flops the next thing you
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:56.040]  know you've got a laser dot on your chest from a sniper on top of an m-wrap i mean you back someone
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:40:00.040]  in the corner like that people are going to act out of control so i mean i think it's a great idea
[03:40:00.040 --> 03:40:05.240]  that you need to as a police officer to get out there and try to mingle with the crowds talk to
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:11.160]  the people in your community and try to build a better rapport absolutely and these things happen
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:17.560]  long in advance of an incident like we've seen happen around the country you know law enforcement
[03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:23.640]  has in all of the ways that we have progressed over the years i came into this business in 1985
[03:40:23.640 --> 03:40:29.320]  30 years ago this summer and you know we've come through a community oriented policing which is
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:39.240]  very relevant and valid today but we have to be the ones who extend a hand and again everybody's
[03:40:39.240 --> 03:40:46.360]  not going to want to work with us everybody's not going to want to return our desire to make peace
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:53.960]  when we can but what law enforcement cannot do is shy away from their duties and uh fail to do what
[03:40:53.960 --> 03:41:01.640]  is required of them because if we don't we can easily lose society you know i was a police sergeant
[03:41:01.640 --> 03:41:06.120]  in southern california when the rodney king riots happened and i can tell you that is not something
[03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:11.320]  we want to see here in houston that's good that's very good to know because that was uh quite the
[03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:16.840]  scene out there with the rodney king incident now mr pitman and i have some issues here from
[03:41:16.840 --> 03:41:22.120]  your website and it says you have a tough stand against illegal immigration do you have any type
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:26.840]  of policies that you like to implement or any things that you like to see done to stem that well
[03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:34.120]  you know when you ask if whether i have policies in place you know peace officers are restricted to
[03:41:34.840 --> 03:41:40.840]  the laws that our legislators give us in order to solve these problems and there are plenty of laws
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:48.040]  on the books the problems is that a lot of uh because of government bureaucracy and red tape
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:54.280]  you know officers and agencies aren't doing what they should do the city of houston here
[03:41:54.280 --> 03:42:00.280]  quite frankly is on every list that you can find that talks about sanctuary cities houston is on it
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:05.240]  and why is that happening police officers in the city of houston are prohibited from doing
[03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:11.720]  certain things when it comes to dealing with uh illegal aliens and so you know we will enforce the
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:19.880]  law and i will through the department excuse me through the office of the sheriff uh when elected
[03:42:19.880 --> 03:42:25.880]  i will work with and hope that our legislators here in texas will give us some of the things that
[03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:31.640]  we need legislatively to deal with this problem because if we don't we're going to lose what we
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:37.000]  know america is and that would be a sad thing when you think of all those who came before us who
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:43.640]  have died and and suffered and offered up so much if we lose it that's right and also i see on here
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:50.200]  is sheriffs the sheriff pitman posse what exactly is it this says it's a thousand man plus volunteer
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:59.400]  posse well you know so often so much of america and so many communities there's this belief that it's
[03:42:59.400 --> 03:43:05.560]  the police versus the public and there is no better situation that when you can get people
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:12.600]  engaged in their government and the posse is simply will be a supplement to everything else we do
[03:43:12.600 --> 03:43:18.040]  whether it's going out to help us look for a lost child whether it's going out and working public
[03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:24.600]  events and partner them up with uh certified law enforcement officers but it is a way to bring
[03:43:24.600 --> 03:43:30.520]  people in from every single corner of this community and have them be involved so they
[03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:36.680]  take ownership in not only the sheriff's office but their community so what are your thoughts on
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:42.360]  sheriff david clark out of minnesota his comments i believe was yesterday on fox where he called
[03:43:42.360 --> 03:43:48.200]  black lives matter black lies matter what do you think about this and this movement going on across
[03:43:48.200 --> 03:43:56.040]  the country right now well you know i'm a pretty fair minded person and i uh color is not something
[03:43:56.040 --> 03:44:01.560]  that i spend a lot of time paying attention to unless i'm shopping for a car or suit everyone
[03:44:01.560 --> 03:44:07.800]  needs to be uh treated equally all lives matter so to say that a black life is more important than
[03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:13.720]  a white life or a brown life quite frankly that's just as racist as anything else sure have there
[03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:18.600]  been things in this country perpetrated against black people over the history of this country
[03:44:18.600 --> 03:44:25.480]  absolutely but i don't think we would be intelligent folks to spend our time dwelling on that we have
[03:44:25.480 --> 03:44:30.040]  to move ahead we need to be positive and we need to try to solve some of the problems that we can
[03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:35.800]  do something about and i guarantee you this rhetoric of black lives matters because what they're saying
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:42.760]  is no other lives do all lives matter and that is my belief as a human being and a christian
[03:44:42.760 --> 03:44:47.000]  all lives matter it's very interesting because you have a lot of people that kind of say that you
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:51.320]  know racism is just out of control right now in the country and i was speaking with an older black
[03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:55.960]  gentleman yesterday i was hanging out with him at this bar down in uh kyle and we were talking
[03:44:55.960 --> 03:45:01.400]  about he said you know 50 years ago if you and i wouldn't be able to sit here and have this conversation
[03:45:01.400 --> 03:45:05.800]  in a bar together me as a black guy you as a white guy we wouldn't be able to do that he said the
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:10.680]  fact that you and i right now are sharing a drink together talking about the government talking about
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:15.240]  politics having a good time not really worried about that it shows you this country has progressed
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:18.520]  and moved forward so there's a lot of people out there in the mainstream media want to keep pushing
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:22.040]  this narrative that white people hate black people black people hate white people i've never even
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:27.960]  thought about until the last year where that's all you hear on the news well because you know it's
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:33.000]  a commentary that there are a few people in this country that want to push you know it makes a lot
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:39.720]  of people money it keeps a lot of people in fear um that's the thing fear yeah when when you think
[03:45:39.720 --> 03:45:43.880]  about you know here in texas and still down in the south but particularly here in texas we have a
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:51.880]  holiday uh june 19th the 19th of june and the news of uh the freedom uh that uh been obtained by
[03:45:51.880 --> 03:46:00.680]  slaves reached galveston texas june 19th 1865 if my math is right that's just slightly over 150 years
[03:46:00.680 --> 03:46:08.120]  ago so for anyone to walk around and still try and accuse uh someone of slavery or what happened
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:13.160]  during slavery is one of the dumbest things i've ever heard because i don't think anybody that
[03:46:13.160 --> 03:46:18.760]  either was a slave or participated in slavery is still alive today so we need to a lot of people
[03:46:18.760 --> 03:46:24.440]  just need to grow up and sure we can take ownership of our history we need to do that and so we make
[03:46:24.440 --> 03:46:30.360]  sure that we don't repeat some of these same mistakes but exactly it's it's very sad uh that
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:35.400]  when i think of it and i think it's so many people that sacrifice so much from every race
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:40.600]  whether it's blacks whether it's the uh the asians that came and helped and we built this country
[03:46:40.600 --> 03:46:46.840]  and now we see it being ripped apart over race and that is a sad sad thing i want to talk to you
[03:46:46.840 --> 03:46:50.760]  about some of the rhetoric and that's a very good answer there sheriff or uh potential sheriff
[03:46:51.480 --> 03:46:55.800]  about some of the rhetoric we've heard around the country about uh constitutional groups things
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:01.800]  coming out of the splc labeling constitutionalists libertarians and that matter uh terrorist uh do
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:07.560]  you share that type of opinion or viewpoint well i tell you what you know if you go back in you know
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:13.400]  the founding of this country i'm sure the king in england probably called our founding fathers
[03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:20.200]  something akin to terrorist you know if we stand up and you know the the beautiful thing about our
[03:47:20.200 --> 03:47:27.080]  government and the way that our shall i say our country you know the one thing that was not settled
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:34.760]  at the inception of this country and our founding documents was slavery but that was taken care of
[03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:41.720]  and when you think about how far we've come and yes we still have a ways to go to call people
[03:47:41.720 --> 03:47:50.600]  who love this country what i call patriots and the government wants to call terrorist or domestic
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:59.720]  terrorist well we've seen that if we don't stand up that you know you can call me any name you want
[03:47:59.720 --> 03:48:06.840]  just don't call me lacking in doing my duty and so i'm not i'm not really caught up in names i
[03:48:06.840 --> 03:48:12.680]  think people that love their country ought to demonstrate it every way they can that's right
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:18.280]  going back to the topics on your website you have the second amendment so you have it also quoted
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:24.280]  here so i take it it's very important to you so when you see people with their gun rights things
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:28.760]  such as open carry is that something that you frown on or what are your thoughts on that
[03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:36.120]  i am a strict constitutionalist constitution clearly talks about and says that the right
[03:48:36.120 --> 03:48:40.520]  shall not be infringed i don't know what is so complicated about that i don't think we need to
[03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:47.320]  have any drawn out legal discussion the right of of a freedom loving liberty minded americans to be
[03:48:47.320 --> 03:48:54.280]  armed is goes back is to the beginning and before the actual beginning of this country so if someone
[03:48:54.280 --> 03:49:00.680]  wants to uh walk around and carry a gun god bless him you know you so often said in my profession
[03:49:00.680 --> 03:49:05.640]  that when something happens and it's you know happening in a matter of seconds it takes the
[03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:11.960]  police to get there in minutes and so you know i don't want to live in a populace of sheep i want
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:16.440]  to live in a populace of people that can help protect themselves and that's what we need to do
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:20.520]  okay that's what one of the sheriffs i believe in detroit detroit was saying as well that people
[03:49:20.520 --> 03:49:24.120]  people need to be armed because like you said we can't be everywhere at the exact same time it's
[03:49:24.120 --> 03:49:28.120]  going to take us some time to get there and a lot of times by the time that you're able to get there
[03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:32.920]  things could already have gone wrong so it's better for people to be armed and have that right to
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:37.880]  protect themselves there was a guy in detroit who was uh his car was stolen and he had his gun and
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:43.880]  the guy turned around and aimed the vehicle and started coming back at him to run him over
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:48.120]  and he said he saw the guy go for his gun and his vehicle that was just stolen so the guy was about
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:52.600]  to run him over and then shoot him out of his own vehicle he pulled out shot the guy the guy went
[03:49:52.600 --> 03:49:56.440]  into a tree and ended the entire thing now if he wouldn't have had that he could have been ran over
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:02.600]  so it's great to be able to protect yourself yeah exactly exactly all right mr pittman i think
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:08.040]  we're about to go out to break here in a moment but we'll be right back after this break so
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:12.680]  you final thoughts with this segment you know was there anything that you want the people to know
[03:50:12.680 --> 03:50:18.680]  about you that maybe we didn't touch on well you know what's important to me you know people love
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:26.040]  to accuse uh folks of having all sorts of agendas and reasons why they do things my agenda is making
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:31.800]  sure that we maintain law and order that we protect and defend the constitution because
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:38.840]  if we don't do that this experiment known as america is going to fail and so that's my agenda
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:43.960]  is making sure that we don't fail sounds like the agenda is liberty and freedom and i think
[03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:49.000]  there's anything wrong with that hard carl pitman we'll be back right after this break so hang tight
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:53.320]  we'll get your final thoughts coming up after this stay tuned this is the alex joneshow jacari

[03:54:14.840 --> 03:54:19.720]  interview in just one second but before we do that i want to give you guys a quick testimonial
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:25.000]  about oxy powder now out of all the info wars life products that we have this is probably the one i
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:31.720]  take the most regular i take it several times a week and it basically cleans you out to put it
[03:54:31.720 --> 03:54:36.200]  quite bluntly and anything that's in there you know i like to go eat a lot of good texas barbecue
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:40.200]  and a steak dinner but that's not necessarily something that you want to stick around in your
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:46.760]  intestines so i take the oxy powder and flush all that stuff out you know it's real good i definitely
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:51.000]  recommend that you have time to sit at home if you're going to take it take it at the night
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:54.200]  time you take it at night time yeah i take it at night i take it in the morning when i come in
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:59.240]  but i'd explain that that's stuff uh it works fast and i mean it's really good it's good and
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:04.040]  healthy yeah it's good for you know it's it's a real good thing but i prefer to take it at night
[03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:07.240]  while i'm at home because you don't want to be caught you know out the grocery store someplace
[03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:11.080]  else and you have a episode but whether you take a day or night it's a good thing to have and you
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:17.880]  can get that at the info warshop.com now finishing things up with our guest carl pitman he is running
[03:55:17.880 --> 03:55:23.080]  for sheriff down harris county that is in the houston area so we've been asking a lot of
[03:55:23.080 --> 03:55:28.840]  questions here carl and we gave you a chance to expand upon your your platform just tell us you
[03:55:28.840 --> 03:55:35.320]  know anything else people need to know about carl pitman well i will share with you uh some of the
[03:55:35.320 --> 03:55:42.440]  individuals who have endorsed me my good friend sheriff joe arpaio out in arizona my good friend
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:46.680]  sheriff richard mac who is the founder of the constitutional sheriffs and peace officers
[03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:53.960]  association and uh my good friend uh the second amendment protector uh who will tell you how it
[03:55:53.960 --> 03:56:00.840]  is ted newton and many many other businessmen and people across this uh the state and now across the
[03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:06.280]  country you know there is nothing wrong with loving your country there's absolutely nothing
[03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:11.320]  long wrong with it if you look around you know whether it's your home your cars your families
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:20.120]  your wealth everything you have could become nothing if we lose our liberties and our freedoms
[03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:26.200]  so i would just ask everyone to take a real serious look at what's happening in this country
[03:56:26.200 --> 03:56:33.560]  and and quit using the uh you know the old uh idea that you don't want to be involved with politics
[03:56:33.560 --> 03:56:39.080]  because i promise you whether you want to or not politics will be involved with you that's a very
[03:56:39.080 --> 03:56:43.960]  good statement now this probably be one of our last questions i want to know what you think is
[03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:49.080]  going to happen or where you see things going if we continue to see these assaults on police officers
[03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:53.720]  we know the recent one in houston uh believe it what's earlier this year the two officers
[03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:59.080]  in their patrol car if these things louisiana as well i believe yeah if these things continue to
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:06.360]  happen where do you see all this going well i surely don't like where it's headed and again you
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:11.080]  know it's going to require us to rethink the way we go about doing our business and law enforcement
[03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:16.280]  you know there's been a lot of talk as recently as it always seems to uh pop up when a single
[03:57:16.280 --> 03:57:21.240]  officer unit gets attacked that we need to go to multiple uh either at least two uh two officer
[03:57:21.240 --> 03:57:26.040]  units well that's not always financially feasible in every community so we've got to rethink our
[03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:33.000]  tactics and and really take a look at everything we do but if we don't get this under control
[03:57:33.640 --> 03:57:41.000]  this is going to be one of the worst snapshots in history uh that uh when we have literally
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:47.080]  open hunting season on police officers all right carol pitman can you tell us how we can stay in
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:51.800]  touch with you and also uh how anybody else can get in touch with you sure uh you can visit my
