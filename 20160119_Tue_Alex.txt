[09:02.320 --> 09:08.640]  family neighbors have asked me why is there such a crisis in fertility and we have a lot of research
[09:08.640 --> 09:15.440]  on that but there's also known compounds naturally occurring and deficiencies and things that have
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.240]  handled uh even with all the chemical bombardment were under have been shown to be able to boost
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.520]  fertility so we're going to talk about fertility uh in the third hour in the fourth hour anthony
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.600]  gucciardi uh we'll have dr group back in to cover a bunch of other subjects uh in news and take your
[09:31.600 --> 09:41.040]  phone calls leon macadoo has a report on the situation up in michigan uh with the tainted water
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.400]  that's now been turned into another race baiting issue by the democrats uh regular suspects hillary
[09:46.400 --> 09:54.880]  clinton and michael more jesse jackson who reverend jackson and others and then we will also have
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.200]  jacari jackson pop in i was already planning to cover this but he's done a lot of research into it
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.840]  it's now come out in documents what we already knew that qaddafi was taken out because he was
[10:05.840 --> 10:11.680]  creating an pan african currency not controlled by the globalist and was giving almost all the oil
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.240]  money actually directly to his people i'm not for socialism because it creates dependency but
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.120]  he was taking the state money and giving it directly to the people for education for building
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.480]  projects and for real infrastructure uh and was actually uh stabilizing force in africa so he was
[10:28.480 --> 10:35.120]  taken out same reason the south african apartheid was taken out now it was an evil but it was replaced
[10:35.120 --> 10:40.160]  because the globalists came in and took it over and they admit in mainline metrics south africa
[10:40.160 --> 10:45.920]  is three times worse poverty crime wise than it was just 20 years ago they are just enslaving
[10:45.920 --> 10:51.920]  everybody now the public's so ignorant they didn't even know that it was different african tribes
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.880]  fighting each other in the a and c and the zulus and then the and then you got the dutch against
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.800]  the british i mean they just literally tune into different hollywood movies about south africa and
[11:02.800 --> 11:12.400]  have no idea how that even ran or worked no idea absolutely zero and now it is hell on earth because
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.000]  you better watch out what you're getting rid of and what you're asking for historically
[11:16.880 --> 11:23.280]  so we're going to look at the takedown of africa in a big big big way and and the globalists want
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.640]  to do that here as well they want to control us and make us all poor so they can dictate control
[11:28.640 --> 11:35.680]  over us as well now let's just look at the facts here before i get to all these huge pieces of
[11:35.680 --> 11:42.960]  world news economic news donald trump news massive radical islamic invasion news the raping the
[11:42.960 --> 11:49.440]  attacking the bizarre behavior more attacks in the u.s more attacks in canada more attacks in europe
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.560]  the answer by twitter facebook and governments is to ban just any criticism of the open borders
[11:56.560 --> 12:03.920]  uh it is simply amazing but there are a lot of stories that if you understand them open up the
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.040]  wider world is there what i call rosetta stones or through the looking glass and one of those
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.400]  is this situation that we followed the last few weeks up in michigan where the old industrial
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.800]  cities because of nafta and gat predominantly that's over 90 percent of the reason all economists
[12:24.800 --> 12:31.120]  agree i mean it's not debatable there's a massive flight out of michigan the last 30 years
[12:31.760 --> 12:39.600]  to the south and to the west and that's what's going on right now people are demographically
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.040]  moving where there's lower taxes where it's warmer and where the jobs have gone and they're
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.000]  also starting to leave the west to a great extent and come towards the center of the country so
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  that's demographically happening it has nothing to do with racism as hillary michael more jesse
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.080]  jackson sharpened all of them are running around saying that the water system is breaking down
[13:04.080 --> 13:08.960]  and the water system is screwed up because the town of flint michigan and surrounding area is 60
[13:08.960 --> 13:24.320]  percent black let's expand on that because that is such a whopper of a statement in the last 20
[13:24.320 --> 13:28.640]  years there's been a globalist movement not just here but all over the world where foreign
[13:28.640 --> 13:35.920]  multinationals come in they get the federal governments of the nations to pass laws and
[13:35.920 --> 13:45.120]  then once laws have been passed and once laws have been put into place upping the quote water
[13:45.120 --> 13:51.040]  quality rules that all these chemicals have to be added that all these new processes have to be added
[13:51.920 --> 13:57.840]  then that bankrupts the old county and city water districts and the multinationals come in and say
[13:57.840 --> 14:07.680]  we'll add the new systems in and then we will basically monitor and run and own the systems
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.200]  from that point out and then they do the same thing all over the world this has been well
[14:11.200 --> 14:16.800]  adjudicated well reported on it's come out in court they then control the lobbying process at the
[14:16.800 --> 14:23.120]  state and federal level come back in and change regulations again and then let the big complex
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.440]  expensive systems basically break down and then give people basically the worst water they had
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.960]  before an example of this is austin texas where hundreds of millions of dollars a year is spent
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.320]  messing with our water we have the edwards aquifer we sit on some of the best water in the world
[14:40.880 --> 14:46.400]  we have all these other big reservoirs it's got to be lightly treated and folks they don't do that
[14:46.400 --> 14:53.600]  they jack with it big time because it's a giant scam not just for the chemical companies that are
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.120]  getting money over a million bucks a year just to florida at austin water but to the special
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.680]  interest that make all the money off administrating and running it for the city so it's one of the
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.000]  biggest scams it's like toll roads taken over the roads jacking up the prices all the rest of it
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.960]  it's been well documented and so you have a giant screw job against everybody taking over the water
[15:14.960 --> 15:19.600]  messing with it i've had a lot of water experts a lot of water managers on the show
[15:19.600 --> 15:27.600]  two years ago i was up in the great town of hot springs arkansas where i vacationed off
[15:27.600 --> 15:34.800]  and on since i was a child staying at the arlington hotel and they had a big city convention for
[15:34.800 --> 15:40.720]  wastewater treatment uh engineers from all over the u.s and i got mobbed i talked about this at
[15:40.720 --> 15:47.120]  the time by listeners who were engineers and water treatment workers but there was mainly the bosses
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.240]  saying you're totally right and i talked to folks right there from arkansas because the big issue
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.560]  that year was they'd passed the state law saying you must florida because all these towns were
[15:56.560 --> 16:00.960]  pulling it out and i sat there constantly i mean i couldn't be left alone by them which is fine
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.120]  talking to these wastewater managers saying listen the water here we sit on top the giant you know
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.160]  ozarks aquifers it's totally crystal clear totally delicious some of the best water in the world
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.560]  they bottle it and sell it around the planet everybody knows that some of the best water in the
[16:16.560 --> 16:23.280]  world i mean you talk millions of year old water under these volcanoes that's what the ozarks are
[16:23.280 --> 16:29.520]  it's a bunch of extinct volcanoes and we take it and we put chlorine and fluoride and all these other
[16:29.520 --> 16:33.920]  chemicals into it it's crazy and i had one guy tell me from a small town he goes listen
[16:33.920 --> 16:40.800]  my kids drink that water he goes we take that stuff and we dump it down an old semen and well
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.160]  so it doesn't get into the well water we do not put it into the water supply
[16:49.520 --> 16:53.600]  so that's also what's going on quietly and when the yearly test comes through with the feds or
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.640]  whatever they sit there and jack with the studies so there's also a secret revolution going on a
[16:58.640 --> 17:03.200]  water treatment plants where they're actually just kind of get rid of the toxic waste and not dumping
[17:03.200 --> 17:11.680]  in the water so it's just amazing that this is happening and then it turns into i mean we hear
[17:11.680 --> 17:19.600]  about chemical spills algae blooms in west virginia in tennessee in ohio in california
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.720]  constantly because these water systems are so complex and because there's so much toxic waste
[17:26.720 --> 17:30.480]  and runoff getting into the water i mean it's a nightmare situation and in many areas they
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.440]  don't have enough water so they are having to heavily treat runoff and things and having to
[17:35.440 --> 17:40.640]  treat sewage toilet to tap where they take the sewage and then process it and take the water
[17:40.640 --> 17:46.640]  out in many areas of california arizona new mexico and then you drink that so it's a complex issue
[17:46.640 --> 17:51.440]  that i've tried to study and i don't even fully understand but let me tell you you think the
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.400]  governor wants people telling him to resign you think they really have the water system breaking down
[17:56.400 --> 18:02.560]  and we're directing the river in for people to drink and then try to treat that because they
[18:02.560 --> 18:08.640]  want to hurt people the truth is they're a bunch of dumb politicians that follow orders and don't
[18:08.640 --> 18:16.160]  even run the state of michigan that's being looted and being totally controlled and so this is a
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.080]  great example of political correctness that i'm going to be this week really getting into the
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.960]  history of and going over where it comes from in the soviet union what it's designed to do
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.280]  that's what the word correct politic basically comes out of the communist system
[18:32.080 --> 18:38.960]  and it's a victory over all of these poor people us included that have no idea what's happening
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.080]  michael more should be talking about the multinational companies that have come in and taken over
[18:44.080 --> 18:50.800]  our water treatment systems michael more should be talking about all the things that are being put
[18:50.800 --> 18:57.280]  in the water and the radioactive isotopes but instead he says this is a racial killing flint
[18:57.280 --> 19:04.800]  michigan is 60 black when you knowingly poison a black city you're committing a version of genocide
[19:05.600 --> 19:12.240]  and they're saying that they put this river water in that they know the acidity of will
[19:12.240 --> 19:17.760]  leach stuff out of pipes do you have any idea what's in pipes that have had treated water for 60
[19:17.760 --> 19:23.120]  years going through it the fluoride the heavy metals the radioactive isotopes you can go to
[19:23.120 --> 19:30.080]  any major municipal water facility and stick a geiger counter or a field meter up to it we've
[19:30.080 --> 19:36.080]  done this it's been on national news and it just 10 15 20 times the radio activity it should be
[19:37.040 --> 19:41.200]  just type in radio activity and water supplies and you'll get local reports from all over the
[19:41.200 --> 19:47.200]  country but there's no discussion about that so yes pumping river water through those filthy pipes
[19:47.200 --> 19:52.640]  is poisonous but what were they supposed to do when there's no water you're already getting poison

[20:21.040 --> 20:26.240]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even

[24:34.160 --> 24:47.560]  This is not a natural disaster.
[24:47.560 --> 24:48.560]  Run!
[24:48.560 --> 24:49.560]  This is not a mistake.
[24:49.560 --> 24:58.560]  They hid this from the federal government, and in doing so, they knew that the people
[24:58.560 --> 25:05.560]  here did not have the political power to do anything about it.
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.560]  The people of Flint have been betrayed.
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.560]  Yes, some of you, they could drink the water, bathe in the water, wash in the water, and
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.560]  have clean air, and they, some, it seemed to be a man-made disaster.
[25:16.560 --> 25:22.560]  If it was a man-made disaster, there are legal and political consequences to that.
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.560]  Absolutely, and I'm sure your foundation will end up getting some money, Jesse Jackson.
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.060]  No discussion of why we're run by multinational foreign companies, no discussion of why the
[25:32.060 --> 25:37.200]  Great Lakes are being sucked dry by giant Chinese waterships that then take it back
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.680]  to China, no discussion about how they're trying to put water meters on people's wells
[25:42.680 --> 25:47.440]  in Michigan, but letting all these big multinational companies take all the water they want, same
[25:47.440 --> 25:54.520]  thing in California, same thing in places like the Ozarks in Arkansas.
[25:54.520 --> 25:57.880]  Because the people don't know how the world works, they're not organized, and they're
[25:57.880 --> 26:00.880]  all busy fighting with each other.
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.520]  I mean, every couple weeks, there's a new water crisis, and when it's in rural white
[26:06.520 --> 26:14.480]  West Virginia, you don't hear it because it's racist, or when a giant coal slurry breaks
[26:14.480 --> 26:17.320]  and drowns a bunch of people, you don't hear it because it's racist.
[26:17.320 --> 26:20.440]  That's what happens in an industrialized world.
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.160]  Whole rivers catch on fire in China, factories blow up and kill thousands of people.
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.160]  Do you hear?
[26:27.160 --> 26:28.680]  It's because racism did it?
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.880]  No, it's because it's a communist dictatorship that cares less about human life.
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.560]  And America is rotting, and everywhere the Democrats run things, like Flint, Michigan,
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.040]  and Detroit, and Chicago, and New York, and D.C.
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.200]  You got the rich part of town that's little bitty, and then the big, giant, sprawling.
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.520]  I mean, you look at areas in Philadelphia a few years ago when I was there, it looks
[26:52.520 --> 26:57.400]  worse than any third world country I've ever seen, and I've been in Honduras, I've been
[26:57.400 --> 27:02.440]  in Guatemala, and let me tell you, there's some of the worst in Latin America, and it's
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.280]  nothing compared to some of these U.S. cities.
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.200]  And it's just, again, everything becomes racism.
[27:11.200 --> 27:18.440]  Melissa Harris Perry is out talking about Trump and Cruz saying, we're getting run over
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.160]  by China and others like we're amateurs, you know, like Obama just there negotiates like
[27:24.160 --> 27:25.160]  a child.
[27:25.160 --> 27:29.880]  Well, that's a standard assault on someone that's doing a bad job, is to say they're
[27:29.880 --> 27:36.680]  an idiot to act like a child, but she says, oh, that's calling a black man a boy.
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.640]  And I guess with that, you could claim in some alternate universe, maybe, maybe a 1%.
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.600]  But what about, Paul Ryan's a really hard worker and the Democrats really need him.
[27:48.600 --> 27:50.080]  Now you be quiet.
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.320]  That's taken away from black slaves that were hard workers and say that, oh, this white
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.320]  guy's such a hard worker.
[27:54.320 --> 27:55.320]  See how she attaches.
[27:55.320 --> 27:56.820]  Because that's a pretty cloud.
[27:56.820 --> 27:59.400]  Oh, you like it because it's white, don't you?
[27:59.400 --> 28:01.200]  No.
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.600]  And it's to create total mental illness.
[28:05.600 --> 28:15.080]  And then she goes on the TV, she didn't even say what they actually said saying he's a
[28:15.080 --> 28:16.080]  child.
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.080]  He acts like a child.
[28:17.080 --> 28:19.480]  She just said, did you hear him coming up?
[28:19.480 --> 28:22.520]  The Republicans called Obama a boy.
[28:22.520 --> 28:27.960]  The clips up on info wars.com, everybody's like, a boy, oh, my gosh, because everybody's
[28:27.960 --> 28:28.960]  seen roots.
[28:28.960 --> 28:29.960]  Yeah.
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.240]  And I've had the author roots on and was the author of color purple.
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.240]  It's a listener.
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.240]  I don't know anymore.
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.240]  I'm losing my mind.
[28:37.240 --> 28:43.440]  I just, I know what political correctness is and I'm going to do a special video this
[28:43.440 --> 28:46.880]  week showing the history of it, the documents I did a Facebook mention before the show today
[28:46.880 --> 28:58.720]  just going over it, but it is an admitted communist system of balkanization of the industrialization
[28:58.720 --> 29:04.560]  of turning people into gibbering idiots who don't know how to be competent at business
[29:04.560 --> 29:06.160]  or social skills or anything.
[29:06.160 --> 29:10.120]  They're just experts at being offended and experts at hating language.
[29:10.120 --> 29:11.840]  It's the opposite of liberalism.
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.240]  The opposite of renaissance.
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.720]  It is a curse.
[29:15.720 --> 29:21.160]  And the poor people of Flint, NAFTA and GATT passed bipartisanly is the biggest reason
[29:21.160 --> 29:22.960]  your infrastructure is collapsing.
[29:22.960 --> 29:27.800]  There's not as many people, what maybe 20% of the people that were there 30 years ago.
[29:27.800 --> 29:34.480]  So you got this big giant jalopy complex water system with all the government regulations.
[29:34.480 --> 29:36.080]  It's falling apart.
[29:36.080 --> 29:37.280]  It breaks.
[29:37.280 --> 29:38.360]  There's no money.
[29:38.360 --> 29:41.000]  You start getting the river water and filtering it.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.920]  There's a bunch of complaining about that.
[29:43.920 --> 29:45.040]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.040]  It's all collapsing.
[29:46.040 --> 29:47.240]  It's what you wanted.
[29:47.240 --> 29:49.520]  The unions wanted NAFTA and GATT.
[29:49.520 --> 29:50.880]  The empires on the real...
[29:50.880 --> 29:51.880]  You wanted Obamacare.
[29:51.880 --> 29:53.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:53.480 --> 29:55.200]  You want death panels.
[29:55.200 --> 29:56.600]  You want open borders.
[29:56.600 --> 30:00.880]  You want fluoride.
[30:00.880 --> 30:06.040]  Carving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished
[30:06.040 --> 30:08.760]  the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[30:08.760 --> 30:14.280]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp, secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building
[30:14.280 --> 30:19.080]  formerly known as James Bell Tavern in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.080]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials
[30:24.080 --> 30:29.600]  realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the Tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[30:29.600 --> 30:34.240]  How appropriate that part of the building has been torn down while other parts remain,
[30:34.240 --> 30:35.240]  commenter W.C.
[30:35.240 --> 30:40.560]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper, we have a Congress that is so intent on destroying
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.720]  the Bill of Rights.
[30:41.720 --> 30:46.920]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[30:46.920 --> 30:51.560]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[30:51.560 --> 31:17.960]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[31:17.960 --> 31:22.560]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[31:22.560 --> 31:24.320]  by globalist concoctions.
[31:24.320 --> 31:28.840]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[31:28.840 --> 31:29.840]  drugs.
[31:29.840 --> 31:33.800]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients

[32:35.800 --> 32:36.800]  of brain force.
[32:36.800 --> 32:39.880]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.

[32:42.720 --> 32:43.720]  your brain.
[32:43.720 --> 32:45.480]  Ultimately we've all been done down to some degree.

[32:48.720 --> 32:49.720]  do it clean.

[33:19.720 --> 33:25.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:25.360 --> 33:26.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:26.360 --> 33:30.800]  We're now 33 minutes and 30 seconds into this global, worldwide broadcast.
[33:30.800 --> 33:35.920]  Leanne McAdoo, Infowars Nightly News reporter and co-host for this show is with us for this
[33:35.920 --> 33:36.920]  segment.
[33:36.920 --> 33:41.600]  Then Jakari Jackson pops in in the next two segments to get into a really important report
[33:41.600 --> 33:43.880]  that's up on Infowars.com.
[33:43.880 --> 33:48.360]  It's confirmed Libya was invaded to prevent Pan-African currency.
[33:48.360 --> 33:54.320]  State Department email reveals Qaddafi had seven billion in gold and silver for the purpose.
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.920]  He tried to work with the West, brought in Western companies, they set him up.
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.640]  So regardless of what you think about Muammar Qaddafi, this is really evil thing to do.
[34:02.640 --> 34:05.720]  Then they put al-Qaeda in after that, Jakari's coming up.
[34:05.720 --> 34:12.080]  By the way, Leanne McAdoo and David Knight tomorrow are being deployed to Flint, Michigan.
[34:12.080 --> 34:13.680]  This circus has gotten too big.
[34:13.680 --> 34:19.440]  Now they're going to be up there really educating the folks about how everybody's being poisoned
[34:19.440 --> 34:20.440]  in the water.
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.120]  Everybody, I mean, they don't just put hydrofluorosalic acid or fluoride in.
[34:24.120 --> 34:28.600]  They take toxic waste from different U.S. plants, Chinese plants, and upwards of 300-plus
[34:28.600 --> 34:33.160]  chemicals are added, and the people wonder why it's so toxic.
[34:33.160 --> 34:34.640]  It's crazy.
[34:34.640 --> 34:37.680]  It's on even local newscasts, admit this.
[34:37.680 --> 34:41.160]  Even the famous dentist that helped get Canada fluoridated 30-something years ago has come
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.200]  out in the last decade and said, I thought we were putting calcium fluoride in that you
[34:45.200 --> 34:47.480]  do need a little bit of.
[34:47.480 --> 34:50.960]  In fact, I've gone before, and you know, but before we were actually producing on ourselves,
[34:50.960 --> 34:56.680]  I call it nutraceuticals, these big mass mineral systems at Whole Foods, and you would
[34:56.680 --> 35:00.560]  see in there that it would say calcium fluoride, a very small amount.
[35:00.560 --> 35:04.880]  I brought that to my dad, who's a chemist, also a physician, and he said, no, no, son,
[35:04.880 --> 35:06.280]  you need a little bit of calcium fluoride.
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.640]  Of course, I knew that 20 years ago, it was still just interesting to see it on the insert.
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.160]  So again, they really deceive people because Leanne's gone out and done reports where she
[35:17.160 --> 35:25.240]  talks to Austinites, and 9 out of 10 say, banned hydrofluorosalicylic acid, well, sure.
[35:25.240 --> 35:33.000]  They won't ban hydrofluorosalicylic acid, which is obviously fluoride, but they want to get
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.040]  rid of dihydrogen monoxide because it sounds scary, and that, of course, is water.
[35:37.040 --> 35:39.760]  So we're going to Leanne here in just a moment.
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.240]  First off, folks, we have a huge special running today.
[35:45.240 --> 35:55.840]  I was going to have another special on liver shield that's been sold out for months, but
[35:55.840 --> 35:58.760]  it's not going to be here until next week.
[35:58.760 --> 36:03.400]  But regardless, we're doing another special that's just as good, and your purchases make

[37:18.040 --> 37:21.560]  The ProMax four-state shower filter has super fast flow rate.
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.200]  The ProPure is now available exclusively of M4sstore.com, I should add exclusively, in
[37:26.200 --> 37:28.320]  a limited first run.
[37:28.320 --> 37:34.440]  ProMax reduces or removes over 200 contaminants from shower water, including heavy metals,
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.920]  VOCs, pesticides, fluorides, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, and odors.

[37:55.400 --> 38:00.080]  water, at M4warstore.com.
[38:00.080 --> 38:11.320]  And by the way, getting into this Flint crisis with the usual suspects of Obama, Hillary,
[38:11.320 --> 38:18.920]  Michael Moore, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, running around saying this is racism because
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.040]  Flint's 60% black.
[38:21.040 --> 38:28.120]  You can print up a stack last year of white areas that have deadly, you know, in predominantly
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.840]  white areas in rural West Virginia, you name it, deadly algae, killing people, they can't
[38:33.840 --> 38:42.040]  get rid of it for a year, you know, deadly, what about the EPA blowing up dams and flooding
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.480]  stuff with cyanide, I mean, look, the government's out of control, rivers set on fire in China
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.640]  every week, black smog everywhere, poison, that's Chinese screwing over Chinese.
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.880]  It's a corrupt breaking down system.
[38:55.880 --> 39:02.360]  And they add hundreds of chemicals in what they call fluoride waste from heavy metal
[39:02.360 --> 39:07.600]  plants from aluminum smelting plants, and from fertilizer production plants, and they
[39:07.600 --> 39:14.040]  take the toxic waste, and they call it lawn fertilizer, or they call it fluoride, that's
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.960]  the big scandal, and they put toxic waste, industrial waste in the water.
[39:19.960 --> 39:25.920]  At the end of World War II, they had just incredible amounts of toxic waste left over
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.320]  from nuclear weapons, uranium purification.
[39:29.320 --> 39:33.080]  There's whole films and books, we've had the experts on them, they flooded whole parts
[39:33.080 --> 39:39.080]  of Tennessee, thousands died, black, white, it was terrible, because they were just dumping
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.320]  the toxic waste on the rivers, they said, wait, we'll just call it fluoride and put
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.680]  it in the water.
[39:43.680 --> 39:49.280]  It reduces fertility, it dumps people down, the physical IQ has dropped, just Google,
[39:49.280 --> 39:55.320]  Harvard admits fluoride causing IQ reductions in cancer.
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.600]  You got the government saying, take half of it out of the water, from 1.3 to what, seven
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.560]  parts per million, or 0.7.
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.040]  We have to do this, folks, there's the Harvard study, impact on fluoride neurological development
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.440]  in children, 20 plus studies in that one alone.
[40:11.440 --> 40:18.160]  So I'm renting here because it is so frustrating to have won the Info War and have all the
[40:18.160 --> 40:19.160]  major.
[40:19.160 --> 40:25.520]  When I say all, they had almost every FDA and EPA toxicologist and scientist in 2000
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.800]  write a letter to their bosses, I mean it was literally 99% of them saying, would their
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.400]  union take this out of the water?
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.960]  They did it again three years ago, I've had Dr. Connit that worked with him, the head
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.240]  of his university department in toxicology, a doctorate in toxicology.
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.040]  He comes to Austin, the mayor laughed at him in his speech, oh here's the Harvard studies,
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.600]  here's our studies, ha ha ha, it's so funny, they're poisoning all of us, they write the
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.840]  book Ecoscience admitting they're doing this to all of us, and their answer is to look
[40:56.840 --> 40:59.000]  us straight in the face and say racism.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.960]  Because now these complex water plants, that's the thing, they do boondoggles, well this
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.400]  complex water filtration, even on good spring water, even on aquifer water in many cities,
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.640]  and then they dump poison in it after.
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.080]  Now you think about that, but it's so much easier just to say, we're getting screwed
[41:17.080 --> 41:20.800]  over, listen I agree, I think running water is great, I think having local systems running
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.040]  is wonderful, but whatever happened to filter in your own water, whatever happened to people
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.280]  hauling water up from the well, of course we're slaves, we're being supplied water
[41:30.280 --> 41:33.880]  by government, and now multinationals came in, bought it out and controlled it.
[41:33.880 --> 41:38.520]  Leigh Ann McAdoo has put together a powerful six minute report today that was going to
[41:38.520 --> 41:42.960]  be airing on the nightly news tonight, and it still will, we're going to be premiering
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.640]  that here, but it will also be on with more tonight, then she's going to Flint, Michigan
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.160]  this evening, or tomorrow morning, since we've got a flight, to cover all of this with David
[41:53.160 --> 41:54.160]  Knight.
[41:54.160 --> 41:57.680]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, you've heard my rant about this, what's your view on it before we go
[41:57.680 --> 41:58.680]  to your report?
[41:58.680 --> 42:01.600]  Well that's what I think is really important for a lot of people to understand is that
[42:01.600 --> 42:08.200]  you basically have these mad scientists there at the water supply, they are kind of working
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.320]  with these different tinctures and they're saying, oh well that's corrosive, so let's
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.200]  add this agent to it, oh well that's going to cause cancer when you mix those two compounds
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.800]  together, that's pretty much what happened in Sacramento when they, for over a year,
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.160]  they knew that they were mixing this agent, once they put this coagulant in the water
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.680]  to kind of bring down those toxins that were in the river water, they were pulling in,
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.600]  it created a cancer causing compound and they knew it, it was causing miscarriages, things
[42:34.600 --> 42:36.880]  like that, but they just let it go on for a year.
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.800]  Same type of thing that's happening here in Flint, Michigan, they were messing around
[42:40.800 --> 42:47.360]  with some different compounds to try and take out this notorious toxic river water, so they
[42:47.360 --> 42:53.640]  were mixing different things and it created, it just caused a huge problem and they weren't
[42:53.640 --> 43:00.000]  adding an anti-corrosive agent into it, so it starts eroding all of these old lead pipes,
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.280]  eroding the iron water mains and it's all going, and the whole time.
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.360]  But beyond that, and the build up from the old water treatment facility that was adding
[43:07.360 --> 43:11.440]  fluoride in, now that's all built up, it's kind of like a water filter in your house,
[43:11.440 --> 43:15.040]  if you let it go too long, suddenly your water tastes horrible, it starts sloughing all
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.960]  the toxins and it's 20 times worse, so here's the takeaway, there is genocide going on against
[43:20.960 --> 43:27.440]  humanity by what they add to the water, but then when it really starts getting bad, then
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.760]  it becomes a big example and people claim it's racism, when all it is is the precedent
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.840]  set to send poison to us through the water systems and then it all becomes a distraction
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.600]  that our water is purposely poisoned because now they make it about racism.
[43:40.600 --> 43:44.320]  Exactly, it's about racism, classism, so of course that's why Hillary Clinton jumped
[43:44.320 --> 43:50.200]  on this because this could be a political power point for her and they're completely
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.400]  ignoring the fact that in Sacramento or now Stockton, they're planning on using that same
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.520]  agent that was cancer causing, why wasn't anyone outraged about that?
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.720]  They're only outraged about this because they can point racism and like I point out in my
[44:03.720 --> 44:08.280]  report, just like with the scandal there with the militarization of the police and police
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.600]  brutality, rather than allowing us to all come together and fight that, they wanna make
[44:12.600 --> 44:17.160]  it a race thing and they're doing the same thing with the water, meanwhile this is happening
[44:17.160 --> 44:18.160]  all over the country.
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.720]  And again, I'm gonna have to skip this network, right, because I'm gonna play your full report
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.480]  and come back with Jacare, so we've got a few minutes left here, get into the fact and
[44:25.480 --> 44:27.440]  of course we're gonna do even more reports.
[44:27.440 --> 44:32.440]  This has happened all over the country in areas that are 60, 70% white as well, we should
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.760]  all come together and say, stop it with the water, citizens should get together and go
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.480]  test the water like folks used to do with the nuclear power plants and they kept catching
[44:43.480 --> 44:44.640]  it being radioactive.
[44:44.640 --> 44:50.000]  We sent Jacare out a few years ago when we knew the radiation levels were up on the
[44:50.000 --> 44:56.000]  West Coast, he found some areas 15 to 20 times regular background radiation with two certified
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.520]  field meters and a Geiger counter and the media went, oh, you're not radiologist, you
[45:01.520 --> 45:06.440]  don't know, the army went out to where we went and said no, it was true and a big investigation
[45:06.440 --> 45:07.440]  started.
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.560]  So I mean, people were catching fish that were 25 times the radiation level and then
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.200]  later it came out okay, we covered up the tuna, it's got high radiation.
[45:15.200 --> 45:19.520]  See, Jacare went and did that and again, that's his job as a journalist.
[45:19.520 --> 45:24.600]  Where were all the other journalists, you see, so were they dumping nuclear reactors
[45:24.600 --> 45:28.280]  in the 60s and 70s off the West Coast because they don't like black people?
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.840]  It's because the globalists are crazy, they hate everybody, why did they build 10 plus
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.120]  reactors on fault lines and tsunami lines in Japan?
[45:37.120 --> 45:41.720]  Why did the Japanese government do it because they're anti-Japanese, they're anti-human
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.640]  folks, it's crazy and so it's a good thing people are upset about their water but I want
[45:45.640 --> 45:46.880]  you to go educate them.
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.040]  I want you guys to print up today like Harvard studies and go, what about the fluoride?
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.120]  This is what builds up in your pipes, this is why it's really bad.
[45:54.120 --> 45:58.360]  Well, and that's the other thing is that they had a lot of activists this last year, I guess
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.880]  around April, trying to fight to get the fluoride taken out of the water.
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.600]  So here the state, the government, they could afford to continue fluoridating the water but
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.960]  they wouldn't pay $100 a day for this anti-corrosive agent that was now eating all the lead out
[46:11.960 --> 46:13.200]  of the old pipes.
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.240]  So they keep on fluoridating but...
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.560]  Here's the bottom line, mass industrial water treatment is a giant scam, a big boondoggle
[46:20.560 --> 46:28.320]  and it's ripping people off, it isn't protecting the people, it's a scam, you've got to filter
[46:28.320 --> 46:29.320]  your own water.
[46:29.320 --> 46:34.720]  I'm all about mass distribution of water but again in Austin, Texas we have totally clean
[46:34.720 --> 46:38.520]  water, there's no reason to treat it, they still do it, they've got to treat the sewage
[46:38.520 --> 46:43.600]  before they put it back into the lakes, that's surface water, and then it filters through
[46:43.600 --> 46:45.760]  the sediment back into the aquifer.
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.440]  The world, the planet knows how to filter water, not these globalists but again they
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.840]  want the money off of it, Leigh Ann, here's your report.
[46:54.840 --> 47:00.000]  President Obama has declared a federal emergency for Flint, Michigan after a devastating man-made
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.160]  disaster was created by the state, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents there with
[47:04.160 --> 47:06.400]  contaminated drinking water.
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.280]  Now all of this happened about two years ago when the city decided to switch the water
[47:11.280 --> 47:15.840]  supply from Detroit to the Flint River, which is a tributary that runs through the town
[47:15.840 --> 47:19.240]  and it's notorious to its residents for its filth.
[47:19.240 --> 47:22.800]  Now immediately following this switch, the residents were complaining about the taste,
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.320]  the odor, the appearance of the water but state officials kept reassuring them the water
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.000]  was completely safe to drink and that there was nothing to worry about but now we know
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.240]  that that was a dangerous lie.
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.240]  Researchers from Virginia Tech found that the water coming from the Flint River was
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.120]  19 times more corrosive than the water coming from Detroit but they weren't treating it
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.280]  with an anti-corrosive agent.
[47:45.280 --> 47:50.480]  More than half of the homes have pipelines made of lead, which means this corrosive water
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.480]  was now leaching the lead out of the pipes and it was going into these people's homes
[47:54.480 --> 47:56.680]  for more than 18 months.
[47:56.680 --> 48:02.520]  A little segue here, this anti-corrosive agent would have cost the city about $100 a day
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.360]  but instead I guess they were able to find countless dollars to fluoridate the people's
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.760]  water so to them allegedly stopping cavities is more important than stopping brain damage.
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.720]  So 18 months later in the fall of last year, researchers discovered that the amount of
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.000]  children with above average lead levels in their blood had doubled.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  Now there is no safe level of lead in blood but lead poisoning causes brain damage, another
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.480]  neurological health issues and it's particularly damaging to developing children as well as
[48:32.480 --> 48:33.760]  fetuses.
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.720]  Now the city said that they switched the water back to Detroit in October but it was too
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.000]  late, the damage was already done and there is no telling how long these pipes are going
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.440]  to continue to leak lead.
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.000]  Now the Washington Post does a really good job at breaking down visually just how high
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.280]  above normal Flint's lead levels really were.
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.040]  So the EPA considers five parts per billion to be safe but 90% of the homes in Flint were
[48:59.040 --> 49:05.160]  reporting 27 parts per billion, 10% of the homes in the sample had lead levels much higher
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.880]  than this, the highest reading registered 13,000 parts per billion.
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.080]  The EPA considers water to be toxic waste level at 5,000 parts per billion.
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.800]  So parents haven't even really seen the long-term effects of what this lead poisoning is going
[49:19.800 --> 49:24.640]  to be doing to them all because a state appointed manager wanted to save money.
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.480]  They lied to residents for two years, told them the drinking water was completely safe,
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.640]  all they needed to do was just boil the water and of course now these kids who have been
[49:32.640 --> 49:35.840]  poisoned are going to have to be supported for decades.
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.960]  And this researcher, she's a Flint area pediatrician, Dr. Mona Hannah Atisha and she was actually
[49:41.960 --> 49:46.680]  studying the lead levels in some of Flint's children and she was the one who actually
[49:46.680 --> 49:49.920]  forced the state to acknowledge this lead problem.
[49:49.920 --> 49:54.320]  The city tried to discredit her research, taking water samples of their own saying everything
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.960]  was completely fine but of course she was able to prove that that wasn't true and now
[49:58.960 --> 50:04.640]  she's saying that all of the city's children under six should be treated as exposed.
[50:04.640 --> 50:08.280]  So that's almost 7,000 children there who are being affected by this.
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.840]  Now Michael Moore of course, he's there in Flint, he's calling it a crime scene, he's
[50:13.840 --> 50:19.560]  accusing government leaders of intentionally poisoning thousands of people and he is pinning
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.600]  the government's decision of course on race and poverty, saying that this never would
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.520]  have happened in more affluent neighborhoods and this is actually the exact same thing
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.160]  that Hillary Clinton said at the end of the Democratic debate and her closing comments
[50:34.160 --> 50:39.280]  that this was about race, this is about poverty and of course you know this could be the case
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.880]  here in Michigan but just like the issue of police brutality, they are now trying to
[50:44.880 --> 50:51.440]  divide this and make this a race class thing but this, it has nothing to do with that.
[50:51.440 --> 50:52.880]  Just take a look at Sacramento.
[50:52.880 --> 50:57.760]  The city admitted to secretly testing a cancer causing agent at its main water treatment
[50:57.760 --> 51:00.080]  plant in order to cut costs.
[51:00.080 --> 51:04.360]  The substances that were forming in the city's drinking water could cause cancer, birth defects
[51:04.360 --> 51:06.400]  and even miscarriages.
[51:06.400 --> 51:10.760]  Red flags went up almost immediately for this but here again state officials completely
[51:10.760 --> 51:15.440]  ignored that and instead they expanded this water treatment program even though they knew
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.760]  that there was some issues there with it.
[51:17.760 --> 51:22.920]  And I've reported on residents in St. Louis who were told directly by the EPA to not worry
[51:22.920 --> 51:28.160]  about the nuclear material that was leaking out of this landfill, they said that these
[51:28.160 --> 51:32.960]  radioactive materials that were leaching into the groundwater were heading in an opposite
[51:32.960 --> 51:34.400]  direction from the city.
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.480]  Meanwhile, the residents had to point out to the EPA that this is the exact part of
[51:38.480 --> 51:41.680]  the underground water where they get their drinking water from.
[51:41.680 --> 51:45.640]  So it's going to be a huge problem in the future and you know let's not forget about
[51:45.640 --> 51:50.720]  the EPA who destroyed an entire ecosystem there at the Animas River and a lot of residents
[51:50.720 --> 51:54.800]  said that the EPA knew that this would happen if they tried to clean up the mine in such
[51:54.800 --> 51:55.800]  a way.
[51:55.800 --> 51:59.760]  Some people went as far as accusing the EPA of doing this on purpose with the intention
[51:59.760 --> 52:04.680]  of being able to set up a super fun site there and of course city officials all across the
[52:04.680 --> 52:10.840]  country actually pay big bucks to treat the city's water with fluoride and no it's not
[52:10.840 --> 52:16.600]  the natural fluoride that is created in the environment, it's hydrofluorosalic acid which
[52:16.600 --> 52:20.640]  is a waste byproduct from phosphate fertilizer plants.
[52:20.640 --> 52:23.360]  So this has nothing to do with race or class.
[52:23.360 --> 52:27.880]  This is disgusting negligence of a system that wants to cut corners and doesn't care
[52:27.880 --> 52:31.280]  about the long-term devastating effects on your health.
[52:31.280 --> 52:35.640]  It's just more proof that you cannot trust the state to take care of you, look after
[52:35.640 --> 52:40.040]  your best interests and the only thing that you can do that's truly safe and effective
[52:40.040 --> 52:43.880]  is filtering your own water.
[52:43.880 --> 52:47.000]  Absolutely incredible job to Leigh Ann and the crew that shot that report.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.080]  What a public service announcement.
[52:49.080 --> 52:54.880]  The headline on that should be plan to protect Flint's water discovered and everybody should
[52:54.880 --> 52:56.920]  be filtering their own water.
[52:56.920 --> 53:00.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the White House science are, in fact it's in Anthony's office because
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.400]  I was doing a report on it last week in there, well somebody run me Ecoscience please, it's
[53:04.400 --> 53:11.880]  by the refrigerator, the mini fridge, I think it's on top of it, I keep my ST yet.
[53:11.880 --> 53:16.480]  Folks, they said they put fluoride in the water to lower our Q and hurt our fertility
[53:16.480 --> 53:20.480]  but see now they don't care about it so bad, they just give us really bad poison where
[53:20.480 --> 53:21.480]  it's killing people.
[53:21.480 --> 53:26.720]  It doesn't kill you 20 years later now or 30 years, it kills you a year later.
[53:26.720 --> 53:32.200]  And that's the whole attitude so I agree, you know what, the governor should resign
[53:32.200 --> 53:36.640]  and then the people above him that wrote books about poisoning us, they should be tried
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.560]  for murder and genocide.
[53:38.560 --> 53:41.800]  You know what, I actually agree with Michael Moore, this is genocide, the more I think
[53:41.800 --> 53:44.240]  about it because that's what it is.
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.440]  Man, I'm angry.
[53:47.440 --> 53:55.480]  You read Ecoscience, it's free online, textbook for the government, PhD level, read it, go
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.360]  just type in Ecoscience, fluoride in the water to control population.
[53:59.360 --> 54:06.160]  In fact, I want David Knight to take this and literally shove it in Michael Moore's
[54:06.160 --> 54:10.160]  face and show Michael Moore's arm bodyguards, show that too.
[54:10.160 --> 54:13.760]  These people are hypocrites, man I cannot take it anymore, I'm telling you I'm tired
[54:13.760 --> 54:14.760]  of them.
[54:14.760 --> 54:18.520]  You know how I'm angry, it makes me their poison in the water and they turn it to some
[54:18.520 --> 54:19.520]  race deal?
[54:19.520 --> 54:23.360]  It is, it's a human race, we're all being attacked by the globalists that are psychos.
[54:23.360 --> 54:27.320]  So it is a racism issue, the tiny group of psychos that love poisoning us, dumbing us
[54:27.320 --> 54:31.440]  down and making us pay for it, I guess everybody else, they want us to all fight with each other
[54:31.440 --> 54:35.360]  so that tiny group can control us and I'm done with it.
[54:35.360 --> 54:41.040]  Now, speaking of tiny groups controlling us and attacking us, we knew this back at the
[54:41.040 --> 54:46.320]  time, we knew they were mad at Gaddafi spending tens of billions every decade of his oil
[54:46.320 --> 54:53.560]  money when oil prices were high to do work projects, water treatment, mining operations,
[54:53.560 --> 54:57.800]  roads, you name it, tapping aquifers so people got good water, building infrastructure all
[54:57.800 --> 54:58.800]  over Africa.
[54:58.800 --> 55:00.300]  I mean he's just a hero there.
[55:00.300 --> 55:03.720]  So they set him up, took him out, put Al Qaeda in, now it's a failed state.
[55:03.720 --> 55:09.920]  And now we have the emails proving that they did not want him to use his 143 tons of gold.
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.480]  Jakari Jackson filed a report for the radio today on this and he's really dug into this
[55:14.480 --> 55:18.880]  so, Jakari, to me, this is just smoking gun, but you won't see this on the news.
[55:18.880 --> 55:22.000]  And just like you said, regardless of what you think about Gaddafi, you know, they take
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.560]  the guy out, they put Al Qaeda in and it's a failed state now.
[55:24.560 --> 55:27.920]  Is it really better off than it was when Gaddafi was in charge?
[55:27.920 --> 55:32.720]  But we see this article from Curt Nimo today and it has declassified emails since on April
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.480]  2nd, 2011 to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reveals the invasion of Libya was
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.920]  launched to prevent more Mark Gaddafi from establishing a pan-African currency based
[55:41.920 --> 55:42.920]  on Libya's gold.
[55:42.920 --> 55:50.400]  And it says that he has 143 tons of gold and that's about $7 billion as well as silver.
[55:50.400 --> 55:54.800]  So we see Alex, he's trying to get away from the French Frank and goes on to report that
[55:54.800 --> 55:59.280]  Sarkozy, who was president of France at the time, wasn't very happy about this.
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.000]  They didn't want him to get on his own currency and be pretty much self-sufficient.
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.520]  As you say, he's trying to improve the area and the ways that he can.
[56:06.520 --> 56:10.000]  Of course, you know, he's done some bad things in the past, but he's trying to move Africa,
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.320]  Libya, to a better area and he's encouraging other places in Africa as well as the Middle
[56:15.320 --> 56:20.080]  East to abandon the French Frank and get on his system of the gold-based currency.
[56:20.080 --> 56:23.520]  Exactly, because if you have control of the currency, you can do anything you want.
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.480]  They can start trading amongst the African countries and build themselves up because
[56:27.480 --> 56:32.160]  any IMF or World Bank money they get has to be spent where the IMF or World Bank says
[56:32.160 --> 56:35.720]  and that's always to boondoggles to their own companies.
[56:35.720 --> 56:41.680]  These multinationals give Western tax money to themselves, not to Africa, not to Asia,
[56:41.680 --> 56:42.680]  not to Latin America.
[56:42.680 --> 56:45.480]  It's done as political control.
[56:45.480 --> 56:47.920]  Gaddafi was breaking that control.
[56:47.920 --> 56:53.920]  Saddam was going to a gold standard and trying to create a pan-Arab currency that has also
[56:53.920 --> 56:56.760]  been declassified as the main reason they took him out.
[56:56.760 --> 56:58.440]  I mean, this is about global government.
[56:58.440 --> 57:02.680]  Oh yeah, it's complete control because he has large shares of oil out there.
[57:02.680 --> 57:06.840]  They said he is going to move away from a U.S. currency to his own gold currency.
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.160]  Like you said, when we got off our gold currency here in the United States, when things really
[57:11.160 --> 57:13.120]  went off the rails, he recognizes this.
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.480]  He tries to change it and everybody says, no, no, no, you're going to stay on this currency
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.800]  and then eventually led to attack that we all know here today.
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.920]  And the worst part is, yeah, he fought back militarily against things he saw that were
[57:23.920 --> 57:29.160]  wrong in the 70s and 80s and I'm not defending it, but you can see both sides, but he came
[57:29.160 --> 57:34.000]  in for eight years to the West, made deals, signed treaties, followed everything, let
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.880]  the U.S., let France, let Europe in, let them build hotels, let them have infrastructure,
[57:38.880 --> 57:43.280]  paid them handsomely, invested his money in Goldman Sachs, did what he was told, said,
[57:43.280 --> 57:44.720]  but I want to build up Africa.
[57:44.720 --> 57:47.320]  He met with Obama, he met with Sarkozy.
[57:47.320 --> 57:48.480]  He thought they were his friends.
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.880]  He was shocked when they double-crossed him and he kept saying, why are you bringing
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.880]  al-Qaeda in?
[57:52.880 --> 57:53.880]  They're going to kill all the blacks.
[57:53.880 --> 57:54.880]  They're racist.
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.560]  He said, they're going to bring extremists in and invade Europe and they came and killed
[57:59.560 --> 58:00.560]  him.
[58:00.560 --> 58:03.560]  I mean, that is so dastardly.
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.320]  I mean, I got to say it, Gaddafi, compared to our leaders, actually was a good guy.
[58:07.320 --> 58:12.560]  I'm not saying he was a good guy, but at least in his older age, he lived in a tent, folks.
[58:12.560 --> 58:13.560]  They showed his palace.
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.440]  It looked like something that a South Austin delionaire would have.
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.160]  It was not very fancy, a little 10-foot wall around it, kind of looked like Lewis Farrakhan's
[58:22.160 --> 58:23.160]  compound or something.
[58:23.160 --> 58:24.160]  It was not big.
[58:24.160 --> 58:27.240]  I mean, he was literally spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the people.
[58:27.240 --> 58:32.080]  He was really, really, talking about Bernie Sanders socialism, he was delivering it all.
[58:32.080 --> 58:34.160]  And it's just unprecedented, simply amazing.
[58:34.160 --> 58:36.160]  Jakari, I want to talk more about this.
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  Back in 70 seconds, stay with us.

[59:51.360 --> 1:00:00.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:03.040]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:12.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:17.200]  We have a former high-level field operative of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:20.440]  Robert David Steele joining us to cover the waterfront in the next segment.
[1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:23.000]  Dr. Groob's coming on to talk about reduced fertility.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:24.720]  You want to know what fluoride does to you?
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:25.720]  That's it.
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:28.320]  One of the main reasons they add to the water, according to the White House Science Art,
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:29.320]  is book eco science.
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:31.520]  Just keep sourcing that for you.
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:35.800]  But Jakari Jackson's here, the full article breaks it all down.
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:38.960]  We knew this from our experts, our insiders, folks that knew Gaddafi.
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:40.360]  We knew what he was doing.
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:44.480]  We knew about the African Union he created that was a counter, the fact that they used
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:46.280]  disunity.
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:50.400]  The people could sit back and say, Africa's failed because the people there just are backwards
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:51.400]  or whatever.
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:55.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Africa, 200 years ago, it was just about like what America was.
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:00.240]  And it was while, while West, there were some civilizations, were some groups.
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:06.320]  They got taken out by Western groups, colonialists who wanted to keep the level of development
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.720]  down for political control to get resources cheaply and not let people organize.
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:16.000]  You read the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company dispatches from India.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  It's the same story.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.400]  Same story with the takeover of China.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:23.520]  First, the globalist model is done here to a softer respect with the carbon taxes they
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:26.600]  want to selectively shut down competition.
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:32.320]  It's just like with what's happening with the big unions and people wanting higher wages.
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.040]  Obama affiliated groups with a new higher wage will be given waivers from that and an
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:38.920]  unfair competition.
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:41.080]  So this is how they do it.
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:44.320]  And Africa has 100% been suppressed.
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.240]  It has been played off.
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:50.200]  They send in mercenaries to destabilize countries every time people don't play ball.
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:51.960]  They kill African leaders.
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.080]  And now they've been caught doing it with Qaddafi.
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.160]  What a war crime.
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:00.000]  And Hillary has said, you know, that Syria is going the way she wanted.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  And the, and the State Department came out last year and said that they've brought peace
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  to Syria.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:08.040]  Jakari, I think they have completely different definition of peace.
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:11.240]  I guess this war is peace is the, the way they're looking at it.
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:12.960]  Of course, Syria is not a peaceful nation.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:16.220]  We can see that by the record number of Syrians fleeing the country.
[1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:19.920]  So if people were safe there in Syria, they wouldn't be leaving.
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:23.360]  But the thing to know by everyone wants to talk about when we address places like Syria
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.200]  is how US foreign policy is a contributor, not the contributor, but a very large contributor
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:31.800]  to why people want to leave Syria, why people want to leave Yemen, Pakistan.
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:34.480]  I would call it the prime driver.
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:37.080]  I mean, I'd say it's 80% of it is the whole Western attack.
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:38.080]  Oh yeah.
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:39.080]  Oh, definitely.
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:41.440]  It definitely is quite significant, but you know, they never want to address that.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:45.640]  They want to get on TV and say, use more of your tax dollars to help us fix this situation,
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:48.880]  but they never want to admit that they're the ones themselves being the US foreign
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:51.560]  policy that made the situation the way it is in the first place.
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:52.560]  I agree with you.
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:55.280]  And it is US foreign policy because we let the globalist hijack our country.
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:59.380]  But it really is at the end of the day, globalist foreign policy where we get the blame.
[1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:00.380]  But we do deserve it.
[1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:01.380]  We've let it happen.
[1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:02.380]  Yeah.
[1:03:02.380 --> 1:03:03.380]  You know, people go out in the streets.
[1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:06.120]  They let, you know, let's bring everybody here, but nobody wants to be proactive.
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:08.640]  You know, bringing people here is a half measure.
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:10.200]  You can bring everybody here that you want.
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  That's not going to stop.
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:14.760]  What's going on overseas and because you can't criticize the president or even bring
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:19.120]  up the things that he does, all these things will continue to happen, not just in the Middle
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:23.600]  East, but in Mexico, where they're running guns down there with Operation Fast and Fierce
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:26.120]  and many other places all around the world.
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:31.480]  And now it's going to be the first woman president and I'd love to have a lot of great
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:32.480]  women as president.
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:36.760]  I could care less man, woman, black, white, literally just let him be a patriot.
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:39.920]  But it's going to be, they already say, even Bernie Sanders, you know, criticizes Hillary.
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:40.920]  They say he's sexist.
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:44.640]  I mean, it is just going to be women in America, not all of them, but a big segment.
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.400]  We'll do whatever they don't care what she does because women are doing it.
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:50.200]  That is the dumbest thinking in the world.
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:54.160]  Well, it's the same thing with presidential candidates or the president himself, whether
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:56.520]  it be a Democrat or it's a Republican.
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:59.280]  If it's their guy, their guy can do anything that he wants.
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:03.840]  Anytime the day he can gut the Constitution, he can infringe on your civil rights.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.600]  As long as their guy, the Republican, the Democrat, the men, the woman, they can do
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:08.600]  no wrong.
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:09.600]  Exactly.
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:12.640]  And folks get confused who are kind of babies to politics when they hear the show over
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:13.640]  the years.
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:15.560]  It could be against Bush, but now you're against Obama.
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:16.720]  You're just against everything.
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  No.
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:18.720]  The globalist has an agenda.
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.280]  It doesn't matter who you get in office.
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:21.280]  It just keeps getting worse.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.640]  I'm pointing out that we're in a controlled paradigm.
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:24.640]  I mean, it's real simple.
[1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:25.640]  Oh, yeah.
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:26.640]  But people don't understand that.
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:30.920]  You know, they'll get tired of Obama, then they'll vote for the Republican or vice versa.
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:35.000]  And that's how the situation continues because nobody wants to step back and really look
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.160]  that these guys are getting funded by the same, by the same people.
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:39.160]  Exactly.
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:41.760]  And so for the first time, Trump is not being funded by these people.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.400]  I mean, I hope he's for real if he gets in, but I don't know.
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:46.280]  We'll just see the main answers.
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:47.280]  Vote with our dollars.
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:48.280]  Vote with our actions.
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:51.680]  Get involved locally and just stop complying with the globalists because what they're doing
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:52.680]  is illegitimate.
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:54.560]  Jacarie Jackson, thanks for reporting on this for us.
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:55.560]  Thank you.
[1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:58.760]  That's Jacarie Jackson with InfoWars Nightly News.
[1:04:58.760 --> 1:05:02.520]  Several gas stations in Michigan have lowered their gas prices to under $1 per gallon, with
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:04.880]  one station as low as 78 cents per gallon.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:09.120]  Meanwhile, across the U.S., oil is so plentiful and cheap that at least one buyer said it
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:11.040]  would actually need to be paid to refine oil.
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:15.480]  Flint Hill Resources, a refinery owned by the Koch brothers, said it wants $0.50 a barrel
[1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:19.880]  Friday for North Dakota Sour, a high-grade sulfur grade of crude, according to a list
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:21.320]  price posted on its website.
[1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:27.040]  In comparison, the refinery was paying $13.50 a barrel a year ago and $47.60 in January
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:28.040]  2014.
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:32.840]  Overall, U.S. benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than 70% in the past 18 months and fell
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:36.200]  below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years last week.
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:39.880]  West Texas Intermediate was already trading near $29 in New York on Monday.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:42.960]  This will lead to the collapse of major oil companies and the loss of tens of thousands
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:45.280]  jobs, meaning the economic compression is likely.
[1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:48.680]  In other words, the global oversupply of oil has now reached the point that the market
[1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:51.720]  is effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their oil away.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:55.320]  Otherwise, oil will simply sit in bloated source facilities or on tankers parked out
[1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:56.320]  in the ocean.
[1:05:56.320 --> 1:05:58.320]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com reporting.
[1:05:58.320 --> 1:05:59.320]  Hey, how you doing?
[1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:00.320]  Good, brother.
[1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:01.320]  Just recently started using your products.
[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.320]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:07.680]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:11.240]  Thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've
[1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.160]  got to have the highest quality.
[1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:18.920]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:20.320]  of using synthetic chemicals.

[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:36.320]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:41.520]  maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:45.280]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:49.640]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I
[1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:50.640]  love it.

[1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:22.640]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:23.640]  to shut down.
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:28.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv, we put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:34.440]  InfoWars.com forward slash show, but it is the members that are paying it forward and

[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:33.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be covering the waterfront in this hour with a guest of
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:39.600]  an interview in off and off the last 10 years, really smart guy, author, researcher, Robert
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:46.320]  David Steele, former Marine, former CIA case officer, US spy hacker, CEO of Open Source
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.400]  Solutions Network, RobertDavidSteele.com, we're going to be talking to him in just
[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:51.400]  a moment.
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:54.920]  He is the open source, everything, manifesto, transparency, truth, and trust.
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:58.480]  We're going to be talking to him throughout the hour in about five minutes into the next
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:08:59.480]  hour.
[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:03.400]  But before I go there, let me just hit some more of the headlines we haven't covered yet.
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:11.240]  IMF cuts world forecast for third time, Sky News, China seen posting lowest economic growth
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:16.880]  in 25 years, GDP expected to slow to 6.8, and that's with their cook numbers.
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:20.120]  Talk about a state run system.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:26.440]  We have a list of Bernie Sanders with $19.6 trillion tax hikes, but of course all the
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:30.080]  elites will be exempt, and they'll vote against auditing Fed.
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:35.320]  Supreme Court agrees to hear Texas challenge to Obama's executive action on immigration.
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:36.320]  That's a big deal.
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:42.360]  GOP elites have blown $65 million on Jeb Bush and his failed campaign.
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  He's polling about 3%.
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.280]  Ron Paul put out a hardcore article.
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:53.520]  He says the state's been set for authoritarianism in America.
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:10:01.160]  Davos elites are to debate rising inequity, and of course to push global tax initiatives
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:04.960]  where they get the money and then distribute it to the third world, but only distribute
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:07.600]  it to companies and corporations they control.
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.520]  That's the inside baseball.
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:12.440]  Major snowstorm threatening DC and New York City.
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.880]  Hillary says it's global warming, so pay her to carbon taxes and she'll fix it, continuing.
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:25.440]  Russia says they're to maintain their level of nuclear restraint for national interest.
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:30.720]  Russia's national interests dictate the need to maintain its potential in nuclear systems,
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:35.400]  and they're basically not following a bunch of treaties because of the increased militarization
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.040]  on their borders.
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:42.640]  That is just some of the news on that front that we have distractions like the Pentagon
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.240]  may demote David Petraeus.
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:49.840]  Oh my goodness, because he talked to a biographer and had something in a file cabinet, but Hillary
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:53.600]  and everybody else is just running around knowing their servers are hacked, doing whatever
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:58.360]  they want, taking money from dictators to give them weapons, and the Bushes were involved
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:02.480]  in funding Al Qaeda as well and supporting it and going back to Jimmy Carter.
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:06.520]  That's all okay, but let's, you know, how about we put Martha Stewart back in jail again
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:11.320]  for stock fraud, but nothing against Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan for all their derivatives.
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:14.920]  It's just ridiculous, these sacrificial lambs.
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:19.800]  A sailor chanted ISIS before beating a man in New York City, yes, shoot cops in the head
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:24.360]  in Philadelphia, beat people, but there's no attacks from the darling little refugees
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:26.840]  coming in, many of which are ISIS fighters.
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:32.640]  Trump says Christianity's under siege, I want to win Iowa, he said, then they're just going
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:35.000]  to clean the table.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.280]  And shocking video shows Swedish woman being harassed and groped by a gang of migrant women.
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:45.040]  We're going to play the shocking video in the next hour, woman films that she is harassed
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:50.040]  by at least two men in Sweden, grabbing on her, following her.
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:54.360]  But women are told, just don't dress sexily, it's your fault by the feminist, the exact
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:56.280]  inverse of what they previously claimed.
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:01.480]  German minister urges Merkel to prepare border closures, Facebook begins Europe-wide campaigning
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:07.840]  against extremist post, Reuters, that means criticizing the open borders, Muslims, practically
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:14.440]  impossible to integrate into Europe, Czech president says, immigrants must improve English
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:19.000]  in two and a half years or face deportation, says Cameron, that's a whitewash.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.320]  I'm not against all these poor folks from the destabilized Middle East.
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:25.760]  Most of them aren't radicals or terrorists, but here's the deal, they know some are going
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:30.280]  to get in, they know there's going to be more attacks, and it's being used for civil emergencies,
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:34.280]  it's being used to take our freedoms all over the Western world, period.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:39.800]  So it's part of a globalist plan, it's part of the UN plan, and the migration head who
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:42.800]  admittedly admits it is to balkanize Europe.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:47.960]  You can go read Peter Sutherland's quotes in the Financial Times of London, admitting
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  it.
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  So this is a divide and conquer strategy, bringing the groups, the government becomes
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:58.000]  the totalitarian refugee, referee of the whole thing with the refugees.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.760]  Also, this is coming up, President Obama asserts power over waterways, remember, and how it
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:09.600]  ties into all the breakdown of the water systems and all the dumping in the rivers that they
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:11.320]  claim is racism.
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:18.560]  No, it's anti-human behavior, it's corruption, it's a collapse of a rotting infrastructure,
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:23.960]  the deindustrialization, the aftermath of NAFTA and GATT.
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:28.720]  I mean, Detroit and Flint are going to totally collapse people, and no amount of bailouts
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.960]  are going to fix it, because there is no industry, it's gone.
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:36.960]  Chicago, New York, they're falling apart.
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:42.160]  No amount of welfare will fix it, it's because this country is rotting.
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:48.320]  Obama eyes audacious use of executive power in final year, the Hill newspaper, they come
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.520]  out and call it audacious, they throw down the gauntlet of executive power grabs, setting
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.880]  the precedent further for an imperial presidency beyond Barack Obama.
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:02.920]  You Democrats that love him acting like a dictator, imagine when we get a Republican,
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:07.000]  and I'll be here opposing those tyrannical moves.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.800]  I hope you'll be opposing them as well.
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:11.760]  We're going to cover the waterfront, what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:16.240]  with the fact that the West is running ISIS in Al Qaeda, being unmasked.
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:20.680]  Robert David Steele has a new book out, looking at were some of these latest Islamic attacks
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:21.680]  false flags.
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:27.920]  And they were brought in, protected and allowed to do it, but does it go beyond that?
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:33.040]  I mean, I ask the question, how could there be attacks, and then the government that brings
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.440]  them in not getting trouble, that's a suspension of logic.
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:43.680]  Another French false flag, bloody tracks from Paris to San Bernardino, a new book out by
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:44.680]  Mr. Steele.
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:48.640]  We'll get to that at the bottom of the hour, there's so much I want to get into him with
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:51.800]  the whole election, what's happening in the world, the factions.
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.480]  Let me ask you this Robert, first it's good to have you back with us.
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:58.440]  Oh, Alex, it's always a treat to be on your show.
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:03.360]  Before we go all of the map here, you were an actual field guy, you know, a lot of combat
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.520]  operations, a lot of intelligence gathering operations all over the Middle East, all over
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.520]  the world.
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:11.000]  So you actually are one of those, maybe five, six, seven percent of them, wrong, correct
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.120]  me, of the CIA that's actually out there in the field.
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:17.520]  What do you think about 13 hours?
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:21.160]  I mean, obviously there was a stand down, what do you think about Benghazi and then pulling
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:25.000]  back then, who are the factions best you can tell?
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.280]  I mean, we know it's the army at the Pentagon against the Navy, but then the Pentagon overall
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:37.000]  against the CIA, allied with the Defense Intelligence Agency and another 14 agencies jockeying for
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.840]  who they're with, who's the NSA with.
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:45.280]  I mean, I've got a lot of good sources, you do too, and they say they can't even figure
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:51.760]  out who's who now, and then it's so corrupt, it's all just about looting and getting funding,
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:56.520]  and that basically we've been captured by corruption, not some foreign power, but just
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:01.960]  by the fact that every agency now is just growing like a bloated tick, hanging on the
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:05.080]  near carcass of the West.
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:11.600]  Well Alex, I was one of the first case officers assigned the terrorist target full time in
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:17.240]  the 1980s, and I've actually organized a false flag for the CIA.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:19.800]  I mean, I know how this is done, I know we do it.
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:23.120]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you never, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to skip this network
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.240]  break, this is so incredible.
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:28.200]  First break that down, get into the, what, what you got?
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:33.680]  A false flag, and there are many different kinds of false flags, mine didn't kill anybody,
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:40.680]  but a false flag is basically where you simulate a whole chain of events and you basically blame
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:42.320]  it on someone else.
[1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:47.040]  But it has a desired outcome that is in your favor even if it has nothing to do with ethics
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:48.040]  or reality.
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.280]  Sure, if you can't tell us the classified false flag you carried out, can you give us
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:53.680]  an example of something else that happened like it?
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:17:00.480]  Well, how about 9-11, how about Charlie Hebdo in Paris, how about this most recent Paris
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:07.960]  event in which multiple witnesses identified white, blue-eyed, paramilitary guys actually
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:13.440]  doing the shooting, San Bernardino on national television in the United States.
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:15.880]  Two different witnesses said exactly the same thing.
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:20.440]  If Alex, you and I are on the same wavelength here, I mean, I really get upset with the
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:25.280]  fact that most Americans are so out of touch with reality because they get their news from
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:30.880]  mainstream media, including Rachel Maddow, who has no clue what the actual unemployment
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.760]  rate is in the United States.
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:39.080]  And so our citizens are basically under-informed or misinformed.
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:40.080]  But there's no question.
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:45.840]  And by the way, this wonderful book that you mentioned, this was edited by Keith Barrick.
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:53.080]  And I'm one of about 50 authors in there, including Craig Roberts and Phil Geraldi,
[1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:56.240]  two of my heroes.
[1:17:56.240 --> 1:18:03.320]  There's no question, but that San Bernardino and both attacks in Paris were false flags.
[1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:09.120]  And they're basically doing to France what was done by NATO Gladio to Italy in the 1960s.
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.600]  Now that's leaked in Italian courts, the Italian presidents come public, they're head of their
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:14.840]  Supreme Court.
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:20.160]  That's one of the most documented false flag chains ever, other than the Israelis.
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:21.320]  So Alex, you're right.
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.720]  And so is the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:31.400]  It's now known that Alan Dulles was a massive traitor who single-handedly saved Nazism and
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:37.840]  promoted fascism in Japan and Italy and Germany, brought the Nazi hydro to the United States,
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:43.720]  helped the Nazis move their empire to Argentina and all of their gold and so forth.
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:51.040]  So what we have in the United States today is financial, religious, and ideological traitors.
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:56.920]  And I totally support the governor of Texas with his call for a constitutional convention.
[1:18:56.920 --> 1:19:02.040]  And I believe that the next president has to be elected on a platform of both committing
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:07.920]  to a constitutional convention if we can get 34 states to ask for it right away and also
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:08.920]  electoral review.
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:11.840]  Sir, I want to walk through all that with you, but you've never dropped so many bombshells
[1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:12.840]  here.
[1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:13.840]  You organized a false flag.
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.320]  These are false flags, the Nazi gold to Argentina.
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.920]  A lot of that's been declassified.
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:20.160]  The public doesn't know it.
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:21.720]  Of course they know where to hunt Hitler.
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:23.640]  They know where he was living.
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:27.640]  My grandfather lived in Texas and there were just Nazis all over the place when he'd go
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:29.520]  on military bases after World War II.
[1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:33.880]  He was angry about it because they'd shoot their mouths off and were very arrogant and
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.480]  he'd had a lot of buddies die.
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:39.920]  But I just don't think people understand that it's not even a Nazi conspiracy.
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:46.360]  It's a Nazi system of covert operations that basically was grafted in, 36,000 of them as
[1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:55.440]  officers into academia, into science, into weapons manufacturing, into NASA, into everything,
[1:19:55.440 --> 1:19:57.120]  and that's what we see today.
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.760]  So of course we've got poison water in Flint, Michigan.
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.760]  Well, it's not just here.
[1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.640]  I mean, Germany has been a vassal state of the United States since World War II and
[1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:12.000]  Angela Merkel is one of the people that has been funded and promoted by the United States
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:16.040]  for a very long time and she came out of East Germany.
[1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:20.000]  The bottom line here is we cannot trust the U.S. government.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:23.760]  And by the way, there's no such thing as a monolithic U.S. government.
[1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:28.440]  There are millions of very good people trapped in a very bad system.
[1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:29.800]  And you talked about Benghazi.
[1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:36.240]  I've got a master post at Phi Beta Iota on Benghazi and the timeline and so forth.
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:40.720]  There are no fewer than seven U.S. foreign policies.
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:47.960]  But in Benghazi, what you had was a CIA operation to destabilize the entire region that Hillary
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:54.880]  Clinton was actively supporting in violation of the Constitution without congressional
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:56.380]  authority.
[1:20:56.380 --> 1:21:00.040]  She let an ambassador die because of her irresponsibility.
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:05.200]  However, Leon Panetta is the guy who gave the no-go order.
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:08.640]  Leon Panetta is a chicken shit with no balls.
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:14.280]  And he overturned his military advisors, including the commander for Africa Com, who could have
[1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:17.000]  saved everybody in Benghazi.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.640]  For me, this was Panetta's first great act of treason.
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:26.840]  His second was the fake bin Laden attack, which killed a number of SEALs to kill a Patsy
[1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:32.720]  that was not bin Laden that was put into place by Pakistan as a favor to the U.S. government.
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:35.040]  And there are some tremendous journalists out there.
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:38.920]  I cannot name them right now because they told me in confidence.
[1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:47.240]  But we have Pakistani sources that have confirmed that the fake bin Laden was provided by them,
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:49.760]  and Leon Panetta probably knew that.
[1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:54.320]  And of course, it was right by their West Point.
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:59.520]  And the word I've been told by SEAL families and SEALs, and this was the week that it happened.
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:03.320]  I mean, I got really scared having this info, obviously, because it was so dangerous, so
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:06.400]  I got it out immediately.
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:10.040]  That they had a body double there, and that's basically what happened.
[1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:13.720]  That's why they then sent 20-something of them in a helicopter to a non-mission.
[1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:16.560]  They knew they were being set up, blew it up.
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.800]  And now I've even had some of those SEAL families on the show since then.
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:22.760]  But let me tell you, it's creepy when you meet with a Navy SEAL or you meet with their
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:24.800]  family a week after it happens.
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:27.440]  We've known from the beginning what happened here.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:30.000]  You talk about Hillary's incompetence.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:34.480]  As you said, those CIA on record with the stand down, they know how this guy named Bob,
[1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:40.080]  the supposed section chief, you know, saying that this new movie, 13 Hours is Wrong about
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:41.080]  a Stand Down.
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:45.440]  We have the witnesses that were on the ground on the radio getting the stand down order
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:47.080]  who worked for the CIA.
[1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:52.160]  They were ordered, and they go on Fox News with Megan Kelly and say, no, we got the
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:54.520]  order from the CIA not to go.
[1:22:54.520 --> 1:22:55.880]  It's not just the CIA.
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.800]  It's everybody, including Hillary Clinton.
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:03.640]  I mean, if you look at my timeline, which was developed by a whole bunch of experts,
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:09.600]  we basically knew seven to nine hours in advance that Benghazi was going down.
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:14.320]  And fast movers with tankers were two hours away.
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:20.680]  Troops, the counterterrorism team in Spain were two hours away.
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:22.480]  There was no question.
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:23.480]  But that...
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:24.760]  Weren't there jets 20 minutes away?
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:26.000]  No, two hours.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.800]  I mean, jets were about 20, though, is what I've read.
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:33.400]  I don't know, because jets use a lot of fuel, and if you launch jets from Turkey and these
[1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:37.320]  other places, you've really got to refuel them.
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.440]  There are other complications, but let's say one to two hours was the window.
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:46.320]  We held off for seven hours.
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:55.000]  Now, knowing what you know is the CIA former guy that ran operations on the ground.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:58.760]  How many people do you think, because we know there were predator drones above it?
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:03.320]  How many people knew it was a lie?
[1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:04.320]  About Benghazi?
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:05.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:06.960]  Day one.
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:07.960]  It depends.
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:12.160]  Part of the problem we have is that the CIA lies to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon lies
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:17.400]  to the CIA, and everybody lies to the Department of State and the White House.
[1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:22.280]  So we have a government in which we literally lie among ourselves.
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:24.760]  It's internal warfare.
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:29.800]  And one of the problems with Libya, of course, was also the French activism, because the
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:32.000]  French wanted to take out Qaddafi.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:35.200]  They wanted to put themselves into power there.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:40.400]  Qaddafi was actually a stabilizing factor in the region, and his biggest crime was that
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:44.820]  he had a lot of gold, and he wasn't going to follow the American Goldman Sachs George
[1:24:44.820 --> 1:24:47.880]  Soto's party line.
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:55.840]  So we literally created a swath of destruction from Afghanistan through Libya, Iraq, Syria,
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:59.920]  all the way down to Yemen, Somalia, and Niger.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:06.920]  What we have done in the last 15 to 20 years is go from 25 failed states to 175 failed
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:08.000]  states.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.280]  The U.S. government, in our name and at our expense, has destroyed the world, and it has
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:15.280]  destroyed the American domestic economy.
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:16.720]  And nobody is holding any one of those.
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:20.440]  That was my next point, and I mean, clearly, you were high-level CIA on the ground.
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:24.120]  You know about divide and conquer strategies, force multiplication.
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:29.640]  You can just see the State Department's sociology with political correctness dividing everyone.
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:35.040]  I mean, it's like Ku Klux Klan propaganda, but through the minorities, it's so evil.
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:41.080]  It even shocks me that they are race-baiting and creating division like this, federalizing
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:45.280]  police, weaponizing them, then the cops do bad stuff, then the answer is bring in more
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:46.920]  tyranny.
[1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:48.360]  What's your view on all that?
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:49.840]  What's really happening in the economy?
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:50.840]  Where we're going?
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:55.280]  Well, it's funny because I just watched Cynthia McKinney speaking on a Russian TV channel,
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:59.560]  and she was talking about change management and chaos management, and you're exactly
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:00.560]  right, Alex.
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.440]  Basically, we're destabilizing the world.
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:09.520]  We're creating massive amounts of fear, and we're spending all of our money on surveillance
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.520]  and control.
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:17.600]  And I have a slide from Medard Gabel on how much we spend on war and how, if we spend
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:24.160]  a third of that on peace, we could give every single person on the planet a two-story cinderblock
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:28.880]  home with running water, electricity, and even a swimming pool.
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.680]  The injustice that is being perpetuated right now, we now know that 62 people on the planet
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:38.280]  have as much wealth as the lower 3 billion.
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:40.280]  This is insane.
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:45.120]  A lot of wealth, and you've showed it on your show before, my preconditions of revolution
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:51.720]  chart, the preconditions of revolution all exist in the United States of America today.
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:57.160]  We are like a house that has been soaked in gasoline with ammunition put in every room,
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:26:59.840]  and we're just waiting for the first match to blow by.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.360]  And George Soros is running around with sparklers in the street.
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:09.520]  And expanding on this, sir, then I come out and say, we don't need class warfare.
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.680]  We don't need class envy, but it's the very Davos elites that have transferred the wealth
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:18.960]  through inside jobs, through crony capitalism, that are lobbying to now take what's left
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:23.560]  the middle class money and redistribute it, which will end the ladder up for poor people
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:32.360]  and terminate it using social injustice causes to actually sabotage people coming together.
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.520]  How do you communicate that to the masses of people that are at the breaking point?
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:41.680]  How do we keep the establishment from organizing a false revolution that only cements their
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:42.680]  control?
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:46.520]  Alex, I am a huge fan of Ted Cruz and state rights.
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:50.400]  I think that it's time for the states to look after their own.
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:53.920]  It's time for us to start nullifying federal regulations.
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:57.760]  It's time for us to say that the federal government has no right to own land.
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:03.120]  There's an absolutely marvelous graphic on how much land the federal government owns.
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:06.200]  They basically own everything west of the Mississippi, and that's a crime.
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:07.200]  So what do we do?
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.440]  I mean, we get a coalition of governors and legislatures in an emergency, just like 1775,
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:17.760]  1776, we get together, we announce the crimes, we point out the feds have been hijacked,
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:23.040]  we deploy a plan to the states, they vote, we pull out the federal government, dissolve
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:26.440]  it, and then how do we reconstitute it, because you've got all these operatives in there,
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.640]  there'll be a huge battle over the next level of control that causes a revolution in and
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:31.640]  of itself.
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:36.040]  Look, one of the beautiful things about being a state is that you have the National Guard
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:38.080]  which works for the governor, not for the president.
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:39.600]  You already have the infrastructure.
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:41.880]  Yes, you can take over your land.
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.320]  I personally don't believe we should have absentee landlords.
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:48.920]  I think every state should control its own land, its own property.
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.520]  By the way, I agree with what you're saying.
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.640]  I'm just putting in the pitfalls of how we need to organize this, and it needs to happen
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:54.760]  through the states.
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:58.600]  I'm huge on truth and reconciliation, and let me point out to you and your listeners
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:01.160]  that there are some billionaires that get it.
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:05.520]  Lady Lynn Rothschild, who's a babe from New Jersey, by the way, she just married well.
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:13.080]  Lady Lynn Rothschild sponsored a conference on inclusive capitalism in May of 2014, and
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:17.280]  we've got some black sheep billionaires out in Silicon Valley who are talking about redemptive
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:18.280]  capitalism.
[1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:19.280]  I know that.
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:20.280]  I've talked to some of them.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:21.280]  Yes.
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:22.280]  Stay there.
[1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:23.280]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:26.800]  There are a lot of new money people, is what you're getting at, and who don't want to
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:31.040]  suicide everybody and have this apocalyptic craziness, but the leader digging in, they're
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:32.040]  planning it.
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:33.040]  Mr. Steele, sorry.
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:34.640]  We can fix this, Alex.
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:36.360]  Do me in the governor of Texas.
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:41.120]  RobertDavidSteel.com, well, the governor listens a lot, so you can tell them what you think
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.120]  straight ahead.
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:47.840]  We'll be back.
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:49.120]  We're on the march.
[1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:51.520]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:30:00.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:05.960]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished
[1:30:05.960 --> 1:30:08.680]  the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:14.200]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp, secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:19.000]  formerly known as James Bell Tavern in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:29.520]  realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:34.240]  How appropriate that part of the building has been torn down while other parts remain,
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:35.240]  commenter W.C.
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:40.480]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper, we have a Congress that is so intent on destroying
[1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:41.680]  the Bill of Rights.
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:46.880]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:51.520]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:55.000]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:02.080]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:07.200]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:10.480]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.760]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:04.160]  for one more week.
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:08.800]  We've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:12.760]  and to be able to watch the mountainage, live reports, the special reports, all my films,
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:14.960]  debuts and so much more.
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:18.600]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:22.600]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system
[1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:23.600]  to shut down.
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:28.400]  PrisonPlanet.tv, we put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:34.360]  Infowars.com forward slash show, but it is the members that are paying it forward and
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:42.240]  helping so many other people see the truth and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:44.440]  much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:49.400]  The reporters, you get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first, and then you can download
[1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:53.840]  it, share it with friends and family, it's a win-win and then you're helping finance
[1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:15.480]  to put it out for free to everybody, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:23.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the Infowars.com
[1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:26.200]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:33.160]  It's definitely a very exciting time to be alive.
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:35.720]  We're going back to our guest, Robert David Steele here in a moment.
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:37.240]  I want to take a few calls for him.
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:38.720]  I'm going to be good and go to him.
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:41.120]  I'm bad about getting a guest on and not going to the calls.
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:50.640]  Another question is your comments, 800-259-9231 for first-time callers, 800-259-9231, briefly,
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.760]  so I want to get right back to our guest.
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:56.640]  We're listeners supported, viewers supported.
[1:33:56.640 --> 1:34:01.120]  We don't get big globalist advertisers.
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:08.260]  We don't get banker bailout money like MSNBC or NPR.
[1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:10.680]  We are supported by the products we sell.
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:14.280]  So A, we try to sell really good products at very competitive prices.
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:16.800]  We try to have a wide selection.
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:22.960]  When you shop with the good guys, you're funding an organization that's promoting true Americana.
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:24.680]  And you know what?
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:25.680]  We built it.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:26.680]  People have come.
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:29.960]  We reach 28 million people a week now worldwide.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:33.380]  About half of our audience is outside the U.S. I love that.
[1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:38.320]  But it's the audience inside the United States that mainly finances what we do.
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:43.680]  If you've not become a nightly news subscriber for $5.95 a month at prisonplanet.tv or m4snews.com,
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:47.360]  you really should check out the benefits and do that.
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:52.280]  We're always telling you you should look online for water testing in your county or your city
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:56.200]  and find out what's being added, what's being done, because of federal laws and state laws,
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:57.400]  it's there.
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:01.640]  And man, they take perfect aquifer water in many areas of the country and just put hundreds
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:03.080]  of horrible things in it.
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:06.200]  What you see happening up in Flint, they should all be filter in their water.
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:10.560]  There should be a nationwide move, you know, to have the government, you know, air lift
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:11.560]  that in.
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:14.200]  But you see, there's so many scams to water, I'm not going to go off into it.
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:16.720]  I went into it in the last hour.
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:21.600]  You need to be filtering your shower water, you need to be filtering your tap water.
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:24.920]  Reverse osmosis is great, but you've got to take mineral supplements because it takes
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:27.640]  out all the minerals.
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:33.400]  If you take some of the other type of water like distilled, it'll kill you, you know,
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:34.400]  in six months or so.
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:37.080]  I mean, I know people that have been drinking that for just two weeks and, you know, gotten
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:40.040]  really sick because there's nothing in there.
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.960]  So again, it's very important that you use the Alexa Pure Pro or you use the Pro Pure
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:52.440]  type systems that we sell that have been tested that are high quality at infowarstore.com.
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:55.080]  And that way you're getting high quality filters with the test on the site.
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:59.120]  The best we can find, very inexpensive for what you get.
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:07.680]  And then we've got the new Pro Pure Pro Max four stage filter that has fast flow and reduces
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:14.120]  or cuts out 200 contaminants plus from your shower water, where you inhale them, where
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:16.880]  you go through your skin.

[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:23.040]  All right, our guest, ladies and gentlemen, joins us, RobertDavidSteel.com.
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:26.440]  He has some other great websites as well.
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:32.280]  There is a new book out that he contributed to, another French false flag, bloody tracks
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  from Paris to San Bernardino.
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.360]  I want to get into that some too, but you were getting into the fact that not everybody's
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:44.880]  a suicidal nihilist or eugenicist in the global combine, but I want to ask you, what is the
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:51.520]  main driving force in the main combines that get together at Bilderberg and Davos and kind
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:54.640]  of iron out their differences like a mafia summit every year?
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:58.440]  And then what are some of these factions you're saying that don't want to bring us into the
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:37:59.440]  new dark age?
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:04.360]  Well, Alex, basically, I think, you know, Animal Farm was a great book.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:11.360]  I think the ultra elite, which certainly leans toward neo-Nazi and even satanic influences,
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:14.000]  they think of us as expendable farm animals.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.280]  They're nothing to them.
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:20.560]  And they basically see profit from war as good.
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:25.080]  And they even like disease because the CDC is a massive scam.
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:29.400]  Most of these vaccines and most of these pharmaceuticals that we're pushing off and most of the stuff
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:35.240]  that we sell on supermarket shelves, it's just plain poison, but it's profitable poison.
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:37.440]  So we're treated as a money machine.
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:45.920]  Now the good news is that a few of the billionaires, Lady Lynn Rothschild, the black sheep billionaires,
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:52.800]  the Mars family in Virginia, a couple of others, maybe Michael Bloomberg in New York City, they're
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:59.120]  starting to understand that the blue collar masterclass, the white collar cubicle class,
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:04.040]  and the academic gold collar class are the golden goose.
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:06.520]  That's the heart of productivity.
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:10.680]  And they're starting to realize that they're getting very close to having people burning
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:11.960]  down their mansions.
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:17.280]  And we have a lot of angry veterans that know how to put a 50 caliber bullet into a lear
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:20.200]  jet that's taking off and landing.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:25.360]  So we're very, very close to an extraordinarily unstable situation.
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:29.600]  So I personally, I sent a certified letter to the governor of Texas, I hope he actually
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:39.240]  gets it, urging him to convene an electoral reform summit and to call for a virtual constitutional
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:40.240]  convention.
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:46.000]  One of the guys I admire besides yourself is Mike Levin and his radio show and his books
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.120]  on liberty and the constitutional convention and so forth.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:55.680]  I think Texas should sponsor a virtual constitutional convention no later than March.
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:00.360]  We need to get all these issues out and we need to understand just how vulnerable the
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:05.320]  United States is to complete meltdown.
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:06.320]  Please continue.
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:15.360]  Well, you know, I mean, I've actually produced a list of seven things and I personally, I'm
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:18.680]  a little concerned about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:21.920]  And if it comes down to Trump or Clinton, I think Michael Bloomberg is going to have
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:23.920]  to run for president.
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:29.440]  I get that Bloomberg takes the Henry Ford position that you've got to have employees
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:31.640]  paid enough to buy your cars.
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:37.160]  And so he isn't pushing it into 21, but he's so anti-gun, yes, he's going to have to,
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:42.320]  he's going to have to compromise on that, you know, and politics is about compromise.
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:47.040]  I think one of the problems with people that are against guns is that they're living in
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:48.040]  an ivory tower.
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:52.080]  Why do so many smart people like you that I agree with like 95% of?
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:57.800]  And people like Harry Dent, like Bloomberg, because I mean, I just can't stand him.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:58.800]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:40:59.800]  Go ahead.
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:00.800]  Yeah, no, that's, that's okay.
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:06.000]  Alex, because I would insist that you be his vice president, so you can be a balancing
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  factor here.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.160]  Um, look, I'm agnostic on who's president.
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.400]  I really don't care.
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:12.920]  I just want my country back.
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:17.280]  I want my constitution restored and I want integrity back in the electoral system.
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:18.280]  We don't have that right now.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.120]  We have a two-party tyranny that is screwing 60% of the public.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:32.120]  Um, and I really believe that we need to find some combination, a bipartisan ticket, a Republican
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:36.640]  and a Democrat, a coalition cabinet, you know, about fantasy football.
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:38.800]  I actually want to have a fantasy cabinet.
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  No, I understand.
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:41.280]  I mean, look, a con con's the way to go.
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:45.280]  And I was never four one, but the constitution's already so gone.
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:49.680]  Why not an emergency point when the states are already on our side to actually go in
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:52.200]  there and get the federal government back in line?
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:56.040]  That's the type of platform bully pulpit that would allow all this, but getting past the
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:41:59.800]  fantasy football, obviously, I mean, Hillary's terrible.
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.160]  What is your issues with Donald Trump?
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:02.320]  I'd love to hear those.
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:07.480]  Well, I, I, I actually published an article in Counterpunch, CounterCoup, how Donald
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:08.960]  Trump can win.
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:14.520]  And I outlined these seven ideas and I was completely blown off by Donald Trump and his
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:15.520]  story.
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:19.800]  The big problem with Trump in my view is that he's me, me, me.
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  Donald Trump is all about Donald Trump.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:27.940]  He does not give a shit about the rest of us.
[1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:29.040]  Mr. Steele, we're on a lot.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:30.040]  I am an FM stations.
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:31.200]  We're able to catch that.
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:32.200]  But, but, uh, please.
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:33.200]  I apologize.
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:34.200]  I apologize.
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:36.880]  No, no, no, no, no, I know you're used to Europe and stuff where people just say what
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:37.880]  they want.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:38.880]  He does not care.
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:41.240]  He does not care about the rest of us.
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:45.840]  One of the big mistakes that he's making is he thinks he can get away with just himself
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.480]  and what he knows.
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:51.880]  Jim Webb has the same problem when Jim Webb says that he, he's his own national security
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:52.880]  advisor.
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:53.880]  There, right?
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:57.600]  That is a sign of my effort to help Trump.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.480]  What do you make of the former Defense Secretary Gates coming out?
[1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:01.480]  Let me know.
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:02.480]  That's true.
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:05.760]  But, uh, and saying Obama calls everybody in and says, I'm smarter than you.
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:08.520]  I can do my, you know, the, the, all your jobs better.
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  Oh, I agree.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:13.680]  I look, see part of the, part of the problem is ever since the assassination of John F.
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:20.040]  Kennedy, every president has been a puppet, uh, from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, they've
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:24.800]  all been puppets and they are all also on these massive ego trips.
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:29.680]  Um, Chris Hedges has written a great book called Empire of Illusion, uh, the loss of
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:32.440]  literacy and the triumph of spectacle.
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:36.200]  All of these presidents think that there's some kind of decider.
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:37.200]  They're not.
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.560]  The decisions are being made by Rockefeller and others in Wall Street in the city of London.
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:44.840]  And these guys are just extremely highly paid actors.
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:49.560]  Now, I think Trump has the power to win.
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:55.280]  If he were, for example, to take Cynthia McKinney as his vice president, a great woman of color
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:03.640]  from Georgia, and if he were to name a coalition cabinet and field a balanced budget and push
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:04.640]  electoral reform.
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:08.860]  I mean, one of the problems with every single senator running for president is that not
[1:44:08.860 --> 1:44:13.720]  a single one of them has been willing to introduce an electoral reform act in Congress.
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:19.640]  You know, it's funny you say that because up until like the thirties and stuff, that's
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:24.360]  what used to happen is if somebody wanted to win, say they were a Democrat or Republican,
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:28.280]  they would end up taking one of the leaders from the other party in a coalition government
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:29.880]  and make them the vice president.
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:30.880]  Why does that happen anymore?
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:36.660]  It's constitutionally mandated, the runner up became vice president, and we had the senators
[1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:38.160]  representing the states.
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:39.160]  Exactly.
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:40.520]  So they got rid of that around the same time too.
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:42.440]  For people that don't know, that's important.
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:48.480]  The state legislatures used to elect the senators showing that state checkmate, that check, yeah.
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:52.240]  That's why I want a constitutional convention, and I'm telling you, Alex, if the governor
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.520]  of Texas will connect with Mike Levin and Sheldon Adelson, who I actually think is going
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:04.960]  to be a huge force in this election, one of the things that has to be settled before we
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:07.960]  have an election is Israel.
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:11.960]  Israel is the third rail in American politics.
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:15.240]  And I believe we have to have a constitutional convention.
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:19.880]  We have to have a truth and reconciliation meeting on Israel and Palestine.
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:24.960]  We have to make some decisions on how we're going to be not funding the Saudi Arabian
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.320]  sponsorship of terrorism and subsidizing- Oh yeah, let me ask you that question.
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:34.640]  Looking at this fog, is the U.S. really allied with the Saudis or the Iranians?
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:39.600]  Are they playing it off as a Sunni Shiite civil war?
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:48.800]  Right now, I think the United States government is actively sponsoring ISIS as a destabilizing
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:49.800]  force.
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:51.200]  So they're really not in the deal with Iran?
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:55.680]  Well, Iran is the adult in the neighborhood.
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.880]  I'm sorry, but I went to college with Iranian engineers, and those are some of the smartest
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:02.400]  guys on the planet.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:06.760]  These are stable, sensible people, and those who are trying to-
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:09.240]  I agree, and like 80% of them hate their government.
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:13.120]  How are these super smart people as smart as they come, the invented chess, run by a
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.800]  bunch of guys who haven't lived in caves?
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:20.800]  Well, Alex, ask yourself why we're run by a bunch of morons in Washington, okay?
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:25.600]  We're all abdicating our responsibility as citizens.
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:27.840]  We are all sitting by the wayside.
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:31.840]  I just had an exchange on LinkedIn with this guy that thinks Bernie Sanders is the cat's
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:32.840]  meow.
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:35.000]  I think Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:39.680]  Sanders is totally committed to the two-party tyranny, and nobody, including Rachel Maddow,
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:45.440]  wants to discuss the fact that the two-party tyranny has disenfranchised 60% of Americans,
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:51.120]  including all Latinos, all blacks, all women, and all youth.
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:54.840]  All I know is Bernie Sanders doesn't talk about crony capitalism.
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:56.840]  He says capitalism's the problem.
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:59.080]  Our problem's crony capitalism.
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:04.880]  Look, Bernie Sanders, actually, whether Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, I would
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:09.960]  vote for anybody that agreed to restore integrity to our electoral process.
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:14.600]  Now that's the other problem with Bernie Sanders, is he wants to create a bigger government
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:20.360]  with more welfare, and more government regulation, and more government mandates.
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.080]  So he's really a light version.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.480]  I've got a wonderful cartoon, which you've probably got around someplace, of this big
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:31.680]  bird with its claws on Capitol Hill, and one wing of the bird is red, and one wing of the
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:41.480]  bird is blue, and the caption is, one bird, two wings, same, and I'll spell it, Alex.
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:42.480]  I don't know.
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:43.480]  No, don't do it.
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:44.480]  Same poop.
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:45.480]  Yeah.
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:46.480]  Yeah.
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:47.480]  Yeah.
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:48.480]  Yeah.
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:49.480]  Let's go to some phone calls real quick.
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:50.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York.
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:51.920]  Go ahead.
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:55.920]  You're on the air with former CIA field commander Robert David Steele, robertdavidsteele.com.
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:59.440]  Hi, you guys.
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:06.360]  I have in my hand here a piece of paper, a news release, and I'm wondering if this times
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:10.520]  in with a false flag in San Bernardino.
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:17.240]  And I'm wondering also if this is fuel for impeachment to get Mr. Obama out of office
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:19.400]  as promptly as possible.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:24.360]  The article says here, nuclear plants shut down if the 10 control rods accidentally fall
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:26.680]  into reactor core.
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:35.160]  That's enough to put the United States out of business within 24 hours caused by smoldering
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:40.720]  event by a brigade on scene, incident of this type could lead to overheating potentially
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:41.720]  results.
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:42.720]  Where is this?
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:43.720]  Where is this?
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:44.720]  When did this happen?
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:47.640]  This happened on December the 7th.
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:48.640]  You know, that's the thing.
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:51.040]  They admit all these reactors are rotting basically.
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:54.000]  There's all these disasters happening and used to be national news.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:58.400]  Do the elite think radiation laws of nature have changed, Mr. Steele?
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:48:59.400]  No.
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.240]  And part of that, my favorite word in the English language is integrity.
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:08.840]  Now Chernobyl and Fukushima have taken us into new places.
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:13.240]  Fukushima is poisoning the entire Pacific Ocean, the entire West Coast.
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:19.120]  The federal government is now undermining all of its radiation control standards.
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.040]  But Ann Coulter said the Japanese should thank him because it's good for you.
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:26.480]  Don't make me go there.
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:33.920]  Look, Alex, the bottom line here is that the entire US culture has become a cheating culture.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:35.760]  That's actually a title of a book.
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:36.760]  That's it.
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  It is.
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.360]  We no longer stand for anything, whether it's New York values or Texas values.
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:45.320]  And we lie to ourselves and think radiation won't hurt our kids.
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:46.320]  Exactly right.
[1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:48.960]  Or vaccines, or poisons on the supermarket.
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:51.200]  So here's the bottom line.
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:50:00.040]  We have got to convene a national conversation in which we focus on restoring the Constitution,
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:06.240]  which includes the runner-up as vice president and senators as representatives of the states.
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.560]  We have to demand that the federal stop owning land and stop taxing citizens.
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:16.440]  I actually think it's unconstitutional for the federal government to tax individual
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:17.440]  citizens.
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:19.760]  We are the United States of America.
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:20.760]  Well, it is.
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:21.760]  It is until 1913.
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:22.760]  You're absolutely on target.
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:26.720]  And people have grown up in slavery so long, they don't even know that what we're saying
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:28.200]  is what made America so great.
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:30.200]  Well, I can't say this enough times.
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:34.960]  The governor of Texas and Mike Levin and you and a few others have the power with Sheldon
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:40.680]  Adelson to bring us all together in a virtual constitutional convention.
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:45.640]  Not an actual constitutional convention, but a virtual constitutional convention in March
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:46.640]  in Texas.
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:49.120]  Let's get all this on the table.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.440]  And again, even if it was just ceremonial, it would have so much attention to it as
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:55.440]  a debate.
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:58.880]  You can't lose because then it isn't even binding, but you started the first wave.

[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:30.680]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:33.840]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.000]  I loved my dad.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  The boy was he stubborn.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:39.160]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[1:53:39.160 --> 1:53:40.160]  His excuse?
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:41.360]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:42.960]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:47.920]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for

[1:53:56.520 --> 1:54:01.880]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:15.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:15.040]  The 3rd hour is coming up and then of course we have the 4th hour hosted by InfoWars Nightly
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:16.040]  News.
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:21.840]  7 o'clock Central Standard Time this evening and of course we have the weekend 4-6pm Central
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:26.080]  radio show that I host and I will be hosting that this weekend.
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:30.960]  David Knight and Leigh Ann McAdoo will be in Flint, Michigan tomorrow covering where
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.840]  they're trying to cause, divide, and conquer race stuff over the horrible, poisoned water
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:40.720]  the government was feeding people, was giving them to have, and then telling them it was
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:41.720]  fine.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:45.520]  That's what they do across the board, but they want to turn it into a race issue.
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:46.520]  Fine.
[1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:49.160]  If that gets attention to it, you know, I finally agree with Michael Moore.
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:51.240]  It is genocide.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:55.040]  But what about the 40% of people that are there that are white or Hispanic?
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:54:59.560]  Oh, it's 60% or black is genocide.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:01.880]  So then I don't agree with Moore.
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:02.880]  Is it genocide?
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:09.520]  If it was 60% white in the town, it's an attack on us and folks, there is social engineering
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:10.680]  going on through the water.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:13.920]  They make jokes about it, Dr. Strangelove.
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:16.840]  It's really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:18.400]  It's really happening.
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:21.960]  They admit fluoride is doing all this and coming up, Dr. Gribbs is going to be in the
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:25.000]  studio to talk about that, how it affects fertility and more.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.440]  He's going to be with us for a little bit of this segment and the next segment and Mr.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  Steele is going to leave us.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.240]  I want to get him up every few months just to talk about news, I want to get him up next
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:38.200]  week if he can do it, just to get into false flags itself, some of his CIA stories they
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:42.280]  can get into, whether it's I want to go to a few more calls right now, but I cannot stress
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:47.440]  enough to you that we've reached an event horizon point, not just for this show, but
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:50.920]  for Liberty based media period.
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.360]  If you continue to tell friends and family and neighbors and on your Facebook posts and
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.680]  Twitter about info wars.com forward slash show.
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:00.680]  If you continue to say, hey, you want the answers, it's here.
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:02.340]  People are ready to hear it now.
[1:56:02.340 --> 1:56:07.200]  We have tripled online audiences with audio and video feeds the last three months.
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:10.320]  Normally it maybe doubles in a year if we're lucky.
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:15.720]  We've been growing exponential, tripling the last three, three and a half months at a scary
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:16.720]  level.
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:17.880]  So expenses go up as well with bandwidth.
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:22.200]  So please, please support us financially by shopping and info wars.com, but keep spreading
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:23.200]  the word.
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:26.440]  And Mr. Steele, I want to go to a few calls here in this segment and the next, but the
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:30.800]  few months we have left, the experience I'm having of our audience exploding and Chris
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:33.880]  Carter coming out and saying, the new X files is based on Alex Jones.
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:34.880]  We reached out to him.
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:38.440]  He says, he knows his admirer, big listener, we're going to hook up the fact that just
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:43.320]  myself as a ping as a culture person, it's not me, me, me, but I'm saying, you know,
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:48.520]  who Alex Jones is getting so big is an example of how the establishments losing the info
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:49.520]  war.
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  Do you agree with that statement?
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:52.520]  I do agree with that statement.
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.560]  They are losing the info war.
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:55.560]  And what's happening.
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:56.920]  So look at, look at ABC.
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:59.880]  What's happening is they're not controlling everybody.
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:07.880]  So the national news media had witnesses on national television talking about three white
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:13.120]  paramilitary dressed men shooting up San Bernardino.
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:18.200]  And then the FEMA, whoever it is, it's running the narrative swoops in.
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:23.640]  Of course the FBI is already there and they stopped that narrative and too many American
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:28.240]  citizens don't notice the disconnect, okay?
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:30.080]  But it's happening more and more often.
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:32.920]  And so I think they are losing the narrative.
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:38.480]  And I think that if Texas were to sponsor a national conversation, I think we could
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:42.160]  actually mobilize most of the country into paying attention.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.280]  Well, we do support the governor and his call for a con con for real with the states, but
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:52.880]  I agree host a summit about a con con and discuss what the states would do there to
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:53.880]  generate.
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:54.880]  I mean, that's how you do it.
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:56.800]  We need a pre convention.
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:57:57.800]  Do a dry run.
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  Absolutely.
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:03.320]  And that dry run will then define the thing because one of the problems that we have is
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:08.560]  that these Republican and Democratic debates are low level idiocy.
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:13.760]  Not a single candidate can actually discuss the 10 high level threats to humanity or the
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:20.000]  12 core policy domains or why Latinos, women, blacks and children are being screwed by the
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.520]  existing policies and by their plan policies.
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:28.280]  Not a single one of them has actually got a full employment plan for this country.
[1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:33.680]  So I think a pre conference, a dry run of a constitutional convention.
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:35.200]  Robert David Steele, stay there.
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:39.400]  We're going to come back and take a few phone calls.
[1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:40.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  And then Dr. Griffin in studio.

[1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:00.480]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[1:59:51.280 --> 2:00:13.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:14.280]  Check it out.
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:22.080]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  And there's the InfoWars.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:30.480]  If you are a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer watching a live feed or watching an InfoWars.com for
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:38.480]  a slash show, you can see the InfoWars News Center and that is just one wing.
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:45.240]  We have three other rooms and a fourth being set up right now crammed full of patriots scanning
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:50.960]  the news, putting information on social media, running shows, getting clips together, producing
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:57.120]  reports, editing video, talking to investigative journalists, lining up Psy Hirsch, lining up
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:02.720]  Donald Trump, lining up Ted Cruz, lining up Rand Paul, just in here building real media
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:07.640]  and telling you what we think not hiding our bias to promote liberty and freedom.
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:09.640]  Robert David Steele is our guest.
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:10.640]  RobertDavidSteele.com.
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:13.800]  He also has his other great news sites you can link through there.
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:18.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in Arizona than Jim and others.
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:19.640]  Paul, you're on the air.
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:22.280]  Hey Alex, may God bless you.
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:25.360]  I have a question for Mr. Steele.
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:32.600]  We all know that Libby, I had a boatload of gold and does, do we know where the gold is
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:35.440]  now after he's been assassinated?
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:39.920]  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure we took it.
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:44.080]  That's right, every time there's a war and everything is looted, no one asked where
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:47.040]  all the antiquities of the gold, the treasury money went.
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.880]  It's just default to not ask questions.
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:54.600]  No, I mean, we ran out of gold and there's very strong rumors that Tim Geithner, when
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:01.040]  he was at the Fed in New York, was actually selling false gold, titanium covered with
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:02.760]  gold cheating.
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:06.480]  I don't think Fort Knox has any gold in it.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:12.520]  So I do believe that a lot of gold was stolen in 9-11 by prior arrangement, and I do believe
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:16.280]  that the Libyan gold was a major target of our attack.
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:20.200]  All right, sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:26.960]  I said, I believe that too, because he wanted to start the, well, I mean, we now have the
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:27.960]  State Department emails.
[2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:28.960]  Good to hear from you, Paul.
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:31.320]  I mean, we're just proving right again, just over and over again.
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:34.560]  And that's the thing, it's not that hard if you just study history.
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:36.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Washington.
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:38.960]  You're on the air with our former CIA insider.
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  Go ahead.
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:45.760]  Hey, Alex, I really appreciate your show, and Mr. Steele, I have a two-point question
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:48.320]  regarding constitutional convention.
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:56.800]  First of all, since our cheating culture is not obeying the Constitution now, what makes
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:03:00.360]  anyone think that a couple of more amendments are going to make any difference?
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:06.880]  And secondly, once a Constitution is, a Constitutional Convention is started, it becomes an entity
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:07.880]  unto itself.
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:13.960]  And like the first one, an only one that we've had without a control, and since the elite
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:19.600]  have plans for a Constitutional Convention like this, how do you plan on controlling
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  something like this?
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:21.600]  Absolutely.
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:22.840]  I've always been against it for those reasons.
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:25.280]  We're in such desperate, we're in such dangerous straits.
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.840]  Now all I'm saying is, is that if it's led by patriots from the beginning, we can control
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:38.000]  it, we can have dry runs as well, and then we can sit there and try to actually fix the
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.760]  country and use it as a way to educate the public with leadership against the culture
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:43.760]  of corruption.
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:44.760]  But the caller's right.
[2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:49.640]  If we are a fallen society, maybe we're like Humpty Dumpty and can't be put back together
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:50.640]  again.
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:51.640]  Go ahead.
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:52.640]  It comes back to state rights.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:57.360]  I mean, first off, the Constitution has been undermined by some of these amendments.
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.120]  This whole Electoral College thing is a huge mistake in my view.
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.720]  The 17th Amendment getting rid of the Senators.
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:04.720]  Exactly.
[2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:06.720]  And the 12th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, the first amendment.
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:08.080]  The 16th, it gives us the IRS.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:10.760]  It all happened in 1913 with the last concon.
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  Right.
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:16.880]  Now let me, let me make the comment that I shall have a concon to reverse the last concon.
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:21.120]  I'd actually like to have a concon that is out of control with the public being out of
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:25.760]  control rather than a concon that's out of control with the elites being out of control.
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:29.040]  I have more faith in the average American than I do in our elite.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  I'll say this.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:31.200]  Desperate times mean desperate means.
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:32.700]  They're ignoring it all anyways.
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:36.120]  I just say throw it all into hell and let God sort it out.
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:38.120]  Let's have a national conversation.
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  And I've never agreed with this and I'm not sure I can really do now.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:44.440]  I'm just saying, I really know Greg Abbots for real.
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:45.760]  We're already dying on the table here.
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:47.000]  I don't know what else we can do.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.800]  But Mr. Steele, great debate.
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:50.760]  Jim, great points, Jim.
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:52.760]  I hear you.
[2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:55.520]  I totally understand your points and I'm looking at both.
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:57.280]  Mr. Steele, thank you so much.
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:04:58.280]  My pleasure, Alex.
[2:04:58.280 --> 2:04:59.280]  Bye-bye.
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:04.600]  A declassified email sent on April 2, 2011 to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
[2:05:04.600 --> 2:05:09.240]  reveals the invasion of Libya was launched to prevent more Mar Gaddafi from establishing
[2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:12.920]  a pan-African currency based on Libya's gold.
[2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:17.000]  According to the document posted on the U.S. State Department website, advisors to the
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:23.240]  second son of Gaddafi told sources the Libyan government held 143 tons of gold and a similar
[2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:27.040]  amount of silver valued at more than $7 billion.
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:32.080]  The gold and silver was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the French franc
[2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:33.400]  for African countries.
[2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:38.320]  A large number of Western African countries are former French colonies and many continue
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:40.880]  to hold French as the official language.
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:45.880]  During the invasion of Libya, analysts argued Gaddafi planned to stop selling oil in U.S.
[2:05:45.880 --> 2:05:49.120]  dollars and demanded instead it be traded in gold.
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:53.840]  Prior to the invasion, Gaddafi urged other African and Middle Eastern nations to follow
[2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:54.840]  suit.
[2:05:54.840 --> 2:05:58.680]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:19.400]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:33.080]  the Info War.
[2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:39.080]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, we're here live, broadcasting
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:40.080]  worldwide.
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:44.120]  Dr. Gribbs can be pulling double duty today, in fact, let's get both these guys in this
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:48.600]  studio today if we can, so you guys can go into the situation room, you're here in the
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:52.760]  war room, you're going to be here for this hour, and then continuing on with phone calls
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:57.920]  for listeners, Dr. Gribbs, into the fourth hour today, and then we're going to really
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:08:58.920]  make you work.
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:03.480]  We're going to interview on another subject on health and wellness for the nightly news
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:04.480]  this evening.
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:09.080]  We're going to be talking about the water situation, what's happening in Flint that they're calling
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:10.080]  racism.
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:13.440]  How about anti-human behavior?
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:18.840]  Never knew they were giving poison water to people, needs to be indicted, they're saying
[2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:23.040]  make the governor resign, fine, but actually get who's responsible and go after them,
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:26.720]  but water is being poisoned all over, so that's the larger issue.
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:32.560]  I'm upset about water being toxic across the board, that's why we say get water filtration,
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:37.240]  and the best systems, the best prices are in InfoWarStore.com, and you're funding a
[2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:41.960]  hardcore operation promoting liberty, takes a lot of money to do that, so it is a win,
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:44.080]  win, win, 360 win.
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:52.280]  Now I have had so many people, for whatever reason, themes come up in your life.
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:57.800]  And I've seen a theme in the last few months with friends and family, and my personal trainer
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:03.360]  that trains me a few times a week, who's married, wants to have kids soon, and so many others
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:11.640]  saying everybody I know, even 25, 30, 35-year-olds, not just 40-year-old women, can't have kids,
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:12.640]  and it's admitted.
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:17.440]  We're going to just type into the search engine, Western fertility drops, sperm counts drop
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:25.600]  by 87 to 95% depending on what study, what country, but it's over 90% on average.
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:33.600]  GMO is leaching out the modified organisms into your DNA, into your mitochondrial DNA
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:38.480]  that's in the women as well, and folks go, men got mitochondria too, mitochondrial
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:44.760]  DNA, not mitochondria, the engine of the cell, mitochondrial DNA that only the women
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:51.720]  have, men have a little bit of it, an inception, but Dr. Roop can explain that.
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:56.480]  There is a scientific attack going on.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:59.720]  We have ecoscience, it's actually on the fluoride, dropped it earlier, somebody comes
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:05.440]  and gets it for me, where the White House science are, talks about fluoride in the water
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:08.920]  to lower your fertility and other compounds, fluoride is an adjuvant, so we're going to
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:14.080]  be getting to all of that in this hour, coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'll segue
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:23.800]  some too, into Obama Eye's audacious use of executive power in final year, will Damascus
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.120]  enemies use their proxies to disrupt Syrian peace talks, USDA study confirms GM contamination
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:37.800]  between GM and non-GM crops, Monsanto works hard to evict Argentine protesters, Christianity
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:42.640]  dying in Britain in new study, only Islam growing, protesters across the nation demand
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:47.960]  higher wages to end police brutality on MLK, it's like a communist movement, what you want
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:52.960]  is jobs and industry, not higher wages, they got high wages in Zimbabwe, what's it take
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:12:00.320]  like a billion Zimbabwe dollars to buy a piece of bread, just people don't get it, you know,
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:05.360]  I mean it's $5 an hour, it's like $100 an hour, 80 years ago, people just don't understand,
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:08.400]  but they get played by people like Bernie Sanders, and then I'm going to get into the
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:16.280]  huge Islamist wave, what's happening behind that, but there's a story up on DrudgeReport.com
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:23.280]  of great interest, Sarah Palin, who I like, she's been demonized, called stupid by the
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:26.760]  liberal media, because you know, that's what liberals do, is call women stupid, and they're
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:32.760]  talking about him getting her to run as his VP, I think that would be unstoppable, absolutely
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:40.480]  unstoppable, and I think Sarah Palin would really be great, who knows, Ted Cruz, maybe
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:46.520]  she'll run with Ted Cruz, the point is, that will Trump, pun intended, the stick of Hillary
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:50.640]  being a woman, so you're against a woman if you're not for, I mean, I always say a Palin
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:56.960]  would've run, you know, it takes a Titan to defeat a Titan to quote, clash with the Titans,
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:04.080]  the Gorgon Medusa against the Kraken, so who is the Kraken, who is Medusa, we all know
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:11.840]  Hillary is the Medusa in this whole situation, so maybe our Kraken can defeat the Gorgon,
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:14.720]  maybe that's why they tell you, Bilderberg meetings has been confirmed, don't look Hillary
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:18.880]  in the eyes, I'm serious, that's how arrogant and out of touch she is, but she's a woman
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:19.880]  of the people.
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:24.360]  Well, I'll take a lady on a snowmobile with a shotgun and a horseback any day over hers,
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:27.920]  pro-gun, pro-liberty, I mean, she's a little warmongering, I got problems with her, but
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:31.400]  I mean, compared to Hillary, whatever, Hillary's even more warmongering, so what are you gonna
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:41.400]  do, but then below on DrugsReport.com, we have an article by Kit Daniels, Davos Insiders,
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:48.160]  self-driving cars spy on you, autonomous cars function as ground-based surveillance drones,
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:53.760]  and then multi-source platforms, GM says, and Obama wants $6 billion to help force implement
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:14:02.360]  this, $6 billion to finance rolling them out, and then you don't own your car, all the sensors
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:07.840]  are owned by the company that sells the data to the government and taxes you by the miles,
[2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:15.080]  and Davos even admits that's happening, that story's up on Infowars.com and DrugsReport.com,
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:19.200]  as well as our backup site, sometimes Infowars gets taken down or has problems, it's not
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:23.400]  very often, it has a little bit of downtime, maybe an hour a month or something, prison
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:28.000]  planet.com, which we're gonna have a whole new redesign soon, different from Infowars,
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:32.440]  different layout, it's the site's gonna really, really explode once that happens.
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:37.160]  Okay, and of course then there's prisonplanet.tv.
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:43.800]  Now, Dr. Edward Groop is here in studio with us, he's also an Army Special Operations Veteran,
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:47.760]  good buddy of mine, really awake to what's happening, he's also a nutritionist and many
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:53.760]  other things, and he is kind of one of the masterminds along with some other medical
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:58.480]  doctors and scientists that we use in chemists, and some of the top formulators, three of
[2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:01.760]  the biggest organic producers in the country, we produce our products at four places, but
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:07.040]  about half our products are produced with Dr. Groop because his are of the highest quality,
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:12.400]  I'm not gonna get into a pitch till later, but here's a short one, a lot of times we
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:18.200]  can't have products sometimes for upwards of six months as you've seen because we can't
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:24.720]  get the wet, super high quality herbs that are cold pressed that actually have the living
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:28.520]  enzymes and cofactors in them that give you the full response.
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:34.120]  A lot of things, you know, most of their budgets in advertising, glitz, hot models, a bunch
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:38.960]  of bull, a bunch of FDA trouble, we don't do that, we don't make claims, any of it,
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:43.240]  we just say, here is the product, try it out and get ready.
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:48.520]  So with us, you'll have a $20 bottle and $8 of it is the product, you think, well that's
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:52.080]  a double markup, yeah we gotta fund ourselves, the average markup is seven fold folks, ours
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:58.680]  is only about 120%, you know, you're talking $75, $80 a bottle in DNA force of cost, then
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:01.440]  we're selling it for $150.
[2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:05.040]  Leading competitors that aren't even as good are $300, $400, $500, one of my buddies who's
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:11.000]  a huge competitive person in sports, I won't say his name, was in here and he said, this
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:17.200]  has this much bio PQQ in it and he goes, I bought a bottle of that with a third the dose
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:24.120]  of this and it was $60 and it had a third of the dose, that's just one ingredient.
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:30.040]  The CoQ10, all the rest of it was at $12,000 to $14,000 a kilo in DNA force, that's why
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:35.000]  it cost that much, it's really a nutraceutical, it's been proven, it's one of the few things
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.440]  out there where you can actually say what it does.
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:42.080]  Nerve regrowth, I mean it's just incredible, you will get numb in parts of your body that
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:45.400]  have been hurt before, at least I did, I heard that and I took it and it blew me away.
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:51.480]  So Dr. Grip is here, before we get into fertility, that's the big discussion here and why it's
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:56.680]  going down so fast, why the sperm are dying, why the women are so infertile, what's happening,
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:00.440]  a true children of men scenario, in the few minutes we have, I want to do this because
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:04.560]  you brought it up Dr. Grip and you're gonna be here for the next hour and 40 minutes.
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:09.240]  Super male vitality, we've had two different formulations where it just gets stronger,
[2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:14.000]  where you added more things, we now have the third generation but it's the same bottle,
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:19.080]  we're not changing the label to call it the third round, it's like X2 is the second generation,
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:25.400]  we ever changed it, I guess it'll be X3, this is really the X3 of super male vitality, it
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:30.800]  has changed, it's stronger, it's even more syrupy, it's even more concentrated, I'm
[2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:35.520]  gonna taste some more of it right now, what have you done to make it even better?
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:41.920]  Well it's the same herbs, except we just constantly look for better sources of herbs, fresher
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:47.360]  herbs, you know we always want to get the best of the best of the best, so anytime you're
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:52.080]  dealing with any type of liquid extraction, herbal extractions, you're always gonna have
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:56.920]  changes in taste, color, consistency and smell.
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:17:58.600]  It's like batches of wine.
[2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:03.320]  Especially depending on the time of the year it was produced, depending on the freshness
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:04.320]  of the herbs.
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:05.320]  That's a lot stronger.
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:09.320]  So you can, what I wanted to let people know is, especially with the super male vitality,
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:10.320]  doesn't taste good.
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:14.240]  Don't be alarmed as an herbalist and someone who knows and tastes herbs.
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:16.920]  Well this stuff tastes like five times stronger, what on earth?
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:21.080]  Well because the Tonka Dalee is actually one of the worst tasting herbs, you know you
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:22.080]  gotta remember these.
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:23.560]  I like how it makes me feel.
[2:18:23.560 --> 2:18:26.440]  Is we want to concentrate it in the end result, that's what we're looking for.
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:28.440]  That doesn't really taste bad but it's got a rich flavor.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:32.040]  So I mean don't be disturbed if you taste an herb and it tastes one way this time.
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:33.040]  It makes your mouth tingle.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:34.560]  Your body knows it's getting something there.
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:35.560]  It does.
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:37.680]  And the next time you order it, it might taste a little bit different.
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.440]  But just to let everybody know, it's the same process.
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:42.600]  We're not changing up any of the herbs.
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:47.720]  It's actually stronger, it's more effective and you know, don't return your bottle if
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:49.400]  you get it because it tastes different.
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:54.120]  It's just that's the way good herbal extraction supplements are.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:56.160]  This is an alcohol with three drops of herbs.
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:59.800]  This is like where you just continue to cold press it until it's a syrup.
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:03.960]  If you have a good supplement and you have a good process, then you expect a little bit
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:08.200]  of change on each batch because just even though you're doing the exact thing.
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:11.200]  What you're saying is, you were telling me off air, this vintage is stronger.
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:12.200]  Yes.
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:14.920]  I know you can't quantify it but how much stronger?
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:18.160]  I would say probably 10% stronger.
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:19.160]  Yeah.
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:20.160]  Well, I know this.
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:22.400]  We got 15% off, super melvitality.
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:25.960]  When you get it with X2 today, both of them are 15% off.
[2:19:25.960 --> 2:19:31.280]  That's the special this week, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, your purchase again makes
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:32.280]  it all possible.
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:36.040]  Dr. Grip, you're going to have the floor, I'm always bad button in backing you up when
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:37.040]  you say stuff.
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:43.040]  We're going to be flashing news articles on screen constantly about IQs going down, about
[2:19:43.040 --> 2:19:47.800]  you know, all the things that are happening, about fertility going down for TV viewers.
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:51.920]  Radiolisters will be going over the headlines, you got a lot of mainstream studies and articles.
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:55.600]  Fertility, how do you fight back against what they're artificially doing?
[2:19:55.600 --> 2:19:58.600]  Some of it by accident, others by design.
[2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:01.600]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinovets.
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:04.240]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:07.160]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:08.160]  pickpocketing.
[2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:11.600]  10 years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:15.520]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip
[2:20:15.520 --> 2:20:16.520]  called RFID.
[2:20:16.520 --> 2:20:20.520]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:25.480]  Soon after it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports, hotel room
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:29.560]  keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[2:20:29.560 --> 2:20:33.360]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with
[2:20:33.360 --> 2:20:34.360]  the world.
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:37.560]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:40.840]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[2:20:40.840 --> 2:20:44.880]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet, sleeves or badge holders

[2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:08.720]  By the way guys, I'm not getting off into a plug fest and I'm going to hand this over
[2:24:08.720 --> 2:24:12.680]  to Dr. Griffin and I'll give him the floor for much of the hour and he's into the next
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:18.360]  hour where Anthony gives you already in the same studio but I just heard my own ad for
[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:24.280]  the ProPure ProMax four stage shower filter that literally cuts out or reduces things
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:26.760]  to non-detectable levels across the board.
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:27.760]  So amazing.
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:33.320]  I forgot it's not just 10% off the promo code water, it's free shipping.
[2:24:33.320 --> 2:24:36.680]  So I'm plugging stuff on there and I'm not even telling you how good the deals are.
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:40.520]  With all the stuff we hear about that's in the water, I love the fact that John P. Holdren,
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:46.600]  the eugenicist, the exterminist, just got hacked by teen activists, guaranteed their
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:47.600]  listeners.
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:52.400]  This guy's a true villain but I'm going to shut up now and get into how we strike back.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:54.720]  Can we mitigate all the stuff in the environment?
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:24:56.640]  Can we not always miss all the GMO?
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:24:58.880]  No, it's in the air.
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:00.040]  Can we filter everything out?
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:02.920]  No, but we can reduce it and live longer, be healthier.
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:08.320]  If not for ourselves, how about for our children, but what about fertility?
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:10.680]  World fertility's plummeting.
[2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:15.080]  Now that Brazil's taking on vaccines and Western medicine, they're plummeting.
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:16.200]  Breast cancer's way up.
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:20.240]  I mean, you follow this, it's like day following night.
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:24.080]  So Dr. Group, this is about six minutes of this segment, long segment coming up.
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:29.640]  The war on fertility, why is it happening and what are natural things freely available
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:33.000]  that are known to boost it?
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.960]  This is something that's been happening for quite some time now and in order for, it's
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:44.060]  really a sad scenario because in order to prepare your body and all the people that
[2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:48.760]  fall in love and get married and want to have children, one of the most devastating things
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:53.760]  to relationships right now is not being able to have children.
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:58.600]  It's separating the male and the female and the female thinks that it's them that the
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:00.280]  problem is.
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:05.240]  The male doesn't really know what's going on and now there's these fertility clinics
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:09.640]  that are popping up all over the world, all over the United States and it's a big money
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:10.640]  game.
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:14.680]  It's like chemotherapy and radiation, it's the same for fertility.
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:19.720]  But in order to be, and no one is addressing the root cause of the problem, why do we have
[2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:25.240]  such a fertility problem in America and all over the world today?
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:30.920]  The doctors, they don't know, the scientists, they don't know, the pharmaceutical companies
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:36.120]  know, the big chemical companies know what it is, is designed as part of a population
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:41.640]  control scheme, but of course people like us know what the situation is.
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:49.520]  I mean, your body has to be aligned spiritually, mentally, physically.
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:58.080]  Your body has to be clean in order for conception to occur, for a baby to come in this world.
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:06.080]  And it's so hard when you have the main causative actions that are out there that are preventing
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.280]  fertility to happen and it's really simple.
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:14.640]  What you have is an attack on the endocrine system.
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.080]  Most people, most doctors, you can say, hey, what's the endocrine system?
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:19.080]  What is it?
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:20.080]  What does it do?
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:24.980]  And most people don't even know, but the endocrine system in your body is a vital system.
[2:27:24.980 --> 2:27:32.400]  Your endocrine system is made up of glands, hormone secreting glands, your pineal gland,
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:41.600]  your pituitary gland, your thyroid, your parathyroid, your pancreas, your adrenal glands, your
[2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:47.280]  GI tract, which is the number one and the biggest endocrine gland in the body.
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:54.720]  And when you focus on why we have infertility, why we have sterility, why we have depression,
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.600]  anxiety, and many other problems today and why we have cancer exploding, you have to
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:01.480]  track it to one simple thing.
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:04.840]  It's an attack on the endocrine system.
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:06.300]  People are getting thyroid cancer.
[2:28:06.300 --> 2:28:07.800]  The thyroid is malfunctioning.
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:10.040]  Oh, by the way, guess what?
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:14.600]  The testes and the ovaries are part of the endocrine system.
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:17.760]  And again, never a question why is cancer exploding.
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:21.880]  Never a question why they say in England half the public will have it by 2024.
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:23.320]  That was London independent.
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.000]  There's no discussion why is breast cancer up 3, 4,000 percent.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  Just no discussion.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:29.480]  No, no discussion.
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:32.200]  So what is it that's attacking the endocrine system?
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:34.640]  Oh, John P. Holdren told us he's killing us.
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:42.160]  Yeah, well, all you have to do is breathe the air, drink the water, eat the food, and
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:45.200]  watch the media and listen to all the negativity on the air.
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:47.840]  And you're going to be stressed and all the things that are going to be affecting the
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:50.640]  endocrine system, but really the main things.
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:54.520]  And this is, listen, I can give people some suggestions here on how to get pregnant probably
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:59.440]  in a short period of time because it's not that hard to repair the endocrine system.
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:04.560]  When you know the root cause of the problem, once you know the root cause is I need to
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:06.320]  come over to your house.
[2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:07.320]  No, the root cause.
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:08.320]  You don't even need to come over to my house.
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:09.320]  It's a joke.
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:10.320]  It's a joke.
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:11.320]  I know.
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:12.320]  It's a joke.
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:13.320]  I know.
[2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:14.320]  I know.
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:15.320]  I know.
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:16.320]  I got three kids.
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:17.320]  You got.
[2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:18.320]  We got three kids, right?
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:19.320]  Two.
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:20.320]  No, I have two kids.
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:21.320]  Yeah.
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:22.320]  It's a horrible joke.
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:23.320]  They made it in the back of the day.
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:24.320]  They're like, Alex, we can just send you over to somebody's house and there's a problem.
[2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:25.320]  It's a joke.
[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:26.320]  It's a Christian show.
[2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:27.320]  I apologize.
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:30.320]  It's a joke.
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:34.320]  And we know how high your testosterone levels can get on a daily basis, which is not a bad
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:38.760]  thing considering the fact that most men out there have low testosterone and low hormone
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:40.600]  levels and we'll get back to that in the next second.
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:41.600]  Which is all about us.
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:42.600]  And then the women are hyper feminine.
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:43.600]  They're like, great.
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:44.600]  No, no.
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  That's why you then get breast cancer so quick.
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:46.600]  We'll be back.
[2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:47.600]  It's a 30-year-old woman.
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:49.400]  I'd have a 70-year-old woman's breast.
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:51.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:30:00.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.600 --> 2:30:05.880]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:08.600]  the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:14.160]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp, secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building
[2:30:14.160 --> 2:30:18.920]  formerly known as James Bell Tavern in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:23.920]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:29.440]  realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:34.120]  How appropriate that part of the building has been torn down while other parts remain,
[2:30:34.120 --> 2:30:35.120]  commenter W.C.
[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:40.400]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper, we have a Congress that is so intent on destroying
[2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:41.560]  the Bill of Rights.
[2:30:41.560 --> 2:30:46.800]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[2:30:46.800 --> 2:30:51.440]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:31:20.960]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[2:32:57.360 --> 2:33:14.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:14.360 --> 2:33:22.920]  Look at these headlines, Shelf-Draving Cars Function at Ground Base Surveillance Drones.
[2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:28.840]  Under that, mainstream news, humanity's last century, re-engineering will lead to creation
[2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:31.160]  of new species.
[2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:35.880]  How many times you heard me talk about that, a lot of you that have been listening in Central
[2:33:35.880 --> 2:33:40.480]  Texas, for 20 years.
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:45.680]  How many times, folks, have you heard us warn of that over and over again?
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:50.960]  Because that's what the elite believe that they are building.
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:53.560]  That's the system they say they're setting up.
[2:33:53.560 --> 2:33:55.080]  The Daily Mail.
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:59.120]  Could this be humanity's last century experts re-engineering our children will lead to creation
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:00.120]  of new species?
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:03.440]  Well, they're already saying, oh, because two men can't have a baby together.
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:07.560]  They don't want to have it with a woman that volunteers to have the sperm implanted.
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:10.160]  We have to splice the two men together.
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:12.920]  But because that doesn't work, we're going to splice three men.
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:14.520]  That's not even a human.
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:20.040]  And then because they make it about gay rights, they've now made a Frankenperson.
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:25.520]  They're now rolling out everywhere that, oh, farms all over the U.S., they're gestating
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:28.440]  humanoids inside cows, pigs, and sheep.
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:34.360]  We harvest their tissue, see, because we don't care about each other.
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:35.440]  We don't care about ourselves.
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:36.440]  We care about NFL.
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:37.760]  We're experts on NFL.
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:43.940]  And so who cares if there's chimera bases?
[2:34:43.940 --> 2:34:47.160]  Imagine what we don't know.
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:49.320]  Imagine what else is going on.
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:50.320]  It goes on and on.
[2:34:50.320 --> 2:34:51.320]  Look at this.
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:57.440]  Sperm and eggs carry genetic memories of parents' health well before conception.
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:34:59.080]  And so the egg and the sperm are communicating.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:00.640]  You talk about magic.
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:03.520]  And our government is just jacking with these corporations with this.
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:06.880]  They have been having no idea of what they're doing because it's just randomly discovering
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:09.480]  things and giving rise to all these new super illnesses.
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:14.880]  We're going back to Dr. Group here in just a moment and we have folks that have questions
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:15.880]  for Dr. Group.
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:20.720]  We'll get to some of this hour and right into the next, George, Angelo, Steve, Rick, Doug,
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:23.880]  and others told for a number to join us, 800-25-99-231.
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:27.000]  I'm going to get to these here pretty soon, but briefly.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.720]  In Donald Trumpland, we're busy fighting with each other over.
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.120]  You're not being any black directors or black people in the Oscars.
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:39.200]  I'll be honest with you.
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:42.000]  I think something's going on there.
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:45.560]  Hollywood is very focused on itself.
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:52.320]  They're always pushing equality and integration, but you go to Hollywood in the elite circles.
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:53.320]  It's white.
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:36:00.040]  It's white as the newborn white babies behind as the driven snow and it's beyond that.
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:01.640]  You go see movies.
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:05.600]  It's either movies for black people or movies for white people or movies for Hispanics.
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:07.920]  They're all about balkanization.
[2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:08.920]  Then they play on that.
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:13.640]  I think there's something there, but while you're busy boycotting that, because I mean,
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:23.200]  I've seen some movies that deserve it, but I'm digressing.
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:27.120]  The point is it's a diversion from how humanity itself is under attack.
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:33.000]  Strong like John Wayne, Donald Trump holds campaign event in front of John Wayne statue.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:38.040]  By the way, we're going to edit a separate video of just group on fertility this hour
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:42.080]  and next all together informationally to put out for folks that want specifically know
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:43.080]  about that.
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:45.080]  You're about to have the floor of the rest of the segment, but I want folks to know, but
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:47.920]  I've just got to finish some of this news.
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:52.240]  Strong like John Wayne, Donald Trump holds campaign event in front of John Wayne statue.
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:54.520]  I think it's a great idea.
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:59.920]  A nice little stunt, but speaking of that, Trump, as you know, tweeted a photo of an
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.240]  info wars.com Hillary for prison shirt a few weeks ago, and we had gotten a bunch made
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:07.920]  at the end of the year, but it's a limited edition when those sell out no more.
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:11.240]  There are some sizes left because they did do a big order.
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:16.880]  If you want the Hillary for prison shirt on the front 2016 on the back, it says legalized
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:18.280]  freedom info wars.com.
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:22.120]  We can show you that photo of the tweet and the photo of the young lady.
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  They're wearing the shirt.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:26.960]  They've gotten a lot of attention around the country with people wearing it.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:30.040]  And yes, when Trump says something about anybody, we might as well play it.
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:33.600]  I've been told that Trump liked the interview he did that he would like to come back on
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:34.600]  at some time.
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:36.760]  I personally wanted to send him a thank you note.
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:37.760]  I haven't done it yet.
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:39.320]  I've got his personal address.
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:41.000]  I'm going to do that probably today or tomorrow.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:44.680]  I've been meeting it for weeks and then he's probably going to be coming back on.
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:49.240]  But regardless, a lot of folks are bringing up info wars on the campaign trail.
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:50.240]  That's great.
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:51.440]  Also bring up Hillary for prison.
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:56.840]  But here's Donald Trump at an event last night being asked, Hey, info wars, you're
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:37:57.840]  going to go back on the show.
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:37:58.840]  And this is what he had.
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:01.680]  He kind of nodded his head and said, Oh, yeah, that's a nice guy, you know, like doing the
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:02.680]  show.
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:03.680]  Here's the clip.
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:04.680]  Kevin, go ahead.
[2:38:04.680 --> 2:38:05.680]  Give it to somebody.
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:06.680]  Alex Jones.
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:07.680]  He was a nice guy.
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:08.680]  Actually, you like him?
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:09.680]  Oh, that's good.
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:10.680]  Alex was an Alex Jones.
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:11.680]  Nice guy.
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:12.680]  Go ahead.
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  Hi.
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:14.680]  How are you?
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:15.680]  Whatever.
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:20.680]  I mean, what I really like is he's tweeted info wars three or four times a week.
[2:38:20.680 --> 2:38:27.760]  You know, it makes me like Trump more obviously that they ended up reaching out to us to have
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  him on the show.
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:29.760]  I'm not bragging.
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:32.600]  I just didn't even try to think to get Trump on because there's such bureaucracy around
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:33.600]  it.
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:34.600]  Like I didn't want to get ran.
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:35.600]  I mean, I'm trying to get ramp on.
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:36.600]  You know, they contacted us.
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:37.600]  I'm not bragging.
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:41.040]  It's just people saying, Oh, I mean, he goes, Oh, look, you know, something's hidden on
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:42.040]  your show.
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:43.040]  I mean, whatever.
[2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:44.040]  The listeners want info.
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:45.040]  They want to hear about infertility.
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:46.040]  Okay.
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:47.040]  Trump's popular.
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:48.040]  Yeah.
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:49.040]  I got a lot of news.
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:53.480]  If it's for real or not, let me briefly ask you, do you?
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:54.640]  What is your gut feeling on Trump?
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:56.680]  And then you've got the floor on infertility recap.
[2:38:56.680 --> 2:38:58.680]  Go back into it.
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:02.680]  Oh, yeah, I watched the interview.
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:08.160]  I have to say that out of all the candidates, I would probably put front, I mean, I would
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:10.120]  put Trump as a front runner.
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:15.200]  You know, I look at the back end of different things too and really understand how the government
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:21.560]  is run with the elite organizations and how people are put in office.
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:28.120]  And I kind of ask myself, will they ever allow someone like Trump to actually get into office?
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:32.800]  I think he has some good ideas and, you know, anybody else is out there running.
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:37.520]  I mean, obviously, we've been in a devastating scenario in this country.
[2:39:37.520 --> 2:39:39.200]  We have a collapsing economy.
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:42.120]  We have a collapsing healthcare system.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.320]  You know, everything is collapsing, including the...
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:47.800]  But Obama said the State of the Union is best ever.
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:48.800]  Of course.
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:50.120]  We have all these jobs available.
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  We have all this stuff.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  Everything...
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:54.680]  It's probably pretty nice on Air Force One, you know, on red carpets for him.
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:55.680]  Exactly.
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:56.680]  They can spend as much money as they want.
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:39:57.680]  Nobody cares.
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.080]  They just start printing more money, but everybody else that has to suffer is the ones that we
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:07.160]  care about and the ones that we want to educate and let them know what they need to look out
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:08.160]  for.
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:09.840]  Speaking of fertility and infertility, I mean...
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:10.840]  Yeah, get into that.
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:14.040]  Let's break it down now.
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:18.600]  What's causing the infertility, the bisphenol A, the glyphosates, all of it, admittedly,
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.120]  you know, absolutely attacks fertility, attacks the cells, not just the, you know, the reproductive
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:25.720]  glands and reproductive organs.
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:31.440]  What can you do to mitigate, stop getting those chemicals as much, but also known compounds
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:34.520]  that we're also deficient in to massively boost infertility?
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:37.480]  What would you tell a woman, you know, let's say a 30-year-old woman with a 30-year-old
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:42.720]  husband, this is a real couple out there, who are looking at, you know, having children
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.880]  and have kind of been trying and it didn't happen?
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:49.320]  Well, the first thing I always tell people when I counsel them for infertility is you
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:54.200]  need to recognize the things that are causing your infertility and the number one thing
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:58.920]  is going to be the xenoestrogens and that starts with, those are estrogen mimicers and
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:04.160]  we're living in a society where we have too much estrogen and those xenoestrogens are
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:09.040]  what contaminates and destroys the endocrine system.
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:12.200]  One of the things we talk about a lot here is iodine and that's one of the things that
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:18.440]  we've found that all the endocrine glands need and want and these xenoestrogens and
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:24.360]  these compounds that affect fertility, whether it's low sperm count, whether it's damage
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:30.360]  to the ovaries, damage to the hormone system in the women, all of these things are estrogen
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:36.840]  mimicers or compounds that damage either the thyroid, the pineal, the pituitary, the adrenal
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:37.840]  and everything else.
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:39.480]  And Dr. Folks are going to say, what are those?
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:45.080]  Well, bisphenol A is in almost all the printer ink, almost all the plastic by design.
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:48.120]  They admit it's to make us infertile expanding.
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:50.200]  What is one of the top ones?
[2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:53.120]  Fluoride is obviously a xenoestrogen break that down.
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:56.680]  That's why the White House Science R says they put it in the water.
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:41:59.720]  So believe it or not, don't drink trap water.
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:04.800]  Don't drink tap water because all of these chemicals are in tap water.
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:08.480]  As a matter of fact, a lot of pharmaceutical drugs have phthalates.
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:13.840]  Now phthalates are a plastic compound and that's one of the top 10 xenoestrogens or endocrines.
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:17.360]  So you're saying chicken McNuggets that have a plasticizer in them, I should be giving
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:18.960]  my children plastic.
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:21.640]  If you want to have a baby later, then no.
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:24.160]  So plastic is not good for you.
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:29.200]  Phthalates are actually fragrances and 75% of the American public actually use fragrant
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:31.240]  compounds in their homes.
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:32.240]  So that's one of the things.
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  The air fresheners.
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:37.200]  Those are little doccal gas chambers.
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:42.840]  Any fragrant in cosmetics, any fragrant in skin lotions, any perfume, conditioner.
[2:42:42.840 --> 2:42:44.840]  That women just dunk themselves in.
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:48.680]  Yes, that they lather all over their body.
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:50.800]  And that's one, that's the loophole because.
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:54.200]  And they wonder why even for young women, their periods are bonking around like ping-pong
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:43:00.120]  balls because they're just dunking themselves in artificial and plant estrogens.
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:01.120]  Right.
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:06.040]  All of this stuff that we talk about are disrupting the hormones in men and disrupting the hormones
[2:43:06.040 --> 2:43:07.240]  in females.
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:12.880]  And the phthalates fragrances, we don't even know what those chemicals are because the.
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:13.880]  They're proprietary.
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:14.880]  They're proprietary.
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:15.880]  They're not.
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:17.680]  These companies aren't required to list.
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:18.680]  That's right.
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:22.280]  They've got laws passed that you don't get to know what it is.
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:25.880]  So the phthalates are a big problem because they make plastic softer.
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:29.160]  But the next big problem is the use of herbicides and pesticides.
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:33.120]  And that's going to be your glyphosate, which is sprayed on all the vegetables.
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:39.560]  Your roundup that you have in your backyard that's being sprayed everywhere.
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:44.240]  The compounds in these are so damaging that they can literally turn off your DNA and affect
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:47.200]  you for generations and generations and generations.
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:48.320]  What shows those articles?
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:49.320]  That's mainstream news.
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:53.680]  But what you were saying earlier, though, the sperm and egg carry genetic memories.
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:58.160]  They found out now that this means that parents' bad habits such as poor diet and drinking
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:03.080]  too much alcohol could be passed on to their children, even if they're healthy during pregnancy.
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:04.080]  That's what the Bible said.
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:06.240]  The sins of the parents are passed on.
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:07.240]  Exactly.
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:13.880]  Now we actually have proof that the memories and the actions are passed on to the cells.
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:16.040]  Not just the DNA and the genes.
[2:44:16.040 --> 2:44:17.880]  And we'll put that article on screen for viewers.
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:19.320]  We'll put that article on screen.
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:21.880]  That means that it's so important.
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:26.040]  Part of our fertility program is that cleansing the body for three to six months before you
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:27.040]  actually try to conceive.
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:28.840]  And that just makes sense.
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:30.480]  That's how they did it in the ancient days.
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:33.320]  That's how anybody who's sensible...
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:36.160]  And this is from the University of Alberta.
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:37.160]  The University of Alberta.
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:41.320]  That's why every ancient culture, before a maiden got married to her mate, and of course
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:44.960]  then she was a virgin, she'd usually get pregnant in just a few moon cycles, that's what women
[2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:45.960]  are based on.
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:51.560]  And she would then go for like a month away and purify herself in the hills of the mountains
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:53.000]  and only eat herbs.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Every culture.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:55.600]  Because they didn't want to have a deformed baby.
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:56.600]  Yep.
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:44:57.600]  And that's how you...
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:00.080]  The good thing about the human body is it repairs itself really fast.
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:05.880]  And that's why we focus on cleansing the gut and bringing that microbiodome back into the
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:08.440]  gut because it is the largest endocrine gland.
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:12.560]  So really what we're trying to do with fertility is repair the endocrine system.
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:18.320]  We give the iodine, which is utilized by the ovaries, the testes, the thyroid...
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:21.840]  It's the good halogen that they take out of the salt and they put the bad fluoride in
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:23.120]  because they love us.
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  Well guess what?
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:27.960]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, all endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:31.960]  You were right when you said the water is the leading source of infertility.
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:35.360]  Because in water you have aluminum particles, you have fluoride.
[2:45:35.360 --> 2:45:39.520]  All these are harmful endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:42.120]  You have all the pesticide and herbicide runoff in water.
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:43.960]  You have arsenic in water.
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:47.840]  You have perchlorate, which is rocket fuel that ends up seeping down and going into the
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:48.840]  water supply.
[2:45:48.840 --> 2:45:51.640]  You have the atrazine in the water supply.
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:45:57.720]  95% of the milk and lettuce in the country is contaminated with perchlorate.
[2:45:57.720 --> 2:46:02.600]  98% of women that had their breast milk tested had levels of DDT and perchlorate.
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:06.440]  It was like 99% of women tested over and over again to have glyphosate in their milk.
[2:46:06.440 --> 2:46:07.440]  Right.
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:13.200]  An unknown fact is that arsenic, which is in the water supply practically all over the
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:20.720]  United States, is extremely restricted to, it basically shuts down your fat metabolism
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:21.720]  and your carbohydrates.
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:26.160]  And so exactly, they got all these studies that nobody talks about, but you've got, right
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:30.160]  here today, people can look them up, where you wonder why folks get so fat.
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:34.240]  People back in my grandfather's had pie after every meal and huge chicken fried steak, so
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:39.120]  they were all skinny because there wasn't all this bisphenol A and all these chemicals
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:41.120]  in the fluoridation that makes you fat.
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:46.840]  They know in studies, you feed GMO to different animals that make some fat stupid and infertile.
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:47.840]  That's right.
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:52.080]  So the solution and the parabens too, we didn't talk about, but parabens and believe it or
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:56.120]  not, I mean, we talk about the living defense here, the introduction of living defense.
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:47:01.760]  A lot of people don't know that people are infested with harmful organisms and harmful
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:08.160]  organisms, which are, can be bacteria, viruses, worms, anything that lives in your body that
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:09.920]  feeds off your body.
[2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:11.880]  They are then defecating toxins.
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:17.640]  Isopropyl alcohol, phenol, formaldehyde, and those are endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:22.000]  So it all really comes back to an attack on your endocrine system.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.280]  Well, my biggest thing we're eating in studies is you people put food in the microwave and
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:29.760]  it like cooks it or you get out, even not fast food, a good restaurant will put it in
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:34.240]  plastic and the plastics, the styrofoam is like melted and I looked it up, but I tasted
[2:47:34.240 --> 2:47:35.240]  it before.
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:36.240]  I just can't do that.
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:38.800]  I'm eating all these chemicals.
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:45.080]  Plastics are the worst and you know, because BPA was taken out of most bottles and baby
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:49.320]  bottles, that doesn't mean that they don't still contain phthalates and doesn't mean
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:53.520]  they don't contain BPS and other forms of plasticizers in there.
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:56.400]  Microwaving your food is one of the worst things you could do because look at all the
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:03.040]  microwave food that comes in plastic containers and any canned food that you have, organic
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:04.040]  or non-organic.
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:05.960]  It will have between all A liner.
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:14.280]  It has between all A liners in it and so it's really hard to completely get away from all
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:16.520]  these chemicals and endocrine disrupting.
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:22.880]  But if you want to get organic, get away from process, use glass and you know, wash your
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:28.720]  food well, have shower filters, have filters in your house, just do it, get the right kind
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:32.360]  of filters that actually cut this stuff out, not just charcoal filters.
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:37.040]  Now is the time folks, because a lot of this is happening, this is a corrupt dirty society,
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:39.520]  but a lot of it is by design they admit it.
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:42.440]  It's basically you have to keep your body clean.
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:44.920]  You have to keep your environment clean.
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:46.560]  You have to drink clean water.
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:51.600]  I mean, even washing your clothes with most of the detergents out there are going to put
[2:48:51.600 --> 2:48:55.640]  endocrine disrupting and toxic chemicals and you're going to absorb them through your skin.
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:48:56.640]  Let's expand on that.
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:00.000]  I mean, anybody when they were a kid would get close at the mall and you were excited
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:03.280]  in the first day of school and you forgot to wash it, you put the shirt on and it would
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:07.000]  like get all over you and then I'd get hives, you know, have the ink on me.
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:11.600]  I mean, that's an exaggerated example of what's coming out of all this into us.
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.520]  I mean, you look at this water situation in Flint, Michigan, they're right.
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:16.520]  It's toxic.
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:17.520]  It is genocide.
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.600]  60% black and the 40% white in Hispanic and Asia and Arab.
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:24.400]  I mean, it's against everybody, but, you know, Michael Moore says they want to kill the
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:25.400]  black people.
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:30.080]  Folks, that's corrupt government that just doesn't care because of this attitude that
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:32.040]  so what if there's toxic waste here?
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:36.760]  So what if your housing facility is on a landfill and they don't tell you, you know, it's so
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:42.840]  what if reactors, 93% of them are leaking worldwide used to be big news of reactor leak.
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:48.360]  Now it's not even on the news, the elite themselves are crazy.
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:51.240]  I mean, they just, or they're space aliens that want to live in radiation.
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:52.240]  I'm not saying that.
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:55.600]  I'm just saying, why do you think they're so crazy and don't care?
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:49:57.640]  They cared 30 years ago more.
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:03.440]  I think that because they know that, that they're going to have to control the population.
[2:50:03.440 --> 2:50:05.160]  They want to see a downfall.
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:06.160]  Everything's too late.
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:08.440]  The countries are way too far gone in debt.
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:09.600]  There has to be a reset.
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:11.720]  They're going to ride the collapse and come on.
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:17.680]  And yeah, they, they know that they're killing people and they're, look, you talk about it,
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:18.680]  designer babies.
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:20.640]  I mean, are we going to be in the future?
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:21.640]  They're already doing it.
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:24.360]  And they're like, well, you know, you can't have it because of this gene.
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:27.720]  They're talking about, you know, for their intelligence, how they look, making them three
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:30.720]  to six to 12 parents, they're already doing it.
[2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:32.960]  Chimeras splicing us with animals.
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:37.760]  It's already happening and I have people on the street telling me I'm full of it.
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:43.160]  No, that's, that's why it's important to be aware of all these things, avoid all these
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:48.400]  things and keep your body clean and absolutely look, look, look, look, there's no doubt.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.360]  There's an evil force directing all this.
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:51.360]  Okay.
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:52.360]  You can say it's the devil.
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:55.840]  You can say it's, you know, enemy forces from clandestine.
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:50:59.840]  I don't know, but it's bad shower filters.

[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:03.640]  It's true.
[2:52:03.640 --> 2:52:07.400]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:09.880]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:25.760]  You're a TV viewer and you can see the ceiling shot of the Info Wars News Center and then
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:29.680]  you can see the televisions reflected there and it kind of creates that endless mirror
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:31.600]  hallway effect.
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:33.400]  Looks pretty cool.
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:38.560]  It's fun to fight tyranny, Dr. Grips here with us right into the fourth hour.
[2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:42.000]  Anthony Gutiarty is coming in here and you guys are going to continue rolling on.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:48.200]  We've got George, Angelo, Doug, Rick, Steve, I need to go to you guys and I really appreciate
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:53.800]  you holding all of you so we are going to go to you pretty much directly when the next
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:54.800]  hour starts.
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:55:00.640]  Dr. Grips is certainly going to like that, but just finishing up here, what are some
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:06.360]  of the things that people can do other than avoiding toxins, not microwaving foods in
[2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:10.680]  plastic containers, things like that?
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:13.640]  What else can you do to boost fertility?
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:19.320]  One of the easiest and most effective and cheapest methods actually is going to be reducing
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:25.800]  your stress levels and that means getting out of scenarios that increase your adrenal
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:31.360]  output and your stress hormones, which automatically decrease the immune system by 50%.
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:33.040]  So don't release as much cortisone.
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:37.880]  That's right, but that's why also we have developed certain supplements.
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:43.800]  Iodine deficiency is one of the biggest causes of infertility in my mind because all of these
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:49.440]  things that attack the endocrine system, every organ in the endocrine system is dependent
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:55.440]  upon iodine and if you notice that most endocrine disrupting chemicals are actually brominated
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:56:00.800]  like the fire retardants and everything like that have bromine, fluorine, or chlorine on
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:01.800]  them.
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:04.840]  As a matter of fact, Viagra, believe it or not, has phthalates on it, so if all the
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:10.040]  men out there that are taking Viagra, you're actually becoming sterile and possibly infertile
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:11.920]  by taking Viagra.
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:14.240]  These control pills have phthalates on them.
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:17.080]  You also have, what is that, like an NPR article of the study?
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:19.600]  Yeah, an NPR because this was very interesting.
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:21.920]  I've always said, heal the gut.
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:25.120]  The gut is one of the most effective things at healing the body.
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:30.480]  And so scientists went and looked at indigenous people and said, what's the difference between
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:33.080]  an American gut flora and an American gut flora?
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:36.400]  And these incredibly fertile women in the Amazon.
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:37.400]  Yeah, there is no...
[2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:38.560]  Most fertile women in the world.
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  There is no...
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:40.560]  Look at them, they get pregnant.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:46.600]  They actually said, Americans digestive tracts look like barren deserts compared with the
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:51.640]  lush tropical rainforest found inside indigenous people.
[2:56:51.640 --> 2:56:58.760]  And that the tribes had 50% more ecological diversity with probiotics than the average
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:56:59.760]  American has.
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:05.080]  So, diverse probiotics, raw foods, pickled foods is the answer to fertility as well.
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:09.880]  And as you mentioned, super male vitality, super female vitality, X2s, the purest iodine
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:15.640]  anybody can find from our research, those are discounted both today, 15% off infowarslife.com.
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:17.240]  So it's a win-win.
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:23.360]  Rest, not getting as angry, taking time off when you're trying to get pregnant.
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:26.400]  What are some of the other known herbs that have been associated with pregnancy?
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:29.440]  I mean, I know there are some that are known as the, you know, basically the pregnancy
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:30.440]  herbs.
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:36.200]  Yeah, Vitex, Hishewu, Fotai root, that's a traditional Chinese medicine herb.
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:44.360]  Hishewu is really going back to the basics, cleaning your body, juicing, fasting, eliminating
[2:57:44.360 --> 2:57:49.480]  all the chemicals and toxins coming in, repairing your endocrine system, clean water is probably
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:52.680]  one of the most effective things that you can do.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:56.640]  And I always recommend people add a little organic apple cider vinegar in there for minerals
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:02.240]  and live enzymes, kombucha is also something that's very effective at cleansing the body
[2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:10.120]  and giving people more live organisms inside their system, good probiotics, doing a harmful
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:15.680]  organism cleanse, and most importantly, cleansing the liver because all these chemicals that
[2:58:15.680 --> 2:58:20.400]  we talked about today that disrupt the endocrine system, guess what, the liver has to process
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:24.680]  them all and most people's livers are functioning under 60%.
[2:58:24.680 --> 2:58:29.640]  So once the liver is functioning, the bowel is repaired, your cells are clean, deep cleanse
[2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:32.480]  and there's another thing that's going to help eliminate all of those chemicals.
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:35.400]  Absolutely, infowarslife.com, thank you all for your support.

[2:59:50.640 --> 2:59:57.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:42.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, it's the fourth hour of Overdrive, I'm Anthony
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:47.320]  Gucciardi and I will be your host with Dr. Edward Group riding shotgun for the rest of
[3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:49.160]  the hour.
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:54.520]  And there's a study that came out the 13th that no one knows about that I think is probably
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:00:59.480]  the biggest and one of the most important studies that come out, I mean really ever
[3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:01.440]  in the history of humanity.
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:06.480]  And it's from Harvard University and I can only find just about two news organizations
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:07.480]  that talked about it.
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:11.240]  We're going to talk about it, get into it, get Dr. Group's take on it and cover a whole
[3:01:11.240 --> 3:01:16.200]  host of other news, including the fact that you might be pleased to know North Korea has
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:23.440]  actually said it's invented a hangover-free alcohol, so don't worry, the Pyeongyang scientists
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:28.280]  say they have invented a hangover-free alcohol according to their state-run newspaper, says
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:34.200]  the suave liquor will spare you wincing when you wake and it has 30 to 40% alcohol but
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:39.400]  it's made from a type of indigenous ginseng that the North Koreans use and due to the
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:43.280]  blessing of Kim Jong-un it actually doesn't give you a hangover.
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:46.280]  So I'm really excited about that.
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:50.040]  To break right into this study and get Dr. Group's take on it, the article that I found
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:55.160]  from Medical Daily is called Pay It Forward Being Nice is Part of Human Nature and it's
[3:01:55.160 --> 3:01:59.640]  Harvard Research, actually it's Yale University, and it says a team of researchers from Yale
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:02.560]  University have some pretty good news for humanity.
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.840]  Most people are inherently good and kind-hearted and it's the mean girls and the guys that
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:08.400]  deviate from the norm.
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:13.080]  In fact, according to their study, unkindness is a deliberate attempt to override our natural
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:14.840]  instinct and pay it forward.
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:20.480]  And if you actually read the study and you read the further description in Medical Daily,
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:25.840]  it goes on to explain that being unkind and being a messed up person, what you might call
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:31.560]  crazy or rude or whatever, it's actually going against your inclination as a human being
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:32.760]  to be nice to other people.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:37.240]  It's saying your instinct at your core is to be a good person and everything that's
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:41.560]  outside of that is going against your so-called blueprint, right?
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:45.840]  It goes by of a theory and it goes on to say we don't know why it could be your youth
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:49.040]  and stuff like that, but I think it's your health.
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:54.560]  And I think I have the studies to back that up as well, Dr. Group, including something
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:59.760]  like this, the mental health benefits of probiotics, good bacteria may improve mood and fight depression.
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:02.840]  Where this study goes on to talk about, we're going to get into it throughout the rest of
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:07.440]  the show, that the evidence and intake of probiotics can help reduce negative thoughts
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:11.800]  associated with sad mood and if you have a gut biome that's messed up from eating a bunch
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:17.840]  of junk like McDonald's, which wipes out your gut biome, you can be more aggressive and
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:22.240]  be more negative and just be upset and what people would call rude.
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:27.720]  So I put forward the question, what percentage of our actions are we even responsible for
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:33.440]  and which are just a biological instinct because we are out of line with how we should be biologically?
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:36.000]  What do you think about that?
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:41.160]  I think everybody is born nice and everybody is born loving.
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:47.640]  If you just look at babies and you look at children that are brought up in nature or
[3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:54.920]  in loving environments, they don't start to get contaminated until they start listening
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:56.120]  to the news.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:59.320]  It's all external factors that cause this.
[3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:05.720]  There's no doubt in my mind after studying the effects on mental disorders, studying
[3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:12.720]  every single disease and tracing it back to what is the root cause, that if every single
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:21.520]  one of us were born, let's say, in the woods or were not exposed to the negativity on TV,
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:27.240]  the negative information that we learn in schools, the negative people that are around,
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:31.120]  the killing, the violence, all that stuff.
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:33.720]  Even with that, we still have that good instinct.
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:39.880]  We'll still stop to help an old lady or we'll still hopefully turn in a wallet when we find
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  it or a lost phone or something like that.
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:43.720]  So I feel that we do have that.
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:47.000]  We're born with that nice instinct.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.200]  And going against it is going against our blueprint.
[3:04:49.200 --> 3:04:52.720]  We'll be right back with the fourth hour of Overdrive with a ton of more news and health
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:05:19.120]  information with Dr. Edward Groove.
[3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:25.080]  The Libyan government held 143 tons of gold and a similar amount of silver valued at more
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:26.920]  than $7 billion.
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:31.960]  The gold and silver was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the French franc
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:33.280]  for African countries.
[3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:38.200]  A large number of Western African countries are former French colonies and many continue
[3:05:38.200 --> 3:05:40.760]  to hold French as the official language.
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:45.680]  During the invasion of Libya, analysts argued Gaddafi planned to stop selling oil in US
[3:05:45.680 --> 3:05:49.080]  dollars and demanded instead it be traded in gold.
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:53.960]  Prior to the invasion, Gaddafi urged other African and Middle Eastern nations to follow
[3:05:53.960 --> 3:06:19.960]  it.
[3:06:19.960 --> 3:06:26.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:06:26.960 --> 3:06:32.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern

[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:53.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:06:53.960 --> 3:07:00.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern

[3:07:30.960 --> 3:07:56.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:07:56.960 --> 3:08:22.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern

[3:08:48.960 --> 3:09:14.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:40.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern

[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:11:01.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:27.960]  countries.
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:54.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver

[3:12:20.960 --> 3:12:49.960]  countries.
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:42.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:14:08.960]  countries.
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:36.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:15:02.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:28.960]  countries.
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:55.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver

[3:17:42.960 --> 3:18:08.960]  countries.
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:37.960]  The Libyan government had to stop selling oil in US dollars and a similar amount of silver
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:19:03.960]  was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the African and Middle Eastern
