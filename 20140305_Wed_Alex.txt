[00:00.000 --> 00:11.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.100 --> 00:18.640]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.640 --> 00:37.680]  Texas Alex Jones well Hillary Clinton is now compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.440]  Hitler the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has just come out and offers
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.840]  grim out look on nation's defense that's out on McClatchy we just saw hearings
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.920]  this morning we've got clips of where Lois Lerner who's been caught lying and
[00:54.920 --> 01:00.240]  taken the fifth previously but then went on to give testimony as if her lies
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.160]  were protected by her declaring the fifth the fifth was the right to remain
[01:04.160 --> 01:12.160]  silent not to purge herself well now she has been questioned again and taken the
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.240]  fifth and it was quite a circus so we're gonna be leading up with that when we
[01:16.240 --> 01:22.200]  start the next segment coming up it says says contempt citation against Lerner
[01:22.200 --> 01:28.080]  quote has to be considered now we're talking let's see the contempt citation
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.120]  what about perjury was it early last year she got up there on it was about a
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.160]  year ago we played the clips remember we should dig those back up where she said
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.320]  I take the fifth but went on to say she knew nothing about what was going on the
[01:40.320 --> 01:43.560]  targeting of the Tea Party now it's all come out that they did and it was
[01:43.560 --> 01:49.560]  ordered so she's protecting El Presidente and if so walks out of the IRS
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.000]  scandal hearing as Cummings calls proceedings on American because his
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.520]  microphone got cut off and he wanted to continue asking questions so this is a
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.360]  real three-ring circus and and this could bring down the Obama Knights
[02:05.360 --> 02:10.320]  because they are certainly persecuting people Darrell is angrily adjourns
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.840]  oversight hearing after lowest learner pleads the fifth again we've got that
[02:13.840 --> 02:20.480]  video coming up but you look to an MSNBC and a redemocrat control newspapers
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.080]  they're like hey we don't need libertarian or conservative groups having free
[02:25.080 --> 02:33.760]  speech we don't need them to be able to have 501c3 or 501c3 for all the
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.280]  different tax exempt designations because that gives them political power only
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.040]  we're allowed to have that so it's it's a real form of discrimination and we have
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.280]  the article from yesterday in fact guys we pull that out of yesterday's stack
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.480]  that broke at the end of the show it ties into all this and the special video
[02:49.480 --> 02:57.640]  reports up on infowars.com right now we have Bloomberg and others in anti gun
[02:57.640 --> 03:02.400]  websites saying don't worry we're very close to getting Facebook to not let you
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.440]  have pro-gun comments you say well Facebook's their own website but they
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.280]  operate as a public commons where you go post your stuff your data and now
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.960]  they're changing the rules and really violating people's free speech because
[03:15.960 --> 03:24.840]  they use computers to block you with with with prior restraint from being able
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.160]  to post a meme about Benghazi being an inside job or to send out a meme
[03:30.160 --> 03:33.720]  promoting the second amendment or they already are doing that to a great extent
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.960]  people say well why are you on Facebook then because it's the big public
[03:36.960 --> 03:40.960]  comments why am I on YouTube that's where the people are I'm not going to be
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.840]  denied reaching out to folks they they open Facebook to be free and open and
[03:45.840 --> 03:49.520]  not spying on you and then the head of it said oh my my users trust me they're
[03:49.520 --> 03:56.120]  dumb efforts we're in their system in their face in an info war they want to
[03:56.120 --> 04:00.440]  have the big platforms but then be able to restrict speech on them by the way
[04:00.440 --> 04:04.240]  YouTube and Google have been pro free speech compared to Facebook I just want
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.600]  to comparing apples and oranges you look at the long trail of activity Facebook
[04:10.600 --> 04:16.760]  has been a censor command base and it's outrageous and we have I don't know
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.680]  more than 30 Facebook's that a fan made for us about four years ago that they
[04:21.680 --> 04:25.200]  gave to us about two years ago and one of them's got almost a hundred thousand
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.440]  viewers or likes but if you had them all together it's about three million people
[04:28.440 --> 04:33.040]  following us so we're not just going to trash that but and and then not use that
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.720]  conduit into the matrix to reach the general public but people better
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.080]  appreciate the fact we've got a Twitter account they better appreciate the fact
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.440]  we've got these Facebook accounts we have in full wars comm prison planet
[04:45.440 --> 04:48.920]  com prison planet on TV I have a lot of different websites and stuff because I'm
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.840]  so used to being censored hacked blocked you name it I've gone out and
[04:52.840 --> 04:56.560]  created a bunch of alternative systems so that we have redundancy we'll be

[05:12.560 --> 05:16.920]  to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[05:16.920 --> 05:21.040]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the

[08:42.720 --> 08:48.440]  basically Vladimir linen or Mao say tongue we're gonna be breaking that
[08:48.440 --> 08:52.720]  down coming up also the latest developments in the Ukraine Hillary
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.600]  Clinton has called Vladimir Putin Adolf Hitler and Russia's test fired an ICBM
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.920]  a mid tension over Ukraine the IDF that's the Israeli Defense Forces has
[09:02.920 --> 09:09.200]  intercepted a major Iranian weapons shipment to Gaza restaurants across the
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.160]  country are moving to block Google glasses I'll talk about why I think that
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.120]  is so important and also the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is saying the
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.360]  outlook for the nation's defense is grim all of that and more is coming up
[09:24.360 --> 09:29.480]  today here's a story that broke at the end of yesterday's broadcast is going to
[09:29.480 --> 09:35.320]  tie into a new story up on info wars calm Bloomberg moves to ban pro gun
[09:35.320 --> 09:38.640]  speech and that ties into what the IRS is up to I'm gonna explain that in a
[09:38.640 --> 09:44.800]  moment Facebook now working with former New York mayor to censor support for the
[09:44.800 --> 09:51.240]  second amendment and then continuing Maryland to target 110,000 citizens with
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.920]  gun confiscation new law would link gun registry with criminal database we're
[09:56.920 --> 10:04.160]  gonna be breaking both of those down as well coming up here today plus you may
[10:04.160 --> 10:07.800]  not be able to get guacamole according to Chipotle climate change is so
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.080]  devastating that they say you may not be able to get even your salsa in the
[10:12.080 --> 10:15.960]  future tomatoes won't be able to be grown this is like saying we'll all be
[10:15.960 --> 10:18.680]  dead if you don't pay Al Gore money which is actually what they're doing
[10:18.680 --> 10:22.080]  doesn't matter the Great Lakes of frozen doesn't matter the Niagara Falls is
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.400]  frozen the Great Lakes have never been documented in 400 years to totally freeze
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.280]  it's now happened but they say we're in the middle of a heat spell and again
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.800]  they're just running around like chickens with their heads cut off
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.760]  fear-mongering to try to push the societal takeover we're going to be
[10:37.760 --> 10:45.000]  breaking all of that down here today and some huge developments in Kiev leaked
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.160]  phone call we're gonna be playing this coming up Kiev snipers hired by US backed
[10:50.160 --> 10:55.560]  opposition to shoot people to then claim that the police were doing it called a
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.360]  false flag ladies and gentlemen and you know that last tape of the ambassador
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.760]  and her deputy talking about destabilizing the country and f-ing the
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.040]  EU and the Russians that's confirmed be a real tape now so that's how they roll
[11:09.040 --> 11:15.480]  and that's how they operate and Russian spies are intercepting the
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.080]  telecommunications that's why they're being disrupted all over the Ukraine
[11:19.080 --> 11:23.760]  right now because intercepting them will will disrupt them if you do it right
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.400]  out of the air a lot of times with systems that basically jam the
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.840]  communications while sucking them up that's why so much of our technology
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.920]  doesn't work well because the back doors and everything are screwing up the
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.720]  operating systems and the hardware the chips themselves because so much of it
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.600]  is about the back door so much of it is about the Trojan horses before I get
[11:45.600 --> 11:51.760]  into our top story the IRS meltdown program note here because a lot of
[11:51.760 --> 11:54.560]  folks were excited about me coming to England I'm still invited to speak at
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.920]  Oxford I'm not snubbing Oxford the one of me to give their keynote end of winter
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.760]  address officially to the school in closed session for only members of the
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.680]  university and faculty it is an honor one of the best honors you can get
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.760]  speaking to a university I'm not going because I got too much stuff going on
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.560]  here with the operation trying to redesign info wars calm prison wanted
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.960]  calm trying to launch the TV system family stuff family illnesses all sorts
[12:25.960 --> 12:30.320]  of things going on I just I'm just not going to England so I cancelled that
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.760]  officially with them yesterday but I do intend to go there in the summer next
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.960]  year if they want me that's fine they say they still do that's just a side note
[12:37.960 --> 12:43.040]  I will be in here next week live in studio I just I'm not gonna miss my
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.440]  radio show for four days all this stuff's happening in Ukraine and with the
[12:48.440 --> 12:53.880]  dollar and all the rest of it it's just it's not a big enough bang for the buck
[12:53.880 --> 13:00.040]  to go speak to a couple thousand people when I could be speaking to millions
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.560]  every day and producing all sorts of important investigative reports and
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.280]  reaching millions more it just it's a low-tech ancient thing and I know it's
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.600]  honorable to go and speak to a group and I think the camels you know what broke
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.560]  the camels back straw was it's always the same I said yeah I'll go speak but I
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.040]  got to be able to film it and use it over a lot oh yeah sure well actually the
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.080]  union wants to film it themselves and then you can have the tape oh can I use
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.720]  it well maybe and I guess they just thought I would just keep coming as
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.240]  they were paying me to come there and that I would you know that was from the
[13:37.240 --> 13:41.320]  beginning it's like see I could go give a good speech that was gonna be a
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.520]  powerful speech on the future of humanity in the paradigm shift for two
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.160]  hours and then I could give it to everybody and aired on the show I was
[13:49.160 --> 13:55.040]  gonna simulcast it on the show in fact I'd be speaking during the second hour
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.600]  of the show the third hour we're gonna carry on radio I was bringing a crew
[13:58.600 --> 14:04.000]  that they weren't paying for to come and you know the cost of like $15,000
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.560]  probably with all the plane tickets the rest of it they weren't paying for that
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.240]  part and it's just like there's no point to just go behind closed doors and talk
[14:11.240 --> 14:16.080]  to people I'm not doing it not doing it so I could I could go there take the
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.280]  archaic speaking in Oxford which is important I like archaic stuff and I
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.600]  like person-to-person stuff I think it's great but I could then take it and
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.440]  digitize it but not to everybody but I'm just not going to do that if I can't do
[14:28.440 --> 14:36.240]  that what great pros I use I'm not going to do that if I can't do that
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.160]  somebody's calling me on my government tracker phone over and over again oh it's
[14:40.160 --> 14:46.880]  my children have to call them they're in the break they're beside them so it
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.400]  sells with excitement that I may allow them to finally get a king snake or
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.400]  something they keep begging for a snake my son especially but that is now
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.800]  spread to the other ones and I mean I just hold the line on reptiles nothing
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.040]  against them I'm not a big snake person and really don't want to feed it baby
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.840]  mice either and they just are very excited and believe that I've agreed to a
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.320]  snake which I really haven't agreed but it's kind of like kids get this thing
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.440]  where yes no you have and we're getting the snake this weekend but it's kind of
[15:18.440 --> 15:24.040]  the ultimate system of advertising where you just convince everyone yes it is
[15:24.040 --> 15:30.640]  happening and so it ends up happening but listen if you won't get me a king
[15:30.640 --> 15:34.960]  snake I know you'll at least get me a small boa which we can then go to the
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.480]  Florida Everglades and dump out no no ladies and gentlemen but we will put
[15:40.480 --> 15:46.080]  Cayman Alligators in Barton Creek I am seriously thinking about I'm joking I'm
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.480]  joking actually I'm not joking it has been looked at anyways well we're worried
[15:51.480 --> 15:56.040]  if we have a pond by Barton Creek and then what will happen if the Alligators
[15:56.040 --> 16:01.760]  in a heated pond get out of the pond the Koi pond and then go down into the
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.400]  creek could that happen is the question all right I am really all over the map
[16:06.400 --> 16:12.280]  and I apologize ladies and gentlemen I am now segwaying off into other issues
[16:12.280 --> 16:21.000]  here let's get serious if tyrants can set the precedent to do things that were
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.800]  previously illegal and get away with it it sets the precedent that they're
[16:24.800 --> 16:31.400]  basically above the law that's a very simple maximum law in common sense get
[16:31.400 --> 16:34.400]  managed they take you a mile they take you a mile they take you a thousand
[16:34.400 --> 16:37.840]  miles they take you a thousand miles they take you a trillion miles and so
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.920]  we've gotten into this situation where government and the interests that
[16:40.920 --> 16:45.640]  control it are really running around like wild heathen like pirates on the
[16:45.640 --> 16:50.280]  deck of a ship they've just captured guzzling rum and you know pilfering
[16:50.280 --> 17:00.200]  winches and this spectacle is intensifying in its rapidity and in
[17:00.200 --> 17:08.000]  its frequency and its intensity and we've got Issa who's done a decent job on
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.840]  fast and furious a decent job on this but he always stops with contempt or
[17:12.840 --> 17:16.160]  always stops and doesn't go with congressional impeachment hearings
[17:16.160 --> 17:20.680]  you can impeach lowest learner you can impeach the attorney general you can
[17:20.680 --> 17:27.720]  impeach Obama you can impeach any of these people but the Democrats will
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.160]  bring out all the dirt on the Republicans if they do the problem is that
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.080]  the Democrats are doing that anyways oh look you have a crooked toenail or you
[17:37.080 --> 17:40.840]  had a girlfriend on the side ten years ago it's all gonna come out or it's all
[17:40.840 --> 17:43.720]  gonna be exaggerated or it's all gonna be manufactured and they're going for a
[17:43.720 --> 17:48.640]  full takeover to get rid of the other party I mean you think we're bad enough
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.920]  with two parties in this country they're joined at the hip conjoined now we've
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.800]  got the one-party system trying to kill what's left of the Republicans and the
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.400]  Republican leadership selling out in the final moment to try to get there you
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.520]  know a place at the table in the transition and get some more personal
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.120]  loot and goodies for themselves but you've got Richard Nixon with a hundred
[18:12.120 --> 18:18.640]  names or hundred and ten names whatever it was locked up in that safe that he had
[18:18.640 --> 18:22.800]  the IRS commissioner gather of his political enemies to try to leak it to
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.240]  the media and use it against people now you've got everybody's IRS file being
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.360]  shared by all these agencies illegally they're persecuting people they're
[18:31.360 --> 18:34.920]  targeting them they're auditing them they're going after the nonprofits
[18:34.920 --> 18:38.160]  they're going after the pro-life groups the tea party groups are telling the
[18:38.160 --> 18:45.120]  military don't be part of it they're telling you know everybody that

[18:50.200 --> 18:54.080]  trying to create social pressure like political correctness so everybody goes
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.800]  along with this and then you get lowest learner the IRS head over the non-profits
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.000]  who is it now came out last year did purger herself even though she took the
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.240]  fifth she went on to lie after it as if that was a get out of jail free card on

[19:12.640 --> 19:16.880]  Attorney General it goes to Obama the IRS person under her met with Obama over
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.080]  and over again Obama got caught lying about that so all this comes out and she
[19:22.080 --> 19:26.080]  pleads the fifth this time and they shut it down and even though the hearings
[19:26.080 --> 19:30.920]  being shut down because she won't talk you get the other Congress person

[33:35.160 --> 33:36.160]  I don't know.
[33:36.160 --> 33:39.160]  I don't know. I just don't know when.
[33:39.160 --> 33:40.160]  I don't know.
[33:40.160 --> 33:43.160]  I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[33:43.160 --> 33:44.160]  Alright.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.160]  I did not know. I don't know what you are going to ask me.
[33:47.160 --> 33:48.160]  I didn't know.
[33:48.160 --> 33:51.160]  Technically, I don't know.
[33:51.160 --> 33:52.160]  I don't know.
[33:52.160 --> 34:02.160]  I don't know.
[34:02.160 --> 34:03.160]  That's right, folks.
[34:03.160 --> 34:06.160]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's yours truly.
[34:06.160 --> 34:11.160]  Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.160]  And by the way, we're going to have South by Southwest coverage,
[34:14.160 --> 34:18.160]  one of the biggest interactive festivals in the world for the next two weeks
[34:18.160 --> 34:21.160]  as it kicks off here very, very soon next week.
[34:21.160 --> 34:25.160]  We're going to have continued coverage and our reporters down there
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.160]  with a lot of breaking news on technology.
[34:27.160 --> 34:31.160]  Edward Snowden is going to be appearing via video connection from
[34:31.160 --> 34:34.160]  Moscow and a lot more in the next two weeks.
[34:34.160 --> 34:36.160]  And I will be staying here.
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.160]  I have politely canceled my trip to England and the Oxford speech
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.160]  just because too much is going on with the situation in Ukraine
[34:45.160 --> 34:47.160]  and so much more.
[34:47.160 --> 34:52.160]  We're going to get into leaked phone call Kiev snipers hired by U.S.
[34:52.160 --> 34:59.160]  backed opposition and play the Estonian Foreign Minister in talks
[34:59.160 --> 35:03.160]  with the U.S. backed opposition leader.
[35:03.160 --> 35:06.160]  So all of that is going to be coming up a pretty big story
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.160]  up on InfoWars.com.
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.160]  Some of the other news video, Bloomberg wants to ban free speech on Facebook.
[35:13.160 --> 35:16.160]  They're actually working to not let any pro-gun stuff be there
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.160]  or to let gun shops even be on there.
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.160]  Just it's over.
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.160]  That matter of constitutional and protected right,
[35:22.160 --> 35:25.160]  they're going to shut down our first amendment, not just our second.
[35:25.160 --> 35:26.160]  Order out of chaos.
[35:26.160 --> 35:29.160]  Gladio Snipers behind killings in Kiev.
[35:29.160 --> 35:32.160]  That's Nemo's article that goes along with Watson's leaked phone call.
[35:32.160 --> 35:34.160]  Kiev snipers hired by U.S. backed opposition.
[35:34.160 --> 35:38.160]  And the big red-linked story I haven't gotten to yet.
[35:38.160 --> 35:39.160]  Showdown.
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.160]  Maryland to target 110,000 citizens with gun confiscation.
[35:44.160 --> 35:46.160]  That's right.
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.160]  And it ties into the story, of course, from a couple of days ago
[35:50.160 --> 35:53.160]  where they are sending out letters saying,
[35:53.160 --> 35:55.160]  oh, you didn't get your gun registered in time.
[35:55.160 --> 35:56.160]  Come turn it in.
[35:56.160 --> 35:59.160]  We don't care if you fill out the registration paperwork.
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.160]  Come turn it in in Connecticut.
[36:01.160 --> 36:05.160]  And they're basically passed laws where you can't manufacture guns
[36:05.160 --> 36:07.160]  in California with a micro stamping.
[36:07.160 --> 36:11.160]  I mean, it's on the last lead smelter that could create bullets closed
[36:11.160 --> 36:13.160]  last year here in the United States.
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.160]  I mean, it is full tilt buggy.
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.160]  The death by 1,000 cuts against the Second Amendment is going on.
[36:21.160 --> 36:24.160]  But we're winning the hearts and minds every metric shows.
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.160]  So that's the good news of what's going on on that front.
[36:28.160 --> 36:35.160]  That's some of what's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.160]  Before we get into this leaked phone call and play a clip from that,
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.160]  please don't forget this hour is brought to you by

[37:02.160 --> 37:03.160]  and they're great patriots.
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.160]  So when FEMA tried to buy out all their food last year,
[37:06.160 --> 37:07.160]  they said no and blow the whistle.
[37:07.160 --> 37:10.160]  A lot of other folks didn't blow the whistle and let them buy them out.
[37:10.160 --> 37:12.160]  So they're ready to ship to you right now.
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.160]  They've got it all at mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.160]  Be prepared, folks.
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.160]  Don't be dependent on the system of all the instability.
[37:21.160 --> 37:23.160]  Have that storable food that lasts 25 years.
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.160]  And continuing, we are listed supported.
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.160]  When you become a member of the nightly news and see the films,
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.160]  the nightly news, the expanded podcast, commercial free audio video,
[37:34.160 --> 37:37.160]  all of it, you are funding a true tip of the spear,
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.160]  pro-liberty media operation that is growing.
[37:39.160 --> 37:43.160]  And you can get a 595 monthly membership or get a yearly membership
[37:43.160 --> 37:46.160]  and get three months free off the regular price.
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.160]  And 11 people can sign in simultaneously with each username and passcode.
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.160]  So, Crity, an original username and passcode that doesn't do anything else you have.
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.160]  It's totally secure as long as it's a passcode that is it to your other stuff
[38:00.160 --> 38:03.160]  and share it with your friends and family.
[38:03.160 --> 38:08.160]  You can give it as a gift, prisonplanet.tv.
[38:08.160 --> 38:13.160]  And lastly, if you go to infoorstore.com, you can find the wise variety of non-GMO,
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.160]  high-quality seeds, the lowest prices, the incredible variety of the best supplements
[38:18.160 --> 38:21.160]  we found out there, bar none, including three supplements.
[38:21.160 --> 38:24.160]  We've developed survival shield, a fluoride shield,
[38:24.160 --> 38:27.160]  and supermail vitality as well as the Wake Up America coffee
[38:27.160 --> 38:31.160]  from the High Mountains of Southern Mexico in the organic volcanic soil
[38:31.160 --> 38:34.160]  bought directly from the Chiapas Farmers.
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.160]  The two different Wake Up America blends, my favorite coffee.
[38:37.160 --> 38:40.160]  Everybody says it's their new favorite or at least they love it.
[38:40.160 --> 38:42.160]  And it's very fairly priced and supports the transmission.
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.160]  Simply put, here's my philosophy.
[38:44.160 --> 38:46.160]  I don't get stimulus money like MSNBC.
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.160]  I don't get hundreds of millions of dollars a year like NPR, taxpayer money.
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.160]  I don't take money from the IRS or like Warren Buffett in Banker-Bellot money.
[38:56.160 --> 38:59.160]  We just sell the highest quality stuff I can find at the best price.
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.160]  We go out and buy thousands of a dash cam that's the best price,
[39:03.160 --> 39:09.160]  the highest quality and have it branded to infowars.com.
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.160]  And then it comes with a free memory stick and we have the same price as Amazon.
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.160]  Nobody can match the price of Amazon. We've done it.
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.160]  On the dash cams and then you're supporting free speech in the Republic.
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.160]  We've got the magazine, the March issue, the War on Men with John Wayne on the cover.
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.160]  All about other putting drugs in the food and water to emasculate men.
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.160]  You can buy that in bulk at cost.
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.160]  Again, that's our goal. Get the word out. Wake people up.
[39:40.160 --> 39:42.160]  Some of the stuff we have is at cost.
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.160]  Some of it has profit built in to help fund the operation.
[39:44.160 --> 39:46.160]  But the magazine's at cost.
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.160]  We have the best-selling ever Molan Labé, Men's and Women's.
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.160]  The Men's is bronze colored with the two crossed M4s and the Spartan helmet
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.160]  with the Victory Wreath, Molan Labé, Info Wars on the back.
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.160]  It says Info Wars with 1776 and Roman Emerals.
[40:02.160 --> 40:05.160]  Then we have an Info Wars version of the Molan Labé as well.
[40:05.160 --> 40:06.160]  And we have the Women's.
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.160]  I think it's the best women's shirt we've ever put out that is gold foil sprayed on
[40:10.160 --> 40:13.160]  and is, you know, women's cut.
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.160]  And it is just fabulous.
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.160]  Men, get this for your wife or your sweetie cake, your cupcake today
[40:20.160 --> 40:22.160]  and support the transmission.
[40:22.160 --> 40:26.160]  You can go up there and see Leanne McAdoo sporting the Second Amendment.
[40:26.160 --> 40:28.160]  We got to get her out shooting the 50.
[40:28.160 --> 40:29.160]  Time to take the reporters out.
[40:29.160 --> 40:37.160]  David Knight, Jakari Jackson, John Bowne, of course, Leanne McAdoo, everybody.
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.160]  And take them shooting.
[40:38.160 --> 40:40.160]  And Watson's coming soon to the U.S.
[40:40.160 --> 40:41.160]  I'm going to take him out there shooting.
[40:41.160 --> 40:43.160]  He'll love that.
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.160]  I'm going to go shooting again with Mike Judge sometime next week.
[40:45.160 --> 40:47.160]  Maybe he'll let me film it and put it out.
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.160]  That should be interesting.
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.160]  We're going to be shooting some exploding targets at, I think, 1,000 yards.
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.160]  But side issue, ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com.
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.160]  But if you want to find the subsections, the Made in America apparel,
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.160]  madein1776.com, leads you right to that sub area of the shopping cart.
[41:05.160 --> 41:09.160]  infowarstlife.com takes you right to the supplement area.
[41:09.160 --> 41:11.160]  So that's how you navigate that.
[41:11.160 --> 41:12.160]  That's how you do that.
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.160]  By the way, I want to get your take on the IRS situation.
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.160]  You can't take the Fifth under penalty of perjury.
[41:19.160 --> 41:22.160]  They make you waive your Fifth to fill out the tax form.
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.160]  You try to plead the Fifth doesn't work.
[41:24.160 --> 41:27.160]  This is a private collection agency for the private Federal Reserve,
[41:27.160 --> 41:31.160]  established in 1913, didn't go mainline until 1951.
[41:31.160 --> 41:37.160]  But the pig-like creature up there heading up the persecution division,
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.160]  the Inquisition of Second Amendment folks,
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.160]  or the purge of the Second Amendment folks in the Tea Party and the rest of it,
[41:46.160 --> 41:47.160]  she takes the Fifth.
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.160]  What's your take on that subject?
[41:51.160 --> 41:54.160]  That's what I'm opening the phones up to take a round of calls on.
[41:54.160 --> 41:57.160]  800-259-9231.
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.160]  800-259-9231.
[42:01.160 --> 42:03.160]  We'll go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[42:03.160 --> 42:10.160]  But first off, leaked phone call, Kiev snipers hired by U.S.-backed opposition,
[42:10.160 --> 42:18.160]  false flag killings used to delegitimize the government that was ousted.
[42:18.160 --> 42:23.160]  Details of leaked phone call between EU Foreign Affairs Chief Catherine Ashton
[42:23.160 --> 42:30.160]  and Estonian Foreign Minister Umas Tate suggest that the U.S.-backed opposition
[42:30.160 --> 42:34.160]  was responsible for hiring snipers who gunned down protesters in Kiev
[42:34.160 --> 42:37.160]  and not the deposed government of Victor.
[42:37.160 --> 42:40.160]  How do you pronounce that? Yana Kovic?
[42:40.160 --> 42:41.160]  Am I pronouncing that right, guys?
[42:41.160 --> 42:43.160]  Yana Kovic, I am pronouncing it right.
[42:43.160 --> 42:47.160]  As the media widely claimed, continuing here,
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.160]  during the phone call, Tate tells Ashton that evidence presented to him
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.160]  by a doctor who treated victims of the sniper attacks clearly indicates
[42:55.160 --> 42:58.160]  both police and protesters were being shot at by the same people.
[42:58.160 --> 43:01.160]  Yes, to create the illusion.
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.160]  And this is what Operation Gladio would do.
[43:04.160 --> 43:09.160]  And Curt Nemo's article gets into that, how NATO,
[43:09.160 --> 43:12.160]  and again, I'm not defending the Russians during the Cold War.
[43:12.160 --> 43:15.160]  It's that both sides did dirty stuff, okay?
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.160]  NATO did hundreds of bombings and shootings from Germany to Italy,
[43:19.160 --> 43:25.160]  from France to Ukraine, you name it, into non-NATO countries at the time,
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.160]  where if communists started getting too popular, they'd shoot people
[43:28.160 --> 43:30.160]  and blame it on them or bomb people and blame it on them.
[43:30.160 --> 43:33.160]  If right-wing groups got too popular and they didn't like where they were going,
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.160]  they would shoot people and blame it on them.
[43:35.160 --> 43:38.160]  If mainline groups, I mean, they did this over and over again,
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.160]  this got declassified by the Italian government 14 years ago,
[43:42.160 --> 43:46.160]  and then even more, about three years ago, and the U.S. government had to admit it.
[43:46.160 --> 43:49.160]  NATO was involved, the British were involved, the Germans were involved,
[43:49.160 --> 43:52.160]  they called them stay-behind networks.
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.160]  After World War II, a lot of the Nazi-held areas,
[43:56.160 --> 44:00.160]  the U.S. just took over the Nazi networks that were there, like Ukraine,
[44:00.160 --> 44:03.160]  Western Ukraine, continued to use them to carry out terror attacks,
[44:03.160 --> 44:06.160]  but they were being directed by the West.
[44:06.160 --> 44:14.160]  So that's how this operates, and people need to be made aware of that.
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.160]  And I watched how this went, how the police tried to stand down
[44:18.160 --> 44:22.160]  so they wouldn't look bad to give them the political support.
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.160]  Then they start getting shot, and our media is calling them freedom fighters,
[44:26.160 --> 44:30.160]  and precision, you know, throwing them all off cocktails at police cars, burning them up,
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.160]  and very serious situation.
[44:34.160 --> 44:37.160]  And look, if the Ukrainians want to overthrow their government, that's their business,
[44:37.160 --> 44:41.160]  but the West is in there stirring it up, overthrowing an elected government,
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.160]  and now putting people in even worse so the EU can suck them dry,
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.160]  this is the type of stuff they'll do in America.
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.160]  They will commit mass shootings and blame it on the Tea Party.
[44:51.160 --> 44:53.160]  You can see all the writing on the wall.
[44:53.160 --> 44:56.160]  They're going to commit new Oklahoma cities and blame it on us.
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.160]  And I'm just saying, it's all they've got left.
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.160]  The problem is they know our people are everywhere,
[45:03.160 --> 45:06.160]  and they're going to run with video cameras to the next Oklahoma city,
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.160]  to the next mass shooting.
[45:08.160 --> 45:16.160]  They know, myself or my reporters, will march in to the press conferences with the evidence.
[45:16.160 --> 45:18.160]  And they're like, well, why don't they just kill you?
[45:18.160 --> 45:20.160]  Because they can't kill everybody, folks, they could blow up in their face.
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.160]  They could raise the event, have it highly compartmentalized,
[45:23.160 --> 45:26.160]  and have 95% of the police and military that aren't aware of what's going on,
[45:26.160 --> 45:28.160]  not know about what's happening.
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.160]  That's why they're so weak, because their stage in the terror attacks are provocaturing them,
[45:32.160 --> 45:37.160]  and then hoping no one picks up on what they did and just buy the official story.
[45:37.160 --> 45:40.160]  I mean, we exposed the underwear bomber with CIA drugged and put on the plane.
[45:40.160 --> 45:43.160]  That came out in Congress a month and a half after we broke it here,
[45:43.160 --> 45:46.160]  with the eyewitnesses, two lawyers that saw it happen.
[45:46.160 --> 45:51.160]  And they asked, on his wife, both saw it, out of Michigan, and what they said turned out to be true.
[45:51.160 --> 45:53.160]  And it just keeps happening.
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.160]  We have the intel, we have the human, the human intelligence, we have the people,
[45:57.160 --> 45:59.160]  and we're watching, we're not stupid.
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.160]  And what really freaks them out is military and police listen,
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.160]  and they now know what's going on.
[46:07.160 --> 46:11.160]  And let me tell you, cops too, you may take part in some federal drill.
[46:11.160 --> 46:16.160]  If they tell you it's secret, it may just be a drill 100 times,
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.160]  but the 101st time, or the 120th time, they're going to have you in a real terror attack,
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.160]  and that backpack's going to be real, and they're going to blow you up at the shopping mall
[46:26.160 --> 46:33.160]  and say, oh, the right wing libertarian cop, you know, John Johnson or whatever his name's going to be,
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.160]  or, you know, Harry Murphy, or Bob Sanchez.
[46:38.160 --> 46:41.160]  Yeah, he had Ron Polleter at his house.
[46:41.160 --> 46:44.160]  Oh my God, he went in during a field trip at a mall,
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.160]  and I'm throwing up hypothetical names and people's names really match that.
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.160]  You know, John Doe, whatever. I'm telling you how they work. Do not be part of it.
[46:52.160 --> 46:54.160]  Do not be part of it.
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.160]  That movie Arlington Road is so accurate how they actually do it.
[46:58.160 --> 47:01.160]  Isn't Jeff Bridges in that?
[47:01.160 --> 47:06.160]  And how they picked the professor who's a libertarian and upset about the government
[47:06.160 --> 47:11.160]  and then set him up to make it look like he blows up the federal building.
[47:11.160 --> 47:16.160]  I mean, tell you folks, that's exactly how they operate, okay?
[47:16.160 --> 47:21.160]  That's exactly how these people operate.
[47:21.160 --> 47:25.160]  Better understand that. That movie's basically real.
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.160]  That is how they operate.
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.160]  And I'm going to tell you, right now, you don't want to be part of it.
[47:32.160 --> 47:38.160]  Go to your phone calls. Let's talk to Nicholas in Virginia. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.160]  Thanks for having me on, man. I've been listening to you for about a year and a half now.
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.160]  One of my friends, Ryan Addison, turned me on to you,
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.160]  and I've really got a lot of great information from you.
[47:49.160 --> 47:54.160]  No, don't thank me, brother. We're all in it. We're all in it to win it. We're in it together.
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.160]  Thank you, sir. So I'm calling about Obamacare.
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.160]  I actually switched jobs in November of last year,
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.160]  and they took my health insurance away from me,
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.160]  or they were going to make me pay $1,000 a month to keep my health care.
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.160]  And so now they put us through the marketplace,
[48:13.160 --> 48:18.160]  and we got a new plan that we had to purchase a separate health care and a separate dental.
[48:18.160 --> 48:24.160]  I went to the dental place about a month ago for some work, just fillings, nothing big.
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.160]  I was told there's no pre-existing condition waiting period.
[48:28.160 --> 48:31.160]  So what happened? Because we're not really talking about Obamacare right now.
[48:31.160 --> 48:34.160]  We're talking about IRS, but it all ties together. What happened?
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.160]  So essentially, they sent me a bill telling me that my insurance company was not going to pay my bill.
[48:41.160 --> 48:48.160]  So when I went to the dentist, my dentist told me there is no conditions, there's no waiting periods,
[48:48.160 --> 48:53.160]  and then when they checked the system about a week or two ago and sent me the bill again,
[48:53.160 --> 49:01.160]  they had gone back into the system and changed to where now there's pre-existing conditions
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.160]  and now there's six month waiting periods for no matter what.
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.160]  No, that's what it does. It brings in waiting periods for pre-existing conditions,
[49:09.160 --> 49:14.160]  but it promises to the opposite. It is the greatest screw job of all time,
[49:14.160 --> 49:16.160]  and I appreciate your calling. I'm sorry that's happening.
[49:16.160 --> 49:18.160]  You should do a YouTube video about it.
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.160]  Everybody who's been hurt by this should speak out, write an article about it, do a YouTube,
[49:22.160 --> 49:29.160]  go to Craig's List, everywhere you can, your voice is important, and just universally decry it.
[49:29.160 --> 49:35.160]  They have a pullout yesterday. Nine out of ten Texans are against Obamacare and want it repealed.
[49:35.160 --> 49:38.160]  Why isn't it being repealed by the Republicans?
[49:38.160 --> 49:41.160]  Nationally, eight out of ten people across the board are against Obamacare.
[49:41.160 --> 49:44.160]  Why isn't it being repealed? Because the establishment wants it.
[49:44.160 --> 49:50.160]  They didn't pass something bold, a bold screw job like this because they intended for it to get repealed.
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.160]  And if they get away with this, folks, the sky's the limit.
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.160]  And I said I was taking calls on the IRS, and I see loaded phones, Chris and Joe and Dr. D and Steve,
[49:59.160 --> 50:02.160]  you all want to talk about the IRS and the subject I brought up.
[50:02.160 --> 50:04.160]  I'm not mad at the last caller, but man, come on.
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.160]  I said only on the IRS, and it's about something else.
[50:10.160 --> 50:16.160]  But I understand it's painful, and you want to talk about it. Believe me, I get it.
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.160]  Everybody I know, including myself, said their insurance go way up.
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.160]  And it's painful, and it's shutting down the economy, it's making most people go to part time.
[50:24.160 --> 50:26.160]  It's designed to break this country's back.
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.160]  And by the way, that's not rhetoric.
[50:30.160 --> 50:37.160]  The whole thing about the website not working is a diversion that's now admitted away from the legislation itself.
[50:37.160 --> 50:39.160]  And I call that day one. I'm not bragging, it's just a fact.
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.160]  I know how these kleptocrats, how their criminal brains work.
[50:43.160 --> 50:50.160]  And now you've got, speaking of Obamacare, Ezekiel Emanuel out saying you don't even deserve to see a doctor.
[50:50.160 --> 50:52.160]  That's the quote. Let me give you the exact quote.
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.160]  Here it is, Obamacare architect. You don't need a doctor.
[50:56.160 --> 51:21.160]  See, that's your free health care, go die on the ditch.
[51:21.160 --> 51:27.160]  Take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine before they close the loophole forever.

[53:58.120 --> 54:18.960]  All right, we're going to go directly to your phone calls here on the IRS if you just joined
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.680]  us and Lois Lerner says that citizens don't have a Fifth Amendment when being questioned
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.240]  by the Federal Reserve's collection agency, the offshore bank's collection agency literally,
[54:28.240 --> 54:33.080]  but that she does and then she always uses that to go on and plead the Fifth to say she's
[54:33.080 --> 54:36.640]  not testifying, but then to go on to say she's done nothing, even though she got caught
[54:36.640 --> 54:38.320]  lying a year ago.
[54:38.320 --> 54:41.200]  So Chris in California, you're on the air.
[54:41.200 --> 54:42.920]  What's your take on this?
[54:42.920 --> 54:43.920]  Hello?
[54:43.920 --> 54:44.920]  Yes, welcome.
[54:44.920 --> 54:45.920]  Yeah.
[54:45.920 --> 54:46.920]  No, it's at California.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.920]  Sorry.
[54:47.920 --> 54:48.920]  Hi, Alex.
[54:48.920 --> 54:51.320]  It's an absolute, it's a joke.
[54:51.320 --> 54:55.240]  She's out there, she's got her eight armed guards, she's smirking.
[54:55.240 --> 55:00.880]  She knows exactly what she's doing, but the good thing for us, it shows the veil falling
[55:00.880 --> 55:02.120]  on the whole system.
[55:02.120 --> 55:03.120]  It's a sham.
[55:03.120 --> 55:04.560]  Everybody's starting to wake up.
[55:04.560 --> 55:10.440]  I'm watching all the board, CNN, MSNBC, I don't care what site it is, people are calling
[55:10.440 --> 55:13.760]  them out, people are upset, people are waking up.
[55:13.760 --> 55:16.080]  I think we're almost hitting critical mass, Alex.
[55:16.080 --> 55:21.360]  Well, it is true that, as Mark Twain said, in the beginning of patriotism, scarce man
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.560]  hated, feared and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, the Tim would join him
[55:25.560 --> 55:28.400]  because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[55:28.400 --> 55:32.440]  And really a lot of people weren't bad in the system, they were just scared.
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.280]  And as more people speak out, now they can't persecute everyone that speaks out.
[55:37.280 --> 55:39.800]  That's that Hollywood tipping point I've talked about.
[55:39.800 --> 55:42.120]  They're not really liberals in Hollywood, most of them.
[55:42.120 --> 55:46.480]  Most of them are actually kind of libertarians or what you'd call a conspiracy terrorist,
[55:46.480 --> 55:50.840]  meaning they don't buy the official account of things out of hand.
[55:50.840 --> 55:51.840]  So I agree with you.
[55:51.840 --> 55:52.840]  Go ahead.
[55:52.840 --> 55:53.840]  Right.
[55:53.840 --> 55:54.840]  That's the point, Alex.
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.240]  You're doing a great job.
[55:56.240 --> 55:58.400]  Everybody needs to stand up and call it out.
[55:58.400 --> 55:59.480]  Don't be afraid.
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.400]  I was in a cooking class the other day with my girlfriend and a woman was in there talking
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.320]  about how she was going to stop again, you know, guns and guns, and I spoke up.
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.080]  You know, I'm not going to, everybody needs to speak out because there's more of us than
[56:13.080 --> 56:14.080]  there are of them.
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.080]  That's right.
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.400]  You heard some anti-gunner in there and you stood up to her.
[56:17.400 --> 56:18.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:18.720 --> 56:19.720]  Don't let them fool you.
[56:19.720 --> 56:20.720]  And the three percent...
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.960]  What does she do when you spoke out, try to ban your free speech like Bloomberg's doing
[56:23.960 --> 56:24.960]  right now?
[56:24.960 --> 56:26.640]  Oh, she, oh, she got all the dignity.
[56:26.640 --> 56:27.640]  Well, I'm over here.
[56:27.640 --> 56:28.640]  I'm over here.
[56:28.640 --> 56:31.200]  It's typical trendy liberalism.
[56:31.200 --> 56:32.200]  It's pathetic.
[56:32.200 --> 56:35.240]  Well, these are people just begging to be slaves.
[56:35.240 --> 56:40.520]  I only want a massive government that murders people worldwide to have weapons, not as average
[56:40.520 --> 56:41.520]  slaves.
[56:41.520 --> 56:42.520]  I'm with the system.
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.520]  I have no instincts.
[56:43.520 --> 56:44.520]  I have no common sense.
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.520]  I'm a moron.
[56:45.520 --> 56:50.320]  Uh, but the TV says I'm good and it's my imaginary friend.
[56:50.320 --> 56:55.120]  They're literally in love with a mind control device just like the movie Her and literally
[56:55.120 --> 56:56.440]  aren't even living in the reality.
[56:56.440 --> 56:58.240]  I appreciate your call, Chris.
[56:58.240 --> 57:00.920]  Dr. D in Arizona, go ahead.
[57:00.920 --> 57:01.920]  Hello, Alex.
[57:01.920 --> 57:02.920]  How are you doing today?
[57:02.920 --> 57:03.920]  Good, my friend.
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.320]  We're loving Lois Lerner.
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.800]  I was so outraged about that dog and pony show this morning.
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.280]  I've been trying to get in and share this idea with you how we could end corruption in
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.440]  all this old, uh, back and forth gridlock and all this nonsense that goes on up in
[57:18.440 --> 57:22.440]  that, that had been houses that we pay for the taxpayers needs of voice.
[57:22.440 --> 57:24.000]  That's the missing component to government.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.360]  I, I, I would hope that you'd get on this and we would try to start co, coalescing
[57:28.360 --> 57:33.400]  together and build a big coalition of people to demand that we have monitors and all the
[57:33.400 --> 57:37.720]  houses of government that the citizens be allowed to submit their questions directly
[57:37.720 --> 57:38.960]  to their congressmen people.
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.480]  And then if they don't want to do this, then remove them, frogmatch them off the floor
[57:43.480 --> 57:44.480]  with Sergeant Robb.
[57:44.480 --> 57:47.120]  Let him get some work in and let's end this nonsense now.
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.320]  I mean, it's corruption now by putting monitors in there, remove what Jim Demin said about
[57:51.320 --> 57:55.840]  government, I think before he left office, uh, that, uh, most of the laws are passed
[57:55.840 --> 57:58.680]  at night by a skeleton crew of, uh, of congressmen.
[57:58.680 --> 57:59.920]  No, that's true.
[57:59.920 --> 58:01.760]  The IRS was passed by three senators.
[58:01.760 --> 58:03.440]  The federal reserve was passed.
[58:03.440 --> 58:05.640]  Most of this stuff is done by the insiders.
[58:05.640 --> 58:06.640]  You're right.
[58:06.640 --> 58:10.520]  Get rid of, get rid of the committee chairman having all the power and get rid of all the
[58:10.520 --> 58:13.840]  national security secrecy that they've used to make it secret.
[58:13.840 --> 58:15.360]  I mean, you just said it.
[58:15.360 --> 58:20.320]  It's secrecy in government is what has made us insecure and led us to this point.
[58:20.320 --> 58:21.320]  Absolutely.
[58:21.320 --> 58:22.320]  God bless you.
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.760]  Good point, Dr. D. We're going to come back for five or six more minutes and talk to Joe
[58:26.760 --> 58:29.400]  and talk to Steve and Gloria.
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.880]  Then we've got Stefan Malinu in studio with us.
[58:33.880 --> 58:36.320]  It's all coming up straight ahead.

[58:40.880 --> 58:50.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
[58:50.040 --> 58:53.480]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[58:53.480 --> 58:55.920]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[58:55.920 --> 59:01.040]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[59:01.040 --> 59:04.600]  other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[59:04.600 --> 59:08.840]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[59:08.840 --> 59:16.280]  what I believe is the ultimate non GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful
[59:16.280 --> 59:21.200]  organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[59:21.200 --> 59:26.720]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[59:26.720 --> 59:29.200]  of using synthetic chemicals.

[59:53.080 --> 01:00:05.080]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.840]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.840]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:17.160]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:31.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:38.360]  Well the architect of Obozo care, Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Death, Dr. Death panel, he's
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.920]  come out and said you don't need a doctor.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.400]  You just need to go to a kiosk.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.480]  Remember, Jakari Jackson went to Walmart and they had some robot, literally diagnosing
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:53.280]  with diabetes and say he was obese or whatever, even though he's in great shape.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.600]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.320]  Walmart robo doctor kiosk promotes Obamacare, a lesium-like machine tells Jakari Jackson
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.520]  he's obese and should sign up for Obamacare.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.800]  And so we're going to show that report along with that with Stefan Malinu.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.320]  Coming up in the next segment, here's a big story we're going to be covering, CIA employees
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.640]  face new inquiry amid clash on detention program, turns out the CIA was spying on the Senate.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.840]  Well, of course they were.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.920]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.680]  Right now, let's go back to your calls on the IRS taking the fifth, even though they
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.760]  tell you you can't, on your tax filings.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.640]  But hey, you know, four legs good, two legs better.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.680]  You're on the animal farm, Joe in California, you're on the air.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680]  Go ahead.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.680]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680]  I'm doing all right.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680]  Just doing a little radio show.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]  Awesome.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:56.680]  Well, it's just another example of how it's one set of rules for them and a different
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.120]  set of rules for all the rest of us slaves.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.760]  Well slaves is the operative word because it is an unconstitutional tax.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.080]  It is in the communist manifesto to have an income tax.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.600]  The average American didn't pay an income tax till 1951.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.520]  I mean, this is an alien thing.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.360]  I'll never forget that Ron Paul was on CNN once and what do we do to get rid of income
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]  tax?
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  What'll build the government?
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360]  What run goes?
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.080]  This capital was built before we had an income tax.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.800]  The income tax doesn't run the country.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.760]  It goes to interest on the debt of the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.800]  But hey, don't let facts get in the way of it.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.800]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.800]  Make a point.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.960]  You know, here's the thing.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.400]  If they're going to continue to ignore us and implement things that we don't want, like
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.680]  an example of Obamacare, you know, you fully implement that when we told you we don't want
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680]  it.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.920]  We're not going to pay taxes anymore.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.280]  Their lifeblood of this whole system is money.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.840]  If they don't have money, they can't function.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.280]  They can't send troops into attack if they don't have money to pay them.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.240]  So cut them off.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]  Very well said.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  No, I agree.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.080]  And withdraw consent from the system, speak out against it, take our moral authority away
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.760]  from them, point out that literally we're run by offshore banks and it's over.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.000]  The occupation will begin to fall.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.080]  They want us poor.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.840]  The globalists admit this.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.440]  They set the economy up to make it artificially scarce because they don't want us being, quote,
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440]  uppity.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.840]  By the way, Paul Watson was on for a long time last night on the Savage Nation with
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.920]  Michael Savage breaking down the whole Ukraine situation.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:41.040]  It's an excellent in-depth talk by two men, one in the UK, one in San Francisco, California,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.040]  on what happened there.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.400]  And it's a fascinating interview.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.320]  I was listening to it this morning and it was almost late to work.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.280]  It wasn't really late to work, but I wanted to get here two hours early.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.080]  I only got here an hour before showtime because I listened while I was getting ready this
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.560]  morning doing research to the whole interview and it's up on infowars.com, Paul, Joseph
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:05.040]  Watson and Michael Savage, really discussing hardcore issues, breaking the left-right paradigm,
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.840]  drilling into the geopolitical machinations of the new world order.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:17.200]  Stefan Malinu, philosopher, futurist, best-selling author, will be joining us, hailing from candidates.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.920]  He's going to be in studio in the next segment, a little bit in the next hour with us, but
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.880]  I'm sure we'll be able to talk about the IRS with you guys, Steve and Robert and Fred
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.360]  and Dave and Mike and many others.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.920]  We will be getting to all of you with him as well.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:38.200]  But I'm going to first cover the statist religion, which he agrees is more dangerous
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.280]  than a lot of people that are controlled by establishment religion.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.120]  And again, I'm a religious person.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.680]  I'm a spiritual person, but I'm not an establishment religion person.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.120]  But I don't get mad at folks that say, I can't see it.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.320]  I don't believe it.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.480]  What I get mad at is atheists that tend to replace one thing with a statement, God, and
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.320]  he agrees that those atheists are dangerous.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.720]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:09.400]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.480]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.800]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:23.120]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.520]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.640]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.760]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:41.040]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.640]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.080]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.560]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.480]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.280]  my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.280]  The facts are in.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.720]  The studies are legion.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.720]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.240]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.360]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.600]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.920]  to get it out of our bodies.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.760]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive infowarslife fluoride shield formulation,
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:36.440]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:41.520]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.800]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.400]  I use fluoride shield every day, secure your fluoride shield, and other pioneering formulations
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.840]  at infowarslife.com today.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.200]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the info war at the same time.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.480]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.200]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.280]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.840]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.800]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.440]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.080]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.320]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.900]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.520]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.120]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.280]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:39.600]  Every time that I look in the mirror, all these lines in my face get clearer.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:49.560]  The past is gone and went by like Dr. Dorn.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.200]  Isn't that the way?
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.880]  All right, Stefan Malinu is with us about 10, 15 minutes into the next hour and we'll
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.880]  have open phones throughout that third hour coming up interspersed with news.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.120]  Stefan is here in Texas going around on tour, best selling author from Canada.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.640]  And I wanted to get him in here to talk about his futurist view on the world and where things
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:19.920]  are going, but to also go over some of the contemporary news that is unfolding in the
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.440]  world today.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.200]  And then we also have government run healthcare where now they promise no new regulations
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.000]  on doctors.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:38.600]  It is 155,000 in the coming changes are vast, the number of codes will explode from 17,000
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.120]  of the current system to 155,000 under the new one according to the Centers for Medical
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.780]  and Medicine Services and it's designed to totally destroy all free independent medical
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:53.120]  centers, doctors, you name it, all the smaller clinics and hospitals, it was written by big
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.440]  hospitals and foreign insurance companies and offshore insurance companies to totally
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.480]  shut everything down but them.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.600]  It's a monopoly takeover to take you from 40 hours to less than 30 hours a week to not
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.960]  cover preexisting conditions.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.720]  Government being involved with corporations screwed up our healthcare.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.280]  If you think it was already bad, it was the best 50 years ago here in the U.S., hands
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.800]  down not debated, royalty came here from around the world.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.760]  Now it's going to be the worst, so the weekly standard has those numbers.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:28.120]  We're also going to be getting into the architect of it, Ezekiel Emanuel, we have the clip coming
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.920]  up, he says, we'll get to the bottom of the hour, you don't even need a doctor.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.720]  It's like Cuba, you've got plenty of doctors in healthcare, you just get a cane if your
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.040]  knees are bad or a cane if you're going blind, a cane is the answer.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.760]  So everybody's like, I want the healthcare like England, you ever watch the parliamentary
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.680]  stuff on C-SPAN where they admit 18 months to get a broken leg fixed and stuff?
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.640]  Wow, folks, you're really in for a rude awakening, just like we told you Obamacare would increase
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]  your prices.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.160]  We're going to get into this move to disarm people as well and the whole climate change
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:09.880]  push for taxation, just a bunch of news with our guest and Hillary Clinton calls Vladimir
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:16.480]  Putin Hitler, takes one to no one, this is all coming up with Stefan Malonev and again,
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.680]  he is the founder and host of Free Domain Radio, one of the largest, most popular philosophical
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.320]  shows in the world with more than 2400 podcasts, 10 books and 50 million downloads, that's
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.160]  an old bio, it's more than that now.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.880]  And he spread the cause of liberty, philosophy to listeners throughout the world and I'm
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.200]  not going to go over his whole background, but prior to that he was a thriving career
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.880]  and software entrepreneur and executive in 2006, he left his work in the tech industry
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.280]  to devote his efforts to Free Domain Radio, now a self-identified full-time parent and
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.280]  philosopher or thought criminal, Stefan speaks regularly at liberty-themed events across
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.800]  North America and South America and he's author of two novels, Revolutions and the God of
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.600]  Atheists as well as eight non-fiction books on relationships, government and religion
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.840]  and freedomainradio.com is his site, again I'm your host Alex Jones, if you just joined
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.200]  us with infowars.com, you can follow us on Twitter at realalexjones.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.920]  Before I go anywhere, I want to thank you for coming to join us.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.560]  Oh, it's my pleasure, thank you so much for having me, I'm actually in town for the Texas
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.560]  Bitcoin Conference tomorrow and it's a real pleasure to, I mean we've done a couple of
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.800]  shows remotely so it's very nice to be able to do a show face to face.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.600]  Well, it's good to have you here brother, now there's so much I want to throw out but
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.480]  I want to cover the waterfront here, quantifying, because I know you're a smart guy when it
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.560]  comes to history, that's why I like having you on, because I'm someone of a history novice
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560]  myself.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.120]  Looking at the wider spectrum, I believe undoubtedly we're in the bottom of a very decadent phase
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.560]  in the cycle, but coming out of that could be renaissance.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.240]  I want to see, A, if you agree with that, B, what do you expect the status to are the
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.240]  biggest religion in the world, versus one of the other largest religions, the liberty
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.440]  lovers, you know, who just are into humans and human empowerment, call it a religion
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440]  if you want.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.920]  The point is humans tend to organize in that fashion.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.280]  What do we do and what's going to happen as the status discover, it's not delivering,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.880]  it's a fraud, it's a lie, they tend to double down and call for 100% taxation, the taxing
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.200]  class tends to start engaging in tax fraud, where you have a $3,000 truck and they say
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.600]  we say it's worth $30,000, that's not happening to friends of mine, we have like 93 Chevy
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.280]  Silverados, and then the state just says sorry, pay that, we're not giving you your sticker,
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.440]  this is happening everywhere, what's going to happen as they double down historically,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.720]  what comes out of that?
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.640]  What are they going to go through with the singularity stacked on top of it, with all
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.680]  the societal crises and super bugs and like everything coming to a head, what do you expect
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680]  to happen?
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.960]  Well, violence, of course, is an addiction, and most addictions have to run their course.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.600]  You know, most people who get involved in addictive behavior end up escalating and escalating
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.720]  and escalating and are focused on trying to use government violence to solve complex
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.640]  social problems, I think you're right, it's in its death throes, I mean, how much further
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640]  can it go?
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.840]  I mean, taxation, if you count debt and so on, and you count all these scaled taxes
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.320]  all embedded in your income and in your bills and in your regulations and so on, 60, 70,
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.160]  80%, who even knows what it is?
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.520]  How much bigger, how much more powerful can it get?
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.440]  How much more debt can a country run into?
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.760]  How many more military bases can the United States have overseas?
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.920]  I think we're reaching the end mathematically and morally of this focus on trying to use
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.480]  the state to solve social problems.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.240]  The idea that you can solve social problems voluntarily and peacefully and virtuously
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.760]  and cooperatively is an enlightenment idea that got eclipsed by the progressive movement,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.080]  the communist movement, the socialist movement of the 20s, where a whole bunch of people
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.080]  said-
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  Who claims the moral haggar.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080]  Yeah, yeah, claim the moral haggar.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.840]  We can solve poverty, we can solve illness, we can make everybody educated, we can teach
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.800]  the poor, and now, I mean, the whole thing is completely unraveling.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:00.240]  You don't see a lot of calls outside of Obamacare, which I think was pretty unique in that the
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.280]  Democrats just had all the cards in one moment in history.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.440]  You don't see a lot of call for big government programs.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.560]  You don't actually see that much of a call for more government spending on things like
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.240]  education because they're spending so much and getting so little result.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:17.240]  I think people are recognizing that more money, more power, is not going to solve the problem,
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.080]  and then people are beginning to look for alternatives.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.000]  It's still early, but we have to be out there saying no, coercion is never going to work
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.680]  to solve these problems.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.440]  So, coercion is like a drug for a toothache.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.960]  You take heroin for a toothache, you feel fine for a little while, and then the rot sets
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.240]  in deeper, and then when you do finally go see the dentist, it's way worse than if you've
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240]  gone up front.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.120]  So, in a democracy, you can bribe a whole bunch of people with the money of the unborn.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.840]  You can sell off the fetuses to the banksters around the world.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.680]  The bill comes due, and the longer we push it off, the worse it's going to be, and I
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.000]  think people are just kind of getting around to the point now.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.120]  And there's not any economists that deny that now.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120]  No.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120]  You're right.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.120]  Ten years ago, we'd talk about this, oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.160]  Now it's like, okay, you're right, it's going on, but what are you going to do about it?
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.400]  Well, the stimulus package, the whole Keynesian thing, right?
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.760]  Like, oh, well, there's a dip in the demand, which is the result of prior-fed policies
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.800]  and pushing everyone into a home policies, and people say, well, the stimulus package
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.000]  is going to even things out, and then it's going to grow again.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.080]  Well, they had the largest stimulus package in the history of the known universe, and
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.840]  the economy is still a complete mess.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.800]  So I think people are no longer, they're hitting the gas pedal, but there's no gas
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.800]  getting to the engine.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.120]  I think people are recognizing it's just not working anymore, and I hope that people are
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.760]  beginning to look at voluntary options for solving some very deep social problems, half
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.280]  of which are natural to the human community.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.280]  Sure, but what do you expect to happen in the interim as those that follow the God of
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.320]  the state discover that the golden calf isn't going to deliver?
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.800]  Well, you say some of them are going to double down, and those people we have to call out
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800]  on a moral basis.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.680]  I think the practical argument has been one.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.240]  You know, libertarians have been saying for 40, 50 years, or if you count classical liberals
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.240]  250 years, that the state is not going to produce anything good in the long run.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.760]  We've won the practical argument because the results are just so catastrophic around
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]  the world.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.760]  Thomas Jefferson is right.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.360]  Nobody's arguing, well, a bit more state, and we'll be fine.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.840]  You know, I mean, this is the death row of the addiction to state coercion.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.000]  But what we need to start hitting people with, Alex, is the moral argument that when they
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.240]  say more taxation will solve the problem, what they're saying is more violence, more
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.600]  theft, more stealing, more stealing, more debt is going to solve the problem, but they're
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.920]  advocating an escalation of violence to solve complex problems.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.320]  We've got to call them out morally.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.460]  The practical argument has been one, but we need to hit them hard in the moral sole
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.720]  of Plexus, so to speak.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]  I agree with you.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.160]  Let me just throw a total wild card at you because I keep seeing this in the news.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.840]  Every time I turn around leaders in government and the people that are over the quote, child
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.400]  porn investigations are reportedly involved in it.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.480]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.600]  Why did number 10 cover up AIDS child porn arrest?
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:58.480]  Downing Street only confirms details when pressed by mail as further sex allegations
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.080]  against PMs, friend emerged.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.920]  Here's an example of government, statistically, truancy officers and CPS, people can look
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.160]  this up at the highest level of pedophilia.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.000]  So the people that are over stopping it are the ones that are involved in it.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.520]  I mean, right there proves the whole state argument.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520]  Why is that?
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.360]  I mean, what is that?
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.720]  People who wish to do evil congregate to the state.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.480]  I mean, there wasn't just the BBC, there's the government run, you have to pay the taxes
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.800]  for it whether you like it or not.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.800]  A bunch of pedophiles run.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.800]  Yeah, a bunch of pedophiles.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.000]  Just Jimmy Seville and all these people with like a 30-year pedophile ring going on up
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  there.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.320]  People in power are the people who want power, are the people who want to get over the rules
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.760]  they're imposing on others.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.160]  I mean, you read this John Kerry quote about how horrible it is to invade a sovereign country
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.000]  when he was talking about Putin and Ukraine.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.080]  I mean, the level of hypocrisy shown by those in power is astounding, it's like watching
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.080]  two alcoholics scream you're a drunk at each other when they're both complete alcoholics.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.000]  So people who want to do great evil gravitate to where you're exempt from the moral rules
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.280]  and exempt from the law which is at the top of the status apparatus.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.640]  That's why expecting the state to save us from evil, the state is a giant magnet for
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.440]  evil doers and it gives them the most possible power that you can have in this known universe.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.360]  So it seems to me that if you want to do terrible things like rape children, yeah, gravitate
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.360]  towards the government.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.640]  The SEC during the financial crisis, the lead up to the financial crisis, the amount of
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.880]  pornography that was found on the SEC computers ran into the thousands.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.760]  They had power point presentations of rampant pornography being developed and shown in the
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.080]  SEC while they were supposed to be guarding everybody's financial interests.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.480]  Well, you know, if you're into looking at porn at work, of course you want to go work
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.720]  for the government because in the private sector you'd be tossed out.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.840]  It's just amazing how disconnected they are and really historically it's government,
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.880]  hero, curricula, examples are legion that become delusional, announce their God and
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.200]  then build pyramids and say, bring your children up here to be sacrificed to me to show your
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.960]  ultimate service to them.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.520]  The whole world becomes a giant Jim Jones cult, drinking government Kool-Aid.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.720]  We'll be right back with Stefan Malinu.

[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.080]  to serve as debt.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.600]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.880]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.680]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.960]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.480]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.440]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.440]  buck.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.560]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.560]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:28.840]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840]  and women.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.720]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:38.080]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:09.520]  We are back live.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.880]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.320]  Stefan Mollin is with us, I guess, 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.960]  We'll start taking your calls coming up here in about 20 minutes on any subject you'd like
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960]  to discuss.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.480]  IRS persecutions, you name it.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.800]  Lois Lerner taking the 5th, even though the IRS tells American slaves they can't take
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.320]  the 5th on their tax forms, and then we're going to get into the fake global warming.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.840]  It's Stefan Mollin's take on that.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:36.800]  The incredible anti-gun confiscation garbage that's going on, the victim disarmament that's
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.200]  going on is unprecedented.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.400]  Now Bloomberg wants Facebook to not allow you to have pro-gun posts defending the Second
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.400]  Amendment.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.160]  I mean, this is really unprecedented.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.400]  The Statists are now losing the intellectual battle, so they're moving toward censorship.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.560]  That's coming up in the next long segment.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.280]  This segment's only six minutes long, and Stefan, I know you're a big geopolitical analyst.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.920]  I wanted to get your take on the situation in the Crimea, in the Ukraine.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.000]  Well, I guess the first thing to recognize is that up until 1953, the Ukraine was part
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.120]  of Russia, and they still very much identify.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.400]  I mean, the whole Eastern half of the country speaks Russian and is very nationalistic,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.400]  very Russian nationalistic.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.800]  It is one of the most corrupt autocracies in all of Europe, in fact, in all of the world
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]  outside of Africa.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.960]  I mean, the level of corruption is-
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960]  It's a mess.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960]  Shaggering.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960]  I mean, the amount of debt and so on.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.960]  Now, they want to join the EU.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  A study came out, I shouldn't laugh because it's just tragic, but a study came out in,
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:34.960]  I think-
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960]  Out of the fire, into the furnace.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960]  Yeah.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.320]  I mean, the amount of corruption in the EU has been estimated conservatively as about
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.600]  the same size as the entire economy of Ukraine.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.040]  So the idea that they're going to go to the EU to try and get away from corruption is
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040]  completely mad.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040]  Yeah.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040]  It's out of the frying pan, into the fire.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.040]  Now, of course, Russia has for many years been paying the Ukraine to store the Black-
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040]  Sorry.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.960]  So the fourth fleet is in Crimea.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.200]  And when in a time of instability, when they don't know which way the government is going
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.000]  to go, it seems to me, I don't know for sure, but it seems to me that Putin is simply saying,
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.120]  I need to go in and secure my fleet because I don't know what's going to happen to the
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.120]  government.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.120]  And this is exactly, I mean, if Turkey was about to be taken over, if America thought
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.080]  Turkey was about to be taken over by a communist government, they would move in to secure their
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]  bases.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080]  They would move in to secure their military assets.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]  It seems to me that-
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  Plus, this is right on the Russian border.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]  Yeah.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]  It used to be part of Russia.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.040]  So it's, I'm not defending Russia, it's just the West is in there starting the whole
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.200]  thing as my issue.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.200]  Yeah.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.800]  And of course, Russia, one of Putin's arguments is, look, he says, I stood behind the America
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.520]  when they went into Iraq, which I disagreed with, when they wanted some of the Eastern
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:44.600]  bloc countries to join EU and NATO, I didn't stand in the way, but enough interference.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  He feels that the West is coming in and interfering on stuff right on the border.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.520]  And remember what happened in 62 when the mussels were going to be installed in Cuba?
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.800]  I mean, America went insane because it was right off the coast of America.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.760]  And this is right off the coast, right off the coast, it's right, attached to Russia.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.360]  And it was a former satellite, so-
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.720]  No, but you're right, they're moving NATO ships into that area as well.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.720]  Yeah.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.880]  So it's a major escalation.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:12.160]  And America has been spending $5 billion over the past 15, 20 years to promote its agenda
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.880]  in Ukraine.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.640]  And you know, there have been some reports that some of the protesters are being directly
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.760]  paid by American satellite organizations and so on.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:27.840]  So that is an extreme invasion of sovereignty of Eastern Europe and of Russia.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.680]  Again, not to defend Russia, it's an autocracy and Putin's a horrible thought.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.200]  But it's a giant provocation and in common law and in common sense, you start something,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.640]  you lose moral eye-ground, which shows the delusional nature with Kerry saying you can't
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.880]  invade countries when they just did this to Syria, they just did this to Libya.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.120]  And now they actually started this operation, it just shows the hubris.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.120]  You raised the point of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and Obama laughing at them.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.120]  Yeah.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.920]  So in a debate with Mitt Romney in the last cycle, Mitt Romney said, well, you know, Russia
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.680]  could do something in the Ukraine.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.240]  And Barack Obama laughed at him and said, the 1980s are calling, they want their foreign
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.640]  policy back.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.360]  The Cold War's been over for 20 years.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.040]  Now, I think the Democratic Party has always had a pretty soft spot for Russia since the
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.120]  Aldra Hiss incident and the HUAC and they were covering up so much of spies, Russian
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.120]  spies inside.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.120]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.360]  I mean, putting libertarians and conservatives and freedom lovers in death camps is their
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.360]  dream.
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.120]  So Stalin was kind of their rock star.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]  Yeah.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.360]  And the covering up of Stalin's crimes and all of this kind of stuff.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.360]  So people...
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.360]  Let's just put it through this way.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.120]  They have, they have pin-ups spread centerfolds of Stalin.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.720]  They've really been very pro-communist, very pro-Russia, because they're on the left, right?
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.360]  Because, you know, the moment is like anti-Russia on the left is about as prevalent as anti-war
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.520]  sentiments when you have a Democrat in the White House.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520]  So yeah.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.840]  So I think that they're not really seeing things very clearly.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.240]  Russia has changed to some degree, but it is still remains very autocratic, very, very
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]  dictatorial.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.440]  And, you know, this guy came out of the KGB ranks, not known for its touchy friendly
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440]  Democratic feelers.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:01.720]  So I think it is not something that is going to be a huge escalation situation.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.120]  It's just that they've moved to protect their military assets when they was on stable government.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.560]  That seems to me, I mean, I don't agree with any of it.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.440]  I mean, it's all just a bunch of thugs, but I can...
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.080]  And the EU just wants to liquidate another corrupt state and suck it dry.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.240]  And this group of thugs want to be paid off by the EU for the assets.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.280]  I mean, all it is is Russia and the EU and George Soros struggling over looting something.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.160]  Well, and now, you know, the way that being bought off, and it all comes back down to
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  buying people off.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.720]  It's all just a mafia movie in nice suits.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.040]  Because they all end up getting, so now the EU is going to put a $15 billion aid package
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040]  in.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.520]  America is going to kick up in another billion dollars.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.520]  Loan guarantees.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.520]  The banks just are getting paid.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.520]  It's like a payday loan.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.520]  The banks just get paid and the poor get poorer.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.520]  It's the same story over and over.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.720]  All right, I want to come back and cover a host of issues from global warming to the
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.880]  gun grab with Stefan Malinu and your phone calls.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.880]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.040]  We're on the march.

[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:08.360]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:14.440]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.440]  to the global takeover.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.400]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.960]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.480]  yourself during any radiological event.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:49.280]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.400]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com

[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.080]  Are you infowarshop.com?
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:05.360]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.720]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760]  Fluoride.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:21.200]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.200]  iodine.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:28.120]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:33.400]  a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.800]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:42.280]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.880]  You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com.

[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:18.600]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:23.680]  Talk show host, best-going author, Stefan Malinoui is in studio with us this into the
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.920]  next hour.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.560]  Your phone calls are coming up in the next second, I promise, for folks that have been

[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:45.000]  I really do want to cover a whole swath of things with our informed guest here today and
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.600]  pick his brain on everything from Bitcoin to the attack on the Second Amendment and
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:54.320]  free speech and how that's now intersected with Bloomberg wanting to censor pro-gun Second
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.320]  Amendment defense online.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:01.680]  And this is just unprecedented, really criminal level larceny going after our basic rights.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:09.040]  I mean, we should all just be burning with anger, but I guess the tyrants have gotten
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.000]  us where we're used to being run over by them.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.640]  It's like deer in the headlights, I'm dumbfounded now by how arrogant they are, but it is good
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.000]  to see the awakening happening.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.280]  But Stefan, before I segue off into a bunch of my questions, what are some points you
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.280]  haven't gotten to yet?
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.040]  Well, actually, let's lobby it back to you, Alex.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.560]  How do you feel about the departure of dear Pierce Morgan from the fair shores of the
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.560]  United States?
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:40.480]  Do I need a Kleenex for you with a tear in your eye with great sorrow to see the anti-gun
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.920]  advocate exit the scene?
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:48.160]  In a way, I am sad because him talking down his nose at everybody and being arrogant and
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.400]  basically saying Americans were all running around with Coonskin caps backfired.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.480]  He didn't implode.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.200]  He imploded day one.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.560]  He never succeeded.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.000]  He effectively wasn't on the air anymore.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.600]  He took 2 million viewers every night and had it down to 380,000 when he left, and it's
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.880]  the same for MSNBC.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:10.400]  They're all in freefall, so I ask you the question.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.520]  Maybe zombies are real.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.720]  I always thought it was medically impossible.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.160]  This, you have zombie banks, this is zombie media.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.360]  Well, look, I mean, the gun thing is tricky, and it's not tricky because the facts aren't
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.440]  on the side of the First Amendment rights, Second Amendment rights guys.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.800]  It's just tricky because people see a gun and they think violence.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.800]  They don't think protection.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.800]  Sure, I get it.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.560]  People see a cop with a gun and they think protection, but they see a private citizen
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.280]  with a gun and the less intelligent among us are like, ooh, that's violence.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.520]  Hollywood told them that.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.720]  Yeah, and so the idea that guns prevent crime is kind of confusing to people.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.640]  And you know, it's like you exercise and you feel tired.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.520]  It's like, well, how is this supposed to make me feel stronger?
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.360]  It's like, you make you feel tired.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.080]  So for people who just live on the surface and see, oh, there's a gun, that must mean
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.880]  there's crime as opposed to the idea that guns prevent what, millions of crimes.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:56.880]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.840]  But what you don't see, people have a tough time with, right?
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.960]  40 plus crimes are stopped, FBI's own numbers, they don't like to advertise for every time
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:04.960]  it's used in a crime.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.960]  Right.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:06.960]  Right.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.680]  And they say, well, you know, you're more in danger of shooting yourself with a gun
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.680]  and all that kind of stuff.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.280]  It's like, I think that statistically this is all very false.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.480]  Well, it's like saying you can't have a car, you might get killed with it.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.480]  I mean, nothing's safe.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.480]  Right.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:23.400]  So there is this weird dumb thinking where if you get rid of guns, you get rid of violence,
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.320]  which is, again, it's just not true.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.960]  It's like, you know, then why don't people say, well, let's get rid of police and we'll
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.760]  get rid of arrests and we'll get rid of jails and then there'll be no violence because nobody
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.480]  is fundamentally against guns.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:38.720]  What they are for the anti-gun people, what they're for is for guns to be centralized
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.680]  in the hands of the elite.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.720]  They are for the guns being centralized in the hands of the cops.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.080]  Because if you have anti-gun laws, cops with guns need to go around in people's houses
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.200]  and take those guns away.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.320]  Which is now happening in Connecticut and California.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.080]  And nobody, this is one thing to be really clear with anti-gun people.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.400]  They're not anti-gun.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.920]  They are very pro-government guns.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.760]  They're just anti-private citizens' guns, which is always something that happens with
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760]  them.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.760]  That's right.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.760]  It's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.320]  That's why they obsess on religion and race and sexual preference because they don't
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.800]  care about all that.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.160]  But when it comes to foreign banks getting bailouts, when it comes to them being exempt,
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.320]  diplomatic immunity, they have bodyguards.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320]  We don't.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]  They're flaming hypocrites.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]  Yeah.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.960]  Why don't you get the Secret Service to stop having guns if not having guns around prevents
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]  crime?
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.120]  It's like, I mean, they spend so much money protecting the president with massive amounts
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.640]  of military force.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.720]  And then for private citizens, you can't have protection.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.720]  But they love it.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.080]  They love it when you don't have private protection.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080]  Why?
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.080]  Well, you know why.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.920]  Because then you're dependent on the government for protection, which will never come.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.160]  Look what's happening to Detroit.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.640]  Take an hour or two to get somebody to come by after a non-level call.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.280]  And the police, you've said, buy a gun.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  Yeah.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.960]  I mean, they're there to identify your body if you're, you know, unlucky.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.640]  So the government is continually breaking your leg and saying, then giving you a crutch
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.720]  and saying, see, without me, you couldn't even walk.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.720]  And this is what they do.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.760]  They want to take away your protection the same way they want to take away your capacity
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760]  to create your own jobs.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.000]  So then you're dependent upon government providing you minimum wage security and all that kind
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  of stuff.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.480]  They want to take away your capacity to save.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.600]  So you're dependent upon them for old age pension.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.720]  And then they even write white papers like Cloward and Pivot admitting it.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  Yeah.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]  Absolutely.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.000]  The second class is one of the most savage aspects of late model democracy.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.840]  And it's, it's resisted to some degree by the Republicans, but it is avidly pursued
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.960]  by their Democrats.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.120]  And now, of course, they want to make you dependent on the government for your healthcare,
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:29.920]  one of the most sensitive, difficult, emotionally draining and unstable things that happens.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.160]  They're going to keep breaking the system until they say, look, we have to take it over.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.160]  It's so broken.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.080]  And by the way, you said that everybody else said that because we know how they operate
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080]  in other countries.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.600]  It's not like, it's not like this is the first time they've done this.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.240]  We watch them over and over again.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.200]  And then even Ezekiel Emanuel comes out and says, yeah, we're trying to wreck the healthcare
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  system right now.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.920]  I mean, if I was trying to wreck a fire department, I should be thrown in jail if I wanted to burn
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]  down the fire department.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:59.040]  He wants to burn down the healthcare system, destroy our, our, and then he's a hero.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.360]  And he admits it on Fox News.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360]  It's terrorism.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]  It's terrorism.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.840]  You know, by any rational definition, it is terror.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.840]  That's right.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  He's a terrorist.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.720]  They are destroying the lifeline for human beings to survive illnesses.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.560]  And you are making them dependent upon a system.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.720]  Now, at the beginning, this is, this happened in Canada, which nationalized healthcare generation
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.720]  or two ago.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:24.680]  Now, the first generation gets it pretty good because the doctors all grew up in that system
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.480]  in the remnants of the free market they used to do in house calls.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.040]  They're used to being really good at serving.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.040]  They're honorable.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  Yeah.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040]  That doesn't just change.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040]  It's a ghost in the machine.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040]  It kind of, and then it takes a while for that echo effect to fade away.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.720]  And then the next generation of doctors who come in who never face any free market restrictions
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.360]  or never had to do customer service, and they basically get paid by the government for ignoring
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.520]  their patients.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:47.080]  The second generation is where it really, really gets hit hard.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.640]  And that's what happened in Canada as well.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.920]  First generation, doctors still working hard.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]  They're still caring about that.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:55.120]  But you don't suddenly stop caring because the government takes over, but the next generation
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.360]  of doctors, you know, it's like the first generation of the NASA engineers did some great
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  stuff.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.360]  You know, what have they done over the last 30 years?
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.640]  They've just get photocopied in the space shuttle and calling it progress.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.680]  And then, you know, so this is one thing that is an illusion that when you take something
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.000]  over and you've got some free market remnants, it actually works relatively okay, and it
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.280]  slowly goes out of focus over time.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.360]  Then the next generation, as is so often the case with the government, gets really
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.680]  hosed with debt and a completely dysfunctional system.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.560]  I mean, when they first privatized the educational system, the teachers didn't wake up not caring
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.560]  anymore, right?
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.080]  But a generation or two later, when you can no longer get fired and everyone's just going
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.080]  in there to hide out from any public free market, yeah, then then it gets worse and
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080]  worse and worse.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.360]  But by then the system is too embedded to undo with anything short of revolution.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.040]  I mean, sort of a verbal revolution, a revolution in my mind.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.040]  And no one can deny.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040]  Look at all the numbers.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:47.040]  I mean, the metrics, the lowering test scores, the physically lowering IQ, the obesity, the
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:54.280]  cancer rates, the saving rates, I mean, we every gauge, the West is in freefall.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.640]  And the problem is, you look at everywhere else, they've never even gone up to the heights
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.640]  to fall.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.520]  I mean, it's a bad, what do you expect if we don't get the new Renaissance going?
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.600]  An absolute new dark age?
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.640]  I mean, this is a pretty bad situation.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  Yeah.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.840]  I mean, I, you know, the one thing that is so frustrating, you know, as a former technology
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.600]  entrepreneur and executive, one thing that's so frustrating, Alex, is that the remnants
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.520]  of the free market keep creating all of these incredible things, you know, like cell phones,
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.000]  where you can video around the world, you know, when you're on a data plan virtually
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  for free.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.520]  And all of this stuff that is so incredible, the human productivity, human connectivity,
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.240]  you know, we have the new Gutenberg press, as you and I talked about in a show before,
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.200]  which allows us to communicate the greatest ideas with no gatekeepers, no people in the
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.440]  way between people who've got great ideas and people who can receive them.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.940]  You don't have to pass through the sensorious.
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:47.160]  Yeah, we're not saying the technology is bad, it's just that Sauron is trying to put his
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:50.080]  will into the computers, go ahead.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.160]  The government keeps taking it over.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.080]  And that which was designed to facilitate communication and spread ideas is now being
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080]  used to...
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  Well, it's like you said, the paradox.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.920]  It's true, historically, a freer country creates so much wealth, everyone's bathing
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.640]  in luxury, then the kids become spoiled, they don't appreciate it, decadence comes in,
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:08.640]  tyranny comes in.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.840]  How do you get by that cycle by having huge human goals that we individually believe in
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.920]  so collectively carry out?
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.600]  Well, my argument is that you have to rethink all the basic human institutions that we have
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.360]  inherited from history.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.320]  Everything that is inherited is open to question.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.600]  You know, we did this with slavery in the West, right?
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.680]  I mean, the Western European Christian culture for...
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.200]  We ended it, so we get blamed with it.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.200]  Yeah, of course, naturally, right?
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.280]  I mean, nobody's going to the Muslims for reparations, they had a far harsher slave
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  trade than the West.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]  Well, it's going on right now.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.880]  Yeah, and only 5% of the slaves in the Atlantic trade ended up in America, which, you know,
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.480]  it doesn't justify the institution, but it certainly means that if you're going to look
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.920]  for scapegoats for slavery, you don't start with America.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.840]  But what happens is every institution, now we've inherited this centralized, collective,
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.120]  violent monopoly called the state, I think we need to open it up to question.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.800]  Is this the best way to organize society?
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:02.040]  Do we really want to get stuck in this continual cycle where the government lets you have some
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:06.480]  freedom, you generate some wealth, the government takes that wealth and uses it to expand itself
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.160]  at your expense and eventually kills the goose that lays the golden egg.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.560]  This cycle has been around since ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, ancient Greece, the modern British
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.800]  Empire, German Empire, Austria, Hungarian Empire, it's the same thing, a little bit of freedom.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.880]  Make some money.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.560]  Government taxes grows into an empire.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.000]  They become arrogant, disconnected.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  And then there's this, you kill the remnants of the free market, where is America down?
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.240]  Now they went down like five or six points in the economic freedom.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.600]  Oh yeah, well there's like scores of countries ahead of us now.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:38.400]  And in freedom of the press and everything we're going down.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.600]  But on the plus side, the mainstream media appears to be having a good internet stake
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.760]  being driven through its heart, which I think is a glorious end to a ghastly beast.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.000]  And that brings me to my next point.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.120]  They will then respond by trying to censor, and there's moves and I'll let you deny man-made
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.680]  global warming, Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech, Facebook now working with a former
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.440]  New York mayor to censor support for the second amendment.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.800]  And it goes to these anti-gun sites where they're in talks and admit he's funding it
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.320]  to not let pro-second amendment speech be on Facebook and they can have bots that block
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.320]  it.
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.440]  We've already seen our pro-gun memes being blocked.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.120]  People go, well, that's their own, they own that site.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.680]  They advertised it as a commons.
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.760]  They built it on our material, like YouTube.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:27.280]  And then now they're clearly in, I mean, we don't know what they're being threatened
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.360]  with behind the scenes.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.880]  I mean, I can't imagine that.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.880]  I'm just saying that's outrageous.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:31.880]  No, it is.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.280]  Now, Bloomberg wants to get rid of free speech.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.800]  That's the beauty of it though, son of a bitch.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.960]  They only shoot at the airplanes over the target, right?
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.240]  When you get close to the target, that's when you get the anti-aircraft gun.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240]  Oh, we're kicking their butt.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240]  Yeah.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.600]  So the fact that, I mean, you know you're achieving something when the powers that be
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.200]  don't like what you're doing.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.160]  You know a drug works on an illness when the illness, if it were conscious, would hate
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160]  that drug, right?
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.920]  So the fact that there's outrage and frustration and counterattacks squealing, it's beautiful.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.120]  I mean, if you know you're doing nothing, if it doesn't, you know, if nobody is bothered
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.720]  by anything you're doing, there's a great quote from Churchill where he said, you have
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.440]  enemies, good.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.760]  That means that you have stood up for something sometime in your life.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:14.680]  And the fact that people are being attacked for free speech, for pro-gun, for pro-freedom,
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:18.800]  for pro-trade, for anti-attack, yeah, don't take it like, oh, I better give up.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.440]  Take it like, I'm affecting something.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440]  I'm on to something here.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.040]  I'm bothering bad people.
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.480]  That's what good people are supposed to do.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:26.080]  We're supposed to bother bad people.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.480]  That's the whole point.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.120]  So I think it's great that there's a lot of flak being sent up.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:34.200]  If there wasn't, we'd be peddling in a basement and in the dark doing nothing.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.600]  But it does show what authoritarians they are.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.040]  They're now sending out hundreds of thousands of letters saying, well, you didn't turn
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.360]  in your semi-automatic handgun, or you didn't register it, turn it in, or we're gonna swat
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360]  team you.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.200]  That article is linked on red on infowars.com.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.640]  They're trying to pass another law to expand gun confiscation.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.560]  They're banning basically gun manufacturing in California with micro stamping.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:57.200]  They just shut down the last lead smelter for lead bullets.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.440]  I mean, so yeah, I mean.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:04.280]  I want people, especially young people, lift the curtain, see the gun, see the gun that
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]  is the state.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.680]  There was this very energetic Occupy movement where they were outraged at the bankers, right?
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.600]  And they wanted, and they are all these crazy socialist nonsense because they're academic.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.600]  Let's try to hijack it.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.600]  Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.600]  But what they did see, which was a terrifyingly beautiful thing for the young to see, what
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:26.160]  they saw was 3,000 activists being arrested and zero bankers.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:29.040]  In fact, the bankers got hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.280]  And Homeland Security simultaneously directing it in 35 cities, they're being scooped up
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.780]  at 2 AM.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.780]  And good.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:40.760]  I'm sorry that it happened to them, but at least they're seeing what it is that they're
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760]  facing.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.560]  And they will be, hopefully, if they've got any brains in their skulls, they will not
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.920]  be tempted to go to the state for solutions when they see the state paying off the people
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:53.240]  who prey upon the poor in the middle class and who sell off the unborn in debt and bonds.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:56.600]  They will see them rewarding those people and arresting their brothers and sisters in
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.120]  a revolutionary movement.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.680]  Hopefully then they will turn away from the state because all we need to do is lift the
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.680]  veil.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.280]  Evil can never win because the moment that people see it as evil, they reject it.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280]  Evil always has to...
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.280]  Well, that's right.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.040]  As soon as we understand the new world order as a private corporate system that's anti-free
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:15.160]  market seeking to shut down competition through the state monopoly combine, as soon as those
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.920]  two things are connected by the right wing and the left wing, it's game over.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.960]  It's game over that George Soros is basically tax exempt, General Electric, Google, Warren
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.440]  Buffett, his company's 400 plus billion of bailout money the last six years while he
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.800]  lobbies for higher taxes in the middle class because he literally is shutting down his
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.200]  competition while feeding on us like a mosquito.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.840]  I mean, it's game over for that piece of crap the minute that's understood.
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.840]  Yeah.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.160]  Was it a guy who goes to buy a joint in Colorado, has in that purchase paid more taxes than
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.640]  all of General Electric, I've got to say.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.080]  Well, they make up the rules and they exempt themselves.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:55.400]  That's the whole point of power is to inflict rules on others and escape those rules yourself.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.160]  If you could convince everyone else in the world to not be a thief, your job as a thief
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.760]  would be totally easy.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:01.760]  Nobody would have any locks.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:02.840]  They wouldn't protect anything.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.960]  They just assume they lost it or mislaid it, right?
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.120]  The whole purpose of ethics historically has been to convince the masses to be good so
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.760]  that they're productive, which makes them fatter cattle to be preyed on by the rulers.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:17.000]  The rulers give us ethics to make sure we don't compete with their evil.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.280]  It's got nothing to do with them actually believing, you know, thou shall not steal
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.600]  as a foundational ethic.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.680]  I don't believe anyone has ever said, well, but you see taxation is a form of theft and
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:27.480]  therefore it's the violation of one of the Ten Commandments and that's like Ron Paul
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.480]  sign.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.480]  He says, don't steal.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.480]  Government doesn't like competition.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  I'm going to hate competition.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.480]  Yeah.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480]  This is the whole problem of ethics.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.080]  It's invented by and I'm an ethical guy and I believe in universal ethics and I believe
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.080]  in virtue.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.200]  But the problem is they use it to make us simpleton chomps and naive while they are rapacious.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.760]  And the idiots rob banks, if you want to be a good bank robber, own a bank.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760]  That's the way.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760]  That's the way.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.760]  Exactly.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.760]  But to make your point, I interrupted about that.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:56.000]  Well, it's just so we're always told as kids, you know, like don't steal, don't push, don't
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.720]  use force to get your way, negotiate, use your words.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.320]  That's what they always say, right?
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.400]  And when you see something like internationally that's what's happening with the Ukraine,
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.480]  what did they do?
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.200]  They threaten economic sanctions.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.680]  They threaten ostracism.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.280]  They threaten to cancel travel visas.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.440]  They threaten all of this kind of stuff.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.480]  They're using their words, not their guns and their bombs because Russia has power.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480]  Russia has nukes, right?
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.240]  That the age of European warfare ended with the invention of the nuclear bomb.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.240]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail with us.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.240]  So with each other, with rulers, they all deal with each other diplomatically and they
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.040]  negotiate and they threaten things and so on.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.280]  But they don't threaten war that much in the West anymore.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:36.080]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.080]  And this is the horrible.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.080]  That's right.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.240]  And it's only because it's safe for us that we don't have nukes.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.240]  Of course.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.560]  I mean, we're the livestock and they care about us insofar as they want us to be productive.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:49.280]  They empathize with us like a farmer empathizes with a cow's desire not to put his face in
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  it.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:53.120]  And they describe us, all elites throughout history, call their subjects cattle.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.120]  We're just a form of livestock.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.120]  And this is the first.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:59.600]  The Aztecs called their lower class, you know, you know, basically livestock.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.840]  So that's where livestock, you know, in the ancient, you know, Hebrew stuff, the neighbors
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  were livestock.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.520]  But I mean, every, you know, to the Egyptians, everybody else was livestock.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.440]  Like the Nazis, everybody else was livestock.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  Yeah.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  I mean, that's how it works.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440]  We're going to go to break.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  Come right back with phone calls.

[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.400]  It's very easy to be a criminal, all you need to burglarize a home is one simple household
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.400]  tool.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  A pair of scissors.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:10.280]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors then you're
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.720]  making it easy for them.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.160]  Almost every home security system even though sold by big name companies has a weakness.
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:17.160]  The phone line.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:22.960]  You shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long term contract and think you're safe.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.500]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip and when a burglar cuts your
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.440]  phone line you're defenseless.

[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:00.560]  The facts are in.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:02.320]  The studies are legion.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:06.960]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.520]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.320]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320]  Simple.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.640]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:22.880]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.200]  to get it out of our bodies.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:29.520]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:35.680]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.120]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:45.040]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.360]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.800]  This is InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:41.600]  Make no mistake, as I like to say, we do not live in boring times.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.280]  It was very interesting times, the old Chinese adage that, yeah, it's interesting, but it
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.280]  also has a double meaning.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.280]  It was very serious.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.520]  And, you know, the crazy thing is I'm just somebody who's studied history in common sense,
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.280]  and much of what we've broken down has turned out to be the truth.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.880]  They've gone through this process of there's no government drug dealing, there's no government
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.480]  money laundering, there's no cancer viruses being added to the vaccines, there's no
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.920]  covered population reduction programs.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.160]  Now it's just all coming out, but it almost just unoculates people psychologically to
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.720]  go, okay, big deal to where they'll put up with anything.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:16.840]  So how do you quantify that paradox I'm kind of getting at?
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.960]  Well, for me, at least being a freedom fighter means always being sorry that I'm right.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:25.080]  You know, because it's like, I feel like I said a doctor, you know, you got a patient
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:27.640]  who smokes and smokes, you keep saying, man, you got to stop smoking and it's going to
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  make you sick.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.320]  You got to say, and a guy keeps smoking, and then he gets sick, and you're like, man,
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.320]  I hate being right.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.400]  I just, I wish I'd been wrong, like, so it all turned out to be not be true.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.320]  And we, now the poor, but no longer poor, income disparities had come down, national
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.760]  debt had been paid off, and peace and unicorns and rainbows, you know, populated the planet.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.560]  But it is a gruesome thing to know where this kind of system leads.
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.560]  There is no end to power lust.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:59.000]  You know, they've done studies, the acquisition of power over other human beings is more addictive
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.240]  than cocaine.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.320]  It actually releases the same kind of chemical hormones in the brain that a drug addiction
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.320]  does.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:13.320]  Yeah, but I like seeing people empowered in art and literature and, you know, huge exploration
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  being launched.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.640]  I don't like telling people what to do.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.560]  No, no, that's, you know, because you're not addicted to power, but it is a very, very
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:21.560]  powerful addiction.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.560]  Right?
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.440]  I mean, what's that guy said, stroke of the pen, law of the land.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.440]  Albagallo.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.440]  Yeah, I mean, pretty.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.120]  Stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.520]  Yeah, I mean, that, that amount of power to, I mean, imagine what Obama can do.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:37.800]  What about Obama going, I'm good at killing people?
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800]  Yeah.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.800]  Well, you know, he may not like to.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.600]  I mean, even if you're a real killer, you don't like, oh, I'm really good at killing
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  people.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  Oh, my existence.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.080]  An ad I've not seen on anyone's business card yet, but, but Obama, I mean, look at this,
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.920]  he can, he can pass Obamacare, he can then add thousands of amendments to it after the
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.320]  fact with no congressional approval.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.320]  He can be the savior of his own bill.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.320]  Yeah.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  He can fix his own problem.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.280]  He can, they can hand out waivers, a direct contradiction of the Constitution.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.280]  Total discrimination.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.280]  Yeah.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.920]  Supposed to guarantee you equal equal treatment under the law.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.760]  They're handing out thousands of those are royal indulgences.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.760]  Those are.
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  Yeah.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.760]  This is, it's, it's papal middle ages nonsense, right?
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:21.080]  So, and that kind of power, you can lie to people and say, you'll keep your doctor.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.080]  And then what are the consequences?
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.400]  I mean, you lie to the government.
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:27.800]  You are going away to in a dark hole for a very long time.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.440]  The government lies to you.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.640]  They get your vote with no negative consequences.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.880]  They have no contract with you.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:34.880]  That's right.
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:37.160]  When the FBI has been here before with subpoenas for people threatening on the website or
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.720]  something, you know, just sad issues, they go talk to me and I go, I'm cannot talk to
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.040]  you because you'll, you always put people in jail saying they gave false answers.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.040]  And that's unconstitutional law.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.040]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.040]  Yeah.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.040]  We'll talk to me.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.040]  No, no, you understand.
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.400]  The first rule of fight club is don't talk to the government.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.040]  The second rule is don't talk to the government.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.680]  The third rule is keep your mouth shut.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.360]  The fourth rule shut up.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.360]  What's the fifth rule?
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.360]  Don't talk to the government.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.360]  I'm going to go out on a limb here.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.360]  It kind of goes on for, right?
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360]  Kind of goes for infinity.
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.920]  The eighth rule, interestingly enough, is don't talk to the government.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.920]  But yes.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:06.920]  Yeah.
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.920]  So, so they have no duty to protect you.
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:08.920]  They have no duty to control you.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.960]  You have no control over your government.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.640]  People think that the vote you, all you're doing is voting for people already bought
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.240]  and sold by special interests.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:18.240]  You know, they should have those NASCAR stickers all over the congressmen by who's bought
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.240]  and sold them.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.240]  It's not your interest that there's...
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.240]  Well, that's it.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:24.960]  People in government corporations and all this, they just join their group and then distort
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:27.440]  everything according to what group they're with.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.560]  And I thought I was on Team Humanity to have a college of ideas where we vote in the free
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.120]  market for what we believe in through free association.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.680]  That's what builds a great civilization.
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.680]  Back with your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:41.680]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.800]  It's going to be a doozy.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:50.360]  GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.320]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:59.440]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:03.520]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.840]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:13.160]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:19.560]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:24.680]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.800]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:31.080]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:33.680]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:38.120]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:41.600]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:46.520]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:53.360]  my favorite coffee available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:53.360 --> 02:00:05.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:10.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.160]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:13.360]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:21.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.640]  By the way, the biggest buzz I've ever heard, I think, is for House of Cards.
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:30.000]  I haven't seen it one episode yet, just quite frankly, I'm either with my family or I'm
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  working at night.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.240]  I just, it's kind of shameful, all work and no play makes Jack a crazy boy, but I've
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.320]  got to start watching this because, you see, the Chinese government's obsessed with it.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.360]  It's getting watched like 100 million times a week or something worldwide with Kevin Spacey
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:45.360]  played by me.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.360]  I'm joking.
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:47.360]  People make that joke.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:48.360]  I don't look like Kevin Spacey, which I did.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.960]  The thing is, is we've got Stefan Malinu here, we're taking phone calls this segment and
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.720]  the next, but he's going to give us his review of House of Cards.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.840]  He's coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.840]  Right now, let's talk to Steve in Colorado.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.640]  Thanks for holding, and thank you for joining us today, Steve.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:06.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:12.520]  Yeah, we just want to say hi to Stefan and what's that Karl Marx thing, bio that you
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.520]  put together.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.520]  Yeah.
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:18.320]  Oh, this is Karl Marx basically praying upon the poor and the working class after talking
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:20.800]  about capitalists being evil for doing the same thing.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:25.640]  He had sex with his maid, had a kid, tossed her out on the street, never paid her a penny.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:29.120]  All the studies that Karl Marx did of the market system at the time, he could never
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:32.780]  find a worker who didn't, wasn't paid anything except in his own house, his maid.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:33.780]  He was the worst exploiter.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.280]  I was just pointing out the moral hypocrisy.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.320]  Oh, and he was an angel compared to Lenin.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.840]  Well, Lenin, he wasn't an outright murderer, Marx, but Lenin was an outright, just savage
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.840]  genocidal murderer.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:46.280]  I mean, nonstop blood fest, but sorry, you can call her, we don't get distracted.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.280]  Do you have a question?
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.760]  Well, yeah, it's kind of funny though, just real quick, I want to talk about the IRS
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.080]  on being out of this stuff, but it's funny how these neo-Marxists of today through osmosis
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:02.240]  almost have this same degree of hypocrisy that Karl Marx did.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:05.080]  I mean, it's almost like I said, through osmosis, it's just incredible.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:10.800]  They're bloodthirsty criminals who have grabbed the moral high ground and lectured to everyone
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:14.480]  when they're exempt from everything they're doing and engage in every dirty trick.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.520]  I mean, you try claiming the fifth in an IRS investigation, they'll clap you in irons.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:25.240]  But the hussy up there can be caught lying last year taking the fifth, does it again,
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.240]  she doesn't get in trouble.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.520]  And the IRS is going to be enforcing some aspects of Obamacare and they are desperate
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.280]  to get out of Obamacare themselves.
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.400]  They are lobbying like crazy to get out of Obamacare.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:37.440]  Oh, yeah, the unions, the government people, and they're all going to be exempt.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.960]  Oh, it's for us, it's for us, Alex.
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.560]  I mean, you know, not for the rulers, I mean, you don't build your electric fences around
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:44.560]  your bedroom.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.040]  If you're the farmer, it's just for the cows.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.040]  Horrible.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.040]  Did you have another comment?
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:50.200]  That's where I need you guys's help.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200]  I am being audited.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200]  Sorry to hear that.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.880]  But by you, I was a drywall contractor in Colorado.
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:03.240]  My entire livelihood and trade was awarded to illegal aliens put out of business, my
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.040]  home taken from the MERS, all the value of my property.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.200]  I know they almost force you with, because again, I'm not even against the illegals.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.760]  The point is, you have them here, they'll work for less, their wives going welfare,
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:18.760]  they then undermine the cost, you're in the system, the IRS comes and takes you over.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.560]  You almost have to survive to just start acting like the illegals, get a fake name,
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.320]  pay nothing, operate, do whatever you want, and just sit there in jail when they arrest
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.320]  you for whatever, and they'll just let you out.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.360]  I mean, you can really learn something from the illegals.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.000]  They're almost the total libertarians, except they then siphon off the state.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  What do you say about that, Stefan?
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.040]  Oh, I mean, American immigration policy since the 60s has been a disaster.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:47.360]  I mean, in the 60s, I mean, this is the case in other countries like Australia and so on.
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.400]  They try to bring people in who are educated, who are at least share some of the common
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.400]  use of the West.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.400]  What's wrong?
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.200]  Yeah, I mean, you can't just go and try emigrating to Australia if you're coming from some third
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.440]  world country.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:01.960]  The Democrats, and again, I don't want to sound like I'm pounding on the Democrats.
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:02.960]  Like I'm no Republican.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:03.960]  But the Democrats-
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.960]  But they're the virulent cancer.
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:07.200]  They are very much bringing in their voting base.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:10.640]  And their voting base is underskilled people from third world countries.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.080]  This has been explicit in their platform since the 1960s.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.880]  I think it was said Kennedy, who first brought in this bill, used to get 90% of immigrants
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.600]  from Europe, now get the majority of immigrants coming in from unskilled from third world.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.360]  And this drives down wages.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.640]  And then they say, well, now you see we need minimum wage laws to bring the wages back
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:27.640]  up.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.800]  And it's, you know, I'm for open borders.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:32.320]  There's no such thing as, you know, an illegal anybody, right?
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.320]  But given this policy, it's just a complete-
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.760]  Well, I was about to say, but yeah, you could have open borders worldwide if there wasn't
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  any welfare.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.760]  Exactly.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:41.400]  But you have welfare and then let them vote to take my guns?
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.400]  Yeah.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:46.080]  I mean, literally, they can then vote to make me their slave.
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.080]  Yeah.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  And it happens.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.080]  It is.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.080]  That's what democracy is.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.480]  Two wolves vote that I'm a sheep on their dinner.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:56.560]  And they want to make me the sheep and take my guns.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.560]  So I'm a sheep.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:00.560]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.560]  The facts are in.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:06.760]  The studies are legion, sodium fluoride, and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.560]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:14.360]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:15.360]  Simple.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:19.680]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:23.920]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.240]  to get it out of our bodies.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:30.800]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars-Lined Fluoride Shield Formulation
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:36.760]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:41.800]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:46.080]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.760]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:54.120]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLined.com today.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:58.480]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.480]  That's InfoWarsLined.com.
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:01.480]  Hi, folks.
[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:03.240]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:08.720]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:12.040]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:16.240]  direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.240]  buck.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:21.120]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:25.120]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:30.400]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.400]  and women.
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:34.280]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:39.600]  And that's why I stock MyPantry with high-quality, storeable foods for MyPatriot Supply.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:44.800]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:51.200]  storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:54.320]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:56.920]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:02.520]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex, the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:03.520]  with propaganda.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.960]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:11.080]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:14.640]  other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:18.880]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:25.800]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula, sourced from
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:31.320]  powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:36.800]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.280]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:44.640]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.640]  dose.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:51.720]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% of super male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:54.160]  introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:08:10.400]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:16.240]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.600]  Well there is a war on for your mind big time and I am your host Alex Jones, the news sites
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:26.160]  are InfoWars.com, PresidentPlanet.com, the subscriber site for the nightly news is PresidentPlanet.tv
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:29.600]  and Stephon Mullen is going to be on that show tonight with our great reporters and
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:34.160]  researchers and soon I am launching the official TV system and expanding the show and I will
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.960]  be hosting the show not just doing commentary like I did last night, most nights of the
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.720]  week so no rest for those that don't want to be wicked.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.240]  No rest for those that want to live in the age of reality and want to be free but it's
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.080]  an animating contest, it's addictive so it's like exercise, man throw me in that brown
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:50.240]  patch every day.
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:53.440]  I got some really bad news for folks but some good news as well.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.720]  The enemy has shown their hand.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:00.200]  We broke off of their sites bragging yesterday that they were about to get Facebook to restrict
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.960]  discussion of the Second Amendment.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:08.400]  That article is Bloomberg Moves to Ban Pro Gun Speech, Facebook now working with the former
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:12.880]  New York Mayor front groups to censor support for Second Amendment.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:18.160]  This just got released an hour ago, it will be going up on InfoWars.com, Mom's Demand
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.840]  Action, literally that's like three people in San Antonio when we had thousands out
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:22.840]  there.
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:26.480]  They tried to start a fight with us on video, add that to the article.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.000]  This just was released March 5th, that's today, 2014, Facebook's announced today that the
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.360]  company and its popular photo sharing subsidiary Instagram will take significant steps, remember
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.520]  they arrest kids that draw a picture of a gun at school to block potentially illegal
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.120]  firearms sales through their platforms.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.520]  Now that's meant to sound reasonable.
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.680]  For the first time, the sites will delete reported posts reported by them offering to
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:52.880]  buy or sell guns without background checks.
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.280]  Now people go, well, that sounds reasonable.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:00.920]  Then you read deeper, anyone with a profile under 18 won't be able to see things about
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:05.280]  guns or read the word gun so they can have bots that block everything.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.280]  This has already happened to us.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:09.960]  We send out a pro-gun meme with like Hitler saying, I love gun control, you know, and
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:11.120]  stuff like that.
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:14.680]  Or people about Benghazi, the Navy SEAL group, they just block it.
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.920]  This has been their plan all along.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:22.320]  And you read into the document, it's page after page, but it says Facebook will continue
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.640]  to report to law enforcement, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:28.200]  Facebook will take down reported pages of groups where guns are sold.
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:32.960]  Now again, these are groups, gun shops and gun groups that then link to their gun shop.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.960]  Guns not being sold there.
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:37.120]  They send it to a gun shop and make you buy it.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:40.920]  They create this illusion until the owner of the page acknowledges the page and includes
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.160]  the information prominently at the top of the page.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:48.240]  Facebook's Help Center will remind sellers that they may conduct background checks.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.680]  So it's all about you, say you will comply with the laws.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.960]  They're the new arbiters of free speech online.
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.520]  Facebook will provide public education ad space targeted to users interested in firearm-related
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:02.960]  content to ensure they know about the gun laws.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:08.080]  So now they'll be Mayor Bloomberg anti-gun, literally brainwashed the public as the attorney
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:12.160]  general said, that famous quote, I'm sure you've seen that, targeted at people so they
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.920]  get free advertising now.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:18.200]  And it goes on, it will block people from being able to see the gun sites.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.600]  So it gives them free advertising, you name it.
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:28.080]  These people always set themselves up like the ADL Southern Prairie Law Center over law
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.520]  enforcement, where they set all the policies.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:31.520]  They're God.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:32.520]  Rachel Maddow is God.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.840]  Well, first of all, I can't imagine Facebook is really enjoying this process.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:40.520]  They say they're working with the New York government or whatever, and it's like me working
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.840]  with a mugger for the orderly transfer of my wallet.
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:45.680]  The fact that he has a gun to my ribs is pretty much the whole equation, right?
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.840]  I mean, what the government can do to business is significant.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.680]  And now I know a lot of businesses use government to get rent seeking, to get comparative advantage
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.680]  and so on.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.760]  But if the government comes knocking and says, we'd really like you to work with us, well,
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:59.000]  they are the guys with all the guns.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.680]  And we've been so compliant, that's what's empowered the beast.
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:04.280]  It's time to start not complying.
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.880]  No, but what's beautiful about this, and we were just talking about this in the break
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:11.000]  that I think the government still thinks that they have a monopoly of information distribution
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.600]  like back in the day when there were like three networks and the government basically
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.360]  controlled or managed or had the license fees for all of these things, right?
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:19.800]  License through the FCC.
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.320]  Now, I mean, what a great way to educate kids about the Second Amendment because Lord knows
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.840]  with teenagers, like these people have never met a teenager.
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:30.080]  You go to a teenager and say, you're not allowed to see this.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:31.680]  And it's two clicks away on the internet.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:34.400]  What's the first thing that that's stay out of the liquor cabinet?
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  Yeah.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:38.040]  I mean, I think the average age- Stop chasing cheerleaders.
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.480]  The average age of kids getting porn these days is 10 to 11 years old when it's not legal
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.920]  until, I don't know, 18 or 19 or something like that, right?
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:49.280]  So it's a beautiful way to get kids interested in the Second Amendment to have Facebook, Facebook
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.880]  start blocking stuff because now they're going to get educated about it.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:52.880]  Well, that's it.
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.480]  They're putting in the same category as porn.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:01.200]  I mean, it's mad and it's wonderful how much work the government is doing on behalf of
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:05.920]  liberty advocates in helping the teenagers to understand the power of the state and helping
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:11.120]  them get interested in topics now taboo, which is, you know, I mean, that's like a catnip
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:12.120]  for a teenager.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:13.120]  Oh, it's taboo.
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.280]  The powers that be don't want me to see this.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.800]  Here I going to go and find it right away.
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.800]  I mean, you couldn't advertise education.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:20.360]  Well, listen, they did that.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.680]  I actually figured out the reason I was successful.
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.960]  One of the big make it or break it moments was I put out some documentaries about the
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.720]  military training for martial law, which they, they do perennially and they do it all the
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:34.720]  time.
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.040]  But the military got a hold of these documentaries.
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.040]  Police say 2000 others.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.640]  That was always somewhat successful.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:46.200]  And the Marine Corps and the army across the board said, do not watch Alex Jones or listen
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.680]  to Alex Jones.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.960]  Most of them didn't know who I was.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.400]  That's why today, undoubtedly we are like the number one show in the U S armed forces
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.880]  because they still say, do not listen to him.
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.240]  Do not listen to Ron Paul.
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.200]  Do not, do not get involved in the tea party.
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.880]  It's making them all run to it.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.880]  What were they thinking?
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:06.720]  I mean, they're thinking they have control over the narrative.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.440]  The narrative is fragmented.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.040]  They used to be a sole control of the narrative, right?
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:16.920]  Like when the Catholic priests spoke the, the liturgy in Latin in the Middle Ages and
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.080]  the commoners didn't know Latin and they couldn't get a hold of the Bible.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.480]  And then Martin Luther comes along translates it into a language they can see and the monopoly
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.400]  of Christendom, then fragments into, you know, swing aliens and Anabaptists and Lutherans
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.400]  and all this kind of stuff.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.280]  And that creates more individual debate and discussion.
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.120]  I think that the people in power now, they grew up in like the seventies or the eighties
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.120]  or whatever.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.240]  And there was a monopoly of narrative back then.
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:41.760]  Now there's no monopoly on narrative.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.360]  They think that they can close this down and it's not going to, it's not going to be like
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:46.360]  whack them all through.
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.880]  Well, that's why they'll have MSNBC or others go, Alex Jones has no listeners and is not
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:55.720]  important and it's not on AM and FM stations and then people go, look, I'm on over a hundred
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.400]  and exist because he's not on on media controlled by the government, but what the difference
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.960]  is I'm on over 160, but we've been more successful in the free market internet.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.440]  The point is, is that they lie incessantly.
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.840]  They lie incessantly and you're right.
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:12.160]  They operate like they think they're in a vacuum.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.200]  You can lie if nobody can cross check you, right?
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.840]  But people don't like, I, my website got banned in the armed services too and the number of
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:20.960]  military listeners to my show went through the roof.
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.120]  Well, that's what I'm telling you.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:28.920]  Didn't they know when they ordered the Pentagon in like 99, 2008, I mean, suddenly I had this
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:33.800]  giant audience and suddenly I was being given all this info that turned out to be accurate.
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.360]  People leaking, you know, just basic stuff, don't like secrets, but what was going on?
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:40.840]  Cause they didn't like the training they were being given to take on Americans.
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.440]  They heard a guy saying it was bad.
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:44.000]  They knew I was telling the truth.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.160]  Then they're told, don't listen to this guy.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.720]  Then they come in and say, you're going to get run or get PT duty if we find any more
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:51.440]  of these films here.
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:52.800]  Suddenly everyone was watching them.
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:53.800]  Yeah.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:56.000]  I mean, I mean, what was the system thinking?
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.400]  It's the delusion of control.
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  The technology has by.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.280]  It's the Streisand effect.
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:01.280]  I'm sorry, what now?
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.880]  You know, the Streisand effect where she kept threatening to sue bloggers, don't say where
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.400]  I live, don't talk about me.
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:08.680]  So it brought all this attention to it, made a thousand times bigger.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:09.680]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:10.680]  Yeah, okay.
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:14.400]  And I'm saying literally that shows how screwed up these people are.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.400]  I mean, I don't mean to keep marveling about it.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.320]  It's just that what you're saying is true.
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:25.280]  Well they inhabit the state, which is an institution that is so ancient.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.280]  It's ridiculous.
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:29.640]  It's just an outgrowth of warlords and witch doctors from the Stone Age.
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:34.760]  They inhabit the state, which is retro, and they have had so much monopoly control over
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.800]  the media that I think that they still don't quite grasp just how porous information has
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:40.800]  become now.
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:41.800]  Sure.
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.600]  You know, it's like you put a tiny pebble in a stream and you think you're damning the
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:46.600]  whole stream.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:47.600]  No, everything just goes around it.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:50.040]  I mean, there's no rock big enough to dam the floor.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:51.040]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:54.160]  I learned early on with stalkers or people in the media that make stuff up who wanted
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:58.640]  attention, smaller people than me, making stuff up, don't respond, they go away.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:01.880]  You give them attention, it gives them attention, they do it more.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:02.880]  Yeah.
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:03.880]  Yeah.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:04.880]  And I mean, that's 101.
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:05.880]  I'm not that smart.
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:06.880]  I know that.
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.120]  How can the system not know that?
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:11.960]  Well, remember, they're also playing to an older audience.
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:15.960]  I think younger people are much more open to principled ideas of freedom than older
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:18.080]  people to some degree, to some degree.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.360]  And I think what they're doing is they're playing to an audience that themselves do
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.620]  not understand how widely porous the flow of information has become.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:28.320]  So what they're saying, the people are saying, well, we don't want our kids seeing these
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  second amendment things.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:31.960]  It's like, well, we just, we talked to Facebook and it's taken care of them.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:33.520]  People are like, hey, I'm over 50.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:37.080]  That sounds plausible to me because, you know, when they weren't allowed to show it on TV,
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:39.120]  they wanted to show it on TV and nobody knew about it.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:40.120]  Oh, when it wasn't allowed.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  Yeah.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.800]  Don't they get by banning Super Bowl ads that are pro-gun, by, by, by arresting kids
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.440]  that draw a picture of a gun at school.
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:47.440]  They only make it sexier.
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.120]  Let me tell you, with the liberal trendies, the sexiest thing now is to go square dancing,
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:55.240]  two-stepping, buy guns, become a hillbilly.
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:56.920]  We're actually winning with the young liberals.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:58.400]  They're waking up becoming libertarians.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:17:59.400]  Yeah.
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.120]  I don't know what's going to happen for the power structure because it's not going well.
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.040]  Well, the other thing too is that I think people, the government control of the schools
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:07.760]  have become so complete, so absolute.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.080]  And this started in the 60s when you could no longer fire teachers and it just became
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.680]  so absolute.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:16.720]  And I don't think people really remember or understand that when young people think of
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:19.360]  the state, they think of the school.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.360]  And the experiences they have in the school are so uniformly negative these days.
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.760]  I mean, it was pretty bad when I was in school.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.760]  That was horrible.
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:26.760]  Yeah.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  But it's become even worse now.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.480]  Like, I mean, in the 30 years since I was in high school, I mean, it's become exponentially
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:33.480]  worse.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:36.000]  You know, they're built by the same people who build prisons.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.400]  It's a mind control facility.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400]  Yeah.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.800]  It is a prison.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.640]  It is an actual prison that you're forced to go to.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.760]  And so I think the government is used to this patriotic blah, blah, blah, but teenagers
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:50.280]  now understand that it's the government that runs their lives as teenagers.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:51.800]  It's the government that makes them go to school.
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.480]  And they're rebelling as mommy and daddy now, but the state is their mommy and daddy.
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.000]  They're going to rebel against the state.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  Raised by the state.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.360]  They've been put in state institutions from about the age of three or four onwards.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.640]  And so when the state tells them stuff, all the rebellion that used to go to mom and dad
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:06.480]  in the fifties is now going to the state.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:08.040]  What a beautiful situation to be in.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:13.440]  What a great, fomenting, wonderful lava pool we've got to inject some reason and passion
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:14.720]  into and to wake people up.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.960]  Because for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:17.960]  Yeah.
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:20.000]  Hey, imagine if high school went on forever.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.600]  Well, welcome to the modern government.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:23.000]  You know, boy, if that doesn't make it.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.880]  You know, I have a recurring nightmare that I still have where I'm back in high school.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:29.000]  Do you still have that one where you didn't study for some test?
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  Yeah.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  Yeah.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  Yeah.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.240]  The nightmare is I'm 30 as a senior and I'm like, my God, I'm an idiot.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.680]  I've got to get out of here.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.680]  That's a great line.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:39.680]  Do the rest of the hour with us.
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:40.680]  You got some lunch coming for you.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:44.840]  We're going to come back, I promise, and go to Fred and go to Dave, you've been drill
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:50.000]  troopers and go to Todd, Robert and another Fred and Todd.

[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  Okay.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:01.400]  I'm Alex Jones, Freedom Domain Radio, we'll be right back.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:02.840]  My name is Jessica Arman.

[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:09.560]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:10.560]  our teeth and gums.
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:15.480]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening

[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:38.680]  your family from an armed attack, but is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong

[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:04.280]  The last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:09.760]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:12.760]  Fluoride.
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:20.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  iodine.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:26.920]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:32.440]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:34.560]  Some line iodine is important.
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:41.040]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:46.520]  You'll find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.

[02:07:41.580 --> 02:24:38.680]  in movies and TV, not in the news, and I'm kind of blind because I only focus
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:39.680]  on news.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.000]  I should focus more on the propaganda in films, but that discussion coming up in the next
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.520]  segment after calls.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:47.800]  Fred in Wisconsin, you're a trooper for holding.
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.960]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  Go ahead.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:55.600]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to ask you and your guest, you have an uncanny ability to predict the
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.000]  future based on the events going on right now.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.760]  I see all these young people, California, signing up for these medical marijuana cards,
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:10.960]  and I see it spreading across the United States, and I believe that if legalization
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:16.600]  happens, if it really does come across, that this is going to lead to gun confiscation
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:21.560]  later and that all these databases are being built because it's still against the federal
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:26.520]  law to have a gun and be under the influence of marijuana, regardless of what the states
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:27.520]  say.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.000]  I think it's going to be a big problem, and I didn't get my first gun until I was 25.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:38.080]  So I think it's just going to lead to a future gun confiscation problem, especially if they
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:39.400]  lose all the money.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  Sure, sure.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:43.040]  And I want to be clear about this whole gun issue.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.760]  The guns are important, but the reason we obsess on it is when they come to try to take
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:50.880]  them, it's because they're going to take the First Amendment, the Fourth, the Tenth, everything
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:56.240]  else, which just symbolize rights that were already inalienable and already existed.
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:00.200]  And the point is, is that they go, oh, we're friends, just let us register them, and then
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:02.000]  they always confiscate them.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.160]  And so, yes, undoubtedly the plan is to take our guns, but as Stefon said, so they have
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:08.160]  the monopoly.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.160]  What's a bank robber do when he comes in, he says, hands up, and he takes the gun away
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:12.160]  from the security guard.
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:13.360]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.760]  They're securing what they've hijacked, what they've usurped.
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:21.120]  And I, at an instinctive level, do not want to be usurped, Stefon.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:24.760]  You know that the system is about to crash when they try to grab the guns.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:28.880]  That is always what happens, because when the system crashes, the dependent classes
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.880]  get kind of angry.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.360]  Where's the welfare check, where's the social security check, where my money's being inflated
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.480]  right out of my bank account.
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:36.480]  I can't buy food.
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:38.560]  I mean, this is what happened in Ukraine.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:45.200]  Ukraine, the average GDP per person is like 35 or 100 or $4,000 compared to Poland, which
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:48.080]  is 30 or 40,000, because they got such a corrupt regime.
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.880]  The Arab string was because the price of wheat went up three times.
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.240]  They couldn't afford to eat.
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:57.120]  So when you've got a dependent class, which has been fostered for the last 30 years, when
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:59.960]  you're about to run out of money, you've got to grab those guns.
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:02.160]  Otherwise, you could be facing some significant...
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:03.400]  And I want to explain something.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:08.840]  It is massive centralization that allows runs on banks, that allows starvation, that
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:11.200]  allows deflation, inflate.
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.040]  If you have a truly diverse, free, multi-crop economy, you have some problems, but you
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.040]  just get richer and richer.
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:19.040]  History shows.
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:23.200]  The problem is ever getting to that point where you get government and regulators out
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:28.760]  of your hair and have a virtuous society, then it's like a perpetual motion machine.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:30.000]  But again, then you become decadent.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  It's the same cycle.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  Anything else, Coller?
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.240]  I would just keep my name off that list as long as possible to see what they actually
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.240]  do.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.240]  Well, yeah.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:42.600]  I mean, folks, you can get guns anywhere in the U.S. without getting them through a registration
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  system.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:45.480]  In most areas, it's legal to buy from a private seller.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:46.680]  Me, I'm so prominent.
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.680]  Anyways, I go buy guns in the background, check, why do I care?
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:53.800]  I don't think I even have hardly any guns that I bought from friends or family.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:56.600]  And they can say anything's illegal, too, nitpicking it.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.080]  It's the cops show up and say, you know, you have a gun illegally.
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:00.080]  No, I don't.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.240]  I don't have your, you know, your view that my guns illegal, as my grandpa gave it to
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.240]  me 30 years ago.
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:08.200]  You know, they can frame anything the way they want it to.
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  Yeah.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:14.600]  And I would strongly suggest that it's a great barometer of an economic catastrophe when
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:17.920]  the escalation of gun grabbing goes on.
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.240]  That's the time where you've got to start thinking about whatever savings you got, whatever finances
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:22.240]  you've got.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:23.240]  That's right.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:24.240]  They're going to take everything else when they go for the guns.
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:25.240]  Robert in mass.
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:26.240]  You're on the air.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.240]  It's the canary in the coal mine.
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.240]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.240]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:30.240]  I'm good.
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:31.240]  Go ahead.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:33.120]  I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:36.320]  You're a true American patriot in the spirit of 76 lives on.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  Thank you, brother.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.320]  What's your question or comment?
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:41.880]  Well, my, my question is about the first, the IRS.
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:42.880]  It's not a question.
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:43.880]  That's the point.
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:44.880]  I'm from Massachusetts.
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:47.760]  So we're under a form of Obamacare here already.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:52.440]  And just to back up what you stated, that they are going to go after your bank accounts.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.040]  They are going to go after your tax accounts.
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:56.320]  That's already happening here in Massachusetts.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:00.840]  If you don't cover yourself for the year, when you go to file your taxes, they take
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.240]  it out of your tax account.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:06.520]  My other point is I'm a kind of hands-on guy.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:08.040]  I like to get in people's faces.
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:09.040]  I call senators.
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.040]  I call congressmen on gun control.
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:13.040]  I call CNN.
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.040]  I call them MSNBC.
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:18.760]  Just to let these people know that there are people out there who do care about the Constitution
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  in this country.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.760]  Well, there are a lot of people who care.
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.840]  But you know, the bill, and now the IRS announced last week, they're going to take the money
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:27.960]  under your bank account, and they go, but Obama promised they wouldn't.
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:31.520]  Well, why do they have it in there to take $5,000 out then, if they're not going to
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:32.520]  do it?
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:35.760]  But a politician promised is such a non-argument.
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  I can't believe people call her.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:38.400]  Did she have anything else she wanted to add?
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:42.720]  I just wanted to say, what an excellent guest you have on, and it's like his take on what
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:45.920]  he thinks is going to take three American people to finally have enough.
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:46.920]  That's right.
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.200]  Will there be a big flashpoint or will it be gradual?
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:50.000]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:00.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:04.800]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning
[02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.840]  you and your family's health.
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.560]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:13.960]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:17.160]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:19.200]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:23.880]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.960]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:32.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  your family.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.160]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.760]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent
[02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:45.080]  iodine exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:50.840]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:53.280]  Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:58.520]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.960]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:02.840]  Introducing Pro 1.
[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.520]  All of your filtration in one system, portable on the go.
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:11.080]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:16.520]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:17.520]  acid.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:22.200]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:27.120]  aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one
[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:28.120]  filter element.
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:31.040]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:34.720]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:42.200]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:47.840]  ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:52.080]  by other fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:32:00.680]  Get your Pro Pure with the new Pro 1 filters today at InfowarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:01.680]  The facts are in.
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:03.480]  The studies are legion.
[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.120]  Some fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:10.680]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:14.440]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:15.440]  Simple.
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:19.800]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:24.040]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:25.360]  to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:31.400]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfowarsLife fluoride shield formulation fusing
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:37.080]  six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:41.920]  just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:46.200]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:48.440]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:54.240]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfowarsLife.com today.
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:58.560]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Infowar at the same time.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:11.280]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:27.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.880]  Free domain radio.com is his website, Steffan Mollin, and we're going to continue with your
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:35.960]  phone calls with Todd and everybody else that's holding after we do our review of House of
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:40.640]  Cards that I've not watched yet, but I know this whole global system is a House of Cards
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:43.000]  that when it comes down we don't want to be crushed by.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.240]  That's what this is all about, is putting out our ideas so that when it all collapses
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.200]  people know that we were right and there's an alternative to this system that we've
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:53.600]  been under and we can have a new renaissance, a new enlightenment.
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:59.520]  Before I go any further, we have some amazing specials going right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:05.360]  We have the entire family of Pro Pure, Pro One, 2.0 systems that cut out the fluoride
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:06.480]  that glyphosates.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:11.120]  I carry the Pro Pure systems because it's the best gravity fed stainless steel system
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  out there.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:17.720]  It blows the competition away side by side comparisons and it costs the same or less
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:19.520]  as its leading competitor.
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:25.080]  Pro One available at InfowarsStore.com and stop drinking the Roundup.
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:29.560]  Stop drinking the hydrofluorosilic acid and the BPA and all the crap that's in the water.
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:33.760]  Whether you've got well water, you name it, rain water, you need to filter your water.
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:37.160]  It's a win-win and it funds this operation, our free speech.
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:40.400]  It does tens of thousands of gallons for the smaller filters, even more with the bigger
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.400]  ones.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:45.800]  They've got a pitcher model that is incredibly inexpensive, the same price as a charcoal filter
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:49.800]  that doesn't cut anything out, just flavor, cuts out bits of the taste bed.
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:52.480]  This has filters in it that actually cuts it all out.
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:54.480]  It's just amazing system.
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:56.880]  You know, I didn't sell filters for a couple of years just because I couldn't find them
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:57.880]  that were good enough.
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:01.520]  We'd have customer service complaints, problems, I don't know what was going on, but we carry
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:05.400]  a couple brands, Pro One's the best, that we've gotten great reviews from them that
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:06.400]  I use.
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.040]  We have the Livestraw, the lowest price that we're allowed to advertise it for and your
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:12.160]  purchase makes the transmission possible.
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:21.480]  So all your water filter needs, infowarstore.com or cultural free, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.640]  And we're funding our whole operation here off of the support of viewers like you through
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:30.760]  free association, not a gun to your head like the IRS, taking your money and giving it to
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  state-run media.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:33.320]  We're here saying, hey, we carry great products.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:36.480]  If you believe in them, buy them, if you believe in what we're doing, support us.
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:41.960]  I mean, take the SuperMail Vitality with eight concentrated organic herbs known to help block
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:42.960]  estrogen mimicers.
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:45.000]  I mean, people take it, they're just completely blown away.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.320]  I mean, look at me, I was like a fat slob and I still am somewhat of a job of the hut.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:52.960]  I mean, got a little bit of a pot belly left, folks, but I mean, I've lost a ton of weight.
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:53.960]  Everybody can see it.
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:57.240]  I mean, I'm in here, camera adds 10 pounds to you, but I mean, I'm a bit ready to take
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:35:58.560]  some foes with the shirt off, folks.
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.000]  I've lost a ton of weight and it's giving me the stamina, the energy to do it, along
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:07.720]  with the other great supplements we have at infowarstore.com, 15% off, we're still running
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:10.040]  that special because it's been so popular.
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:15.480]  It's sold out, but more came in infowarstlife.com, it's always on the same store, just that
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:25.000]  just takes you right to it, infowarstlife.com, on infowarstore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.560]  And regardless, when you get the survival shield, the fluoride shield, detoxifier, the
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.000]  SuperMail Vitality, all of it, it funds our operation.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.320]  So you win, period, through free association.
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.560]  That's what it's all about.
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:40.080]  Looking for organic food by buying organic food.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:45.000]  You then displace all the inorganic food to where those people are going bankrupt.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.160]  It's the power of voting with choice, and that's what we rely on and what has sustained us,
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:54.560]  and why the system is trying to wreck the free market, the remnants of it, but still
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:57.760]  empowering civilization and society.
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:02.120]  So you can also call the toll-free number for any questions, or to order via telephone,
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:12.320]  the t-shirts, the books, the films, the Molan lobby, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:16.320]  And when you go over and watch the podcast with Stefan Malau on his site, that's supporting
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:17.320]  the free market of ideas.
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:21.800]  When you pass on his podcast, when you pass on our podcast, when you tell friends and
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:27.440]  family about the different radio shows and books, all of that is little individual actions.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:32.040]  We're not in some vacuum, we're just the kleptocrats and people that think in gang mentality who
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:35.920]  aren't creative and gang up to rob us that are creative.
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:38.920]  We're better than them when we take the field.
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:39.920]  Our ideas win.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  I've experienced it.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:44.720]  There are a lot more articulate, better folks than me out there who just don't have confidence
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:45.720]  in themselves.
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:49.480]  I've been on there 19 years from nowhere, folks, with free association.
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.200]  We reach 3 million people.
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.960]  That's a conservative number every day, and we're growing.
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:59.360]  And freedom is popular, and we can legalize freedom as Ron Paul says.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:01.840]  We can have a debate about what freedom is.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:06.120]  Total anarchic capitalism like Stefan Malau knew, or me just saying, hey, I want my republic
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:07.120]  back.
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:09.080]  It's better than being run by foreign banks.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.200]  Just don't blame the republic as they do for what our society's turned into.
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:15.360]  Now, I'm going to go back to calls, but if you want to comment on voting with our dollars,
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:16.360]  I'd like to get that.
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:22.880]  And then I've never heard such a buzz as about House of Cards and people on the street going,
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:24.360]  it's what you say about them.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:28.680]  I don't know how it's on Netflix, but that shows the model of a Netflix platform five
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:33.040]  years old dominating everything, 100 million viewers a week, that show alone.
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.280]  I keep telling people, don't try to go to Hollywood to be successful.
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:41.360]  Go make your own film with passion, and it'll pay for itself, and the next film will make
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:42.360]  money.
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:46.880]  But so many people just want to go make it and be rich with no passion, and then there'll
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.760]  be a bling-bling hip-hop star, or there'll be a movie star not getting that the journey
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:53.480]  is the destination.
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:39:00.120]  So House of Cards with a 9.0 rating on IMDB almost unheard of, what is your take on this
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:01.120]  phenomenon?
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:03.200]  Well, it's free market art.
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.640]  It's art without a license, because it's coming through Netflix, there's no FCC, there's
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:08.640]  nothing like that.
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.960]  And I had a guy on talking about a good documentary called Divorce Corps about family courts and
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:17.240]  just how unbelievably predation, what predation they have, particularly on the American male
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:18.640]  and the divorce situation.
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:26.240]  And he was pointing out no TV studio can accurately portray judicial corruption, because networks
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:29.480]  are getting sued all the time, and the last thing they want to do is piss off judges,
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:32.360]  because they're going to sit in front of some judge who's going to remember them and judge
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.600]  against them, right?
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:38.440]  So this is Netflix streaming directly through the internet, bypassing the FCC, bypassing
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.280]  the regulators, and so they can put out an honest to goodness portrayal of I think what
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.280]  politics looks like.
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.840]  You compare this to something like the West Wing, which was Aaron Sorkin's drama about
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:53.120]  Democrats in the White House, which was state humping Demo porn from a couple of decades
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:54.120]  ago.
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:56.720]  This is the true face of politics.
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:02.760]  This is the backstabbing, the evil, the monstrosity, the hypocrisy, I mean, it's like Othello
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:07.280]  where you had Iago as the bad guy making Othello into a bad guy, but there's no good guy in
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:08.280]  this whole thing.
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:11.880]  And it's the Democrats, because normally you get left-wing writers if they have to
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:15.320]  portray bad people in politics, they make them Republicans.
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:21.480]  But these are Democrats, and it is showing just how corrupt the system is, how unsustainable
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:27.560]  the system is, and it's not even backroom deals for the sake of any advancing agenda.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.680]  Like it's not like they want to do good things and they have to regretfully do bad things
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:32.520]  to get those good things going.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:36.280]  They only pretend they want to do good things in order to advance their own personal power
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:37.280]  and agenda.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:41.960]  And I think that is an accurate view, and I think it's going to really color and condition,
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:46.520]  particularly young people's view of what it is to be in politics and what the government
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.960]  really looks like from the inside.
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:49.200]  I think it's very powerful.
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:53.320]  As you said it yourself, because I talked to a lot of people that say, man, this is
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.480]  really accurate, and by the way, this is what you're saying about the government, Alex.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:03.000]  It's a sign that the whole wall of Hollywood control is imploding.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.880]  I was talking about this the last few months, and I've had a lot of big Hollywood people
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:11.240]  and rock stars contact me and say, man, you don't know how true what you're saying is.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:13.960]  And I'm out in Hollywood, and I've been to a lot of big A-list parties and stuff back
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:17.560]  when I would even go do that, because now I realize nothing ever really comes of it,
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.560]  so why go out there?
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:21.360]  Because I used to go out there to be on big national TV shows, and that doesn't really
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.240]  do anything, so what's the point?
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:25.920]  But I would go out there, and people weren't liberal.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:27.200]  They weren't conservative.
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:28.360]  They were libertarian.
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:29.880]  They know the systems of fraud.
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:31.400]  They want freedom for their kids.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.920]  They know GMOs bad.
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.240]  They're liberal on some issues, conservative on others, those traditional issues.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.840]  They've all got guns, even if they claim they're anti-gun, because the studio won't put you
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:43.960]  on if you don't toe the line.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.480]  And the few people that would come on my show literally would get called in and told you're
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.560]  never going to work again if you don't stop that.
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:54.000]  If you want to be part of a libertarian group, you've got to be literally in a secret society
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  in Hollywood.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:59.160]  But the truth is, because they haven't let them be libertarian, or what they call conspiracy
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.600]  theorists, people that question known liars, the hottest thing for, I don't know, eight
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:05.600]  years.
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:09.120]  It was about eight years ago, and that's where we're getting invited out there a lot
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:10.120]  by a lot of people.
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.520]  There's just a few folks that were willing to go on the show.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:18.280]  And I'm telling you, across the board, but some of them, like Brad Pitt, or Angelina
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:23.640]  Leigh, that I know woke up and saw my films, and Aaron Russo's, I'll leave it at that,
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:24.640]  and were awake.
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:26.560]  They got freaked out and went and joined the U.N.
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:31.520]  See some of them go, okay, it is all rigged, I will literally go sell out to it.
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:34.840]  Or they argue, well, I'll do more better inside the system.
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:39.880]  But what I'm saying is, the whole facade of Sumner Redstone and all these top lawyers
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:46.040]  and people that I've had meetings with, literally is about keeping people on the plantation
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:52.080]  and mind control to keep Hollywood under the fake liberal progressive authoritarianism.
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:56.520]  The facade is already falling, and they're now figuring out they can go out and say and
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:58.360]  do what they want.
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:03.360]  And I'm telling you, House of Cards, I believe, is then going to be seen as the dam breaking.
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:05.320]  So I want to declare they're dead.
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:10.760]  Hollywood, as the L.A. mayor said a few months ago, is, quote, in an emergency and is bankrupt
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:11.920]  and is in a crisis.
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:13.160]  You bet, it's over.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:14.160]  It's over.
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:16.960]  It's over for them, and mainstream media is over.
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:22.400]  The dinosaur media is over, but the next thing to fully implode, I'm saying, is Hollywood.
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:26.960]  And now they're finally desperate, where Man of Steel is decentralized, anti-eugenics.
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:34.320]  And movies like Nutjob or Antigina 21, now suddenly, or the Lego movie, is libertarian.
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:35.480]  Really.
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:39.360]  Though in their death rows, they're allowing the directors, I've talked to some of them,
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:43.800]  to actually go be pro-liberty, and those are the only films that are making it now.
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:48.080]  So instead of Hollywood just collapsing, they can either collapse or Hollywood can make
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:51.080]  the decision to survive and join with liberty.
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:52.600]  But they've now reached that tipping point.
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:53.600]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:55.360]  Well, they'll follow the dollar.
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:59.840]  This is what you were saying when talking about the products that you sell.
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:03.280]  Everything you subsidize grows, and everything you don't subsidize shrinks.
[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:05.760]  So I mean, in terms of giving money to people, right?
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:08.160]  So whatever you subsidize is going to grow.
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:12.400]  So yeah, if people want libertarian messages, then the people in Hollywood will change to
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:13.640]  reflect that.
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:17.280]  Don't go and spend your money on stuff that promotes a immoral agenda.
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:18.280]  It's very fundamental.
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.280]  You know, you've-
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:20.520]  They've been wagging the dog here.
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:21.680]  It's time for us to wag them.
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:22.680]  You vote with the dollar.
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.480]  I mean, in the house of cards, I'm not going to give any spoilers, so panic about that.
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.520]  The rich guy says to the vice president, you are about to make an enemy of a man with
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:34.560]  $40 billion.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:37.560]  And he says, what do I care about your money?
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:40.640]  I have the guys with all the guns.
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.320]  That is a very powerful statement to come out of mainstream media, or at least this
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:45.920]  mainstream is just going to get.
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:48.040]  That is an incredibly powerful statement to come out.
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.280]  He's saying, I have all the guns.
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:51.280]  That's what government is.
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:52.280]  It's not your protector.
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:53.280]  It's not your savior.
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.800]  It's not the salvation of the poor.
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:55.920]  It's not the healer of the sick.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:58.400]  It's not Jesus walking on water to bring you a donut.
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:00.860]  It is the guys with all the guns.
[02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:01.960]  And that's all it is.
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:03.320]  That's all it's ever been.
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:07.920]  And the fact that it actually has been said to the general public in one of the most popular
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:14.240]  shows to come out in the last year, I have all the guys with the guns shocking.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:18.560]  I mean, it's something I've been saying for like 30 years, and now I can see it actually
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:19.560]  coming out.
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:21.800]  Governments are ganged with a flag.
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:24.840]  They are the disorganized crime.
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:26.440]  Organized crime is the mafia government.
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:27.760]  They're just the better criminals, right?
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.940]  Like the guys who own the banks or the better bank robbers, the guys who run the government
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:33.760]  are the better organized criminals.
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:36.520]  They just, they won and they get to run the show.
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:40.320]  And the fact that it's actually being talked about and there is this complete, it might
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:41.560]  as well be a mob movie.
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:42.960]  And it's incredibly popular.
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:43.960]  Yes.
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:45.040]  It is incredibly popular.
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:49.200]  And even the name of it, House of Cards, it's all about to come down.
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.280]  And what a wonderful thing it has been to be right for 30 years and have the credibility
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.240]  of accurately predicting catastrophe because it's really hard to argue with people who've
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.560]  been saying the non-obvious for 30 years who turn out to be completely right.
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:06.240]  And I think that there's no future in the universe of House of Cards.
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:09.280]  It is all just circling the drain, grab as much as you can.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:13.560]  It's like Indiana Jones, like when the door is coming down, you just grab whatever gold
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.680]  you can stuff in your pockets and try and get out.
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:18.840]  The days are numbered and this is why the anti-gun stuff is so strong.
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:22.240]  Oh, the elites are all running to armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere.
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.920]  They're already running down the Temple hallway with the big rock rolling towards them.
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:29.280]  And they're telling us, be calm though.
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:30.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:32.200]  They don't want us to run for the exits and block their exit.
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  Buy some government bonds.
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200]  It's a really great investment.
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:37.480]  They have bonds in Canada, the 75-year bonds.
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:41.360]  I mean, does anyone seriously think that the system is going to be around in 75 years to
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.920]  pay off that principle?
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:43.920]  It's mad.
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:48.760]  But what does it say that I could produce something like loose change, seen over 150
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:49.760]  million times downloaded?
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:52.280]  I mean, I helped produce those.
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:54.560]  Oh, it was the producer.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:55.560]  That I could make films.
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.080]  I'm not bragging, but literally, I've made films that have been seen 50, 60 million
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:04.440]  times myself, a piece just on YouTube and Google, and I'm nobody.
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.200]  Imagine when that paradigm finally shifts and people realize they don't have to run
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:11.080]  to LA to try to go make their movies.
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:15.080]  When everyone starts making them themselves and all that new talent gets turned loose,
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:16.880]  it's a new renaissance on every front.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:22.480]  I don't think the globalists can stop human progress unless one of their little experiments
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:25.880]  or a war they start ends up killing everybody.
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:31.120]  I just hope that collectively, through individual action, we can block them from blowing the
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:32.120]  planet up.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:33.120]  Well, that's what we have to do.
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.080]  I mean, people ask me, where does the future go?
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:38.440]  The future goes where the most passionate and virtuous people tell it to go.
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  It's up to us.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  It's up to the people.
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:41.440]  I mean, where does the future go?
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:42.440]  It's where I want it to go.
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:43.440]  It's where you want it to go.
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:44.440]  It's where these listeners want it to go.
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:45.440]  That's where the future goes.
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.920]  And my experience was, you know, I struggled through graduate school in Canada, heavily
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:50.920]  socialist country.
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:52.440]  I couldn't master the material.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:57.000]  It was just really hard work trying to get free market voluntary principles to be accepted
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.360]  by academics up in Canada.
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:01.040]  And I tried to publish books.
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:02.040]  I wrote books.
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:03.360]  I've really got great reviews on the books.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:04.880]  Nobody would publish them.
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:05.880]  Now I do.
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:06.880]  I don't have your reach.
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:09.320]  I've got three to four million downloads a month of a philosophy show.
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:10.600]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:12.520]  The fact that I can actually talk to people now.
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:14.960]  Got top philosophers in the world can't get that.
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:17.240]  But you go out in the free market, boom, you win.
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:19.720]  It shows they can't pick the winners.
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:21.080]  Look at, more and more, they can't.
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:22.080]  They're out of bullets.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:24.720]  Look at how they try to make Hillary like a movie star.
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:26.440]  CNN, MSNBC, she's so beautiful.
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:27.440]  She's so glamorous.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.880]  No wonder you're tanking like a lead balloon in the ratings.
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:35.200]  Trying to make Michelle Obama look like a reanimated snapping turtle, you know, how beautiful
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:36.200]  she is.
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:41.360]  I mean, it's literally a bunch of narcissistic criminals, at least the old fashioned kleptocrats
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.360]  knew to stay quiet and shut up and just look stately.
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:48.280]  They actually want to be on red carpets and parade around in front of us in some Edward
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:49.440]  Bernays type deal.
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:50.440]  It's not working.
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:53.080]  No, I think it's better if they don't talk so much.
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:56.120]  You know, it's like that really pretty but dumb girlfriend everyone has at one time in
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  their life or another.
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:00.840]  It's like, I'll introduce you to my friends, if you could just smile and not talk too much,
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:01.840]  that would be excellent.
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:05.360]  Well, I mean, look, it's one thing if scumbag, you know, rock and roll people or whatever
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:09.240]  want to show off with a bunch of women in a jet and bling, people kind of go, oh, that's
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:10.240]  rock stars.
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:11.240]  Or that's hip hop people.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:12.240]  It's still cheesy.
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:16.880]  But when the president and his whole camp followers are strutting around in red carpets
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.360]  and I'm good at killing people and look how sexy my wife is, I mean, it's delusion.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:23.360]  Yeah.
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:29.080]  I mean, don't they know people don't want to look at you in a taxpayer-paid red carpet?
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.240]  We're sick of you.
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:32.520]  Well, but they live in the bubble of privilege, right?
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  They live in the bubble.
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:36.960]  I can't picture what it's like to be on the other side of the gun because, you know, a
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:41.160]  whole life with Isaac Kidd, you know, go to school or you pay your taxes or pay the law,
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:43.880]  you sit this side of the gun, gun pointing straight at you, right?
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:44.880]  Barrel straight at you.
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:48.800]  I can't even imagine what it must be like, Alex, to be on the other side of that gun.
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:50.880]  In other words, people have to watch your show.
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:52.360]  People have to give you money.
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:53.480]  People have to do what you say.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:55.000]  Like I can't imagine, but it must.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.120]  That would be like a woman having sex with me who didn't want to.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:00.120]  That's horrible.
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:03.240]  I mean, we have some compassion, some empathy and all that.
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.720]  Well, no, I mean, the point is I want her to be passionate and like me.
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:09.160]  Like, I want them out of free association.
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:10.400]  The government is raping us.
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.080]  They want to rape us.
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:13.520]  But they want to go back into power.
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:14.520]  This is what it like for me.
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:15.520]  Oh, I know.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:16.520]  But I'm saying they want to make us.
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:17.520]  Oh, I know.
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:18.520]  It's rape.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  It's rape.
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:22.480]  But that's because they know they have nothing of value to add, but their vanity can't accept
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  that.
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:24.480]  So they have to force it on us.
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.680]  For me, being in power, be like, take a wild ferret and up into an aquarium and put it in
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:29.680]  that wild ferret.
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:31.760]  That ferret's going to be like, ah, got to get out.
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:33.760]  I mean, you put me in power for a day.
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  I'm cloying to get out.
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:37.840]  These people work night and day for years to get back into power.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:40.600]  I mean, it's like they're a completely different species.
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:41.760]  And then you study how they live.
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:42.760]  They're actually prisoners.
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:43.760]  In some ways.
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:44.760]  In some ways.
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:45.760]  Yeah.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  Oh, because the bureaucracy is the real power.
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:47.760]  Yeah.
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:48.760]  Yeah.
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:49.760]  And we're going to come in and jam in some phone calls.
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:51.960]  I promise, Todd, you're up next.
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:55.960]  And then, and then, we're going to, there's two tides.
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:58.960]  That's why I'm going to get Todd in Texas and Todd in Canada.
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:00.880]  The two tides straight ahead and many others.
[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:04.840]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:10.520]  Alcovision plasma pH drops optimize pH level and get rid of harmful waste and acid.
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:14.960]  It's a few drops in water, restores vibrance and energy and gets you back in balance.
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.720]  Now order two bottles and get $10 off your order.
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:20.640]  Sign up for monthly auto shipping and save 25%.
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:26.480]  Call 800-518-7615 or visit alkavision.com.
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:27.480]  Alkalize your body.

[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:31.800]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:35.480]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  IRAs?
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:40.440]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:42.040]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:45.480]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:50.360]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:56.160]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.440]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:01.600]  Hi there.
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:02.600]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:06.840]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:13.120]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:17.720]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:22.960]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:25.160]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:29.640]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:30.840]  goes.
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:36.480]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.880]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:42.640]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:44.360]  in the last three months.
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:49.760]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:50.840]  your home.
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:56.480]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:59.480]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:02.880]  The global social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:05.280]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:10.600]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone and other
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:13.880]  hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:18.120]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed
[02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:25.480]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super-male vitality formula sourced from powerful

[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:07.600]  tonight.
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:08.600]  We are talking about the war on men.
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:13.720]  The subject of the new March issue of InfoWars Magazine, Canadian Mounties override civilian
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:19.120]  rule to arbitrarily ban and confiscate firearms that just broke minutes ago at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:23.840]  Go down Maryland to Target and confiscate 110,000 citizens' firearms.
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:24.840]  Video.
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:28.680]  Bloomberg wants to ban free speech on Facebook, unbelievable.
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:31.720]  That is just some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:32.720]  Government.
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:33.720]  Police fund.
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:34.720]  Radar.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:35.720]  Crowd.
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:36.720]  Scanner.
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:37.720]  Detect.
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:38.720]  3D.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:39.720]  Printed weapons.
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:40.720]  We have a gun theme today that just, without even telling my writers, just a theme appears
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:42.040]  of what's happening sometimes.
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:43.040]  Very serious.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:44.040]  Let's jam in some calls.
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:45.040]  Four Stephon Mullen.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.280]  Todd in Texas, then Todd in Canada.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:49.320]  We're on the air, Todd.
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:55.800]  Hey Alex, talk a little bit about the IRS and the veil coming off.
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.840]  I think it came off with a loud thud on the floor, and I don't think anybody even looked
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:02.240]  to see what it was.
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:05.440]  No, I hear you.
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.760]  They declare the fifth when they're committing crimes, but then they don't let us declare
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:11.640]  the fifth in IRS forms, and that's all I could say.
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:14.840]  And the next thing, everyone's saying they want to take your guns.
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:17.720]  I don't believe they want to take your guns at all.
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:18.720]  Not for one minute.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:19.720]  Well, they're trying to confiscate them.
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:20.720]  Remember where they get control?
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:21.720]  They do.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:22.720]  No.
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:23.720]  I believe that's a ruse.
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:26.240]  I believe they don't want to take your guns.
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:32.360]  They want you to use your guns, and then they can blame the economic collapse on you.
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:37.400]  Well, when there is a large economic collapse, it'll be guns that maintain order, like in
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:40.920]  the LA riots when the cops left, so I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.440]  Just before we go to the other Todd, let's talk to Raymond, listening on 1530 a.m. in
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:46.440]  Chicago.
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:47.440]  Raymond, you're on the air.
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:48.440]  Go ahead.
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:49.440]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:56.680]  I was calling in regards to the gun confiscation and them talking about, you know, even using
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:55:58.920]  the word gun for the younger people.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:04.440]  Yeah, that's now a thought crime, according to our dictator, Bloomberg, yes.
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:10.080]  So what are they going to, I mean, then they should outlaw all these shoot them up games
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:11.080]  then.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  Oh, no, no.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:15.720]  They're allowed to have shoot them up games violently on the Super Bowl, but a pro gun
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:19.040]  thing about men protecting their household that doesn't even show a gun, that's banned
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.560]  on the Super Bowl.
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:21.560]  Exactly.
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:23.760]  I don't get their thinking.
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:25.600]  I really don't get their thinking.
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:26.760]  I hear you, brother.
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:32.400]  Talking about the young man that, you know, chewed his pop tart in the shape of a gun.
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.320]  Well, that's in 1984.
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:36.080]  You can be disappeared for even less.
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:40.520]  I mean, so let him get suspended to give the pop tart, look like a gun to somebody else.
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:42.520]  If you see a cloud, it looks like a gun.
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:43.760]  It's over your neighbor's house.
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:44.760]  Arrest them.
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:45.760]  I think that's reasonable.
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.320]  If you are born with a mold in the shape of a submachine gun, you would never see the
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:50.320]  light of day.
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:51.320]  Yeah.
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:52.320]  You just take a meat cleaver out.
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:53.320]  Chop the baby up.
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:54.320]  Absolutely.
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:55.320]  All right.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.320]  Appreciate your call, brother.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:57.320]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:58.320]  Todd in Canada.
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:56:59.320]  You're on the air with Stefan Malinu, our guest.
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:00.320]  Gentlemen, how are you doing today?
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.320]  I just want to touch base.
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:06.560]  You started off this segment about the gun ban in Canada, it's the Swiss style classic
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:11.040]  green and what it is is the RCMP have just banded it without going through the proper
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:12.040]  channels and whatnot.
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:15.400]  Now, what I've done is I started the YouTube channel and I've started speaking out against
[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  it.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:20.840]  This morning, I called the head office for the firearms registry here in Canada and
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:27.480]  I videotape to the encounter and I put it on YouTube and I told them I was very nice
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:32.040]  to her, you know, ask my questions, but she couldn't answer any of them and I was just
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:33.920]  basically said, okay, thanks very much.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:37.240]  Just so you know, I'm going to put this on YouTube and have a nice day.
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:39.520]  My phone rang 20 minutes later.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:42.240]  She called and she said, have you put that on YouTube yet?
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:45.440]  And it was slow to load and it was in the process and I just said, yeah, I'd put it
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:48.120]  on YouTube and she said, well, you're going to have to take that down because you didn't
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:49.120]  have my permission.
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:53.400]  At that point, I informed her that she is a public servant and then I do not need her
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:54.400]  permission.
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:59.120]  I encourage all Canadians to call the registry office and voice their concerns.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  Absolutely.
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:03.800]  Now, I've been following this in Canada where they're lawlessly just reclassifying guns
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:06.480]  and that they've registered and confiscating them.
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:08.360]  And this is happening everywhere, Stephon.
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:09.360]  This is really getting serious.
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:12.880]  Well, you know, and this is the example of what we've been talking about, different rules
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:13.880]  for them than for you.
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:18.560]  You see, they can bypass legal procedures to take your guns, but if you tape a call without
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:22.320]  that permission, that's wrong because you don't have their pay, even though if you
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:25.120]  announce it in their public servant, I know about Canadian law, same as ours.
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  You can do it.
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:29.160]  Hey, I tell you what, caller, plug your YouTube channel.
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:31.320]  I want to look at that and add it to our article if it's good.
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:32.320]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:33.320]  It's Awaken Canada.
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:34.320]  It's a new channel.
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:35.320]  It's not pretty.
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:36.320]  I've just started.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:37.320]  It's okay.
[02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:38.320]  Awaken Canada on YouTube.
[02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:39.320]  We'll look it up.
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:40.320]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:41.320]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:58:41.320 --> 02:58:42.320]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:43.320]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:43.320 --> 02:58:44.320]  infowars.com, port slash show.
[02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:50.680]  You can find free audio, video, feeds, podcasts, spread those podcasts, folks.
[02:58:50.680 --> 02:58:54.640]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:59.760]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:03.840]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:08.160]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:08.160 --> 02:59:13.480]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:19.880]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:24.960]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:27.120]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:27.120 --> 02:59:31.400]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:34.160]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:34.160 --> 02:59:38.840]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:41.920]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:48.600]  my favorite coffee.
[02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:50.600]  At infowarslife.com.
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:28.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:43.600]  All right, folks, final segment of Stefon Malonew, our guest here, talking about the
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:47.480]  future of the world, our current state, and we're done with calls now in the five minutes
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  we've got here.
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:52.960]  I want to thank you for coming in, spending time with us, Stefon, getting into the war
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:55.840]  on males briefly, but first, you wanted to make a point.
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:01:01.680]  Yeah, I just really wanted to tell people that the government's escalation of its power
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.360]  is absolutely not going to stop until we stop it, right?
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:07.840]  It is going to continue to grow.
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:10.200]  It is like somebody wildly addicted to some substance.
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:12.720]  They need an intervention in a weird kind of way.
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:15.800]  You can do it out of love for the people on the other side of the gun, you know, take
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:17.920]  the gun away from them gently because it's not good for them.
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:21.880]  Like that great scene in the DeBranda movie on the waterfront where he takes that gun
[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:26.240]  away from his brother gently and tenderly who's there to kill him and all.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.720]  And we just have to take this power away from people.
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.720]  It's bad for them.
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:31.560]  It's toxic for society as a whole.
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:32.560]  They're addicts.
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:33.680]  You know, what do you do with somebody who's addicted?
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:37.360]  You try and take that substance away from them so that they can get their heads clear.
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:38.360]  It's not going to stop.
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  There's nothing.
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:42.600]  And I've noticed with narcissism, power addiction isn't just in government.
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:45.600]  Either people are getting more enlightened or they're going on weird power trips.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:46.600]  Yeah.
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:48.600]  And I'm invincible.
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:49.600]  You're going to do what I say.
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:50.600]  Yeah.
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:51.600]  I'm right because I'm me.
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:54.320]  And, you know, we have to, you know, whether it's lovingly or assertively or even aggressively,
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:56.720]  we have to just take away this power from these people.
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:59.880]  It is so destructive to humanity as a whole.
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:01.400]  And they can't do it themselves.
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:04.680]  The only people who get that kind of power are people who are addicted and want more
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:06.320]  of it no matter what.
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:10.240]  I know some of your views on this, but our current issue of the magazine is all about
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:15.120]  the chemicals, the food, the water, the culture, every TV show, bad-mouthing fathers, men.
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:16.680]  What is the war on men about?
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:19.080]  I guess the state wants to be the daddy now.
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:20.080]  Yeah.
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:22.800]  I mean, the more that the government can break the bonds between men and women, the more
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:26.080]  that they can make women dependent on the state and guarantee future votes from them
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:27.080]  and their children.
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:28.720]  And Bernays wrote books on that and that's public policy.
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:32.320]  And this has been a Marxist, leftist, progressive policy for hundreds of years.
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:34.560]  They've done a great job with the family courts and everything.
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:35.560]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:38.120]  I mean, more money flows through the family courts and all the other courts put together.
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:41.120]  The average divorce cost $50,000.
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:44.840]  And in other areas of the world, like in some of the Scandinavian countries, you just write
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:48.120]  something in and send it off and you're divorced in six months.
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.280]  And the no-fault divorce, divorce used to be a contract, the most serious contract in
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:56.680]  the world, much more important than your cell phone contract, which you can't break.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:00.480]  And in, it was Reagan in the 60s in California, brought in the no-fault divorce.
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:05.560]  You used to actually prove, you had to prove abuse or infidelity to get divorced before.
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:07.960]  And now you can just get divorced because you want to.
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:12.880]  The majority of divorce is 60, 70% initiated by women for dissatisfaction, for reasons
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:13.880]  of dissatisfaction.
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:17.600]  And what you realize is the really cool thing to do, the truth is statistically, it's literally
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:19.240]  turning us into animals.
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:22.920]  It's destroying the human unit and the children are now the wards of the state.
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:24.720]  And the women are the tarts of the state.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:25.720]  Yeah.
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:31.080]  And so basically, the government is now stepped into the provider role that used to be inhabited
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:32.160]  by the male.
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:35.480]  And therefore the women have now changed their allegiance towards status and which is why
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:39.960]  more women vote Democrat and why there's good statistical studies that show that the increase
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:43.960]  in state power accelerated significantly after giving women the vote.
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:47.040]  Again, not that giving the women the vote is bad or anything, but the inevitable result
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:48.040]  was ever Bernays.
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:49.960]  They said, you have our feminist smoke cigarettes.
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:50.960]  The women will smoke them.
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:51.960]  Yeah.
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:52.960]  I mean, they just have been preying on women.
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:53.960]  Yeah.
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.800]  And statistically, women on every metric are going to hell in a handbasket.
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:59.360]  And there's so other sons and daughters and so are the men.
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:02.920]  Well, it's so devastating victory for the new world order and incredibly destructive.
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:08.560]  You know, the there's no single worse predictor of a negative outcome for a child than becoming
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:11.040]  from a single mother household or a single parent household.
[03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:12.160]  It's worse than race.
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:13.240]  It's worse than gender.
[03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:14.800]  It's worse than than demography.
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:17.000]  It's worse than socioeconomic status.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:22.320]  But they advertised it in all the women's magazines and shows as like a new set of clothes.
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:24.840]  It is the sexy, cool thing to do.
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:25.840]  Yeah.
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:26.840]  And it is incredibly destructive for children.
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:30.600]  It's one thing to get divorced and it is liberating to sit out and go and do whatever
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:31.600]  you want.
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:32.600]  Yeah.
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:35.840]  But, but, but you had kids and now statistically it's going to wreck their life.
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:36.840]  And now we have to pay.
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:38.880]  You don't care because you're a state run Jezebel.
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:39.880]  Yeah.
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:41.560]  And we have to pay that we have to pay the price for them becoming criminals.
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:44.280]  It's everyone else who suffers when these kids get out into society.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:47.120]  Blacks had 10% in legitimacy before the great society.
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:48.120]  It's now 90%.
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:49.120]  Yeah.
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:50.120]  And whites are right online.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:51.120]  It's the same deal.
[03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:52.120]  Totally wrecked.
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:53.760]  Just running around completely collapsed.
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:54.760]  End of civilization.
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:55.760]  Yeah.
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:57.840]  Growth of the state is the end of the family and vice-versa.
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:04:58.840]  But it's trendy.
[03:04:58.840 --> 03:04:59.840]  Yeah.
[03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:00.840]  But it's trendy.
[03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:06.840]  Yeah.
