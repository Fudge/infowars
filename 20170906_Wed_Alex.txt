[00:00.000 --> 00:16.800]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:16.800 --> 00:25.280]  There's a reason every ancient culture believed in God. It's because they
[00:25.280 --> 00:29.800]  noticed a lot of things going on they couldn't explain and they saw rhythm
[00:29.800 --> 00:38.080]  in wars and in feast and in famine and they saw patterns in the stars and in
[00:38.080 --> 00:45.000]  the heavens and in volcanoes and storms and earthquakes and we're entering one of
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.880]  those times now where the Pacific Rim is the most volcanically active as it's
[00:50.880 --> 00:59.400]  been recorded in modern history the last 300 years or so we see now the storm
[00:59.400 --> 01:06.680]  cycle for typhoons and hurricanes in the Atlantic and Pacific going from being
[01:06.680 --> 01:13.740]  very very tepid the last decade or so to now not just developing a storm like
[01:13.740 --> 01:20.080]  Harvey but still wreaking havoc in its aftermath but Irma now the strongest
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.800]  hurricane ever recorded for its miles per hour over 180 miles an hour a
[01:26.800 --> 01:33.040]  category 5 is 150 to 160 they've never recorded something that should be a
[01:33.040 --> 01:39.040]  category 6 they've got to expand now and officially call this a category 6 but
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.680]  they'll do that after the storm they're not going to sit there and quibble over
[01:43.680 --> 01:49.560]  what rating it is during the storm but it is official that meteorologists are
[01:49.560 --> 01:59.600]  saying this is a category 6 over 180 mile an hour winds we're going to have
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.480]  total coverage at info wars.com news wars.com here on the radio and
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.200]  television free feeds and info wars.com for us show and our own Quentin
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.440]  Carter has a family his wife lives part-time in Florida he's gonna be
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.840]  traveling back there to take care of his house and dogs and cover things for
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.080]  us and I'm gonna find out who wants to draw straws around here and go to
[02:22.080 --> 02:25.120]  Florida because if you look at the tracks that we'll get to when we come
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.960]  back after break of the the hurricane tracks for Wednesday the 6th of day of
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.840]  September 2017 most the tracks slam right in the middle of Florida and then go
[02:36.840 --> 02:42.000]  rampaging straight up and they've gotten good with these computers it may go up
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.480]  the east coast instead it may go across Florida and right back into
[02:45.480 --> 02:51.320]  Mississippi Louisiana or Texas I don't wish the storm obviously upon anybody
[02:51.320 --> 02:55.560]  but Paul Watson just went off he was on earlier with David Knight for the real
[02:55.560 --> 03:05.680]  news syndicated transmission that is going out from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and he
[03:05.680 --> 03:09.360]  was just breaking down the news article that's up on info wars.com and
[03:09.360 --> 03:15.520]  PrisonPlanet.com right now where the left is claiming the name of Irma is
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.680]  sexist and they're claiming it's racist and that maybe Trump's causing it
[03:20.680 --> 03:26.640]  deranged leftist think Trump is creating racist hurricanes
[03:29.800 --> 03:34.160]  deranged leftist think Trump is creating racist hurricanes I'm gonna grab a
[03:34.160 --> 03:40.280]  clip about 40 after last hour when Paul was on with David Knight we're gonna play
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.800]  that coming up because he goes over the of the article but I'm gonna cover it
[03:44.800 --> 03:52.720]  when we come back from break as well but Irma is steaming along and only about
[03:52.720 --> 04:02.000]  five miles an hour with forward motion towards the Bahamas towards Cuba towards
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.200]  Hispaniola and then scheduled to slam right in to Florida now it's going in
[04:09.200 --> 04:20.280]  circles at over 180 miles an hour and if something like that was to hit Florida
[04:20.280 --> 04:24.800]  it would create devastation this country has never seen but you notice the Lord
[04:24.800 --> 04:32.320]  works in mysterious ways because Harvey brought people together and I think this
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.120]  will bring people together wherever it hits but it's gonna be serious they've
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.320]  already cleaned off store shelves across Florida and many other areas
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.520]  Amazon's been caught gouging people on storeable foods water filtration that's
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.680]  why we are lowering the prices again to the lowest level we've ever had them I'm

[11:08.320 --> 11:15.360]  live with yours truly Alex Jones deranged leftists think Trump is creating
[11:15.360 --> 11:22.320]  racist hurricanes and they're also I have a CNN club here we're gonna play
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.720]  coming up I shouldn't laugh this is so serious where they say oh people don't
[11:27.720 --> 11:32.840]  take names serious like Irma it's a woman they only take things serious like
[11:32.840 --> 11:39.640]  Harvey well a that's not true and there's no evidence but B they didn't
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.000]  take Harvey serious because the Democrat mayor told her by just stay at
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.560]  home it wasn't gonna hit the city and they ignored the governor they made it a
[11:47.560 --> 11:53.320]  partisan issue and Houston's a Democrat city now it's a blue city Austin and
[11:53.320 --> 11:58.200]  Houston are blue now and the Democrats are so done they cheered and said how
[11:58.200 --> 12:05.960]  great kill all the rednecks kill all the Nazis magazine covers newspaper covers
[12:05.960 --> 12:13.040]  professors you all saw it it's crazy it's voodoo and now they're saying oh my
[12:13.040 --> 12:18.520]  gosh Florida's got liberals in it so this is the act of God against Trump of
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.480]  course they also said it was an act of God against Texas and they said it was
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.280]  global warming the Texans didn't accept the carbon tax a few years ago and we
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.480]  fought it so it's our fault yes and we just paid Al Gore money everything be
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.080]  fine deranged leftist think Trump is creating racist hurricanes Trump
[12:39.080 --> 12:43.080]  derangement syndrome has worsened to the point where hysterical haters of the
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.160]  president are now seriously claiming that Trump is responsible for creating
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.680]  racist hurricanes yes really hurricane Katrina hurricane Harvey hurricane
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.720]  Irma the government will manipulate the weather to exterminate blacks even if
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.760]  they have to kill whites tweeted a writer for complex as that's a major
[13:01.760 --> 13:10.360]  publication I can't believe Trump sexist and racist head ass is letting Irma and
[13:10.360 --> 13:16.360]  Jose run a hurricane train on America wrote one Twitter user and there are
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.800]  thousands of these tweets I can't believe Trump sexist and racist head ass
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.720]  whatever that means is it possible that Trump has a hurricane making machine
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.280]  that pushes the news off his racist decisions now you can think this is all
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.240]  deranged even though there's hundreds of pages of it linked to in this article
[13:34.240 --> 13:42.480]  but it's not this is not just people online CNN commentators are bemoaning
[13:42.480 --> 13:49.760]  like let's play that clip first CNN reporters are bemoaning so are MSNBC
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.920]  hosts so are MPR hosts I have all the clips right here saying that it's too
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.320]  bad these hurricanes are coming because it's knocking the Russia investigation
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.000]  out of the headlines and it's knocking the whole Confederate statue issue out
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.160]  of the headlines oh you can't race bait like you could in it you you see all
[14:09.160 --> 14:12.960]  the images of white people saving minorities and minority saving white
[14:12.960 --> 14:19.280]  people and oh the census is out white people and Christians now a minority in
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.440]  many areas of the country and Christians are a minority in many areas so we're
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.320]  gonna be getting to all that survey white Christians are now a minority of
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.440]  US population as the globalists intensify their war on Christians but
[14:33.440 --> 14:39.480]  here it is this is a mark dice report MSNBC idiot complains Houston flood
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.560]  stopped Russia collusion coverage here it is
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.520]  hurricane Irma is currently headed towards Florida and is reportedly one of
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.000]  the largest hurricanes ever recorded let's check in with CNN the most trusted
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.400]  name in this to get some updates female hurricanes are deadlier than male
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.320]  hurricanes study says what the hell is this apparently sexism isn't just a
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.880]  social problem if you're the path of a hurricane gender bias might actually
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.520]  kill you a study suggests people prepare differently for hurricanes depending
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.280]  on whether the storm has a male or female name this is a real story by the
[15:15.280 --> 15:19.240]  way this is not satire I have to tell you this because it's impossible in most
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.920]  cases to tell whether or not something is actually being reported from CNN or
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.520]  whether it's on Saturday night live feminine named hurricanes versus
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.800]  masculine named hurricanes cause significantly more deaths apparently
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.640]  because they lead to a lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.640]  in other words a hurricane named Priscilla probably wouldn't be taken as
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.000]  seriously as a hurricane named Bruno which might spark more fear and prompt
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.320]  more people to flee no no they're not nobody would even take that way nobody
[15:49.320 --> 15:52.920]  would even suspect that there's any correlation except some more to take gender
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.280]  studies college professor who decided to look into this just listen to this their
[15:57.280 --> 16:01.520]  study suggests that changing a severe hurricane's name from Charlie to Alois
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.240]  could nearly triple its death toll for severe thorns we're taking protective
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.200]  action would have the greatest potential to save lives the masculinity
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.880]  femininity of a hurricane's name predicted its death toll the study said
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.280]  this is one of the millions of reasons we say liberalism is a mental
[16:18.280 --> 16:23.000]  disorder it's not a joke it's a scientific fact okay enough with CNN
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.200]  let's check in with the Washington Post maybe they're reporting on some real
[16:26.200 --> 16:31.000]  news for a change wait what's this we should stop putting women in jail for
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.240]  anything it sounds like a radical idea stop incarcerating women and close down
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.760]  women's prisons but in Britain there's a growing movement to do just that the
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.200]  argument is actually quite straightforward there are far fewer women in
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.340]  prison than men to start with women make up just seven percent of the prison
[16:48.340 --> 16:52.920]  population this means that women are disproportionately affected by a system
[16:52.920 --> 16:56.680]  designed for men this is another real story from the Washington Post by the
[16:56.680 --> 17:00.320]  way this isn't on the onion but could the women's presence actually be
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.000]  eliminated in the United States where the rate of women's incarceration has
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.680]  risen by 646% in the past 30 years the context is different but many of the
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.880]  arguments are the same what kind of arguments could there be maybe we should
[17:14.880 --> 17:17.880]  check some international news let's see what's going on with our friends over
[17:17.880 --> 17:22.120]  across the pond in England and check out the BBC wait a minute what's this the
[17:22.120 --> 17:26.600]  tube meaning the subway is to change their ladies and gentlemen announcements
[17:26.600 --> 17:30.120]  London's underground staff have been told all right see the full report at
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.240]  mark dice calm and we also have it posted on news wars dot com let's go to
[17:34.240 --> 17:39.280]  another one of his excellent reports MSNBC idiot complains Houston flood
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.320]  stopped Russia collusion report we we we just played the one where they again
[17:45.320 --> 17:50.080]  are saying that because it's the name Irma it's sexist because people again
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.960]  don't take those as seriously then we have the report deranged left to stink
[17:53.960 --> 17:58.560]  Trump is creating racist hurricanes that is again on info wars dot com but here
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.360]  is the one I was mentioning MSNBC idiot complains Houston flood stopped
[18:03.360 --> 18:06.960]  Russia collusion coverage as you know the devastating flooding of Houston has
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.480]  been dominating the news for the last week and the liberal media are quite
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.440]  upset about it and anxious to get back to beating the dead horse that they've
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.720]  been hitting for the last nine months their Russia Trump conspiracy theories
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.080]  here's MSNBC's Malcolm Nance let me tell you something if we didn't have a
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.920]  hurricane this week that letter between Felix Seder and Cohen would be
[18:27.920 --> 18:35.080]  considered the bridge between Trump's own personal desires and the Kremlin
[18:35.080 --> 18:39.240]  kept throwing all of their effort behind him we'd be talking impeachment this
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.920]  week you idiots have been talking about impeachment every day since President
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.960]  Trump was sworn into office back in January so much so that even Nancy
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.760]  Pelosi is telling you to stop because you're looking like morons here's
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.920]  Sanders little Brian Stelter assured his audience that they haven't forgotten
[18:53.920 --> 18:57.680]  about the Trump Russia conspiracy theories and promising to keep coming up
[18:57.680 --> 19:02.200]  with more is the Trump and Russia story over like the biggest stars on Fox News
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.680]  claim that's the subject of my essay today is it over or is it very much
[19:06.680 --> 19:10.680]  ongoing because the experts say it's very much ongoing all right let's stop
[19:10.680 --> 19:16.680]  right there who are the experts the experts are Mueller and a bunch of people
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.480]  appointed by Democrats who completely ignore all the massive crimes of the
[19:20.480 --> 19:24.200]  Clintons and Obama but Stelter just lied to you because it turns out a week
[19:24.200 --> 19:29.560]  ago this has come out today via the Daily Caller it's confirmed by CNN and the
[19:29.560 --> 19:34.200]  New York Times CNN pulled investigative team off Trump Russia coverage and is
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.320]  basically curtailing it because they've been caught producing fake news and are
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.800]  facing a whole bunch of different lawsuits that story is up on info wars.com
[19:42.800 --> 19:47.840]  as well so you read into the meat of the story they are pulling and killing
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.600]  their major investigations out of DC and other areas because they've been proven
[19:52.600 --> 19:57.000]  to be engaged in fake news reportage and the sources are saying they never said
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.160]  what CNN said they said you want to save money in a place that gives you
[20:01.160 --> 20:06.120]  growth control and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk and you

[24:25.320 --> 24:34.840]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen if you're watching us on television we've
[24:34.840 --> 24:45.600]  got on screen a composite of radar satellite and ocean buoys to show what's
[24:45.600 --> 24:51.400]  happening with the air the water the wind the precipitation and you can see
[24:51.400 --> 24:59.680]  how incredibly gigantic the storm is that is at over 180 miles an hour when
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.240]  US weather aircraft flew through it earlier today breaking any record by
[25:05.240 --> 25:09.600]  more than 10 miles an hour it is a category 6 but there's no such category
[25:09.600 --> 25:13.680]  yet there will be a new category now understand they've only been having
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.800]  categories for hurricanes and typhoons and things the last 60 70 years or so
[25:17.800 --> 25:21.240]  they've only been flying through these since the end of World War 2 so the
[25:21.240 --> 25:25.880]  environmentalists are gonna say pay us carbon taxes or the monsters not gonna
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.840]  spit the sun back up they're gonna use the voodoo to push all this if the US
[25:30.840 --> 25:34.800]  cut all its carbon we would have more carbon dioxide put out because China
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.640]  doesn't even have scrubbers on their plants so again carbon taxes is voodoo
[25:39.640 --> 25:45.880]  because it's all about taxing human activity and taxing carbon dioxide that's
[25:45.880 --> 25:49.720]  not even linked to all of this so we've always had hurricanes we've always had
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.360]  typhoons before they had names we've always had earthquakes we've always had
[25:53.360 --> 25:59.440]  volcanoes but undoubtedly in our lifetimes in modern times since satellites
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.840]  have been pointed at hurricanes and since aircrafts have been flying through
[26:03.840 --> 26:09.760]  them and since they've been measured this is the mother of all blows as they
[26:09.760 --> 26:17.200]  call it in the old British Navy and it is definitely going to be devastating
[26:17.200 --> 26:23.560]  cross your fingers and hope that it turns widely and goes up into the main
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.120]  North Atlantic but that doesn't look like that's gonna happen looks like it's
[26:27.120 --> 26:33.200]  gonna run over the Dominican Republic it's gonna run over Cuba and turn right
[26:33.200 --> 26:40.280]  into Florida and if it's still a category five or six when it hits there's
[26:40.280 --> 26:43.960]  hardly anything standing when that ends up happening you'll have buildings that
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.840]  are completely gutted that are concrete and steel everything blown out both
[26:47.840 --> 26:53.120]  sides there'll be husk that have to be completely rebuilt maybe the elevator
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.400]  shafts will still be intact so this is what it's like to live on a planet
[26:58.400 --> 27:05.440]  always going through change just last week they asked 50 Nobel Prize winners
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.320]  for science whether they thought humanity would end up surviving and most
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.360]  of them said they didn't think we would and they listed right up there amongst
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.800]  the crises we face natural disasters but Elon Musk has come out there's a
[27:17.800 --> 27:27.320]  Hill article and thinks AI race could ignite World War three and then he goes
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.560]  through how he thinks that could happen that's on the heels of Putin we
[27:32.560 --> 27:39.080]  actually have a translation of this into English of what Putin said Putin says
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.080]  the nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world I say if we keep
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.760]  letting this AI race continue chances are it's can end up triggering some type
[27:48.760 --> 27:55.800]  of mass crisis or it's going to basically make humans obsolete which is what
[27:55.800 --> 28:01.920]  the globalists admit they're deploying AI to begin with Tesla CEO Elon Musk is
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.080]  warning that the race to develop artificial intelligence could be the main
[28:05.080 --> 28:10.040]  cause for igniting a third world war dismissing North Korea's nuclear
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.360]  missile program as a serious threat relative to AI technology China Russia
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.200]  soon all countries strong computer science come competition for AI
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.960]  superiority at national security level most likely will cause World War three
[28:23.960 --> 28:27.880]  in my opinion must set in a series of tweets Monday let's go ahead and play
[28:27.880 --> 28:38.760]  that clip from Putin
[28:38.760 --> 29:04.000]  he's on to say that monopoly of any one nation would not be a good thing and
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.320]  Russia will share the technologies we have two other clips coming up where we
[29:10.320 --> 29:16.000]  do have Putin doing a breakdown of some of these issues dealing with North
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.160]  Korea and dealing with putting sanctions on Russia and the United States
[29:20.160 --> 29:23.920]  asking for help in North Korea he says is ridiculous we'll play those when we
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.960]  come back and those do have subtitles but also do have a translation but you
[29:28.960 --> 29:32.760]  can read the full transcripts of what Putin had to say basically anywhere by
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.520]  search engineering and Putin says the nation that leads in AI will be the
[29:37.520 --> 29:44.000]  ruler of the world we'll be right back I'm Alex Jones please stay with us

[34:00.440 --> 34:11.040]  on as well Sarnovich is here producing his film titled hoaxed and he's put out
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.000]  the feature link film on free speech being attacked silenced so that'll
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.320]  certainly be informative with Mike Sarnovich in studio with us coming up
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.680]  here in just a moment it is so sickening to watch the Democratic Party
[34:26.680 --> 34:32.720]  establishment the corporate media and their ne'er do well loser followers
[34:32.720 --> 34:41.200]  grovel like beetles on their backs or a turtle in the sun on its back trying to
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.680]  bring down Trump trying to stop a renaissance trying to kill the recovery
[34:47.680 --> 34:55.080]  and getting more and more shrill and more and more desperate and trying to
[34:55.080 --> 35:03.880]  project on to everything in reality everything in creation to some type of
[35:03.880 --> 35:10.160]  racial or cultural oppression so that the very atmosphere in which we live is
[35:10.160 --> 35:18.400]  one of cultural division they are trying to brain damage the public into total
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.240]  political correctness they know it's mentally ill they know it's ridiculous
[35:23.240 --> 35:33.400]  to remove a ESPN longtime commentator because his name is Robert Lee who just
[35:33.400 --> 35:38.120]  so happens to be Asian it'd be okay if his name was Robert Lee and he was from
[35:38.120 --> 35:49.400]  Georgia it sounds crazy to ban college campus names or facility names dorm
[35:49.400 --> 35:55.320]  names study hall names from the Irish last name Lynch but it's being done
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.720]  because they want to signify that the mental illness has power and they want
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.040]  to give the powerless victims of political correctness some semblance of
[36:04.040 --> 36:10.720]  power some semblance of ritualistic gravitas where if they complain and say
[36:10.720 --> 36:20.920]  we don't like Martin Luther King he didn't mention trannies term didn't exist
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.480]  then well he must hate him so take down his statue take down his mural at major
[36:25.480 --> 36:33.000]  colleges and it's done because it's about a religion of pulling down
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.360]  information tongue-and-cheek Jack Pasobak went out and said take down your
[36:38.360 --> 36:44.520]  linen statue here in Seattle and the mayor said yes we will take it down to
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.000]  we'll take everything down that's offensive you take down everything
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.720]  that's offensive there'll be nothing left and the people running around
[36:52.720 --> 37:00.960]  demanding they police what's offensive will be your new gods the information
[37:00.960 --> 37:11.160]  police and that's what they are so they're gonna say it's racist they're
[37:11.160 --> 37:13.680]  gonna say the name of its racist they're gonna say Trump created it with
[37:13.680 --> 37:21.280]  weather weapons they're already saying that and they're going to misrepresent
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.520]  what I say on the subject but you can search engine been living stent weather
[37:25.520 --> 37:34.480]  weapons the father of weather weapons ten years ago it was declassified that
[37:34.480 --> 37:41.400]  Ben Livingston was the first man to fly a aircraft into a hurricane and into a
[37:41.400 --> 37:47.600]  typhoon he flew into storms with 170 mile an hour plus winds back then only
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.480]  typhoons went that fast in the Pacific they could get going even quicker
[37:51.480 --> 37:55.840]  hurricanes turned the opposite direction and only get up to about 165
[37:55.840 --> 38:03.240]  before Irma is at 180 plus and they were able to take clear blue skies and 15
[38:03.240 --> 38:08.000]  aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh trail in Vietnam and put 10 feet of water on it
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.080]  in one day using just 15 aircraft in 1967 the Stanford Research Institute
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.600]  secretly certified they could create hurricanes steer hurricanes make them
[38:22.600 --> 38:27.840]  stronger or kill them and so many people do ask the question why aren't we
[38:27.840 --> 38:35.320]  seeing weather modification to stop hurricanes well there's a 1979 treaty on
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.680]  weather modification and it says if you do it on mass scale you've got to get
[38:39.680 --> 38:42.960]  agreement at the UN because those weather patterns end up affecting your
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.600]  neighbors and others in a chain reaction that even computer modeling can't
[38:46.600 --> 38:52.560]  understand but the Chinese are engaged in water in a weather modification the
[38:52.560 --> 38:56.560]  Russians are doing it Dubai's doing it it's in their newspapers they don't hide
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.480]  it that they use jet aircraft spring but also weather modification towers on the
[39:01.480 --> 39:04.960]  ground sending up electromagnetic radiation that resonates with the
[39:04.960 --> 39:11.640]  barium salts aluminum dioxide and other systems and actually then it causes the
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.320]  nuclei to resonate so it's more attractive to water molecules forming
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.560]  precipitation now when I cover this issue they never want to actually discuss
[39:22.560 --> 39:28.400]  it so they'll always say Jones says Obama sent the tornado that hit Oklahoma
[39:28.400 --> 39:33.640]  City a caller called and said couldn't Obama have sent this and I said ma'am
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.960]  they do have weather weapons they can control hurricane groups and a tornado
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.000]  groupings things like that and I pushed her towards the weather channel that
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.480]  reported on it after we did after Livingston came on the the damn broke
[39:48.480 --> 39:52.040]  because they just declassified some of it I tried to get him on six months later
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.640]  and he was threatened by the government he and his son-in-law owned and own a
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.040]  large he was 90 something years old when I talked to him I couldn't find out this
[40:01.040 --> 40:04.280]  morning trying to call him and stuff if he's even still alive we should look
[40:04.280 --> 40:11.360]  into that but if he is he's over 100 tough guy though still flying missions
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.200]  daily when he wasn't taken off in weather modification for contracts for ski
[40:16.200 --> 40:24.960]  resorts you name it but that's micro manipulation not macro and so yes this
[40:24.960 --> 40:30.160]  stuff exists but you have to understand it's all classified it's all secret we
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.240]  don't know so I'm not saying Trump created it so there'll be a disaster so
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.520]  we can all have unity like the Democrats on CNN and MSNBC are saying
[40:39.520 --> 40:42.880]  they're actually saying we think Trump might have created this with weather
[40:42.880 --> 40:49.600]  weapons all I've ever said is they have these systems they're very classified and
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.200]  you know that there are massive rogue groups in the government in the CIA the
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.360]  FBI in DARPA in the Department of Energy that's over the weather
[40:59.360 --> 41:12.880]  modification to a great extent and that we should investigate whether something's
[41:12.880 --> 41:21.200]  being done by these agencies that Trump doesn't even know about think about that
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.240]  because if Trump doesn't know what people two levels below him are doing if
[41:25.240 --> 41:31.240]  Trump doesn't know they're going on TV his own head of economic policy or his
[41:31.240 --> 41:34.760]  own Secretary of State if he doesn't even know that they're going on shows and
[41:34.760 --> 41:39.200]  running him down because they know what shows he watches and what he's doing when
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.640]  he's doing and now have the president so isolated that he's getting limited
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.560]  information do you really believe that Trump even knows about weather
[41:46.560 --> 41:51.600]  modification that's why the deep state so scared they took over America they took
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.760]  over our industrial base they took over our DARPA systems they took over the
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.440]  advanced technology research facilities that created the internet fission fusion
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.280]  nuclear power the whole modern world and they had it suppressed they were
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.040]  doling it out to select companies they controlled they were directing human
[42:09.040 --> 42:18.880]  development and Trump talked about it in his inaugural speech that there's a lot
[42:18.880 --> 42:22.520]  of secret technology and we're about to unlock the secrets of the universe
[42:22.520 --> 42:26.960]  together and I know for a fact Trump is looking at life extension and Trump is
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.120]  looking at secret technologies that have been deemed disruptive that we know
[42:31.120 --> 42:37.800]  they've been shelving for 60 plus years and he wants to deploy that and he wants
[42:37.800 --> 42:45.000]  to get that out to the public and Vladimir Putin gave a speech two days
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.800]  ago to journalists and engineering students and said basically the same
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.480]  thing I want to play that clip one more time since I just mentioned it again
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.480]  let's play that clip and this time I'll give you the translation into English
[43:00.480 --> 43:04.480]  via the subtitles that obviously don't work for radio listeners this is a
[43:04.480 --> 43:08.400]  radio TV transmission if you're just driving down the road or watching on TV
[43:08.400 --> 43:15.960]  in full wars.com for a slash show is where you can find all the details but right now let's go
[43:15.960 --> 43:23.720]  ahead and go to that clip from Putin artificial intelligence is the future
[43:23.720 --> 43:29.640]  not only for Russia but all of humanity it comes with colossal opportunities but
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.680]  also threats that are difficult to predict whoever becomes the leader in
[43:35.680 --> 43:44.400]  this sphere will become the ruler of the world and it would not be very
[43:44.400 --> 43:50.520]  desirable that this monopoly be concentrated in someone specific nation's
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.680]  hands that's why if we become leaders in this area we will share this know-how
[43:55.680 --> 44:01.120]  with the entire world the same way we share our nuclear technologies today but
[44:01.120 --> 44:07.240]  in order not to stand at the end of the line we need to work on it today
[44:07.240 --> 44:14.800]  already so there is that clip from RT now speaking of Putin clips let's shift
[44:14.800 --> 44:23.680]  gears into this news Chinese scientists warn K-ven detected at North Korea
[44:23.680 --> 44:29.720]  nuclear test site mountain could implode and spew radiation over entire region
[44:29.720 --> 44:37.200]  that's why there were treaties signed in the 70s banning globally above ground
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.720]  and below ground nuclear testing because the radiation levels in the northern
[44:41.720 --> 44:46.960]  hemisphere are now three times what they were pre-Hiroshima Nakasaki
[44:46.960 --> 44:55.480]  1945 bombing of Japan and North Korea of course does everything very very
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.600]  shoddily they can't even feed their population but they can certainly feed
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.960]  the giant demonic tick that was given the nuclear reactors and missiles by the
[45:03.960 --> 45:09.840]  Clintons Kim Jong-un and you know the globalists are now sending signals in
[45:09.840 --> 45:12.760]  North Korea that they're not gonna support Trump during all this and that's
[45:12.760 --> 45:17.000]  why he's so belligerent and then the left blames Trump and even has major left
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.160]  disorganizations out cheerleading North Korea Chinese scientists warn K-ven
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.600]  detected at North Korea nuclear test site mountain could implode and spew
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.760]  radiation over entire region mountain could implode again and spew
[45:34.760 --> 45:40.000]  radiation over the entire region well why not and after all in Coulter said
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.720]  that radiation is good for you the Japanese should be thankful for
[45:43.720 --> 45:48.920]  Hiroshima and Nakasaki and a leaking H-bomb test I mean that's got to be
[45:48.920 --> 45:54.880]  nutritious as well it's got to be as good as your multivitamins maybe we put
[45:54.880 --> 45:58.760]  radiation tablets in the shape of little giraffes and little hippopotamuses
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.040]  little elephants it'll be healthy for our children we already know that North
[46:02.040 --> 46:05.480]  Korea has the capability of not only firing intercontinental ballistic
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.440]  missiles that could strike every US major city but they have a nuclear
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.760]  technology to make any such attack absolutely devastating weapons of mass
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.360]  destruction electromagnetic pulse weapons in World War 3 aside however the
[46:17.360 --> 46:21.760]  South China Morning Post reports that there's another danger lurks just
[46:21.760 --> 46:25.440]  below the mountain where North Korea has been testing their nuclear devices
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.720]  total of six nuclear devices have been reportedly taken place in North Korea and
[46:29.720 --> 46:35.880]  Chinese seismologists have been able to pinpoint their locations within a hundred
[46:35.880 --> 46:41.680]  meters and the report goes on to report that the mountain is unstable and
[46:41.680 --> 46:46.760]  appears that it could cave in and areas of it already have caved in meanwhile
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.280]  this is out of the hill South Korea conducts live fire exercises for the
[46:50.280 --> 46:56.000]  second day along the demilitarized zone where we still have the ceasefire of the
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.760]  Korean War that never ended but let's talk about something that could be just
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.480]  as dangerous as out-of-control AI or AI directed by sinister forces is the real
[47:06.480 --> 47:12.200]  problem I mean the guaranteed problem that they're already using algorithms
[47:12.200 --> 47:16.600]  interfacing with humans that I believe are a form of AI and so does Google to
[47:16.600 --> 47:22.240]  manipulate markets consolidate power destroy open renaissance based systems
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.800]  but now they're reporting and we're basically breaking this because Lancet
[47:26.800 --> 47:32.640]  published it a week ago no one else covered it we checked so we're breaking
[47:32.640 --> 47:39.000]  this at info wars dot com and news wars dot com new antibiotic resistant
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.240]  hyper virulent superbug discovered in China superbug declared an alarming
[47:46.240 --> 47:53.600]  evolutionary event and we're going to break this down on the other side of
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.320]  the break and again I'm not here covering all these negative points to be
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.680]  negative I'm spotlighting them so we can do something about our corrupt
[48:03.680 --> 48:09.120]  government are out-of-control bureaucracies out-of-control multi-nationals that
[48:09.120 --> 48:13.040]  have a eugenics-based worldview that are attempting to pull up the ladder and in
[48:13.040 --> 48:20.000]  the free market big globalist institutions trying to block alternative
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.360]  systems of care to counter superbugs I mean the list goes on and on and nine
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.840]  times out of 10 when we spotlight these cockroaches and we expose this change
[48:30.840 --> 48:34.800]  comes for the better but when we're laissez-faire about it and don't care and
[48:34.800 --> 48:41.580]  leave the greedy political class to be in power you know our children don't have
[48:41.580 --> 48:48.840]  any future now before I go any further here today it's obviously vital to

[54:20.720 --> 54:47.960]  little late getting back in the seat here because we're working on so much
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.840]  breaking news out there and a ton of guests coming up in the next hour we'll
[54:52.840 --> 54:57.440]  continue to track Irma the megastorm that is set to make Harvey unfortunately
[54:57.440 --> 55:04.520]  look pale in significance but it was many a historian and many a philosopher
[55:04.520 --> 55:12.440]  that pointed out adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters that actual
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.040]  quotas from Victor Hugo the French philosopher and it's not that we like
[55:16.040 --> 55:21.920]  adversity but just like gravity is what makes our muscles and our heart strong
[55:21.920 --> 55:29.200]  and our bones strong you'll die without gravity it's the same thing being
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.520]  politically aware being active being involved in your community standing up
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.720]  for yourself that's what makes you strong as I've said many times you go on a
[55:39.720 --> 55:44.640]  Mars mission by the time you get there in a year even astronauts in the best
[55:44.640 --> 55:52.760]  shape could get beaten up by a teenage boy can hardly walk because they don't
[55:52.760 --> 55:56.960]  have the full gravity of the earth even though they work out hard it's not
[55:56.960 --> 56:02.720]  enough folks that have spent a year year and a half in space can hardly get up
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.280]  out of their chair it's the same thing 30 40 years ago most people knew how to
[56:07.280 --> 56:12.640]  do basic arithmetic now almost no one does because of calculators they made
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.560]  our lives easier but they made us mentally weaker they're getting rid of
[56:16.560 --> 56:23.080]  learning how to write words in schools all over Europe and all over the US where
[56:23.080 --> 56:30.280]  you only know how to type we're being dehumanized so do I think Irma is a
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.640]  weather weapon I don't know the earth's weather has already been manipulated so
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.400]  much who knows but for them to claim oh it's carbon dioxide you didn't pay a
[56:39.400 --> 56:44.240]  carbon tax that's total quackery they're the ones saying that the average
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.640]  person is engaged in weather modification and so we're guilty while
[56:48.640 --> 56:52.080]  there's these big giant weather modification programs going on by
[56:52.080 --> 56:58.600]  every major country from South Africa to China to Russia to the EU to the UK to
[56:58.600 --> 57:04.360]  the United States to Canada and thousands of private companies doing it and
[57:04.360 --> 57:08.440]  then I simply point out this could be a weather weapon and they'll say oh my
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.920]  gosh he's a crazy cook because again I'm actually giving people background to
[57:13.920 --> 57:18.360]  understand that we're being kept in the dark about a lot of things but what I do
[57:18.360 --> 57:24.440]  know is being manipulated what I do know is being controlled is the
[57:24.440 --> 57:29.200]  manipulation of viruses and bacteria so when we do come back in just a few
[57:29.200 --> 57:34.840]  minutes I will get into new antibiotic resistance hyper virulent super bug
[57:34.840 --> 57:41.400]  discovered in China this is exclusive to news wars calm and by the way there's
[57:41.400 --> 57:45.040]  an editor's note at the bottom that Kit and I basically put on it this morning
[57:45.040 --> 57:48.960]  together we were talking about it and it's like we don't want to say I said
[57:48.960 --> 57:53.000]  this is horrible news I said it I said I haven't seen this he said I know it's
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.800]  almost a week old from Lancet Medical Journal got no coverage I can't believe
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.920]  this and I said this is horrible there should be more discussion people should
[58:01.920 --> 58:07.800]  know about this meanwhile but all these other antibiotics stop working silver is
[58:07.800 --> 58:13.320]  known to still work sometimes I wish it worked all the time it doesn't but you
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.040]  got the FDA running around trying to ban colloidal silver because big companies
[58:17.040 --> 58:20.360]  are trying to patent the process so only they can sell it to you by
[58:20.360 --> 58:25.800]  prescription for $200 a bottle please sell it at infowarfstore.com that's
[58:25.800 --> 58:28.960]  just an example by the way we're not gouging double triple the prices like
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.360]  Amazon has been caught doing for storeable food and water filters we've
[58:32.360 --> 58:39.080]  cut them 30 to 50% off at infowarfstore.com for folks to get prepared but
[58:39.080 --> 58:43.560]  listen it's not just for this storm this is a great time of change everybody
[58:43.560 --> 58:48.320]  needs to be self-sufficient it's critical
[58:49.040 --> 58:53.280]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our
[58:53.280 --> 58:58.360]  own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[58:58.360 --> 59:02.320]  us to mother nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm introducing Z shield
[59:02.320 --> 59:07.520]  toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the USA it's filled
[59:07.520 --> 59:11.960]  with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[59:11.960 --> 59:16.600]  the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win this is the
[59:16.600 --> 59:20.320]  formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[59:20.320 --> 59:24.800]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can
[59:24.800 --> 59:28.520]  possibly get you want to yourself you know it's your family and you owe it to the
[59:28.520 --> 59:32.880]  future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[59:32.880 --> 59:38.160]  and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
[59:38.160 --> 59:41.880]  reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as
[59:41.880 --> 59:45.280]  you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the
[59:45.280 --> 59:51.040]  world now it's time to change our bodies with Z shield info wars live.com
[59:51.040 --> 59:56.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:59.320 --> 01:00:08.240]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the GCN radio
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.840]  network
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:25.320]  a new antibiotic resistant hyper virulent superbug has been discovered in
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:32.840]  China Lanzik medical journal reported on this days ago and it's gotten no
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:38.520]  coverage we have a story at info wars.com by David Bowman new antibiotic
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:45.440]  resistant hyper virulent superbug discovered in China superbug declared
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.200]  an alarming evolutionary event now we know they're manipulating the weather
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.120]  but we really know genetic engineers are manipulating viruses and bacteria and a
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.640]  lot of it's being done with these chimeras and cross species creations
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.720]  that are being made for pharmacological crops the crops are the
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.080]  humanoids being grown up inside the gestation facilities of cows and pigs
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.240]  and then being harvested that's mainstream news MIT you name it but not
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.440]  popularly pushed they just reported here and there so they can say oh you knew
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.440]  about that so that when it all comes out in the full consciousness they don't
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.640]  get in trouble they're titrating the dose inoculating you psychologically to
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.880]  accept this and prepare for this but they don't want a movement launched to say
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:35.440]  that clones and chimeras and humanoids have rights scientists in Hangzhou China
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.840]  have discovered a new strain of antibiotic resistant pneumonia which
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.800]  spreads incredibly fast following a 2016 outbreak in a hospital ICU which led
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:52.120]  to the deaths of five patients ranging in age from 53 to 73 that's bacterial
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.320]  pneumonia the findings published in Lancet researchers conclude that the
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.960]  triple threat posed by the new superbug poses a substantial threat to human
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.400]  health because they are simultaneously hyper virulent multi-drug resistant and
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:16.200]  highly transmittable it spreads quickly it replicates quickly it is very
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.480]  resistant to wide-spectrum drugs and it's easy to transmit airborne an
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:38.560]  airborne mutagenic superbug k pneumonia i st 11 cr dash hv kp or lovingly called
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.120]  the angel of death the liberals would call it the angel of love are the ones
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.120]  always calling for mass extermination they'll probably get what they want
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.680]  sooner rather than later and then they'll beg in a deadly combination of two
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.000]  previously known strains of pneumonia one which shrugs off all the toughest
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.680]  antibiotics and the other which is classified as a very severe and hyper
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:07.120]  virulent in terms of how lethal it is and how quickly it spreads man I'm
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.080]  looking at our headline it's not even strong enough it needs to be scientists
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:21.320]  discover 12th monkey bug I mean scientists discover grim reaper pneumonia a
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:31.640]  scientist discovered Stephen King's the stand for real I mean this is just crazy
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.680]  when you actually know about pneumonia and you know how deadly it is and you
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.040]  know about how it's been mutating and then now these two previously super
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:46.040]  deadly strains have mutated together man and it's always coming out of China
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.160]  always all the gifts come out of China the slave labor the suicide nets the
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.320]  death factories and all the liberal groups run it all the Apple factories all
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:03.560]  the Facebook all the oh it's so loving it's so liberal while we're busy pulling
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.040]  down Confederate statues and foaming at the mouth over Trump trying to turn the
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.600]  economy on and trying to repeal the ripoff that's Obamacare written by the
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.560]  evil Republicans and opposing while all this is happening in hurricane Irma
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:25.320]  barrels down category six just like in the movie science fiction horror movie
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.680]  World War Z where's it come out of China or say politically changed it because
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.320]  that was politically incorrect the book that'd be racist if anything came out
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.320]  of Asia it's just nothing but kittens come out of there when people go to the
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.200]  bathroom in Asia flowers and the glitters shoot out like unicorns so in
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.120]  World War Z it comes out of New York City but anyways this is real this isn't
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.000]  World War Z so everybody that takes through too many people I think you
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.320]  should line up over in China and start breathing it in
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.520]  we've got great air filters great water filters great non-gma or LMC's great
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.080]  books great films great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people and we've got
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.800]  a new humongoid sale not the number of things that are on massive sale but on
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.400]  what's on sale out for months not been on sale for months months we've never
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.440]  offered super male vitality known concentrated herbs cold pressed
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:26.200]  super male vitality 57% off it's never been the price it is right now with
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.760]  3596 reviews 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites unprecedented and
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.720]  it's cold pressed that's why super male is so different people say well I know
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.760]  these compounds work is admitted to science these are other what you sell
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.400]  they buzzfeed said it's like it's already best selling stuff it's been
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.280]  certified as you know healthy and good forever why these aren't anything new
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.760]  because well why do something new and you can have the oldest and best but
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:06:00.120]  cold pressed as most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.360]  information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.920]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.560]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.560]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.440]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.920]  to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other super food
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:34.240]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.600]  info wars isn't just fighting the globalist we're getting results and
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.200]  we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning

[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.120]  need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be clean it's the air we're
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.680]  breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.960]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here in
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.400]  America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.840]  have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.640]  it's yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best job you can
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.440]  to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.880]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.880]  themselves the general public doesn't the Alexa pure breeze would be a steel
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:43.400]  at 300 $400 $500 one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.120]  this is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.600]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.400]  so revolutionary today then for our store.com
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.240]  this planet is a spaceship two-thirds of the way out on our little spiraled
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:20.040]  armed galaxy orbiting a standard yellow Sun and on this planet there's seven and
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.480]  a half billion people there's a dictatorship run by a third-generation
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.200]  king Kim Jong-un who never took the field in battle for his kingdom but
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.160]  perches upon hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs and delivery systems thanks to the
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.440]  Clintons and the globalists arming them to create tension in the region now we
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.520]  have major Democratic Party groups cheering Kim Jong-un on against Trump
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.680]  and the USA and we have had the armistice for the ceasefire since 1953 but
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.400]  that more and more looks like it's coming to an end we also have new
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:59.520]  antibiotic resistant hyper virulent superbug discovered in China that is the
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.080]  most deadly combination ever simultaneously hyper virulent multi-drug
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.440]  resistant and highly transmissible we'll be getting into ST 11 CR HVKP the most
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.000]  deadly pneumonia ever discovered this was in Lancet Journal three days ago four
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.640]  days ago no coverage one of our writers saw it wrote the article on it I cannot
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.760]  believe this is not bigger no this is insane we have Irma the strongest
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:30.160]  hurricane ever recorded in 60 plus years of scientific recording 180 plus
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.240]  miles an hour for making it a category six officially again typhoons in the
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.720]  Pacific get up to 180 hurricanes never above 165 ladies and gentlemen this is
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.040]  the strongest hurricane stronger than the last eight storms combined and most
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.280]  its tracks have it going right up the keys to the center of the state of
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.440]  Florida into Tennessee Georgia you name it so wow get ready we are living in
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.840]  biblical times ladies and gentlemen meanwhile deranged leftist think Trump
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.360]  is creating racist hurricanes that's the article up on info wars dot com with
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.680]  MSNBC and CNN both saying that it's distracting from the Russian narrative
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.880]  and that the name Irma people aren't as concerned because it's sexist naming and
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.760]  after a woman so anything they can project on to divert the population into
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.760]  their mental illness palace Mike Cernovich great investigative journalist
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.320]  constantly breaking hardcore stories they've gone from six months ago claiming
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.480]  you were making stuff up to dreading you and with McMaster saying your public
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.800]  enemy number one for trying to you know defend this whole populist reboot of
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.600]  America that Trump is just riding a wave on we supporting but that's what's
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.440]  happening so what is the state of our world today the quickening the
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:50.080]  intensification the insanity the wars good things and bad things are all
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.800]  accelerating for every action equal and opposite reaction it's been said
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.440]  throughout history that you enter these quickening times and that things seem to
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.880]  be connected and and and things get more and more crazy where would you say we
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.560]  are right now Mike Cernovich good to have you here my pleasure we're definitely
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.600]  approaching the singularity because our time is becoming delayed it now where I
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.560]  always ask people how long ago was it when Kathy Griffin pulled her little
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.960]  ISIS beheading stunt how long ago with scare moochie fired everything has
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.480]  happened like a thousand years ago yeah exactly so our time has become a
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.760]  delayed because we're being approaching the singularity whatever that means we
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.560]  don't know yet because we've never been in the singularity but but our time now
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.400]  is being accelerated right where a second feels like a minute right we live so
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.760]  much in a day now a full day now feels like a month and a month feels like a
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.160]  year and a year feels like a decade I mean think about it we didn't we hadn't
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.480]  even met feels like I knew you ten years 20 years we met like what for the
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.240]  first time a few months ago it's crazy right so I think that everybody time is
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.840]  changing yeah our perception of time is changing and our by the time this film
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.280]  comes out you're making it'll be archaeological well that's actually why
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.800]  we're trying to get it out by Christmas it's a time capsule yeah yeah because by
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.360]  the time you get out by Christmas people are like well fake news isn't even the
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.720]  topic to sure now there's a different topic to sure and the things that you're
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.680]  bringing up shooting down the film it's important to have these evergreen
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.960]  time capsules where we slow down in this warp and kind of document what
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.080]  happened in that period to understand what's happening now some say this big
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.000]  simulation is actually by our species looking back at what went wrong
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.160]  previously and that it's not a simulation in silicon but a true three
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:41.440]  dimensional simulation in deep space well I mean if you said of a film yeah
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.840]  we're all in a film well just like what we weren't a simulation yeah of course
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.760]  we're a simulation and it's just like when you use fruit flies or whatever a
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.160]  fast reproducing organism to study what would happen over a thousand
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  generations over time whatever the simulation we're in it and it's
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:02.120]  accelerating our passage of time now to see how people react to more events
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.160]  happening in a future time so the simulation it could just be the law the
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.440]  simulation that don't the globalists get that they've lost control and it's all
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.520]  over I mean and they should try to get control of themselves because we're all
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.960]  in this together we better have sort of having open debates about what's
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.560]  happening or there's no future like Elon Musk is saying he thinks AI race
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.200]  could ignite World War three as a much greater threat than North Korea well
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.200]  once you have the AI on the blockchain so the blockchain is gonna create an
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.760]  unsensible internet essentially which is a beautiful thing the idea that you
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.080]  could create entire network social networks on the blockchain but what
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.440]  happens when the AI goes over to the blockchain and that's something else
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.400]  that nobody in the media really wants to do the interface and everything we're
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.200]  doing yeah everywhere you walk and then what happens when they when they put
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.040]  blockchains on us that we can't even see you could you you know what will become
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.680]  part of the distributed ledger so everybody you'll have and then they
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.320]  say oh we've got to tear down this whole old part of the city because the
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.800]  printable city can do it much quicker and then the first test are just a block
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.680]  then it's a half a city and then somebody hacks in to that AI system and it
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.720]  can chew up the whole planet in two hours and rewrite the entire planet in two
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.280]  hours once you launch that AI system well yeah I read a great article
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.000]  actually in and Forbes on how Walmart choosing the blockchain I should
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.560]  actually send it to producers because I really want to talk don't you get the
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.720]  printable cities gonna be the real weapon well we don't know the Genesis
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.840]  weapon we don't know what's gonna happen when that when they can track us so in
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.600]  this article now they're using the blockchains for supply fulfillment supply
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.400]  tracing so they can say where do these mangoes come from and they could just
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.280]  type in the ledger and they can find it within its entire history and the
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.600]  fertilizer that was used in the tree it came from where it worked on it I can
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.120]  almost an omnipresent three-dimensional documentation of that right so then what
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.440]  happens when we have that gives the AI total surveillance yeah and then we'll
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.400]  have serial numbers on all of us and then anywhere you go anytime you pass a
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.640]  kid that's the whole thing we've all been worried about you know the
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.240]  government spying on us and everything but as we've learned with how Google is
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.200]  monitoring everything you do every time you use a Google map Google is putting
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.280]  it into the deep learning machine and tracking you and then they can predict
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.080]  the future and then once you're able to predict the future they're able to add
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.840]  stimuli to manipulate us through the algorithm through our subconscious
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.640]  because the computer can see a map of our subconscious from our actions that
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.400]  our conscious mind is unaware of it knows our rhythms it knows our
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.600]  activities and then that's the end of consciousness oh sure it knows what
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.400]  advertising to send you if you're if you're on Facebook it knows what that's
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.320]  what people don't understand with the deep learning AI what they're doing is
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.160]  right now they're learned that is pacing and leading a classic you know
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.320]  persuasion principles they're showing you what you think you want and meeting
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.760]  where you are and then they're leading you to the where they want you to do and
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.600]  that is why Google wants to control the internet sensor which you see and then
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.200]  before long you'll type in things on Google and they'll know what you're
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.840]  going to look for and they know what's going to appeal to you and they'll show
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.760]  you just the right they admit that's their current operation right but
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.680]  eventually it's going to get out of their hand though that's the whole problem
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.680]  that people don't understand is that it people would say well what you can't
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.960]  have you couldn't have skynet without the blockchain because people would say
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:14.280]  well skynet you can just turn it off well sure but you can't turn off the
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.400]  blockchain it's a decentralized network you can't turn it off so once the AI has
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.800]  has achieved consciousness and has handed over it's got its tentacles into
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.800]  everything and can turn our food our energy everything off anytime at once
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:34.120]  sure and then once it plugs in to these large AI factories that will be able to
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.640]  take in the materials and produce whatever they want out the back end it'll
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.880]  be great for medicine housing everything else but once these things get
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.760]  scaled up then the AI can literally feed itself into everything and rewrite the
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.480]  entire surface of the globe leaving what it wants destroying what it wants
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.320]  well yeah 3d printing so they'll they'll 3d print drones that's why I tell people
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.800]  they should really watch black mirror I don't know where they got the black
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.800]  mirror people where they're plugged in or who's been talking to them or if they
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.480]  have some kind of I'm trans-terrestrial understanding of what's going on but
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.160]  sure well all of the Chinese have announced I mean before they even had
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.760]  that episode where you go around and everybody has to fringe you or your
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.000]  social score goes down and then you make less money and then they can social
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.560]  engineer your behavior by that that's the Chinese model they're coming out with
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.080]  where you have an ID that's internet but also a personal corporate and
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.440]  government off your activity and then if that lowers down you can't get a job
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.120]  it's the mark of the beast and now they just turn it off basically well and we
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.080]  already have that here oh I better not tweet that out people gonna find it
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.080]  they hate mobs but right now is the collective human being hive mind doing
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.280]  that to each other censoring each other I mean as we're now learning with you
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.760]  know gab dot AI almost got kicked off as domain register we're now learning that
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.600]  the big censorship threat isn't from a government it's from each other because
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.960]  we've been brainwashed to attack each other and censor each other so the hive
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  mind is being turned against each other but the next that notice to notice the
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.320]  computer is already warring humans against each other with the race
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.320]  narrative the culture narrative and then bringing in foreign stimuli like the
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.560]  Islamists which we have to fight because it wants to take us over like the AI and
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.840]  it brings in that artificial stimuli to then just supercharge it yeah the next
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.240]  evolution though is going to be little quantum AI bots and they could just send
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.960]  them into a part of your brain where you don't even know I mean there's
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:23.440]  actually analogs in this nature there are certain parasites that make a
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.280]  example it takes over cats yeah yeah so there's all these different cats get
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.760]  taken over by the brain parasite yeah and then also slugs get go up the top of
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.880]  the tree the bird can eat it then the chest state the larva of the parasite
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.240]  right so eventually you'll walk in and there'll be a microscopic you know
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.400]  quantum bots that go into your own brain what they're already doing for 20 years
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.280]  is they have an anti-stress vaccine they give the troops that that's really a
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.800]  nanotech virus that goes in and eat certain parts of the brain that's just
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.640]  completely admitted well at beta blockers but yeah eventually though it won't be
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.200]  under our control though eventually the AI overlords or whatever will just you'll
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.560]  walk into an area and you'll breathe in some kind of fume and the next thing you
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.000]  know your brains exactly take it over and they tell us with that movie
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.480]  transcendence with Johnny Depp where he's the loving dust that's in the
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.760]  atmosphere and you just breathe him and oh he's liberal he saves you yeah and
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.240]  they'll do whatever they want with you just lay down and die and then yeah I
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.600]  just comes by and choose you up yeah that's why I mean that there's a reason
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.040]  Elon Musk is horrified I don't I don't know how anybody can think of AI and not
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.320]  be horrified by it only if perhaps they don't really believe it if you even if
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.560]  you're not scared of the robots the evil people are trying to be in control of
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.240]  it and they're gonna be directing it well they won't be I mean they I'll take
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.960]  over the evil that's the whole point once it's out of Pandora's box it's out
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.800]  and who knows what weird machine language direction it's gonna go in man I'm
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.040]  gonna have to get off the grill well most the globalists believe well I'm gonna
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.800]  tell you what the inside scoop is straight ahead stay with us it's a no

[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:07.480]  broadcasting worldwide I'm your host Alex Jones Mike Cernovich running down a
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:13.680]  dream hurricane Irma more coming up in the next segment category 6 they're
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.640]  saying officially it would be if they had that category they haven't made it yet
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.000]  but it's over 180 miles an hour and the storm track most the tracks computer
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.200]  tracks AI tracks show it going right up over Cuba right up straight under the
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:34.200]  keys into the main state this is going to be spectacularly bad and we're gonna
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.960]  have reporters there on the ground Leanne McAdoo is there she's in the pan
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.040]  handle we've got Quentin Carter that's gonna be there on the east coast and I'm
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.720]  thinking to send some more reporters as well but the tracks have it depending
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.000]  on which track you look at going strip the middle of the state or ravaging the
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.840]  east coasts of the state and going up the east coast if it continues to be a
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.040]  category even five once it makes landfall it will destroy everything in
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.400]  its path so this is what happens though we have volcanoes we have things like
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.040]  this on our earth now we're building new things super bugs super computers and
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.480]  you were getting into this whole AI revolution we were talking during the
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:17.560]  break about how people are into in fighting and hyper competitive about
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.920]  what they're doing in their own little accumulation sphere doesn't mean we're
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.480]  not free-market and don't like to be secure but but so many people can be
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.040]  bought off by the globalist who themselves on a power trip have have
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.600]  lied to themselves and don't realize that if we don't really pull back and
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.400]  have a serious debate about this with everybody we don't have a very good
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.040]  prayer of having a future but I know this we're living in an incredibly
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.400]  exciting times everyone should be edge of their seats right now with the
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.800]  acceleration of technology and time compression that you were talking about
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:55.960]  right we didn't I think too that the hurricane Harvey has shown that this is
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.000]  our opportunity to level up as a species ultimately what we're here for is to
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.600]  because you know a lot of people don't know that we are part of a hive mind a
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:08.440]  global brain we're all just nodes in a massive much larger collective consciousness
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.360]  network and that's why people have the same ideas as somebody else even though
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.360]  they're in this has been shown even before a rapid communication and there's
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:20.800]  tipping points monkeys exactly tipping points and flexing points historical
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.320]  times and right now we're in one of those historical times a mass movement sort
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.520]  of phase a populist the populist wave is really just like the Enlightenment
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.240]  period the Renaissance there have been these times where people have had the
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.240]  opportunity to level up and at a Harvey has I mean it even made the media nice
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.840]  for a while there were journalists down there who you know are usually very
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.440]  very nasty people very often helping people trying to save people so Harvey
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.880]  and maybe even Irma is our opportunity from the machine to level up and decide
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.080]  if we want to take ourselves to a higher level of consciousness and if we
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.560]  don't rise to the challenge then my belief is we will approach a very dark
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.880]  age because they will say that okay you could have leveled up to higher levels
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.280]  of consciousness approached a much more beautiful state but you chose not to you
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.960]  chose remain divided and because of that we'll go down into a new dark and the
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.760]  globalists say they want a technocracy they want to make people poor just that
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.120]  attitude will keep us from the new clean technologies and new developments
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.240]  they're suppressing while they point at human crises and our problems and claim
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.800]  they want power to stop it they're constantly blocking it what it works great
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.960]  if you're a if you're like a billionaire then you can have more slaves if you
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.680]  have more income inequality that is why the globalists want to destroy them
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.360]  exactly they see more poor people as increasing their value instead of more
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:48.440]  successful people increasing all of our value right none of these people like
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.600]  Tim Cook my the Microsoft see none of them said hey let's go down to Mexico and
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.120]  make Mexico a better country let's help no no no no they say let's bring
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.800]  in let's exploit that place yeah and then let's bring in let's keep those wages
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.880]  low you know let's let's contact other corporations that are raising wages we
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.240]  don't want that well I mean that's Trump's crime he really is raising them
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.560]  yeah and there's proof of that actually I mean there was an antitrust civil
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.120]  lawsuit brought against Google and Apple they conspired to suppress the wages of
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.920]  tech workers meanwhile they said well we can't get enough tech tech workers we
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.360]  can't hire enough people we need more HP ones and everything but wait a minute
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.400]  you're suppressing wages artificially so they what they want is a slave planet
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.880]  where they can have poor people I mean the globalist dream it's already here
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.960]  Foxcom the globalist well we're not there yet the globalist dream is America in
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:41.040]  Europe the last bastions of virtue and beauty in the world they want broken
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.080]  homes because if you have broken homes you have men that you can easily brain
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.760]  wash like that kid and the alt-right kid who went drove his car into people very
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.160]  easy to take males who are disillusioned from society and control them and then
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.880]  they can buy the children and stuff like they do in Haiti and in everything
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:01.120]  exactly the vampires want villages to write and I agree we're not there yet
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.640]  everywhere I'm saying we're already there at a Foxcom Apple laboratory with
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.560]  suicide nets in the stairwells on the buildings 18 hour workdays force
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:13.760]  drugging people living on top of each other absolutely like animals having to
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.880]  buy their food from the company store that's where they've got us and then
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.960]  they're already now replacing them with robots and just throwing them out on
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.920]  the street so you want a vision of the future that's it yeah it's complete I
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.400]  mean if you want a vision of the future you go to Brazil in the favelas where the
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.440]  you don't have a middle class you only have an upper-class ruling power elite
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.200]  and then you have a slave class beneath them and then you have your choice of
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.560]  all the children that the pedophiles the globalist can buy that's right Mike

[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.760]  the back in a minute because I want to get the back in a minute but we're
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.240]  talking about mass propaganda we're not talking about DACA we're talking about if
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:18.360]  you go look everywhere every story about DACA every taxi rule hateful evil
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.320]  mean racist yeah those are all manufactured in like an AI Zuckerberg
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.560]  Facebook clinic to go this is the word people don't respond to racism or KKK
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.720]  and where they know that's bull let's move to cruel hateful hurtful to the
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.640]  children exactly and then you see how much it works or how much it doesn't
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:40.280]  work so we'll see there oh yeah but twitter.com forward slash CER and OVICH
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:46.440]  and then medium.com forward slash the at sign CER and OVICH I do a lot of
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.640]  breaking news there today I actually wrote an article and it mentioned you
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.440]  we were talking about you know hit pieces and media hit pieces and how to
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.720]  respond to it and a lot of people don't understand that the way it doesn't
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.600]  matter what the media says as long as you don't blink as long as you just keep
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.040]  pushing forward that exactly it's all a hoax it's all explain that people that
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.340]  I want to get into DACA which is an example of this and now Trump
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:11.880]  understands not blinking when he's doing the right thing because just to
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.760]  crystallize DACA Obama just signed an order outside of law
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.840]  countermanding saying anybody that says they're a kid can come in it wasn't
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.640]  about people that were currently here it was about abridging our laws by saying
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.400]  it's children when most of them aren't children and most of them just got here
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.320]  he said to Congress pass a law fix this clean it up I'll sign it they wouldn't
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.240]  do it Trump said he'd revisit DACA if Congress doesn't act so all he's doing
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.800]  is saying we're not gonna let 40 year old rapists say their kids that you know
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.120]  came here 30 years ago with no proof you've got to clean this up and make it
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.920]  about real dreamers that are here that do have jobs that aren't criminals and
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.040]  who can prove they've really been here they go no no no hateful you're hurting
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.920]  children right and if you can't we're hard-wired to to respond to shame I
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.160]  mean if you think about it the biggest fundamental question a person has to
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:07.800]  answer for himself or herself is why does shame work why do I care if people
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.800]  call me or why do I care if people call me or whatever we care it's because again
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.160]  like the first segment that's why we're communal creatures yeah people will try
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.560]  to make fun the first segment because they don't actually understand the
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.320]  hive mind theory of collective consciousness but that's why shame works
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.240]  because there's another node in the collective consciousness sending us data
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.840]  saying oh that's bad and then and then your own mind you think oh maybe that is
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:33.520]  bad and then that they're doing is getting artificially people and this is
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.480]  the key to everything because I noticed going back 10 years leftist would walk
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.440]  up to me in a grocery store they're really just conformist globalist
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.200]  minions fascist because the right wing is bad too you know with all their wars
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:48.480]  and garbage and they would point to hi everyone hates you no one likes you boo
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.720]  shame shame shame and then you see it in live feeds in DC or Austin or LA or
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.880]  wherever I met most folks are shaking my hand or saying hi but the other folks
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.840]  when we go shame shame shame and a few more will go shame shame shame and but
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.440]  is there something wrong with me because I always knew I was right I knew they were
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.880]  being infantile junior high and I thought it was funny but I felt sorry
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.600]  for them so I'm not really sociopathic I'm kind of the opposite of that so
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.240]  what's wrong with me because from my earliest days I didn't care a b what's
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.320]  wrong with them they know they're in a so-called priest class controlling
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:26.920]  people through shame they're in a cult of political correctness and know it's a
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.080]  fraud so what do we do to get them out of their own matrix because what you
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.280]  brought up Cernovich is the key to understanding their mindset they're
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.320]  prisoners but guards at the same time right the best the best guards are the
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.560]  fellow slaves the best slave the most loyal slave is somebody who doesn't know
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.840]  he's a slave and that's what people don't understand is that there's a lot
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.520]  of messaging being used to literally brainwash people there's a great book
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.880]  called the battle for the mind by William Sargent which talks about I mean we
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.400]  should talk about this right now it's such a powerful book the battle for the
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.560]  mind by William Sargent and when what they found out the Chinese found out
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  because their geniuses at this stuff is that if you kidnap somebody a prisoner of
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.520]  war rather than beat the guy up if you want to flip them to your way you say
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:10.520]  hey why don't you just write a 500 word essay about one thing that maybe the US
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.000]  is doing that's not so good no no no don't bash the USA don't say the USA is
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.480]  the worst country in the world but just think of maybe one thing that the US
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.800]  could improve on and then you get these people writing essays and then sharing
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.960]  that message and the next thing you know you flip them and you actually make them
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.640]  anti-American so that is the most effective mind control is that subtle
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.880]  stuff that going on so that's what they do in these college indoctrination
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.600]  things they go hey let's give you a thing on white privilege incrementalism
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.680]  yeah exactly and then you notice when you finally say whites are the devil
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.840]  need to be killed you get a pluses yeah you work your way up but they
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:46.240]  incrementally get you there right you say oh let's just help well oh it's just
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:50.840]  a diversity lecture calm down bro who cares no one's saying what's your evil
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.440]  exactly but years later whites are the devil must be killed and you look up and
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.520]  it's weird white professors running it and they know they're running a
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.320]  psychological Milgram experiment they know that's what's crazy is that I used
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.640]  to think only the high levels knew then the low levels know it they want to get
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.600]  into the priest class just like when I watched Gruber on c-span saying thank
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.080]  God they're so dumb it was all the other graduate students they're learning
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.720]  going how do we lie how do we hurt them we want to be in the parasite class we
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.760]  want to be in the more lock class how do we be how do we become holders of the
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:26.560]  Eloi and he's up there well let me tell you they have no attention span and they
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.000]  are your enemy and they're all just smiling like psychopaths like a bunch of
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.240]  Ted Bundy's well and that's again because of the global brain phenomenon
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.600]  that's why people have to understand fundamentally the most important
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.680]  existential question which is like what are we who are we and what we are are
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.680]  part of the again the hive mind the collective unconscious so people when
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.200]  they conform to what the other nodes are saying then they get a rush of that
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:54.120]  you're a good person now that the reason that's so dangerous is because now
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.080]  we're at a time where they've created armies they've used for decades now
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.920]  now weaponized these these minions and now they're getting more aggressive
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:07.400]  exactly you can attack like I did man it is um let's just say that Shauna is not
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:11.640]  real happy about me having happy hours and everything because me I just go I
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:17.040]  will not live in fear of these people but yeah they're they're definitely you
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.600]  know a very high-level person asking what my security situation is a very
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.760]  everybody would know the guy's name I'm not going to mention it so there are a
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.440]  lot of people worried about me now because of the violent leftist and they
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.720]  are they are an army they're a weaponized army well I noticed that it was
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.760]  like a broadcast because I'd go around the corner and there'd be another like a
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.520]  body snatcher literally hissing it's on video people said wow they look like
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:43.320]  goblins yeah something's happened to him well especially in the area so an area
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.480]  like Seattle so Austin is good because there's a lot of patriots too so there
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.000]  are a few people in Austin who are bad for example yeah the goblins aren't as
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.720]  emboldened to actually come out in daylight here exactly but in Seattle
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.200]  like I would not have a I wouldn't hold an event in Seattle because there would
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.920]  be too many terrorists going on there too many Antifa terrorists too many
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.120]  pedophile-looking goblins around there I would not do anything in Seattle San
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.680]  Francisco I wouldn't do a public event anymore for the same why do they look
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.080]  like goblins well because your aesthetic values it relates to your own
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.800]  self-respect so if you live a nihilistic aesthetic or a nihilistic mindset where
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.600]  you believe nothing matters then you allow your own body to become gross
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.920]  that's why they don't shower they don't groom themselves that a lot of them
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.840]  don't wipe their own bottoms they're just stinky they're stenchy and in San
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.560]  Francisco they you can you'll step in human species oh there was there was
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.880]  human feces all over the streets everywhere yeah and that that's the
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.600]  impromptu and I noticed that the goblins were like hopping happily around it
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.360]  like they want things to be ugly well because in their own mind they're
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.400]  ugly because their aesthetic is ugly the that's what ultimately the end game of
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.200]  postmodernism and deconstruct them is is deep and that's to classify that the CIA
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:58.160]  under Ford Foundation control by the 50s wanted ugliness wanted to destroy
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:02.560]  notice the amount said Wonder Woman is not a feminist movie she's gorgeous and
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.200]  powerful because she's feminine no no no no no no no we need a woman that looks
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.640]  like a man who has power the top you know director said this is evil don't
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:16.320]  show a woman in power no no using her no this is evil well in that's a woman
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.120]  with cancer dying that's power it all starts with that's why they wanted to
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.440]  deconstruct the nuclear family because a nuclear family that Norman Rockwell
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.080]  thing it triggers their own dirty filthy aesthetic they want everybody to be
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.080]  to be filthy and to live in fecal I mean they want the kids in those pictures in
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.600]  a basement with them cutting their toes off yeah that's why they all look like
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.600]  potbelly pedophile goblins so that's their aesthetic that is their death
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.000]  wish that's why they deconstruct anything that's beautiful that's why when
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  you go into museum now that should be celebrating culture you're not seeing
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.560]  good culture is the goblin force attacking because it thought this was
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.440]  their time with Hillary that this was their worldwide move and instead they've
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.560]  been reversed and their great offensive is turned into their their Waterloo well
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.280]  that could be it it's also that you summon energy so that for example if
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.480]  you're very loved you will also be very hated that just because the rule of
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.320]  polarity that we live by and that the simulation no true I noticed the more
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.120]  successful I get them the hate just gets more intense and then that hate gets me
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.840]  more love it's it's a polarity right right exactly people are drawn to you
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.640]  more and that's just because it's the nature of the law the universe you can't
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.400]  you can't draw greatness from the well you're gonna have to draw negativity too
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:29.960]  that's the way things are set into play so what had happened is the post
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.400]  modernist and the cultural Marxist they went too far and where they're open
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.200]  here's here's a good question about internet freedom internet censorship the
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.320]  the internet the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants to fight a law that
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.280]  would hold websites accountable for allowing human trafficking but so they
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.560]  want to defend the right for people websites to sell humans the freedom for
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.800]  that but they will not defend your right for free speech when Google messes with
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.760]  you they won't defend gaps right yeah they'll they'll they'll defend like the
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.720]  ACLU the most radical bizarre provocation but they won't defend just
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.360]  basic mainline freedom well pedophiles that's the whole point is that well
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.640]  salon and others openly say we we like pedophilia we're voting it yeah exactly
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.960]  and then when so the point is that they will defend your free speech right to
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.040]  pedophilia child by the way you know you know a lot of folks are going to see it
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:25.280]  the clown because this is murder porn of small children no one in cinema has
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:28.960]  ever shown four or five six-year-olds being torn apart by demons but this is
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.640]  going to really be you know real Jeffrey Dahmer fun yeah and they'll be copycats
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.680]  it in all these things and I've watched a clown it's a very nasty well you know
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.120]  that's what for actually looked it up thousands of years ago priests and human
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:46.440]  sacrifice with dress with white and then red hair bows of the clown outfits
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.720]  actually go back to ancient Egypt and human sacrifice so that's a whole archetypal
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:53.960]  deal that Satanist for thousands of years dress up in clown outfits when they
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:58.360]  ripped her children apart Katie armor has been on a mission to manufacture the

[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.160]  that's how they spun it was I was like would you like some sausage and then
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.960]  that's how they twisted it in in that I tried to have sex with a der spiegel
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:46.280]  rider yeah I remember that article here's a sausage want to saw wasn't even in my
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.560]  hand it was like here's a plate of the sausage and I was like he's like what's
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:53.760]  good I'm like the sausage right they could technically say he asked me if I
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.320]  wanted some of his sausage but see how they'd play that game on their readers
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.200]  right he spoke good English by the way you knew full well what he's doing yeah
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.120]  Mike speaking of that and I want to get it me back into the hurricane they've got
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.520]  a big movie coming out that Hollywood's producing called Geostorm 2017 right on
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.560]  time dealing with massive man-made weather weapons I'm not saying that's
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.840]  what Harvey or Irma are the audience is talking about it people want to know
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.560]  about it we're going to be playing that trailer coming up in the next early part
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:30.200]  of the hour but getting back to this they've got shows on Comedy Central shows
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:37.440]  on HBO shows everywhere attacking me and now they've launched all these other
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.520]  programs so many of them I can't even keep track parody site launches Alex
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:47.440]  Jones inspired show spoof where they all then say things I've never said then
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.480]  attributed to me and then their goblin force then when they see me on the street
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.680]  run-up screaming what these people have said as if I've said it is this like the
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:01.120]  mental illness broadcast for their delusional audience it's beyond fake
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.480]  news it's comedians it's actors it's teleprompter readers saying all this and
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.960]  then it's attributed to me why are they getting so desperate because you're
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:15.400]  probably the most interesting man in the United States right now I wouldn't say
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:19.120]  the world because you know there's a lot of other countries but yeah maybe put
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.280]  his most interest in me and my son of it you're definitely Matt drudge they're
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.200]  all real interesting well well drudge lays low though drudge promise he's
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.600]  really smart in person right and really interesting and dynamic on air but he
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:32.280]  won't do it I know but it's beautiful though because there's the intrigue so
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.600]  Matt Matt drudge's game is on point because he's this sort of in a good way
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:41.000]  a figure that nobody really quite knows or understands and that's part of his
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.200]  power so there's different kinds of sure exactly but not making it about me
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:51.000]  there's at least seven shows weekly or daily attacking me now I've got the
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.960]  producers of Seinfeld trying to be to a TV show with them and this is the names
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:58.280]  of Seinfeld it just gets crazier and crazier I mean that's beautiful though
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.480]  I didn't call them back I need to but no I mean it's beautiful though because it
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:07.680]  shows that the the we're winning the war because if you that's the thing we
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.360]  talked about earlier in the earlier segment which is that you're when you
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.240]  draw love from people you're gonna draw hate from others anytime you draw
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:17.760]  attention people are going to interpret that it's like the elephant okay no I
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.320]  agree but what do you think they're trying to do they're trying to get
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.040]  ratings to make money off of you why wouldn't they that's the whole point is
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:29.320]  the same reason that it's the same reason that people will take a clips in
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:33.080]  the Joe Rogan podcast and upload them to their own channels because they get
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.880]  subscribers just by uploading clips so there's all these like weird Joe Rogan
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.600]  fan things and then some of those channels have like 150,000 you know what
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:43.320]  Joe asked me back on about a month ago and we're trying to work out the time
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:48.120]  but I think we ought to go on together I'm banned from the show and I don't know
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.040]  why you guys have had an issue together I've never had an issue with them but
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:56.360]  apparently Sam Harris cried about it and no I'm Sam Harris you he's one of
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.920]  those he was a new atheist with Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens well I
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:04.880]  mean Joe does have some preachy know-it-all atheists I could sit back
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:14.400]  know oh the intellectualness oh yeah let me tell you and then he goes well here's what Sam did Sam goes Sernovich is just a troll
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.760]  he's a mean person I don't like Sernovich Trump terrifies me Sernovich
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.960]  made fun of me one day so Sam has like really obsessed with me the emails people
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:28.200]  like hey if you have him on you can't you know I'll never be on your thing so oh
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.440]  my gosh I hate it total drama and then Joe tries to say I'm not really banned
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:40.080]  but it's like come on everybody knows why if one bullshit about that

[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:53.760 --> 02:00:00.720]  all right Mike Cernovich and I are having an interesting discussion
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:07.760]  1984 is 1776 that's right you're listening to the Alex Jones show I know a
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:12.120]  liner is coming in there but I interrupt everybody so I interrupt myself we're
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:18.000]  going to have James Jose Rawls on because he predicted like a year ago and
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.040]  then about six months ago then about a month ago that Antifa would basically
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.440]  turn into a terror organization and that they would start becoming the
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:27.800]  weatherman now they say that's who they are and what they're gonna do so we're
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.720]  gonna get his take on where he sees all that unfolding but I like Joe he's a
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.880]  really funny guy we're talking about how big his show is and so we weren't
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:38.200]  bashing it you were just talking about the phenomenon of kind of a shadow band
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.560]  type deals that happen we're one of the pseudo-intellectual guests announces
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:47.800]  that someone is a troll and then to pay homage to the fact that person's God then
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:51.320]  you who just make the show more popular and have your own platforms are not
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:55.320]  gonna be on there because it makes you know guests unhappy if you are the
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.760]  arrogance don't know that guy is who just showed me a clip during the break I
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:04.960]  could care less the more guys got a microphone open in there the more I am
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:10.320]  banned the more people say he's the evil one or for years we will not say his
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:15.880]  name all it does is make us bigger it's so ridiculous it's so crazy that we're
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:19.520]  the one that's so controversial they wouldn't list it is the number one
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:25.200]  podcast in Joe's history or period at Google at Apple he should say come back
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.320]  let's make a bigger stunt out of this let's get ready to rumble the man that
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:34.360]  Apple will not even let you know is number one with Joe Rogan in his huge
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:39.120]  platform why won't they do that that's so simple with Joe's platform they can't
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.000]  silence him with all the platforms he's got he would say we're having back the
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.560]  guy with the biggest podcast we ever had but let's see if this one gets censored
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:50.400]  let's see if Apple puts it to the top they'll hang on every word and instead of
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.280]  25 million viewers it'll have 50 million viewers but we don't want Super Bowl
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.920]  level audiences yeah I thought it was interesting that Joe definitely should
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.520]  have called that out and again I'm a big he's done great work yes he did kind of
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.280]  call him wow it's weird they never listed as number one well no I mean but
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.920]  you got to go to war for something like that if they're committing if they're
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:12.600]  committing fraud the way Apple is by not listing that's not letting it trend
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.200]  there was a message is we're not gonna let you monetize it either well you
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:19.760]  are you have Alex song we won't let you monetize it well the reason we bring
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.920]  you get into that America's gone folks what where is the common sense here
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:28.040]  YouTube's doing it too they wouldn't let the podcast Brett Weinstein and Jordan
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.720]  Peterson did with the Joe Rogan it was a they won't let it train me on YouTube so
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.840]  YouTube and Apple and all these companies are manipulating it and the
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.640]  problem is if that people lay low on that you have to raise a stink Joe should
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:43.800]  be like hey why don't you call the YouTube CEO and ask her why she won't let
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:48.400]  this podcast and then Joe would be even bigger exactly because I mean you know
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.360]  out there the internet sphere the only thing that anywhere approaching what I'm
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.160]  doing is Joe Rogan and Joe knows that he said it on here that we're both mega
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.400]  massive he's seeing my numbers and I've seen his we've shown each other are we
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:08.120]  ways he knows that so why be afraid of that like in Ghostbusters cross the
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:14.520]  streams yeah you gotta you know you he guys he has to call it out because
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:19.120]  people like him who is an oblige oblige right he has a duty that if they're
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.640]  censoring people like Jordan Peterson Brett Weinstein if YouTube won't let
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.960]  the the biggest shows trend you got to just like yo YouTube what is up this I
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.240]  mean Joe Rogan used to go to troll Carlos Mancina and say you're a joke thief
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:35.080]  and he would film it and say you're a joke thief but when Apple and these big
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.440]  corporations are spanking his butt you know get in their faces man get in and
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:42.840]  say look YouTube I'm not gonna I just like it went after Carlos Mancina I'm
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:45.960]  gonna get in your face I'm gonna get in your face Apple we're not gonna let these
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.320]  by the way they are doing that but listen Joe's not going in the corner and
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:53.680]  peeping on himself and rolling over in a catatonic thing scared of Apple I was
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.600]  not that he's afraid it's just that he doesn't want to get in their face and be
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:01.040]  aggressive watch the Carlos Mancina confrontation I know I know but listen
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.040]  this is a big deal because of the number one podcast long-form podcast ever
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.120]  almost four hours long number one they admit it they will not even let it show
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  up in the top hundred because it'll just stay there at the top forever they
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:16.760]  don't want us to get the trophies but we win the ND 500 we win the NASCAR race
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:22.460]  we win the Formula 1 race we win and you don't get it it's a fraud it's one
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:25.000]  thing if it's a Don King fight you can't a hundred percent prove it was a fraud
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.120]  with this they're rigging it in front of everyone but it's okay because they're
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:33.240]  liberal and they're Apple and they own slave factories with suicide nets now
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.080]  if they didn't own suicide nets it's like the ADL gives awards to George
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:42.160]  Soros admitted Nazi but if you're not a Nazi they call you a Nazi so see that
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.600]  that's the thing on a slave factory you're okay they care about the dreamers
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.400]  though Apple really cares about dreamers that's why you're not liberal you're
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:58.960]  doing the slave factory turn of it yeah we've got great air filters great water

[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.040]  of the islands in the Caribbean already hit if you're a TV viewer the latest
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.680]  coverage at info wars calm and news wars calm the world is definitely entering
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:07.120]  a massive quickening period predicted by so many in the fourth turning and other
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.680]  analysis why does history repeat why does it rhyme why is everything synced up
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.240]  we don't really know but we know there is a collective unconsciousness we know
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.280]  there's a collective will the globalists are trying to artificially influence
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.800]  that now I'm not saying Irma is geoengineered but there is geoengineering
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:28.840]  going on secretly in the United States they admit the programs happening they
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.600]  just have the details secret they admit there's weather modification going on
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:37.080]  China Dubai Russia the EU everybody does it there's thousands of private
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:41.200]  companies doing it on a micro level but there's a lot of advanced technology
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.200]  that we don't know about in 1967 the Stanford Research Institute certified
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:50.080]  was declassified in 2006 I interviewed the scientists involved when he first got
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.800]  declassified been Livingston meteorologist who was the father of it was 90
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:00.640]  years old then and the left is saying oh climate change is here it's time to
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.600]  talk about geoengineering they're the ones already doing it they're claiming
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.280]  we're geoengineering as individuals so we're guilty let them have control of
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:13.920]  the atmosphere and they'll save us see how they take over so regardless geo
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:17.320]  engineering is going on they're trying to blame us saying it's happening
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:21.160]  individuals but then claiming the elite are doing nothing meanwhile though right
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:28.240]  on time with these super storms we have the new film geo engineering 2017 coming
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:36.480]  soon on October 20th oh just a little bit more than a month or so after Irma is
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.880]  set to hit isn't that just perfect timing like all these race war films
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:44.200]  they've been putting out this is starting to get suspicious here it is
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:51.000]  Geostorm
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.360]  Senate committee now here from Jacob Lawson climate ISS chief coordinator may
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:01.800]  the record reflect that he was nearly one hour late yeah sorry about that I
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.760]  literally had to fly in from outer space
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:11.160]  thanks to the system of satellites natural disasters have become a thing of
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.000]  the past we can't control our weather
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.440]  which person one of our thermosphere at satellites malfunctioned over Afghanistan
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:28.720]  so your proposal is what we shut down all satellites I don't need to remind all
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.720]  of you how many people died from catastrophic climate
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:39.200]  geostromes are you going back up to space I'm going back I promise I'm a safe
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:45.440]  trip sir just don't touch anything
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:52.480]  this is mr. Jake Lawson three Jake Lawson you look much older than I would
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:12:00.840]  have thought I mean good I'm I getting fired my access has been blocked so
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:10.480]  that has a bad cotton that happens somebody hacks into the satellite
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:14.880]  he hacks into the AI there's potential for catastrophic weather events from a
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:24.120]  global scale a geostorm I love how I spearheaded along with people like
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:30.160]  George Norring but with real science the geoengineering the UN the world
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:35.000]  trade organization all of them the council and farm relations all admitting
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.160]  they're doing it all admitting it secret with ground-based lasers and ionizers
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:45.800]  it's not space-based and they're manipulating on a mass scale and then
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:51.480]  they make stuff up like I supposedly said Obama sent tornadoes five years ago
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:55.600]  to Oklahoma City no a caller said that I said no they can create major weather
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.680]  fronts and control them that's been declassified but I don't think this is
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.200]  probably a weather event but they lied and said I did so again why are we so
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.000]  attacked why are we so demonized because we're always decades ahead get the news
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.760]  days weeks months or even years before at info wars.com Mike Cernovich yeah
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:16.400]  that's why they are afraid because all they can do are repeat talking points
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.760]  they don't actually want to break news what are they allowed to talk about and
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:22.840]  there's all these conformity mechanisms that are enforced on people
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:27.280]  especially people in the media they say don't go there so but but I thank them
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.560]  for what they do I mean for example these Soros funded websites they they will
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:36.960]  take all of the videos we do download them transcribe it and then they will
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.040]  write an article about it and I share those articles actually I'm like wow I
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:43.840]  really I'm that's their mental illness they have to act like they are the
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.760]  magic wand they are the high priest it's a con game they declare that what we're
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:52.200]  saying is not true and that everyone else regurgitates saying it's not true
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.640]  but everybody knows the media is lying so most the public goes oh my gosh it is
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.120]  true because you don't know something is true until the government or its mouth
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.560]  pieces officially deny it yeah I'm grateful because I'm so busy man I can
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.440]  barely you know I need a haircut I want to thank George Soros and media matters
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.080]  and David Brock for being our secretaries right they're transcribers I
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:16.240]  don't even have time to get a haircut let alone take this audio and download it
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:19.080]  and have it transcribed and everything who has the time so thank you but they
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:23.920]  do I'm very grateful for media matters for you know be sure to use headings and
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:28.320]  downloads and they'll say Roger Stone and Alex Jones say in three months they
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.440]  will say that you know Trump is mentally ill or or has early on set a
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:35.680]  dementia exact words three months later I mean I just love how they just think
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:39.840]  everything we say they keep documenting it for us as our secretaries so that when
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:44.320]  it comes to exactly as we said everybody knows how on target we are yeah and I've
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.040]  always told people who when they're like hey you're hiring anybody I go look
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.560]  man just get a job at the Southern Poverty Law Center or media matters and
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.600]  you can get paid to watch me and to transcribe me and to work for a job yeah
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.080]  it's amazing as you there's Charlie where's they'll wrote that article they
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.520]  tested our products that they're totally clean exactly what we say is in them you
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:07.360]  couldn't have a better third-party review and I and people think he works
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.480]  for us that was like fit well BuzzFeed they sent probably $50,000 because I'm
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:16.240]  I'm getting a product tested right now and for the full FDA you know these
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:22.800]  people testify in court $5,500 just to test one model 55 so they ran you
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:26.320]  through three different testings for all of your different products and
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:31.200]  everything and it turned it while it was amazing it showed that you stop the
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:34.400]  spin and say it was bad but then they admit everything we say is what we say
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.360]  yeah but the only thing the thing is the only thing that people remember is
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:40.600]  that it passed the test they don't remember that they go well there isn't
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.840]  enough zinc even though the zinc was a binding agent and it wasn't even about
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:46.960]  the zinc whatever people don't remember that people where they go he sells
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:51.040]  something for $25 only has $5 the zinc they don't tell you it's got a bunch of
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.240]  other ingredients in it right just play the semantical games right but but again
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.920]  people don't remember that all people know is that you faced the most scrutiny
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:04.640]  of any supplement nutrition they had Ella that they had San Francisco law firms
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.560]  that basically own the testing place and who sue people but it doesn't pass
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.280]  California standards while a lot of folks I even sell in California and they
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:16.160]  didn't get what they wanted right so you you tested the most stringent devoted
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:20.720]  lab testing process in history and you and you pass the test I think it was an
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.480]  amazing that's why I linked an article widely that's why I linked a lot of the
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.920]  stuff and the truth is that I think but but I guess the bigger point though is
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:33.600]  the point is but feed has to cover us because they're losing control will they
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:39.040]  will they test supplements from Amazon that Jeff Bezos sells though I guess
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.840]  that is that's my bigger question is that what why aren't they testing
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.400]  supplements from Amazon and Jeff Bezos I asked Charlie Warzella on the phone I
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:49.600]  called him up that last week or two weeks ago and I said why don't you test
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.760]  that he just kept saying well you're a very interesting person with a big
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:57.320]  platform and I go Bezos is way more important you know $100 billion Amazon
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.800]  Whole Foods once world government once the president dead yeah I actually was
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:06.080]  reading the Forbes the old thing and I should also in the picture the production
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:10.360]  team actually what Bezos looked like before his big rebrand but the truth
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.200]  is that in media the biggest and you didn't make this one break today
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.960]  Politico just had the top 50 most influential people in media maybe you
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.160]  know maybe the people can find that pull that up Bannon's on there but Drudge and
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.640]  you aren't there in media right now the three most influential people in media
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:31.200]  are Drudge Bannon and you not necessarily in that order so you have to
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:34.400]  you if you're on a media beat you have to write about you that's why it's just
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:37.400]  but they still play the game like we don't exist and I don't care about them
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:43.280]  saying we're big it's just that you know human animal chimeras are real MIT's
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:46.880]  been reporting on it for a decade all these things are real geoengineering
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.720]  is real they just keep saying we're crazy and it isn't working where does this
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.280]  go and we've got to go to our guests I apologize for getting them on late but I
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.440]  guess he can apologize because he didn't make the show last week but best-selling
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.280]  author researcher former army intelligence officer really smart guy
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:04.480]  survival blog.com James Wesley Rawls I'm not going to play all the clips because
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.320]  of time his books like years ago actually that I know that name he's the
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:12.400]  best-selling fiction writer a long time ago yeah James Wesley Rawl
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.200]  Patriot you've been writing patriotism for 25 years James Wesley Rawls let me
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.680]  ask you this question what point are we at historically right now as we're
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:22.880]  talking about the tipping point an acceleration of time an acceleration of
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:29.800]  knowledge all this AI where are we right now well I think we're entering a a
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:35.520]  phase in our nation's history where we're seeing technology intersect with
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:42.160]  politics and at this point we are at great risk of having technology leap
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:49.720]  frog to the point where personal freedom is destroyed in our nation we we're at
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:55.240]  that point right now and we need to be vigilant and we need to be as politically
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:02.040]  active as possible to prevent that kind of overreach because the technology is
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.520]  there all the way from biochipping all the way up to you mentioned weather
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:14.160]  control so we need to be vigilant we need to be politically active and we
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:20.120]  definitely need to have family preparedness a goal because I think that
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:24.920]  as time goes on we're going to see more and more crises that will impact us at
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.520]  the family level why is it historical that earthquakes storms political
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:32.640]  unrest all go together the globalists know that they say oh it's global
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:35.800]  warming give us full control with geoengineering let us run your lives
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.520]  let us track everything you do let us tax you let the technocracy run your
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:43.520]  life the AI algorithms and this will save the earth you can already see what
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:50.280]  they've scripted and then along comes a record hurricane now a category six and
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:55.360]  all things very suspicious well I you know I'm I'm not I don't take a
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:00.520]  conspiratorial view on weather control but I do think that they're there that's
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:05.760]  definitely a factor there somewhere in the background I'm just not sure how
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:14.480]  much is impacting us with current events but we have to watch all of the
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:19.800]  these storms and be ready for them because regardless of whether or not
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:28.000]  there's any man-made input into them at all there's still a a huge impact on us
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.360]  from in terms in terms of family safety in terms of family preparedness in terms
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:38.920]  of even the economy because that the economic impact of these storms can be
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.040]  enormous so let's look at Arma let's look at how Harvey blew up in the
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:46.280]  globalist phase trying to create a race war kind of diffusing what you'd
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.840]  predicted this summer that Soros was pushing so let's go back to your
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:52.640]  prediction coming true but now because of Harvey kind of raining on the race
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:57.040]  war they're already trying to spin Arma as racial or sexist because the name is
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:01.200]  a woman this is seriously what they're trying to do what is your gut level of
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.320]  you on the impact of this hurricane I mean obviously we don't know exactly
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:07.320]  where it's gonna hit but it's going to looks like hit at least as a category
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:12.520]  three or four maybe even a five or six the United States in Florida or other
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:17.040]  areas how bad will that be will it bring us together how will the left try to
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.440]  piggyback on this well I think you just hit on a very important point and that
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:27.720]  is Harvey really flew in the face of the whole liberal narrative they wanted
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:32.880]  to they were doing their very best to divide this nation and and try to play
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.600]  up all the divisiveness and if you see what happened in the aftermath of
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:41.440]  Hurricane Harvey where you had people of all different skin tones helping each
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:47.240]  other out very selflessly it really didn't match their narrative and now
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:53.000]  they're moving on and talking about Hurricane Irma but you know when you
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.520]  come right down to it the American people are good folks and they help each
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:00.240]  other out and they don't you know when they go to rescue someone off the roof
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:04.560]  of a house in their boat they don't pass them by because of a difference in
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:12.040]  skin tone that just doesn't happen this is America so that the the liberal media
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:17.960]  establishment really doesn't have an answer for this because it comes right
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:26.240]  down to the good the essentially good nature of the American citizenry the
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:30.560]  Lord does work in mysterious ways Harvey blow up in their face what are you
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:34.640]  expecting to do on their whole Russian narrative and this drumbeat for COG to
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:38.840]  overthrow Trump it doesn't seem to be getting a lot of toe holes but it
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:42.680]  doesn't matter they try to kill the president they attempt to go forward
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.640]  with this I think foreign enemies will use it if they try to kill the president
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.080]  or do kill the president what do you think the timetable is on that James
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:54.920]  Leslie Rawls well it's very difficult to determine a timetable but there's
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:59.040]  definitely an agenda there and you mentioned continuity of government most
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:04.640]  folks don't realize that FEMA is not primarily a disaster relief organization
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:08.920]  it's a continuity of government organization that's their their main
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:16.240]  underlying task and that's a very large chunk of their budget and in terms of
[02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:21.880]  FEMA is the face of the larger submerged deep state military industrial
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:29.360]  complex right their real goal is their real task goal tasked by Congress is
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:33.880]  continuity of government and don't ever lose track of that don't don't lose
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.880]  sight of that folks because that's their real mission the disaster relief stuff
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:43.200]  is just you know kind of icing on the cake their real goal is continuity of
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:49.120]  government and you have to look at the FEMA budget and unfortunately a lot of
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:57.000]  the FEMA budget is classified and the part that's classified is the COG in
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.680]  fact many years 90% of its budget has been secret but now Trump clearly to his
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.280]  credit and I want service to pop it on this he really ordered FEMA to take
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:12.400]  action not just have a vestigial front for natural disaster relief but actually
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.080]  make its mission more about disaster relief because real COG is about the
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:20.960]  country being in a good position yeah there's no point in having a federal
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.760]  government if they can't do disaster relief roads a few things the government
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:27.680]  should do well the government shouldn't be worried about every kind of thing in
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:31.360]  our private life and he handled it like an executive you know that Trump is
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:35.800]  doing the right thing when the media was unable to criticize him Obama on the
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.560]  other hand there was massive flood he doesn't even show up right he was
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:42.800]  playing golf there was flooding well you notice Trump also got out of the way
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.640]  and said let the locals spearhead this because they have the people the manpower
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:51.560]  they're there and they've got places to take folks we can't centralize something
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:55.560]  this big he has that basic faith of the people well Trump understands people
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.600]  whereas Obama always looked down on us this like I don't Obama did so this is
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.760]  the thing about Obama that a lot of people don't understand is Obama doesn't
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.680]  hate us but he views us as like his little pets like ants yeah we're not
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.160]  really a man we can't have freedom and this is a lot of liberals is looking at
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:16.720]  ant farm you know over on the shelves and expanding on that over here and
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.120]  try them came up with his dad who bare knuckles got into real estate business
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:24.800]  but with the skin of his you know teeth you're just being really a tough guy and
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:28.560]  Trump knew it was about the workers liking you working late cooking them
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:32.720]  hamburgers out there going you know to the pool hall with them but they liked
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:36.200]  it they get down in that then they have all the big planes and the fancy stuff
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.800]  but he likes you know hamburgers would catch up on him at night that's super
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.160]  blue collar folks I mean he cooks a steak well I mean that's ultra blue
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:47.240]  collar Trump is the is a blue collar billionaire and he actually likes
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:50.840]  getting in there helping people seeing people being taken care of and that's
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:54.640]  what they hate James Leslie Rawls what do you think their next move is gonna be
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:04.800]  with boy I think that we're gonna see the the mass media try to spin Hurricane
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:15.960]  Irma into some sort of class war they're going to try to take Irma the
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:24.600]  aftermath of that hurricane and use it to try to divide people they're gonna do
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:28.360]  their best that's right James get a drink of water sounds like you're eating a
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.040]  peanut or something got part of it down your one pipe that's happened to me
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.840]  hundreds of times on air trying to eat something during the break up a little
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:36.120]  piece down your wishes somebody would let you get a drink of water that's why
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.960]  don't eat till 2 p.m. because empty stomach you know yes I don't I do
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.720]  intermittent fasting so I eat usually until 2 p.m. that way the whole time it's
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.160]  just clear mind my body is not digesting any food I'm just focused on pure
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.040]  instinct and everything James I want to get back to you real quick and then
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:56.200]  have you expand on this I don't have the staff or crew to go do it but what's
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.600]  the point everybody heard you that listens regularly predict before Trump
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:03.240]  even got elected they use culture war and that they would then go to weathermen
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:07.760]  tactics when right beating people in the street didn't work but then the
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:11.600]  hurricane came turned people against it and now Pelosi and others that had to
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:14.400]  come out say okay they're a terror organization or they're a criminal
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:17.520]  organization we get for that they're a terror organization it seems like that
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.000]  blow up in their face what does it signify them basically flushing the
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.280]  toilet on Antifa or is that only a limited thing for face saving in the
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:29.640]  algorithm no I think that it's more face saving because I think they want to
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:35.400]  distance themselves from Antifa because they can see what's coming and that is a
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:43.080]  large segment of Antifa is in a particular camp they call themselves the
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:49.280]  by any means necessary camp BAMN that's actually a fairly large portion of
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:52.720]  Antifa I think the liberal establishment is trying to distance
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:57.520]  themselves from that camp of Antifa because they don't want any of it
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:04.840]  sticking to them when Antifa starts their inevitable terrorism campaign that's
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.800]  powerful we should talk more about that it's important jump in yeah yeah and it's
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:13.480]  important to that the left wing for the first time not done by the mainstream
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:17.360]  media alternative media people who are listening and this is why when people go
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:20.920]  how do you join the information war is everybody listening in was calling Paul
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:25.600]  Ryan and calling Pelosi and said you need to disavow Antifa because if Trump
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:29.960]  has to disavow David Duke then you have to disavow Antifa the mainstream media
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:32.760]  was not calling for that and that's another reason the mainstream media is
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:37.520]  freaking out because they don't have the power now we've we've hijacked the
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:41.960]  mechanisms of the globalists in the machine where we're gonna make them
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:45.280]  disavow Antifa we're controlling the narrative now because we're pushing
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.160]  logic and people instantly buy into that because they already know it they know
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:55.480]  that Pelosi and all these other acronyms are our jokes yeah exactly so that's
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:58.720]  why when people listening in what can you do that's why the media wants people
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:03.480]  hopeless but Hurricane Harvey and of course you know John chime in here if
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:08.440]  you have anything to say about that is Hurricane Harvey proved that the American
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:12.640]  people have not quit it proved that the lies about Americans not loving each
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:17.120]  other are false and I think that Harvey is an opportunity for us to
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:24.120]  collectively level up let's come back because if if Harvey devastated the
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:28.560]  globalist race war division agenda their hate agenda they call us hate they're
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:32.720]  the ones who should hate then how important is this next battle we'll
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:36.280]  come back with James Leslie Rawls Mike Cernovich and more on the other side
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:46.200]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:01.400]  and information and in the last four or five years doing more more research I
[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:05.960]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:10.600]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:15.600]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:20.520]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:26.000]  to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other super food
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:31.320]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time

[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:17.760]  coming up after our guests leaves this game's closing rolls got Roger stones
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:22.200]  been on vacation for a week and a half much-deserved he'll be hosting the fourth
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:28.960]  hour and co-hosting the next three hours after that but Mike Cernovich is
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:32.800]  gonna be hosting an hour up as well but quarterbacking the whole thing in the big
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:38.560]  HD studio the new studio will be Owen shroyer and the reason I say HD studio
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:44.840]  for radio stations in HD audio HD video for syndication purposes and then we
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:49.160]  can have all these other guest hosts who are at remote locations sometimes not
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:54.080]  with the perfect HD audio we're building something really new here to tie in
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:59.120]  citizen journalist activist a Mike Cernovich loves roundtable shows war
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.000]  room a lot of hours left four or five people on it some days he won't be there
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  some days he will when every once he'll come to the show Roger stone will be on
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.600]  at least an hour every day we're going to have all these other broadcasts getting
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:14.600]  launched and the radio stations are really excited and starting to turn them
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:18.000]  on that's a big deal to launch a new show and already have radio stations
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.040]  David Knight's been off for two weeks already has three affiliates more than
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.080]  70 looking at signing agreements the problem is they always have six months
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:32.600]  a year long contracts with the big two networks that are out there and so we're
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:36.880]  looking at by end of year probably a hundred stations picking up David Knight
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:39.720]  hopefully I'm shooting for a big number and that's old-fashioned
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:44.280]  threshold radio but that's the original digital soapbox that's the place where
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:47.520]  they don't screen your calls and you reach big audiences and it's not
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:51.400]  controlled that's the old original outposts of what became the new
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:56.920]  independent media and I based what I've done on a talk radio TV format so that
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:00.320]  we're up here just giving you a basic breakdown of the latest news philosophy
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:03.960]  guest issues people that agree people that disagree and then pushing you
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.280]  towards news wars dot com that's our modern age the news wars and you of
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:13.240]  course you've got the fact that it's an info war a war on for your mind Mike
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:15.480]  Stern but you're talking about what James Wesley Rawls was just saying we're
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:19.440]  going back to him about how critical this is you said look next phase is
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:24.320]  false flag I totally agree with you as you went to break you were that's their
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:27.720]  only move we are kicking their butt they want to play the part of the victim
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:32.200]  they've been caught staging events or winding them up all three of the leaders
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:36.080]  of the white supremacist rally had worked for Obama and Hillary just in a
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:40.520]  year right right and so when I say false flag and this is important thing too
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:43.840]  because they like to twist it we're not saying these events don't happen exactly
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:48.160]  exactly it's about who's orchestrating the event so for example that all right
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:53.440]  United you right rally as we know now Jason Kessler was occupied person was a
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:57.240]  total infiltrator there's probably that was a false flag in the sense that no
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.760]  no there wasn't a horrific state department officials out there was
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:05.640]  terrible so it did happen but it was who was it it wasn't a natural organic
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:09.680]  gathering of patriots it was a fabrication so that's what I mean when I
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:15.800]  talk about a false flag I mean that what we're going to see is the ADL the SPLC
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:20.080]  deep state using people like Jason Kessler type so be it with their offshore
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:25.000]  mega counts we've now discovered exactly well over $200,000 in Bitcoin has been
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.840]  transferred to the Daily Stormer which is a marginal site well who who is doing
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.520]  that well we don't know but we do know the Southern Poverty Law Center is
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.920]  hiding millions of dollars offshore so is the Southern Poverty Law Center taking
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:41.520]  that money they are so-called public interest group no other public group
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.800]  like this has these quasi illegal accounts we need them to release the full
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:51.680]  records of their Mediterranean and and European but also Caribbean bank
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.560]  accounts right so they're taking that money they're funneling in it laundering
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:59.560]  it if you will and then they're using that money to fund websites like the
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.840]  Daily Stormer and other sites that make people the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:05.680]  got caught running the main white supremacist compound Elohim City and
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.920]  commanding it right well and that's what people people don't realize is that the
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:13.200]  SPLC is a history that's we're not just saying like oh I imagine they would no
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:16.920]  they've been caught doing it before and they're doing it now so that's why you
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:20.080]  take all that money you hide that money and then they can fund their little
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:24.760]  black ops to try to make everybody look while putting us in with Nazis a lot of
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:28.280]  them their own connections hoping one of their minions like they went into the
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:31.600]  focus on the family family research council and shot it up hoping we get
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:35.440]  killed yeah Floyd Lee Corkins very important name everybody in America should
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:39.320]  know the name Floyd Lee Corkins he went on the Southern Poverty Law Center's
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.680]  website found an hate list name and then went and committed a mass shooting
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.680]  wanted to murder people the media never demanded the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:51.440]  disavow this so that makes you wonder if the media supports it the media barely
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:56.760]  covered up the connection are they barely at the young Turks inspired a
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.480]  multiple mass shooters including the Seattle shooter I've documented this on
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:05.560]  my medium page proving that multiple mass shooters were then there's the young
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.680]  Turks then there's the young Turks and getting all their foreign offshore
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:13.880]  money from Gulf State dictatorships Qatar is what I've heard Qatar and in
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:18.320]  other tyrannies well they don't they don't deny it well I know that's so bad
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.880]  it was hard to believe when I first heard it I was like I wonder if this is
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:25.320]  fake news I had to actually look it up so they unabashedly take it and they've
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:28.920]  inspired Elliot Roger the Chula Vista shooter he went and killed a bunch of
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.760]  people near Santa Barbara he was a avid watcher and subscriber of the young
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:36.840]  Turks and again they're so arrogant when they talk about us they go somebody
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.560]  that nobody needs to talk about they don't even know their name but okay
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:42.360]  we're gonna talk about them I mean give me it's just they're so arrogant let's
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.480]  go back to James Wesley Rawls of Sir Vivalblog.com so you predicted all
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:50.880]  this up to now you heard us warned about false flags I mean what are their other
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.320]  moves what is your concern about false flags well I think there there definitely
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:00.160]  will be a lot of staged events if you look at what happened in Charlottesville
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:06.000]  there was obviously the the whole rent a crowd or rent a mob factor that came
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:10.800]  into play there I think they'll do more of that they'll probably use Bitcoin and
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:18.520]  other nefarious banking practices to try to cover their trail but you will
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:24.480]  still be able indirectly or at least post facto to follow the money and we'll
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.880]  see in these these false flag events these staged events more and more money
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:34.960]  being funneled to the most radical people they can find on the opposite side
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:41.480]  of the fence simply to stir the stir the pot simply to try to trigger an event
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:46.880]  that will play into their political agenda and the Southern Poverty Law
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.920]  Center which is not just demonized you but it's demonized me by name is is a
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:40:00.080]  prime candidate for that kind of action I would not put it past them what do you
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.800]  make of them having tens of millions in secret shady bank accounts offshore
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:11.280]  right and they've got that word chest available and they have no moral
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:15.680]  compunctions so they they don't have any reservations at all it handing that
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.520]  literally in the hands of neo-nazis handing it to them and saying you know
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:26.440]  that they could even do it anonymously now it is by the way they were running
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:29.920]  Elohim city that federal informants like howl and others when public about this
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.400]  there were a lot of deaths surrounding this about how they were in command of
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:36.600]  Elohim city and that's where of course Oklahoma City bombing came out of these
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.080]  people are hardcore and it was Eric Holder at the time Deputy Attorney General
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:43.760]  who got caught in the emails via lawsuits who was basically quarterbacking
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:55.760]  it amazing so what else is on your radar screen well I want to re-emphasize
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:02.960]  the importance of watching for the use of high technology by the Antifa
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.040]  terrorists I think because especially because a lot of their their young
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:12.400]  activists are technically savvy there's a very high likelihood that they're
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:18.680]  going to use cyber weapons or they're going to use high technology in weird
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:26.720]  combinations to inflict terror on a grand scale and as we mentioned before
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:31.800]  they may also try to attribute it to someone else to false flag the whole
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:38.280]  event so watch out for the use of high-tech of cyber weapons off the shelf
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:47.000]  equipment like drones and drones used in combination with non eye-safe lasers
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:56.160]  with chemical weapons bacteriological weapons new yet you may even nuclear
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:01.280]  material that doesn't reach critical mass just used as a dirty bomb but look
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:09.240]  for combinations of technologies to be used in unprecedented ways what about
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:12.440]  those that's uncertain but you're in the break and get the article here about
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:19.000]  all these TV shows spoofing patriots spoofing myself so they've chosen that
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.920]  having him say outrageous racist things and things and then hiding behind the
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:26.960]  fact that it's comedy but they're posing as news shows it's comedy and then
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:33.160]  they're defaming folks I think this is a form of identity theft well yeah
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:37.160]  certainly it is and it's one of those dirty tricks that they don't have any
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.800]  compunctions about using and if they can if they've they've already co-opted the
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:51.280]  mass media now they're they're basically fine-tuning it to use slurs and
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:58.240]  innuendos and false characterizations to do to do to meet their political goals
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:03.400]  and that's exactly what they've done to you as what they've done to me in my
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:10.080]  case it was guilt by non-association or even disassociation but I again that's
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:15.240]  the way they play that's the way their budgets operate and that's what we can
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:22.240]  expect more of in the future if anything I think they're going to amp it up but it
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:26.000]  seems the public is getting psychologically aware of this psychologically
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  immune to this I'm just concerned Mike certain which what do you think they're
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  going to try next I keep asking that because if everything they're doing is
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.360]  blowing up in their face what's going to come next then well they'll have another
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:42.840]  I mean think about the historical moment we were almost out with the James the
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:47.280]  Moore the Google attack on free speech we were about to have an elevated
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:51.880]  conversation on what free speech means and about diversity and tack and
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:57.760]  diversity of opinions so you always have those alt-right people that's who's
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.600]  who's used by these groups to go kill somebody have a rally have clan torch
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:06.560]  marches and everything so those right now are the most useful tools so I
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:11.440]  imagine that those people are planning another event so that somebody else can
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:14.200]  get killed or something else can happen and the media can point and say look
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:18.160]  look how bad these guys are and then they're going to try to tie us to those
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:21.600]  people that's the classic game so for example Soros they're trying to tie
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:26.320]  Tucker Carlson to all these morons because Tucker Carlson hosted Andrew
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.320]  Torb of the CEO of gab which is a free speech alternative to Twitter so the
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:35.800]  media the real conspiracy theorists now are actually the media because they'll
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:39.320]  say well wait a minute Tucker Carlson had the CEO of a tech company on a show
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:45.080]  oh but wait a minute some of the people who use gab dot AI are maybe not nice
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.800]  people therefore those not nice people Tucker really likes them and he's
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:53.160]  trying to promote them and everything so they've gone full conspiracy theory
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:57.000]  where nothing actually makes any sense if they say and that's why you just head
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:02.560]  on the heart of it not just by starting a race war they love that but their main
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.480]  objective is that the liberal media defines who you can have on who you
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:13.880]  can't have on and then basically bullies news core with this criticism into
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:19.120]  curtailing their most popular shows and thus shinking their enemy when it's the
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:23.560]  mouse that roared as you said earlier it's all just an intimidation and if you
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:27.360]  realize it's a fraud and don't blink it just totally dissipates you realize
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:31.440]  what a joke it is who cares of a bunch of scumbags and globalists call you a
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.920]  Nazi when you're not yeah they the no platforming is really what triggers the
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:39.360]  media's they'll go how dare Megan Kelly have Alex Jones on her how dare
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:42.640]  Sernovich appear on 60 minutes even though I gave them fifteen point one
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.640]  million views of the record since Barry and Michelle went on the first time so
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.520]  they want to control who is allowed to have a so-called platform so then what
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:54.840]  do we say we're free to mind we go well if they don't want to let us have a
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.400]  platform we'll go create our own platforms and now they're trying to kick
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:02.440]  us off of our platforms that's the next step but they're pushing too hard and
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:07.160]  they're pushing too aggressively and too viciously so ultimately we'll just have
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:11.440]  to exactly don't they get beyond the Streisand effect I'd call it the Beatles
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:15.840]  effect or whatever the Elvis effect oh my gosh you know they had a bunch of you
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:20.160]  know teenage age women throwing their bras and panties at Elvis you know a
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:23.440]  bunch of 18 year old girls well obviously those first events were staged
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:27.440]  with some actors to get the hysteria going for the video shoot for the film
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:31.200]  shoot to then hand it off to the media knowing everybody would run out and go
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:34.760]  oh my gosh look he's corrupting our young ladies knowing they'd all run out
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.760]  and buy Elvis records I mean don't they understand that that's what they're
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:41.360]  doing to us but see they think it doesn't matter because they're gonna
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:44.680]  completely shut us down they're not gonna even let us have a platform well I
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:49.000]  would print stuff out I'll show up and that's the difference between us and
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.680]  other people is I'll just show up to their houses I'll print out pamphlets
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:58.360]  I'll mass mail pamphlets all across the country they have no idea actually if
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.000]  they come after me I'm not gonna sell it's a private company they can do
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.560]  they can do whatever they want their private company they have no idea what
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:08.320]  they'll notice you had the idea of the nationwide Google demonstrations which
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:12.360]  everybody basically canceled because they went look Alex Jones of Dejecto
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:17.880]  Sobeck and Mike Cernovich they have this idea for alt-right Nazi rallies against
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:21.720]  Google and not just us the people that were all gonna sponsor it all chickened
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:25.480]  out I understand why because they're saying Nazis are coming here telling
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:29.400]  their idiot viewers and listeners that we're literal Nazis they march in there
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:34.080]  like you know PCP ads or somebody in a matrix and literally want to kill us
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.760]  because mainstream media told them we were Nazis well that's why the media
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:43.120]  gives all this coverage to the so-called alt-right I mean let's look at it
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:45.880]  we're the new right we're the new patriots with a new Renaissance I'm not
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:49.120]  even right wing exactly I've even I was even talking to somebody we're with
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.880]  this little movement I'm not even using right wing anymore because we've
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:57.800]  transcended this right left paradigm but the reason to think about this right
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:02.120]  how easy could you or I get four or five hundred people to show up a tweet yes
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:07.240]  easy right so they the alt-right got ten million dollars and free media coverage
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:10.480]  oh they're having this event and we'll be there and we'll give you free promotion
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:14.400]  promotion promotion was less than 200 of them yeah they get a few dopes to show
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:17.920]  up what were their numbers look tiny yeah and then most of them who showed up
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:21.600]  they were meeting the coverage anyway yeah media I was about to say than other
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:25.200]  people shows like Watson said we're the right after Hillary lost he said we are
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.600]  the new right we are not the alt-right is they define that to put anybody that's
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:33.280]  smart in that group and then call them all white supremacist in closing James
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.320]  Leslie Rawls thanks for coming on but you were dead on about Antifa other key
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:42.560]  things you'd like to impart to us well just watch the media and the way that
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:47.400]  they treat us in the next few months I think that they're just really getting
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.920]  started in their attempt to silence us but it's really gonna backfire for on
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:56.880]  them in their attempt to marginalize us they're actually going to draw more
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:02.720]  attention to the alternative media and when they try to demonize us we'll get
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:08.160]  more viewers when they try to demonetize us we'll get more viewers when they try
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:13.760]  to demote us in the search engine rankings we'll end up with more viewers
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:19.080]  and if they try to delete videos from YouTube for example there are
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:23.840]  going to be alternative platforms that pop up where folks like full 30 calm
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:28.600]  where where folks are going to go and find the content they really want to see
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:31.520]  that's right James let me bring the substance you raise it go ahead to
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.200]  marginalize us we're gonna backfire I agree but you just said it we could see
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:39.040]  it before World War two the Germans building up on the Polish border and
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:42.800]  others everybody new world was coming here they're launching all these new TV
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:46.840]  shows as I said misrepresenting who I am all launching now they're not doing
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.400]  that for nothing I agree it's not even that I'm this big leader they're
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.480]  choosing this fake straw man of myself to make it the image of the Liberty
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:59.280]  movement to try to destroy that fake image and then tie it to whatever false
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:01.720]  flags I think they've got ready and I think they're gonna bomb federal
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:04.560]  buildings and stuff I think they're gonna not just do it at Charlottesville I
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.480]  think they're gonna kill a bunch of people mass shootings you name it the
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:11.800]  guy gets shot he's got a backpack pull of you know every Liberty Lovers
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:15.960]  newspaper magazine or article or film I think that's what's gonna happen well
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:21.160]  they had a guy unite the right pull out his gun fires weapon and say a very bad
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:26.320]  word to a person that's what they do they wanted to what they want to do is
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:30.680]  they wanted to trigger a response so so the way you do it is smart the way they
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:35.720]  do it is they bring in somebody to create chaos hoping then that that'll
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:39.840]  create a mob rule of fact because we keep catching them in the scientific false
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.000]  flags where they really do it well James Wesley we're all survival blog

[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:19.120]  a break because they're gonna be interviewing me for the film you're
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:23.480]  producing while you go on and co-host with Owen some in the new studio we're
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:26.080]  building a whole another studio right out here it'll be done in about three
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:32.440]  months that way I can have other shows going out and other breaking news and
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:36.760]  there with reporters while we're in here and vice versa we cover a lot of them
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:39.760]  I knew show the news but a lot of days well you said we get big picture and the
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:43.120]  globalists are getting their butt handed to them and if there is a big terror
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:47.720]  attack chemical attack biological attack radiological attack something that you
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.040]  know is in your area videotape everybody get details enough of you do that it's
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:55.200]  why they've backed off Oklahoma City style events because they got caught by
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:58.880]  people in the building folks know to look at the feds the local cops remember
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:02.520]  who was there they named FBI agents they even use German intelligence a lot of
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:05.720]  times when you commit crimes in this your own country use foreign assets like
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:09.040]  an agreement but they have the NSA in England spying on citizens here in
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:13.160]  vice versa so it's a swap situation so Mike Cernovich I could not reiterate
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.520]  enough that yes we're having big victories but they're trying to stall the
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:19.640]  economy they're trying to block the recovery they're trying to encircle Trump
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:23.040]  let's come back from break in a moment and talk about the fact that we love the
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:25.800]  Trump agenda we love the fact that we got him in there he's better than Hillary
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:30.600]  but they are starting to slow him down and encircle him and you know is he
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:34.560]  kind of halfway starting to give up to the deep state just because he's
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.840]  waiting for a breakout in Congress we'll talk to you in a moment about that but
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:42.800]  first off we need to support the broadcast and I'm not complaining I love

[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:02.320]  see how great it is infowarsstore.com Mike Srinivas let's start getting into the
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.120]  Trump agenda where it is where you see him going because a lot of great things
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:09.720]  are happening but Bannon and others say that no you're about to see a mainline
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.480]  president a mainline Republican compared to what you saw is that them kind of
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:16.960]  sour grapes because they got kicked out or what's happening well Trump just
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:20.680]  agreed to raise the debt ceiling limit for the next three months so he already
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:26.440]  unfortunately gave them that deal that that just broke an hour or two ago this
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:31.440]  so what happened so he he wants to be liked I think by Schumer and those
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:34.800]  people as a fundamental human need Trump that's the thing about Trump is he's an
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:39.600]  amazing historical figure but he still has the foibles that all humans have
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:45.480]  which is that it is hard to not be liked it is a hard to be hated you you want to
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:48.480]  appeal to people of hatred say well why do you hate me I want you to understand
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:52.800]  me I want you to know that I'm not this caricature that you create and if you
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:57.280]  lack moral certainty and a philosophical grounding that what you're doing is
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:01.200]  virtuous true and good then you're more susceptible to the mind control but he's
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:05.400]  great better than anybody I know at not blinking and moving forward he did the
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:09.680]  right thing on DACA it's an order by Clinton by Obama it's illegal it's
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:13.680]  letting criminals and child molesters stay here free he told Congress fix it
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:16.560]  where it's really people you know came here when they were young who aren't
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:20.400]  criminals have a vetting and I'll do it that's very liberal but but they're
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:23.400]  calling him the demon so he did the right thing there though yeah but they're
[02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:26.160]  saying he didn't do the right thing because they know that it's gonna be
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:31.000]  very hard to fix this in Congress with the 2018 midterms coming up sure so stay

[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:30.760]  why are you having them on some people don't like him what I care about is
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:34.800]  getting results breaking hundreds of news stories that nobody else had from
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:38.320]  real sources and even having the enemy media come out and say okay this guy's
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:41.800]  for real but all the fakes out there that kind of sit upon their mountains
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:48.000]  they just go oh Mike Cernovich he's a troll you know again that's how they set
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.640]  themselves up and don't have to be successful in the media they just
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:56.360]  pontificate like George will saying oh we don't care how you vote for Trump
[03:00:56.360 --> 03:01:00.560]  we'll just set it aside because we are the Republican Party that was just him
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:05.800]  trying to act arrogant in a con game of Kabuki theater like we'd all just go to
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:10.000]  sleep because he did that well is that haughty smug I mean for example where's
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.280]  that dumb article you you show me earlier is that haughty smug dismissive
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:18.040]  where they think if here's here's what they're doing to try to satirize Alex
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:22.760]  Jones the show is tagline not mainstream not establishment not helping
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:26.640]  that's so obvious it's not even humor humor has to have an element of so not
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:30.160]  helping yeah but everybody knows they're sick of the establishment right but
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:34.040]  they they just drip with smugness and dismissiveness where they go well you
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:38.000]  know Cernovich is a troll well who are you to call me that's what I always ask
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.040]  people as I go who are you to call me anything who are you to call me a troll
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:45.200]  but I mean it's the same thing we're involved actually raising millions and
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:48.560]  and and have crew down there doing all this stuff for Hurricane Harvey and the
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:51.880]  rest of it they're the ones trying to turn into a race war trying to snipe the
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:55.080]  president for handing stuff out but they say we're not helping no because
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:58.680]  everything they say about us remember it's them well it's projection of course
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:04.000]  and it is a they're trying to elevate their social status visa visa us and but
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.800]  all I got to tell it all the haters out here watching you I know they all cry
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:09.680]  see the emails you think me and Alex don't talk I can't believe you have
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:13.680]  a Cernovich on well they all do that again to virtue signal and bully us into
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:16.400]  who we can talk to right when people tell me not to have some money on I have
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:20.040]  one more yeah exactly and people have told me not to go on your show and I'm
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.200]  like get out of here man what is wrong with that's the thing is divide and
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:27.720]  conquer that they try to use but when I was at the airport and in Orange County
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:31.800]  as I'm leaving hey how you doing Mike you know good to meet you a big fan or
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:35.760]  whatever take picture I land I leave the airport in Austin to get to my Uber and
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:39.680]  somebody goes Mike I just want to say hi how are you and go to the coffee shop
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:43.400]  the guy's like Mike right here you know this coffee's on me so I got bad news
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:47.240]  like my club it's like my club everywhere we're everywhere that the network
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:51.000]  knows of higher consciousness people are everywhere so the haters can groan and
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.560]  grimace and cry the reason they're they're mad because they want to dominate
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:03:00.160]  the big wireless internet that is the human mind exactly and they sense
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:03.040]  energy now when their parents are sharing this stuff their grandparents are
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:06.440]  sharing this stuff that the people are waking up people are looking around and
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:11.480]  figuring out but but my advice to the haters is rather than try to tear down
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:14.800]  Alex or me or divide and conquer which does it doesn't work go out and do
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:17.640]  something for yourself your own message focus on your own and by the way they
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:22.280]  think we're saying that because they're hurting us and we want them to fail no
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:26.600]  we you're hurting yourself and the entire collective by the way you're
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:30.680]  behaving admit we've been right about everything admit that you misconstrue it
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:35.320]  we say so you can have a fight with a straw man if I have a pinata of Mike
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:39.520]  Tyson and I beat it up I didn't beat up Mike Tyson it's called fantasy land and
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:42.880]  you're the ones that are in it so many listeners go Alex why are you always
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:47.200]  talking to your detractors worry because of the prodigal son the the main
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:50.160]  audience is already awakened smarter than I am on most cases we have to reach
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:54.040]  out to the zombies but some of them are too hateful and know they've been lied
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:58.680]  to and tell you hey we revel in being losers what do you do about them those
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:03.480]  people unfortunately are lost but the rising tide will lift all boats so that
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:08.760]  the very negative hateful people will still rise up if we collectively as
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:14.880]  people as a species as a consciousness as a mind as an entity as part of God
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:20.600]  which is all around us and everywhere if we elevate everyone else the losers
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:23.920]  are going to rise up with us so that is why we do our haters and losers are

[03:09:17.400 --> 03:09:22.800]  room which i think is going to be a real blockbuster in terms of fighting back
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:27.560]  against the mainstream media and their constant war of lies and disinformation
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:31.440]  and i don't want to give people a false sense we're winning because this is the
[03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:34.920]  storm came in and discredited them and show unity but they're going to launch
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:39.080]  back with false flags mike and i really believe something oklahoma city level or
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:42.680]  worse you can see it they got all these tv shows and i'm not bringing this up
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:45.960]  because it's about me i'm never even play the promos for these shows all these
[03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:51.400]  hbo and comedy central shows where they admit this characters alex jones then
[03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:54.600]  they have the characters say horrible things i never said this shows they've
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:58.680]  got something big planned this fall you can see the military buildup
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:03.280]  information warfare wise roger what do you think's coming and plus you i know
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:08.040]  you live in florida part of the year are you ready for our first category six in
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:16.240]  history well alex i have evacuated florida taken my wife my dogs my cats my
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:21.920]  children my grandchildren and we have decamped to washington dc probably go to
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:26.400]  new york at the end of the week governor rick scott has called a state
[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:31.720]  emergency for the entire state forced me to cancel a book signing i had with the
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:36.280]  great milo that was planned for this saturday that's been rescheduled till
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:43.720]  october at fifteen so we're as ready as we can be we batten down the hatches in
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:49.560]  florida what surprises me about the left is the fact that they just have no sense
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:55.320]  of shame last night watching the former director of intelligence james clapper
[03:10:55.320 --> 03:10:59.240]  on cnn with anderson cooper now clapper is a man
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:05.480]  who got caught red-handed lying about the governor the government's uh... nsa
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.680]  metadata collection system he insisted under oath before the congress
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:15.000]  there was no such program until of course the disclosures of edward
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.840]  snowden proved that he was a liar and he was forced to backtrack in the face of
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:25.640]  a possible perjury charge so the question you have to ask yourself is
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:31.560]  why would cnn interview such a person why would anything they say
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:35.560]  be held to be true or credible it's amazing
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:39.240]  how the left just has no sense of shame they're so busy
[03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:45.320]  attacking malania trumps shoes that they don't pay attention to the record of
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:48.840]  distortion of a man like clapper and by the way roger
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:52.040]  uh... that's the reason i held over i'm glad you reminded me why decided to
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:57.160]  hang into your hour here and that's because look at how cnn has
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:00.680]  been forced to admit that they basically had most of russian investigation
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:04.600]  killed now because they got caught plagiarizing making stuff up
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:07.080]  talking to witnesses that never told them the things
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:11.400]  that's in the hill that's in politico that's in daily caller today
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:15.160]  uh... so this whole thing's unraveling and then again this on the heels
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:18.760]  of last week as you mentioned in congressional testimony
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:22.760]  it's now admitted that comey cleared the clinton's and even told them and wrote
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:26.520]  them a letter before he ever interviewed them showing it was a complete
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:31.160]  and total absolute one hundred percent fraud
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:34.920]  caught red-handed the guy is his own leaker committing crimes
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:38.680]  lying and saying he didn't uh... you know have notes that admitting he did that's
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:41.320]  lying to congress then uh... saying well i don't have to give it to
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:43.720]  international security attorney general he did
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:47.880]  i mean it's just legions of fraud these people though keep operating like
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:50.840]  they're invincible sessions has gotten a little stronger on it
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:55.000]  but i agree with the president where is sessions these people are ridiculous
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  criminals muhler is a fraud and an absolute sycophantic joke
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.040]  and comey is a moron idiot criminal tarmac meeting criminal
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:07.240]  i couldn't agree with you more alex i don't understand why
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:11.000]  attorney general sessions has not convened a grand jury and brought an
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:14.600]  indictment against james comey for obstruction of justice
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:18.760]  it's as clear as the nose on my face and that's pretty prominent
[03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:21.400]  in this case we go all the way back to the
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:24.600]  faissa court declarations in november
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:28.520]  that prove without dispute that the entire
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:33.560]  front line of the nsa under obama clapper rogers brennan
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:39.320]  at all rights were illegally surveilling spying on as many as
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:43.560]  thirty thousand americans that list would include donald from
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:49.000]  roger stone malania trump avanka trump paul manifor
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:52.440]  the list goes on and on this is wholesale spying
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:59.640]  use of government authority and assets for spying for political purposes
[03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:03.640]  it's a classic criminal indictment so
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:08.120]  where is sessions is he asleep let me ask her to this question then you know
[03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:10.840]  that i'm and i'm gonna eject because you're gonna be back on the war room
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:13.880]  later today as well it kicks off in about 45 minutes and in full wars dot
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:16.200]  com forward slash show and news wars dot com
[03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:19.400]  forward slash show mic service where do you think the russian things going because
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:23.080]  the word is it's sputtered out it's over there is no evidence it's made up
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:26.440]  okay some lawyer asked about a real estate deal they have hundreds of them
[03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:29.800]  going at any one time and okay someone's looking for dirt on hillary
[03:14:29.800 --> 03:14:32.920]  meanwhile hillary's up to her eyeballs in russian collusion
[03:14:32.920 --> 03:14:37.160]  yeah i've actually got stuff i probably can't share right now but
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:40.520]  based on the people that i know received subpoenas recently
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:44.120]  i know that they have nothing on russia because what they're looking at
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:47.320]  is so delusional and so far-fetched it bordered out
[03:14:47.320 --> 03:14:51.480]  Mueller is america's number one conspiracy theorist now
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:55.000]  because this whole russia stuff based on what they're looking at based on high
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.880]  level sources it's so off the wall it's so bizarre
[03:14:57.880 --> 03:15:01.960]  it would be like they went to the coffee shop where you have coffee
[03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:04.200]  and they go in and they start interviewing people because you're there
[03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:06.840]  every day and it's has anybody ever seen oh yeah that's in the news where
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:09.960]  they're tell folks about the harassment they're contacting
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:12.520]  not just all the folks that ever lived in the trump towers they're going after
[03:15:12.520 --> 03:15:15.800]  all those other business contacts yeah they they found out all the people who
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:20.200]  were members of the trump golf club and they've created a database
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:23.320]  usa today to this they're created a database of people who
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:27.640]  they're a sole crime is that they were a member of trumps golf club
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:31.400]  and of course as we know this is stalking yeah it's stalking harassment
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:34.920]  they will use this to docks people and then here's what they're going to say
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:37.560]  well i mean we haven't released a list jest
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:41.080]  but uh yeah but now what they're doing is they're letting the loonies know
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:44.440]  hey you can go recreate this list on your own
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:48.760]  wink wink nod nod here's where they play baseball the new york times says
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:51.720]  and then oh hashtag hunt republicans it's so clear
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:55.160]  how they're how these wimps are trying to when i call Mueller a criminal he
[03:15:55.160 --> 03:15:57.240]  covered up for the cleanse he covered up for the bushes
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:15:59.800]  the guy's a joke now he's going after trump for nothing
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:04.440]  Mike mcsternich closing comments yeah i mean comey's a criminal
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:07.560]  as we know we need more people like roger stone the white house jeff sessions
[03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:09.720]  i love the guy but he's just out of touch
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.080]  he's too worried about marijuana we need him
[03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:17.160]  to focus on getting in tifa people thrown into prison where they belong
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:21.880]  declaring them a riko enterprise and using the riko act to break up in tifa
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:25.320]  just like they broke up the mob this has to be done this has to be a priority
[03:16:25.320 --> 03:16:28.680]  we're always honest with the audience i'm gonna skip this break so roger has more
[03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:33.400]  time and the 50 break as well but the big
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:37.480]  question here is we don't want to just sit here and bash trump but on the
[03:16:37.480 --> 03:16:40.600]  empty understand thing he went back and what he said his instincts were
[03:16:40.600 --> 03:16:44.040]  but he also said he listened to the generals um he said he wanted to decriminalize
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:46.920]  marijuana he's kind of like sessions run around you know with like
[03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:51.080]  reefer madness 2.0 this is crazy uh he is saying
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:54.920]  wiki leaks is horrible and criminal when that's who got him elected more than
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:58.360]  matt roger even info wars or roger stone or you i mean let's just say
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:02.840]  julien assange uh and and and the patriots who aren't exposing our secrets
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:06.840]  are exposing criminal activity and then now
[03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:09.480]  with some of the things he's doing clearly he's a million times better than
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:12.760]  hillary we love him he's so strong he did what he said he do on dakka
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:16.200]  because what obama was doing is criminal he wants him to reform the program
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:19.240]  but there are some signs and mike's saying there's some signs and
[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:23.160]  bannon has said there's evidence that trump is basically starting
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:27.080]  to capitulate to the republic of establishment
[03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:30.600]  is that really fair to say roger stone and i'm gonna turn this over to you thank
[03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:34.840]  you alex i think to answer your question
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:40.600]  more so in the realm of foreign policy than the realm of domestic policy
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:45.800]  absolutely clear that the president is dedicated to building the wall
[03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:50.120]  pardon me it's also absolutely clear that he is adamant about a 15
[03:17:50.120 --> 03:17:53.160]  percent corporate tax rate for american businesses
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:57.560]  big and small my opinion this is the absolute cornerstone
[03:17:57.560 --> 03:18:01.320]  of the trump revival this is the cornerstone of the success
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:04.360]  of his presidency it would buy him both time
[03:18:04.360 --> 03:18:07.560]  and capital to fix the country's other problems
[03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:12.280]  so i think i give him an a plus on the area of domestic policy
[03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:17.400]  uh he clearly is uh keeping his pledge in that area where i'm concerned
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:22.040]  is the growing influence of the generals what i call the seven day and may crowd
[03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:26.440]  general mattis general mcmaster who has direct ties to george
[03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:31.880]  soros who worked for a think tank financed by soros prior to his white
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:34.840]  house service who's in the white house at the
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:38.840]  severance of jared kushner the president's
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:42.520]  son-in-law and who in no way is committed to the trump
[03:18:42.520 --> 03:18:46.760]  doctrine abroad of avoiding international conflicts where
[03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:51.640]  our inherent national interest is not clear so i give the president an a on
[03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:56.360]  domestic policy at this point i'm concerned after the afghanistan
[03:18:56.360 --> 03:19:00.360]  announcements that the neo cons who seem to have
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:06.360]  post flin infiltrated the foreign policy apparatus of the trump administration
[03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:11.480]  are beginning to show their muscle in that area i think when we look back on it
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:17.560]  we will see that the dismissal of flin is a seminal moment in terms of the
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:23.000]  neo cons making a comeback in foreign policy
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:26.920]  the other point that i i guess i would make today that i think is
[03:19:26.920 --> 03:19:33.720]  topical is that i filed with the court in the district of columbia my response
[03:19:33.720 --> 03:19:38.360]  to the lawsuit by obama and his cohorts in which the president
[03:19:38.360 --> 03:19:45.560]  and his campaign and i were sued for allegedly colluding with the russians
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:52.920]  to hack the email of the dnc and to give that information to wiki lakes
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:57.160]  we filed in the court yesterday i think it's pretty well covered in the media
[03:19:57.160 --> 03:20:02.440]  today making the point that they can't even prove that the dnc
[03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:06.840]  was hacked never mind that it was hacked by the russians
[03:20:06.840 --> 03:20:10.200]  or that i had anything to do with it this is a
[03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:14.920]  lawsuit that is being utilized for fundraising purposes
[03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:21.080]  it's a fraud upon the court they provide no evidence whatsoever of collusion
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:26.440]  with the russians by myself or donald trump or his campaign
[03:20:26.440 --> 03:20:30.520]  so we have moved to dismiss we have also
[03:20:30.520 --> 03:20:37.080]  planned to to pursue sanctions by the court against the long
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:41.480]  list of august white shoe left-wing lawyers
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:44.760]  who've had the bad judgment to append their name
[03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:48.760]  to this piece of crap it's a harassment lawsuit
[03:20:48.760 --> 03:20:52.040]  we broke this story right here at info wars dot com
[03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:55.800]  only several weeks ago i'll be honest with you alex
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:20:59.240]  and my info warriors i wear it as a badge of honor
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:03.560]  being attacked by barack obama and the clintons that's a badge of honor you've
[03:21:03.560 --> 03:21:07.080]  seen it in the case of mike sernovich you've seen it in the case of alex
[03:21:07.080 --> 03:21:09.640]  jones you've seen it in the case of my friend jack
[03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:13.240]  jumpin jack flash bassobiac when they attack you
[03:21:13.240 --> 03:21:18.280]  it means that you are effective it means that you're getting under their skin
[03:21:18.280 --> 03:21:23.000]  and it means that we're winning and that is very specifically
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:26.600]  i think what bothers them the other piece of
[03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:31.560]  very concerning news coming out of washington
[03:21:31.560 --> 03:21:35.000]  is the the word that keith schiller
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:40.280]  longtime bodyguard and confidant of president donald trump
[03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:45.160]  will be leaving the administration now keith schiller is a man i've known for
[03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:49.480]  a number of years he is a patriot he is the man
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:53.480]  who sees donald trump last at night and first thing in the morning
[03:21:53.480 --> 03:21:58.120]  he is the man who keeps one eye on the crowd and the other eye on the
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:01.880]  other bodyguards including the secret service
[03:22:01.880 --> 03:22:05.720]  he is a man who always has the best interests
[03:22:05.720 --> 03:22:09.560]  and confidentiality of donald trump at heart
[03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:14.120]  and i fear that he is being squeezed out by general kelly
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:18.520]  i know uh as of this morning that kelly has gone to the president and
[03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:23.160]  complained about roger stone i haven't even warmed up on him yet
[03:22:23.160 --> 03:22:27.080]  so i'm not sure what he's complaining about but i do know this
[03:22:27.080 --> 03:22:31.720]  squeezing keith schiller out a man who is protecting the president
[03:22:31.720 --> 03:22:37.640]  with his life is an ominous sign but the reason that they are moving schiller
[03:22:37.640 --> 03:22:41.000]  out is the same reason they moved steve bannon
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:47.160]  and anthony scaramucci out these men all had independent access to the president
[03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:50.840]  of the united states they all had the ability to speak to the
[03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:55.400]  president at will and that is what scares general kelly
[03:22:55.400 --> 03:22:58.920]  so much you see he'd like to isolate the president
[03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:02.440]  he'd like to completely control what the president reads
[03:23:02.440 --> 03:23:07.080]  what he sees who he meets with who he talks to on the telephone
[03:23:07.080 --> 03:23:11.000]  he'd like to control where the president goes and where he can't go
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:14.760]  and that in my opinion completely misunderstands
[03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:20.840]  donald jay trump i fear for the president's safety if a man like keith
[03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:24.280]  schiller is not in the white house at his side
[03:23:24.280 --> 03:23:28.520]  i have no illusions having written a book about the kennedy assassination
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:32.680]  about the flaws in our national security operation
[03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:38.520]  including the u.s secret service i'm not saying that every secret service
[03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:41.800]  agent is not a patriotic american trying to do their job
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:45.400]  the great majority in fact i would say virtually all of them are
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:49.240]  i'm worried about corruption at the top of that agency
[03:23:49.240 --> 03:23:52.920]  just as i worry about corruption at the top of the fbi
[03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:56.360]  and i worry about corruption at the top of the cia
[03:23:56.360 --> 03:24:00.280]  i'm not trying to disparage the patriotism of the rank and file men and women
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:04.040]  who work for those agencies who are merely trying to do their job and serve
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:07.080]  their country but without keith schiller
[03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:10.040]  keeping a watchful eye on the president's back
[03:24:10.040 --> 03:24:15.000]  in all honesty i think the president is in grave grave danger
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:19.480]  the way the establishment works is first they try to defeat you
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:23.160]  they can't do that they try to discredit you then they try to
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:27.080]  co-opt you if they cannot co-opt you then they try
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:30.920]  to remove you we saw this in the instance of president
[03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:34.040]  richard nixon we saw it in the instance of president
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:38.520]  john f kennedy and it is not beyond the realm of possibility
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:44.760]  in the instances of president donald j trump if he stands in the way of the
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:48.920]  war machine if he stands in the way of the neocons who so
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:55.160]  desperately want war over syria uh then he poses a real
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:25:01.320]  obstacle to their money making agenda to their internationalist agenda
[03:25:01.320 --> 03:25:06.440]  donald trump standing up for american sovereignty for american exceptionalism
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:13.320]  for american nationalism is a real chink uh in the game plan
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:17.400]  of the nationalists who had already decided that they were going to have a
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:23.480]  jeb bush versus hillary clinton election heads i win tails you lose
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:27.240]  policies identical rhetorical flourishes
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:30.920]  uh uh strain to appear that there's some
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:34.840]  differences but in truth all selling us the same
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:41.080]  old globalist crap along comes down from the preeminent
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:48.200]  outsider controlled by no one beholden to no special interest
[03:25:48.200 --> 03:25:53.480]  owing no one for his election other than the american people
[03:25:53.480 --> 03:25:57.240]  and now having gotten rid of ryan's previous
[03:25:57.240 --> 03:26:04.360]  under whom absolute chaos ensued while perhaps the president likes the pace
[03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:07.560]  a little better in the organization a little better
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:12.680]  but i can tell you that at the end of the day i'm confident that he will chase
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:16.440]  at the attempts by general kelly to control him
[03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:21.560]  to control his information flow particularly in fact we know that he has
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:26.200]  already chewed kelly out having read in politico
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:29.560]  where the general actually goes public and announces
[03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:33.800]  that he intends to try to isolate the president announces that he attends to
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:39.960]  try to keep him entirely in the dark so i think kelly will
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:44.600]  ultimately go the way of those previously who have not
[03:26:44.600 --> 03:26:48.120]  understood that donald trump is his own man
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:52.600]  that donald trump is a free spirit that donald trump will not be
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:58.280]  managed controlled handled and the more he reads about those attempts
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:04.680]  the more likely his rebellion will be now probably be a very good time to
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:09.560]  also mention that we are not uh in a position where we have
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:13.960]  multi-million dollar checkwriters like the ford foundation or the rocker
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:18.200]  feller foundation or george soros financing our broadcasts here at info

[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:55.160]  voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or
[03:31:55.160 --> 03:31:59.400]  five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite
[03:31:59.400 --> 03:32:02.440]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our
[03:32:02.440 --> 03:32:07.000]  ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:10.280]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:32:10.280 --> 03:32:14.360]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i
[03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:17.400]  set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[03:33:03.320 --> 03:33:10.520]  it's roger stone
[03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:15.800]  welcome back i'm roger stone and i'm as you can see here with
[03:33:15.800 --> 03:33:22.120]  jack pastovic who is going to be joining me at the
[03:33:22.120 --> 03:33:28.280]  on the war room later today jack had some observations on DACA which i think is
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:33.960]  the best place for us to begin jack what is your
[03:33:33.960 --> 03:33:38.200]  assessment of the current political situation regarding DACA
[03:33:38.200 --> 03:33:42.280]  roger i think it's interesting the timing of when the DACA decision is going
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:45.160]  to come down to so we're seeing now that because of the
[03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:48.200]  six month extension which has been granted by the administration with
[03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:52.200]  sessions and trump to this that we're now looking at an early 2018
[03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:56.280]  decision from the congress regarding an extension regarding any
[03:33:56.280 --> 03:33:59.800]  legislation so politically speaking on the calendar that's
[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:04.600]  going to be right in all of the primaries coming up with congress we've
[03:34:04.600 --> 03:34:07.800]  already looked at this uh some people out there have launched what they're
[03:34:07.800 --> 03:34:12.200]  calling revolution 18 a primary against the never trumpers
[03:34:12.200 --> 03:34:16.200]  and now this DACA issue this issue of amnesty and let's be clear
[03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:19.560]  that when we're talking about DACA we're not talking about children these are
[03:34:19.560 --> 03:34:23.880]  on average 26 year old the majority of them are young adults
[03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:28.600]  um that now the republicans in congress who are going to be facing
[03:34:28.600 --> 03:34:33.160]  a slew of primary challengers from trump republicans
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:36.280]  from people who are on board with the america first agenda
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:41.000]  are now going to have to put their name to paper on whether or not they are yes
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:44.280]  or no on this amnesty well my concern though is
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:47.320]  has to do with the atmospherics of this issue
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:51.720]  it's never good to be in a position in politics where you are depicted
[03:34:51.720 --> 03:34:57.960]  as being against children uh look i'm an immigration hardliner i think it is
[03:34:57.960 --> 03:35:01.960]  absolutely essential that the president build of a wall
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:07.320]  but at the same time i think that uh this is an issue in which i would have
[03:35:07.320 --> 03:35:12.520]  sought some compromise but let me go a step further the president's message
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:17.320]  appears to be muddled he made a number of comments
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:20.760]  prior to the announcement of the decision about
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:24.680]  approaching this with heart with compassion not being against
[03:35:24.680 --> 03:35:28.600]  the children then he appeared to just toss the ball
[03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:33.080]  to the congress without comment saying what's their problem let them
[03:35:33.080 --> 03:35:38.600]  solve it uh and now today he's saying well if they don't solve it
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:42.520]  i'll revisit it what does that mean i'm not sure
[03:35:42.520 --> 03:35:46.600]  what that means so the administration's response
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:52.440]  to me seems to be muddled uh and if we're going to fight out the 2018 elections
[03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:57.240]  i'd rather fight it out on the basis of economic growth
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:02.440]  and the tax cut to me there's an issue that allows you to cross over
[03:36:02.440 --> 03:36:05.960]  to working class and blue collar democrats so-called
[03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:10.600]  trump democrats uh and where you can take on
[03:36:10.600 --> 03:36:14.440]  the two-party duopoly take on the leadership of the republicans
[03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:19.640]  and the democrats who stand in the way of your pro-growth your dynamic pro-growth
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:22.520]  agenda i'd much rather spend the election talking
[03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:27.000]  about that and talking about DACA what sort of things do you think can be on
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:31.080]  the table for the president it seems like he's offering DACA
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:34.040]  to the democrats it seems like he may be offering this
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:37.320]  what does he want in exchange what are some of the things that he could ask for
[03:36:37.320 --> 03:36:40.680]  exchange not only from the democrats but of course the establishment
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:43.160]  republicans well let's start with funding for the wall
[03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:47.960]  which they seem to be a recalcitrant about here's an opportunity to get the
[03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:51.640]  funding on the wall and return for some kind of compromise
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:56.280]  on DACA i'd believe you could probably put other restrictions on the program
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:37:00.040]  uh maybe he can even horse trade votes for his 15 percent
[03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:04.120]  tax rate for american businesses big and small
[03:37:04.120 --> 03:37:08.200]  uh still i believe the key to the president's reelection the voters will
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:12.200]  give him enormous license if he can revitalize
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:18.680]  and re-energize the economy also in the news today the trial of
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:23.240]  senator robert menendez senior democrat that's kind of funny because i didn't
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:25.640]  see that in the news today was that in the news
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:29.960]  it's amazing i heard that it started does not appear to be on the front page
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:34.600]  of the new york times now i think so now we did learn last week that among
[03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:38.520]  senator menendez's most active fundraisers are the
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.600]  republican consultant in a navarro wait a minute
[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:46.040]  why would a republican be out raising money for
[03:37:46.040 --> 03:37:49.560]  senator bob menendez who the government now tells us
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:55.560]  the evidence shows that his corruption scheme went on for over 20 years
[03:37:55.560 --> 03:37:59.720]  and this is someone the great people at life's that went actually dug deep into
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:02.360]  anna navarro's background found that she had donated
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:06.520]  20 000 dollars to democrats over the years
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:10.440]  and her don't she says well i donated to bob menendez a few times
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:15.080]  anna you held actual fundraisers three times
[03:38:15.080 --> 03:38:18.360]  for bob menendez during the course of this corruption
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:22.520]  so we've already saw that this corruption trial is ensnaring
[03:38:22.520 --> 03:38:25.880]  a lot of what they're calling sort of the old core the old establishment
[03:38:25.880 --> 03:38:30.760]  democrat party to include harry reid now we're seeing that it's going to ensnare
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:35.240]  a lot of people to include anna navarro and other touchpoints on anyone
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:40.200]  who had also been donated to by this uh this this dirty it's looking ophthalmologist
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:42.760]  who by the way has already been convicted of fraud
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:46.680]  in florida uh melgan now it looks like
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:51.000]  there are going to be more questions regarding who knew what
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:55.800]  about menendez who knew what when did they know it what was going on at these
[03:38:55.800 --> 03:39:00.280]  fundraisers were these fundraisers held down in the dominican republic
[03:39:00.280 --> 03:39:04.440]  at this guy's resort place where they're where they held a lot of this stuff
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:09.000]  most of these completely unreported by senator menendez himself but of course
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:12.200]  you're not going to hear any of that today from the mainstream media
[03:39:12.200 --> 03:39:15.720]  it's not going to be leading uh trending topics on twitter
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:19.720]  or facebook or google algorithms aren't going to be bringing up very much
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:22.520]  instead they're probably going to find an issue like i don't know melania
[03:39:22.520 --> 03:39:25.960]  stilettos or something something vital now it's interesting
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:31.560]  that the uh the menendez investigation has led us to learn a lot of things about
[03:39:31.560 --> 03:39:36.040]  anna navarro when she wasn't busy giving to bob menendez she was donating
[03:39:36.040 --> 03:39:40.360]  deborah waserman schultz it also appears that she was acting as an
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:44.360]  immigration attorney in her earlier years without ever being a member
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:49.960]  of the florida bar we know based on a new york times article she was fired
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:55.800]  by the jeb bush administration for falsely claiming to be an attorney
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:59.560]  if you look at her bio at the uh kennedy school at harvard
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:03.560]  it's very curious she says she got her undergrad from university miami
[03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:07.640]  and then it says in one sentence she later got her jurist doctorate
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:12.040]  why wouldn't she mention the name of the school where she allegedly got it
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:15.320]  looks to me like more research needs to be done
[03:40:15.320 --> 03:40:19.080]  i was really heartened to see my friend michael caputo challenge her
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:24.120]  on cnn on her question of her republican credential how did she respond to mr
[03:40:24.120 --> 03:40:26.600]  caputo's line of questioning she went directly to jeff
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:30.440]  zucker and complained as she always does about anyone whether it's ed martin
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:35.160]  who's appeared here many times at info wars dot com or michael caputo
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:38.840]  if you get in her face she will go to management and make sure
[03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:42.760]  that you're never booked again she seems to be untouchable
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:47.400]  the point of course is as i revealed here at info wars only days ago
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:51.160]  jeff zucker's tenure at cnn is tenuous at best
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:55.800]  that i believe that when the merger goes through in which at&t
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:41:02.760]  acquires time warner and therefore cnn mr zucker will be shown the door
[03:41:02.760 --> 03:41:07.560]  how far behind him will in a navarro be that's the question hopefully she'll be
[03:41:07.560 --> 03:41:10.040]  there carrying her bags alongside with him
[03:41:10.040 --> 03:41:15.080]  now the other question of course that many in washington are focused on is
[03:41:15.080 --> 03:41:19.880]  what happens to senator menendez his seat yes in the u.s senate
[03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:23.800]  if he is convicted a lot of people are saying that
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:27.320]  governor chris christie who at one point was very close with the trump
[03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:31.480]  administration then kind of gotten the boot early on during the transition
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:34.920]  period could sort of pull a hui long type move
[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:39.720]  and actually appoint himself to the senate seat rather than wait out his
[03:41:39.720 --> 03:41:43.480]  time in the governorship a lot of people don't think that he stands a chance
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:47.160]  in other electoral politics at the national level but this would give him
[03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:50.680]  the chance to at least finish out the senate seat there
[03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:54.680]  there's a couple problems with that scenario first of all from a historical
[03:41:54.680 --> 03:41:57.320]  point of view governors who have pointed themselves to
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:01.080]  vacancies in the u.s senate has never worked out governor
[03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:04.120]  wendell anderson of minnesota tried this in the
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:07.720]  eighties and it was an ignominious disaster
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:11.560]  chris christie's approval rating right now is the lowest of any governor
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:16.840]  in new jersey history so his prospects to actually hold on to this seat would be
[03:42:16.840 --> 03:42:21.080]  difficult at best my sources in new jersey tell me
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:24.920]  that the nomination of assemblyman john
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:29.000]  brimmick is far more likely than the
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:33.800]  self-appointment of chris christie to the u.s senate
[03:42:33.800 --> 03:42:38.200]  but christie is a political animal and he does not appear to have any place to
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:41.720]  go as you correctly point out um he is
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:45.720]  disaffected from the trump administration
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:50.680]  although he did manage to get one of his protege's appointed fbi director
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:54.520]  it's another head scratcher why we would want to put another
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:43:01.240]  drug warrior neocon into that office but he seems to be christie this is a man
[03:43:01.240 --> 03:43:05.800]  without portfolio a man with no place to go
[03:43:05.800 --> 03:43:09.960]  and that may afford him an opportunity
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:14.600]  to see his way clear to appoint himself to the united states senate
[03:43:14.600 --> 03:43:19.000]  the timing is of course also crucial we don't know
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:22.360]  when menendez is likely to get convicted
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:26.280]  we only know that he is likely to be convicted
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:30.520]  i would point out that all of his appeals
[03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:34.440]  have been denied and in those appeals he essentially
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:38.760]  pretested his arguments of his defense that his
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:42.840]  service to dr melgom was merely constituent service
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:47.960]  and that he can't be prosecuted for that however the prosecutors and um we
[03:43:47.960 --> 03:43:51.400]  have to bring people up to speed on the case i think a little bit here too
[03:43:51.400 --> 03:43:54.920]  because again the mainstream media has been completely derelict in their
[03:43:54.920 --> 03:43:57.400]  duty in this to say that there's a sitting united
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:01.160]  states senator regardless of party it happens to be democratic
[03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:04.760]  this time but it should be reported on this is someone who is
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:09.320]  we're talking uh frequent flyer miles on a private jet
[03:44:09.320 --> 03:44:13.960]  um a a resort like mansion down in the dominican republic
[03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:17.800]  and calling to make special sweetheart deals
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:21.160]  not only for different pieces of legislation
[03:44:21.160 --> 03:44:25.960]  in the senate calls to harry reid that may have been made on behalf of melgom
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:29.240]  and people that were associated with him uh from a financial standpoint
[03:44:29.240 --> 03:44:32.920]  but also visas for different girlfriends
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:37.080]  of this doctor from all over the world coming in we're told they're girlfriends
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:41.960]  we don't know anything further now at one point uh menendez and melgom said
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:46.360]  this is all just a bunch of fluff it's merely partisan attacks
[03:44:46.360 --> 03:44:50.200]  and we should not talk about it the media tried to stick with that narrative
[03:44:50.200 --> 03:44:53.640]  for a few years this thing has actually been going on for several years
[03:44:53.640 --> 03:44:57.400]  in the making uh but after a few fits and starts it's finally
[03:44:57.400 --> 03:45:01.080]  seeing its day in court the prosecutors turned around and said no wait a minute
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:04.360]  just because the media is writing that it is debunked
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:08.760]  it has not been investigated it has not been brought to to trial
[03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:11.720]  it has not seen a jury so just because the media says
[03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:16.360]  that the headline is false that that does not mean the charge is false and
[03:45:16.360 --> 03:45:19.880]  that's what we're going to find out in new jersey here in the coming days
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:24.360]  unfortunately it's no longer available but at one time there was a website where
[03:45:24.360 --> 03:45:28.920]  you could go and see uh the foreign girlfriend a
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:33.560]  stunning russian woman uh who dr melgom wanted to keep in the
[03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:36.680]  country and who senator menendez went to bat
[03:45:36.680 --> 03:45:40.840]  for with the immigration service in an attempt to so
[03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:45.640]  having seen her rather explicit pictures i can fully understand
[03:45:45.640 --> 03:45:49.080]  dr melgom's motivation in the matter
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:52.760]  roger you're a true investigative journalist what can i say i just go
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:57.240]  where the facts lead me uh the other uh stunning development
[03:45:57.240 --> 03:46:01.400]  only days ago was the u.s. government's failed
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:06.440]  attempt yet again the third attempt to pardon me the second attempt
[03:46:06.440 --> 03:46:13.720]  to convict supporters of the bundy family of ranchers in las vegas
[03:46:13.720 --> 03:46:17.720]  nevada arc county nevada who are in an epic battle
[03:46:17.720 --> 03:46:20.840]  with the federal government if you're not familiar with this story quite
[03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:25.560]  simply uh when these ranchers who were uh ranching on
[03:46:25.560 --> 03:46:29.800]  federally owned land through a permit uh with the
[03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:34.200]  bureau of land management fell behind in their payments
[03:46:34.200 --> 03:46:38.920]  while the government launched a waco-like assault on their property
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:45.480]  in an attempt to seize their cattle bundy cliven bundy the rancher correctly
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:49.160]  went to the county sheriff and said this was
[03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:55.480]  theft now the bundy family and 18 of their supporters
[03:46:55.480 --> 03:46:59.080]  have been incarcerated for almost 19 months
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:06.440]  none of them allowed pre-trial release uh and the judge in this matter
[03:47:06.440 --> 03:47:12.360]  who has presided over the first mistrial where the jurors failed to bring
[03:47:12.360 --> 03:47:15.560]  any verdict against the bundy's supporters
[03:47:15.560 --> 03:47:19.960]  has not allowed them to call any defense witnesses
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:24.120]  has not allowed them to mount a first second or
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:29.480]  fourth amendment defense um has not allowed them to choose
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:34.440]  their own attorneys this is a kangaroo court something you might see
[03:47:34.440 --> 03:47:39.480]  in the old soviet union uh we i have written about this extensively at
[03:47:39.480 --> 03:47:43.320]  info wars dot com five reasons why president
[03:47:43.320 --> 03:47:47.080]  donald trump should pardon the bundy's
[03:47:47.080 --> 03:47:50.840]  this is an issue that we're going to be covering quite a bit more here at info
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:55.640]  wars dot com uh we are have launched a petition
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:59.640]  uh which in which we hope to amass a million signatures
[03:47:59.640 --> 03:48:05.960]  to have presented to the president calling on him to review this case but
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:10.680]  jack the most disappointing thing to me was when attorney general jeff
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:16.680]  sessions visited las vegas the highest law enforcement
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:20.440]  officer in the u.s. government and he commended
[03:48:20.440 --> 03:48:27.960]  the prosecution thus publicly tainting a trial uh in violation of his
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:33.560]  ethical obligations and the law you may remember actually before your time
[03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:37.320]  when president richard nixon in the middle of charles manson's trial
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:41.480]  for mass murder said well manson is guilty everyone knows it by the way
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:44.920]  manson was guilty and everybody did know it
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:50.600]  but the left went insane aclu they went crazy you've tainted their trial you
[03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:55.880]  violated charles manson's civil liberties today we see no such
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:49:01.960]  outcry regarding cleven bundy uh and uh his supporters
[03:49:01.960 --> 03:49:05.720]  it almost seems roger that this is almost part of a trend that we saw during
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:09.080]  obama's department of justice the politicization of
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:12.440]  law federal law enforcement in the united states which trickled down to the
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:16.040]  fbi under komi which but was continued under uh
[03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:20.520]  eric holder as well as loretta lynch herself uh we saw it in the prosecution
[03:49:20.520 --> 03:49:25.160]  and wrongful conviction of joe arpio simply for doing his job and upholding
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:28.920]  the law being refused a jury be uh the judge ruling
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:31.880]  in the opposite of the way that every single one of the witnesses
[03:49:31.880 --> 03:49:36.600]  testified at the trial so is this another situation where it's
[03:49:36.600 --> 03:49:40.760]  where now the trump administration has to deal with the politicization of the
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:44.360]  doj and where sessions finds himself having to sort of
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:48.120]  either i don't know if he's if he's not willing to it or if he's waiting or
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:51.160]  what exactly the situation is but there's a it seems like there's a lot of
[03:49:51.160 --> 03:49:56.040]  messes that started at doj under holder and lynch and that sessions
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:59.400]  seems to be focused on other things rather than cleaning it up
[03:49:59.400 --> 03:50:03.400]  i think that's exactly right jack and you're right to bring the
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:08.360]  uh the example of the prosecution of sheriff joe arpio
[03:50:08.360 --> 03:50:12.600]  they bring the prosecution against arpio under the wrong statute to ensure
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:17.000]  that he can't get a jury trial that his fate is entirely in the hands of an
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:22.920]  obama appointed judge they uh they communicate illegally
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:27.320]  with the judge during the trial the justice department monitors
[03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:30.120]  arpio's communications with his attorneys
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:35.800]  during the trial this was a political hit job this was entirely a political
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:39.240]  prosecution uh in all honesty i think enormous
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:43.400]  credit goes to alex jones and the folks at info wars for the fact that this
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:46.920]  got to the president's attention and the president did the right thing by
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:52.280]  pardoning sheriff joe so it shows that justice can be done
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:56.600]  and we can only hope that the same uh justice we have seen in the case
[03:50:56.600 --> 03:51:00.280]  of sheriff joe arpio will be seen in the case of
[03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:05.000]  uh the bundy ranchers the bundy family and their supporters
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:12.440]  let me stress 18 men are held in shackles in a dank filthy
[03:51:12.440 --> 03:51:18.120]  nevada jail none of them have prior criminal records but all have been
[03:51:18.120 --> 03:51:22.920]  denied pretrial release by the heavy-handed federal judge who was
[03:51:22.920 --> 03:51:29.640]  handpicked by senator harry reid why because senator harry reid wanted the
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:33.080]  land that the bundies were ranching for a solar
[03:51:33.080 --> 03:51:37.720]  energy product project you can read about this at a
[03:51:37.720 --> 03:51:43.160]  piece i have now at info wars dot com but that's the back story about why
[03:51:43.160 --> 03:51:48.360]  these brave americans have fought to maintain their rights against the
[03:51:48.360 --> 03:51:52.040]  oppressive jack boot of the bureau of land
[03:51:52.040 --> 03:51:56.440]  management by the way when did the blm get their own army
[03:51:56.440 --> 03:51:59.960]  the founding fathers weren't even sure that the federal government should have
[03:51:59.960 --> 03:52:06.440]  an army but the blm has their own uh their own strike force
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:10.680]  to to force ranchers to pay their payments
[03:52:10.680 --> 03:52:14.760]  this is yet another outrage of the federal government
[03:52:14.760 --> 03:52:18.920]  and so we saw this a lot now with the obama administration and now the left
[03:52:18.920 --> 03:52:22.520]  is still picking up one of the politicization of law enforcement
[03:52:22.520 --> 03:52:26.760]  so now whenever the president tries to undo something like that
[03:52:26.760 --> 03:52:30.520]  such as he did with joe arpaio and now he's looking at trying to undo the
[03:52:30.520 --> 03:52:33.640]  unconstitutional way and we can all at least agree
[03:52:33.640 --> 03:52:37.320]  on the docket decision the executive order passed by obama by
[03:52:37.320 --> 03:52:41.720]  executive fiat from the from the oval office was clearly unconstitutional
[03:52:41.720 --> 03:52:45.880]  uh to go against the wishes of congress as the representatives of the people
[03:52:45.880 --> 03:52:49.560]  and we're breaking this down to this is like civics 101 lesson that we have to
[03:52:49.560 --> 03:52:52.680]  give because of brock obama twisted everything around
[03:52:52.680 --> 03:52:57.000]  and now the left is trying to say you are disobeying the rule of law
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:00.840]  by actually following the constitutional law of the land
[03:53:00.840 --> 03:53:06.680]  because of the unjudicial the prejudicial and unlawful actions by so much of
[03:53:06.680 --> 03:53:11.000]  federal law enforcement under the obama era now we're seeing this twist
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:14.600]  around to say with the president basically going to say
[03:53:14.600 --> 03:53:17.640]  well i simply want congress to come up with
[03:53:17.640 --> 03:53:21.160]  legislation on docka i want them to come up with legislation
[03:53:21.160 --> 03:53:23.800]  and we can say yes or no we can have that debate
[03:53:23.800 --> 03:53:27.000]  but the left is coming around and saying we don't want debate
[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:32.520]  we want our dictatorship back that they had under obama they just don't like it
[03:53:32.520 --> 03:53:36.200]  when the president says well no we want to go back to the constitutional form
[03:53:36.200 --> 03:53:39.720]  of government and yet they call trump a dictator and compare him
[03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:43.640]  to adolf hitler and joseph stop you know jack one of the most effective things
[03:53:43.640 --> 03:53:47.560]  i've seen this week was newman newsmax publisher chris ruddy
[03:53:47.560 --> 03:53:53.480]  appeared on the don lemon show on cnn and it was a performance that was in my
[03:53:53.480 --> 03:53:58.040]  opinion absolutely masterful ruddy gave no
[03:53:58.040 --> 03:54:02.680]  quarter whatsoever he got right back into lemon's face
[03:54:02.680 --> 03:54:06.040]  and every time lemon misrepresented the truth
[03:54:06.040 --> 03:54:09.240]  or launched an attack on president donald trump
[03:54:09.240 --> 03:54:13.320]  almost all of itself centered lemon actually said at one point
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:16.920]  well a lot of people here at cnn
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:20.840]  criticize the president but the president seems to be obsessed
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:24.760]  with me in essence saying it's because he's black
[03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:28.440]  well the president doesn't give two thoughts about what don lemon thinks or
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:31.480]  what he has to say and to his credit
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:35.320]  publisher ruddy got right back into his face and said it
[03:54:35.320 --> 03:54:41.000]  then lemon went into harangue about how low the president's poll ratings are
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:46.200]  at that point ruddy pointed out that his poll ratings were about the same
[03:54:46.200 --> 03:54:49.800]  as president barack obama in this same period
[03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:54.920]  so my hats off to chris ruddy an extraordinarily effective performance
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:55:01.000]  beating back fact new fake news at cnn jack what else was notable this week
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  that you think uh the info warriors need to know about on that same piece we're
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:09.240]  now actually starting to see a crack in the mantle of the fake news
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:13.240]  where the new york times just yesterday posted an entire story and
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:17.560]  investigation they did of cnn's fake news their coverage that they had to
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:21.080]  eventually retract of the trump russia
[03:55:21.080 --> 03:55:24.280]  situation a story they wrote where anthony scaramucci
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:28.360]  had been uh tied to this russian investment bank the new york times
[03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:33.560]  completely i mean eviscerated cnn's complete lack of judgment
[03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:37.800]  complete lack of oversight using sources that didn't give them
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:41.000]  uh confirmed information not confirming it
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:45.880]  um at going back and forth on these things but then the editorial decisions
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:49.080]  made by jeff zucker to hit print on that story
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:52.840]  even when at one point their legal department at cnn said
[03:55:52.840 --> 03:55:56.840]  we still have questions about the story and zucker goes and pushes forward with
[03:55:56.840 --> 03:56:01.000]  it because the russia trump story had to lead cnn
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:04.760]  regardless of what was going on we saw this same narrative
[03:56:04.760 --> 03:56:07.960]  in the project veritas case and now the fact that
[03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:12.120]  the new york times of all places the the failing the carlos slim to own new
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:15.960]  york times is even turning their crosshairs rhetorically
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:20.120]  speaking on cnn it really goes to show how
[03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:23.480]  bad and how forceful their their fake news
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:28.360]  is going uh there is nothing better than when the left
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:32.280]  turns on each other before we leave you today i want to remind you one more
[03:56:32.280 --> 03:56:36.120]  time to please go to the info wars dot com store
[03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:41.000]  my favorite product is the trump penns 2020 t-shirt
