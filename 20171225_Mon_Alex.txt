[00:00.000 --> 00:18.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[00:18.840 --> 00:28.000]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.280]  i woke up at about three thirty in the morning last night and i couldn't go back to sleep
[00:34.280 --> 00:41.240]  and i wrote down some notes of course i forgot left the house but it was profound and it
[00:41.240 --> 00:47.000]  was extremely simple and it's something we've already talked about before but it gets lost
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.960]  in everything the globalist don't want us celebrating christmas or anything else that's
[00:54.960 --> 01:00.560]  old and cultural because they want to remove everything and force feed their new systems
[01:00.560 --> 01:06.760]  that's why they're at war with everything traditional and most things traditional are traditional
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.680]  because they're nice and they work and they're productive and they're happy and they punish
[01:12.680 --> 01:18.800]  badness and reward goodness but once you flip the balance into evil it becomes an evil
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.280]  economy and things just go downhill you want to stay away from an evil economy and go towards
[01:24.280 --> 01:27.720]  a good one doesn't mean you're ever going to be in some utopia but you want to be going
[01:27.720 --> 01:34.220]  towards the good in the spectrum and it just hit me that as libertarians as patriots as
[01:34.220 --> 01:41.000]  constructive people we tend to have victories move on it's that quiet professionalism you
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.820]  know that you see in so many hardworking smart great people is they're confident they don't
[01:44.820 --> 01:49.700]  need to sit there and tell you about it all day because they just are and everybody picks
[01:49.700 --> 01:53.760]  up on it women pick up on it men pick up on it i mean that's just that's when you got
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.600]  what it takes the right stuff and other people don't and the folks that don't have the right
[01:58.600 --> 02:03.080]  stuff they're always trying to get together to take over the people that do and then we're
[02:03.080 --> 02:06.920]  always trying to help the people that don't have the right stuff now the globalists don't
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.240]  have the right stuff they've stolen power but they think we don't have the right stuff
[02:10.240 --> 02:13.880]  now want to kill us off because we don't want to play along with their ballgame so it's
[02:13.880 --> 02:21.280]  a it's a perversion but that said it hit me we've got to celebrate these tax cuts and
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.480]  i mean really celebrate them and we've got to show how good they are on average i had
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.720]  a chance to read over last night again this morning when i woke up about an hour hundreds
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.880]  of bullet points in there but there's more than 30 big ones and it's i mean one of the
[02:35.880 --> 02:40.440]  cleanest tax bills i've ever seen it's got some port barrel in there but not one democrat
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.960]  voted for it which is completely shameful and even a few democrats on cnn had to come
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.640]  out and say you know this is really this really is a middle class tax cut you can't lie about
[02:51.640 --> 02:58.160]  it the ultra rich already wrote the laws to keep their money offshore trump just undid
[02:58.160 --> 03:04.520]  the central plank of the globalist taking the money offshore and that's why i get viciously
[03:04.520 --> 03:10.080]  angry when i see hillary clinton and michael more and all the usual suspects lying and
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.920]  playing on people's ignorance i mean it really makes me mad the big banks and the ultra rich
[03:14.920 --> 03:24.040]  the fortune 100 to a group wrote the 40 percent or 38.9 percent tax the big corporations wrote
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.760]  it and i sit there with leftist as they go oh are you glad you're rich friends alex
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.960]  we're going to get that big tax cut people just walk my set me free oh you're working
[03:33.960 --> 03:42.880]  with the rich people now know you buffoon the ultra rich wrote it to screw you you pay
[03:42.880 --> 03:52.840]  all the taxes shock even see and admit tax bill gives working families damn good money
[03:52.840 --> 04:00.720]  1.5 trillion baby in fact it even got rid of some of the tax exemptions for people making
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.640]  over a million dollars a year if anything it's a tax increase on new vorice believe me you're
[04:06.640 --> 04:11.560]  making a million bucks a year that that's not ultra rich it's not one percent that has
[04:11.560 --> 04:16.080]  70 percent of money it's we've done the math it's point zero zero zero zero zero zero
[04:16.080 --> 04:22.000]  zero zero four two of every service like a whole bunch of zeros and then a four two
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.360]  so it's the point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero whatever four two that
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.960]  are ruled on the show and they want a monopoly they want consolidation under democrat global
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.160]  is control all over the world you see middle classes shrink and the ultra rich created
[04:37.160 --> 04:42.840]  it's the ultra rich to a man and to a corporation very few women that are promoting this global
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.200]  socialist system because they're exempt from it they transfer your wealth take it for themselves
[04:47.200 --> 04:53.960]  and trump and all of us just blew a giant hole in it and the EU is panicking the EU admits
[04:53.960 --> 05:01.640]  it's gonna move our jobs back they're threatening us too why is the fungus why is the mold why

[05:56.920 --> 06:16.760]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[06:16.760 --> 06:28.200]  war I couldn't sleep at about three thirty in the morning I got up because my brain
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.400]  was racing and I got up and wrote a bunch of notes but again I of course forgot left
[06:33.400 --> 06:40.640]  on the kitchen table breakfast table when I came into work today when I came into this
[06:40.640 --> 06:50.160]  war today that I'm very honored and very humbled to be a part of and it was so clear it was
[06:50.160 --> 06:53.960]  all laid out right there and again all of it you're already going to know I don't tell
[06:53.960 --> 06:57.200]  you anything you don't already know in your heart the reason you listen and put up with
[06:57.200 --> 07:07.240]  me at the time shows a train wreck because of myself because you know deep down I am
[07:07.240 --> 07:12.920]  in this with you and you are in this with me and that's why they always attack and say
[07:12.920 --> 07:18.160]  I'm not real and I hate my listeners when I get tears in my eyes when families run up
[07:18.160 --> 07:25.280]  to me and shake my hand black Hispanic white you name it Asian old young because they're
[07:25.280 --> 07:33.320]  counting on me and I feel weak in this fight sometimes because I know so much more and
[07:33.320 --> 07:39.280]  I don't have the energy or the skill to properly execute perform operations that I know would
[07:39.280 --> 07:45.360]  turn everything around but I'm not the only person you're not the only person Trump's
[07:45.360 --> 07:50.000]  not the only person and now as we realize we're here and that there aren't just scum
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.280]  in the world there aren't just backstabbers in the world there aren't just vicious liars
[07:54.280 --> 08:01.160]  in the world the worm is turning and evil is panicking they were all so sure that they
[08:01.160 --> 08:05.520]  were going to bring in this global government it isn't just Hillary that's failing the globalist
[08:05.520 --> 08:11.960]  said last year in major publications in their establishment publications they said emergency
[08:11.960 --> 08:17.200]  red alert they knew internal polls had trump ten fifteen points ahead they stole we now
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.160]  know over seven million votes not three and a half like trumpet earlier been told off
[08:21.160 --> 08:26.320]  of pure research Harvard research is over seven million Hillary stole six states five
[08:26.320 --> 08:30.800]  states tried to steal six others and we have all the evidence of that local state homeland
[08:30.800 --> 08:37.360]  security caught just department breaking in with their cyber squads trying to flip the
[08:37.360 --> 08:43.960]  votes and stopped them so there's a civil war going on against the globalist of hijacked
[08:43.960 --> 08:47.400]  the nation and those of us trying to take it back it doesn't mean those of us on the
[08:47.400 --> 08:51.560]  side of trying to bring sovereignty back are perfect for the people that have even joined
[08:51.560 --> 08:55.320]  us are perfect a lot of them can see which way the winds blowing and now as people realize
[08:55.320 --> 09:03.560]  we're going to win it's going to accelerate the victory and the globalists now know they're
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.880]  going to lose for good they finally realized in the last forty eight hours and I can feel
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.760]  their horror I can see their response I can see people jumping ship even faster this is
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.120]  the moment the president's got to be under maximum security everybody else has got to
[09:18.120 --> 09:26.040]  be under maximum guard watch your six right now because right now yesterday when that
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.680]  bill passed and they went up there and had that celebration it was absolutely we turn
[09:30.680 --> 09:38.640]  the corner right there we turn the corner right there that I mean we turned all the corners
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.880]  it didn't mean that we're perfect that mean we don't have a lot of big crises to face
[09:42.880 --> 09:49.520]  North Korea you name it but spiritually let's start it without inauguration eleven months
[09:49.520 --> 09:56.280]  ago and that declaration bringing God back in the covenant saying it's about humanity
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.080]  it's about workers it's about the people you you're not just the people or the minority
[10:01.080 --> 10:05.360]  or the infighting group you're the people you're the workers you're the builders you're
[10:05.360 --> 10:12.280]  the strivers that it was invoking God and then saying you are the celebration you have
[10:12.280 --> 10:20.120]  value it isn't just hype it's what builds a culture and then now less than a year later
[10:20.120 --> 10:32.840]  so many promises delivered the globalists are in full panic mode and so we need to celebrate
[10:32.840 --> 10:39.480]  and be thankful for everything we've got being thankful and I know I'm preaching to most
[10:39.480 --> 10:45.440]  of you that already know this but to others being thankful is the answer to being happy
[10:45.440 --> 10:55.360]  and being honorable is the key to real wisdom and the globalists are always going to attack
[10:55.360 --> 10:58.480]  those of us and stand up against them and say that we're the dishonorable ones we're
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.920]  the liars we're the bad ones and cobble things together and twist what we've done or take
[11:02.920 --> 11:07.880]  points when we've fallen and try to magnify that to make us all feel like we don't have
[11:07.880 --> 11:12.800]  a right to be free but it's all a lie it's all a false indictment by the accuser by the
[11:12.800 --> 11:19.240]  devil and that's what the spirit is and that's why they always say jones doesn't believe
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.760]  what he's saying jones isn't real jones is an actor because they they don't want you
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.120]  to believe there's anybody else out there that thinks like you do they're saying you're
[11:27.120 --> 11:33.880]  not real the real reason they fear me is they know I'm real and they know I'm committed
[11:33.880 --> 11:40.200]  and they know I have will to stand against what they've done thanks to God putting wind
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.800]  in my sails and they can't stand that and of course the proof is the pudding said you
[11:45.800 --> 11:50.360]  treat by its fruits we are destroying the globalists we are breaking their corrupt world
[11:50.360 --> 11:55.560]  government we are exposing the technocracies we are unmasking and unveiling their monopolies
[11:55.560 --> 12:06.360]  we are causing together a global accelerated awakening that has evil everywhere in a panic
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.120]  and desperately coming out of their rat holes out of their spider holes out of their eel
[12:11.120 --> 12:18.840]  holes to fire us now which only accelerates their defeat as we draw their fire that's
[12:18.840 --> 12:25.920]  the key to this they've now come into our keep come into our castle to destroy us in
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.840]  the night and just like bale wolf we're waiting and as they try to flee we slam their arm
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.920]  in the door and rip it off we've still got to face other great evens but the point is
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.080]  this particular monster has already had its arm torn off and is bleeding to death and
[12:42.080 --> 12:49.480]  its mother is going to fall next because we are going into the mountain next where they
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.120]  molest the children where they engage in the satanism where they carry out their operations
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.320]  we are going into the mountain and if some of us are destroyed going to the mountain
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.400]  doesn't matter for more of us will follow and it won't be fear going to the mountain
[13:04.400 --> 13:09.760]  it will be honor and the quest for liberty and freedom and an honor to go into the mountain
[13:09.760 --> 13:15.920]  into the enemy's own darkness because we carry the light of christ in our hearts ladies
[13:15.920 --> 13:26.560]  and gentlemen the EU has completely uncloked the grandson of the main nazi fortune yunker
[13:26.560 --> 13:30.360]  who owns a country they hijacked in world war two luxembourg i mean just the arrest
[13:30.360 --> 13:38.360]  him immediately just the arrogant insanity of these people snaggle tooth nazi says no
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.760]  you violated international treaties you can't cut taxes under world government combines

[13:57.640 --> 14:03.040]  articles are on info wars dot com with just screenshots of london guardian your spiegel
[14:03.040 --> 14:12.640]  EU fears unfair u.s. tax bill will in incentivize companies to move to america and then i've
[14:12.640 --> 14:21.520]  got one right here out of the associated press where they announced and cnbc that you violate
[14:21.520 --> 14:28.480]  a global agreement let's pull that up there it is u.s. tax reform breaks global rules
[14:28.480 --> 14:34.560]  EU says oh there's global rules where do you get rules from a government been talking
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.720]  to us like we're five-year-olds for 50 years while you set up world government stealth
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.160]  and as we said all they got to do is expose it people attack us saying it doesn't exist
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.720]  but when they finally go operational everybody will go what you said this wasn't going on
[14:48.720 --> 14:54.960]  haha the only people that bought the kool-aid and drank it was the globalist and sure they
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.880]  stolen trillions and those other crap they've got hollywood disease in everything and brainwashing

[21:27.440 --> 21:34.240]  being tested and that's what this is make no mistake and that's why the enemy coveted that's
[21:34.240 --> 21:40.480]  why they hate humanity the globalists are fallen twisted souls that seek to make greater men and
[21:40.480 --> 21:48.480]  women their slaves always seeking ever hungry for the blood of the innocence and i think about how
[21:48.480 --> 21:53.840]  the media all over twitter facebook everywhere i wasn't even looking for it and i saw a look at
[21:53.840 --> 22:01.440]  tim scott the uncle tom you know the beautiful part about our rallies is about half the folks
[22:01.440 --> 22:06.720]  there quote minorities the media panicked about that when we had one at the rnc they said yes
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.800]  it was very frightening half the folks there were black or hispanic or asian probably more than that
[22:11.440 --> 22:18.320]  everybody got along great but see by telling you oh blacks aren't welcome in the republican party
[22:18.320 --> 22:23.360]  or in the tea party then blacks don't go that's like the black house chief of staff kelly came out
[22:23.360 --> 22:30.000]  and said we're looking for all qualified applicants please you know if you're a minority we're not
[22:30.000 --> 22:37.200]  getting minority request here we just want competent people so and see that's how that self-segregation
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.800]  works and now the colleges are teaching women don't go around men men don't wear women blacks
[22:42.800 --> 22:48.320]  stay over here hispanics over here whites over here they're setting up a prison and then hyping up
[22:48.320 --> 22:55.840]  stuff and staging false hate crimes and then tim scott who had tears in his eyes talking about
[22:55.840 --> 23:00.960]  president trump who it's real affirmative action and if you really want to do it even though it
[23:00.960 --> 23:05.280]  discriminates you either has been past problems but it's actually teach somebody how to fish don't
[23:05.280 --> 23:12.320]  give them fish they're going to deploy you want to say racially massive extra funding for factories
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.600]  jobs and businesses into black areas which is good for the country good for everybody we need to
[23:17.600 --> 23:22.000]  lift these folks up that have been on a democrat plantation for 200 plus years they just put them
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.840]  on a new one when lbj figured out blacks were running their own businesses and becoming too wealthy
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.280]  and so they've come out a bunch up and attacked tim scott called an uncle tom you know he actually
[23:31.280 --> 23:36.080]  read uncle tom uncle tom wasn't a wimp he was a christ figure doesn't mean you don't always lay down
[23:36.080 --> 23:41.120]  you don't always stand up no one to hold him no one to fold him but that christ figure christ wasn't
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.560]  a wimp at that point or gondy wasn't a wimp or martin was a king wasn't a wimp i mean martin was
[23:46.560 --> 23:51.600]  a king you'd call an uncle tom he got killed being loving and being a good person of course they so
[23:51.600 --> 23:54.800]  people don't even know what uncle tom means because the democrats took it and turned it into
[23:54.800 --> 23:59.520]  pejorative by the 1870s look up who did it i wanted to check my memory someone read read up on the
[23:59.520 --> 24:05.280]  history this morning again they flip everything you got the blacks running towards the kkk party
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.560]  because they don't know any better because they've been lied to by the schools like everybody else
[24:10.560 --> 24:18.640]  that know any better so it's it's just incredible ladies and gentlemen and of course it was uncle
[24:18.640 --> 24:22.880]  tom's cabin that moved everybody to finally embrace abolitionists and not want to have
[24:22.880 --> 24:29.520]  slavery anymore it was that book about the christ figure uncle tom that actually triggered all of
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.680]  that and by the end of the civil war millions of dead by the end to stop slavery wasn't started
[24:35.680 --> 24:40.400]  over that but see they take that victory away from you and say oh he was a bad pathetic person that
[24:40.400 --> 24:47.760]  groveled and everything he was servile he was always other things well if you're in front of all
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.840]  the cameras and your enemy is about to kill you it destroys them when they kill you was obi-wan
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.040]  kanobio went at the end when he lets darth vader chop him in half no he knows it's about to
[24:58.080 --> 25:04.400]  commit the next generation of the fight he's done at this point he's also going to buy some time
[25:05.440 --> 25:11.440]  and again that's fiction uncle tom's fiction but it helps people understand what real heroism is
[25:11.440 --> 25:17.760]  at the point that you need to let people kill you if you're the spirit decides the time then you
[25:17.760 --> 25:23.440]  don't fight you let them kill you because it brings them down because an hour later you blow up the
[25:23.440 --> 25:29.120]  death star those are all allegories of how things really work martin Luther king blew up the death
[25:29.120 --> 25:35.920]  star trolton heston marching with him to help end real racism blew up the death star those that
[25:35.920 --> 25:40.720]  got blown up came back with hey we'll take control of these people this way and they've done it and
[25:40.720 --> 25:45.840]  they've taught racism and horrible wickedness and horrible vicious attacks by black people against
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.960]  whites and others all over the place 10 to 1 20 to 1 30 to 1 depending on the city and the media
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.360]  covers it up and they want you see it it's not to demonize blacks it's to say what you're doing is
[25:55.360 --> 26:01.520]  wrong just like kkk doing stuff that's wrong stop it it's evil because most people aren't psychopaths
[26:01.520 --> 26:06.560]  they make excuses for why they go out most people that were kkk weren't psychopaths they were bought
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.280]  into it they were manipulated into it same thing with blacks that now act like the kkk but at a
[26:11.280 --> 26:18.080]  much wider scale of true persecution but see it's all okay because the old kkk people that control
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.280]  the kkk are in control of you they weren't believe in any of that stuff people that control the kkk
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.840]  they wanted to control the poor farmers that were their real competition by putting them into a
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.800]  secret society group they could control a gang see these people know what they're doing these
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.800]  the parasites are very very smart let's go out to break with tim scott that they hate so much
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.920]  because it's like a moses to leave black folks off the plantation then we'll come back with a
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.640]  powerful video that mcgreens put together because trump is going to now go after the welfare system
[26:48.640 --> 26:51.120]  they're going to say that they're killing everybody but that's not what's happening we're
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.760]  literally taking people to not letting them be domesticated from the company store like they
[26:55.760 --> 27:01.040]  had whites as slaves as sharecroppers here it is mr president during one of those conversations
[27:01.040 --> 27:07.040]  that we had we talked about ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country
[27:07.760 --> 27:13.120]  52 million americans living in distressed communities and we talked about legislation that
[27:13.120 --> 27:19.920]  could move those communities forward and you said yes and as a part of this tax reform package the
[27:19.920 --> 27:28.000]  investing and opportunity act has been included which will bring trillions of dollars into poor

[38:00.640 --> 38:06.560]  a big deal i know i keep arping and i know you know this most of you please tell your friends
[38:06.560 --> 38:13.040]  and family because this is key the the un the globalist all of them are running around saying
[38:14.240 --> 38:22.560]  that oh look trump's breaking global rules there are no global rules the rules are screw america
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.280]  and the west over transfer power to authoritarian countries where globalists that sold our countries
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.120]  out ally themselves with the other authoritarians it's authoritarian monopoly men and crony capitalist
[38:33.120 --> 38:39.120]  and communist dirtbags against the renaissance against the real liberals if you really study
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.480]  what it is under classical analysis if thomas jeverson was looking at this he'd say those are
[38:44.480 --> 38:51.040]  monopoly groups just like a royal system but worse there's not even any honor nobody has to
[38:51.040 --> 38:59.680]  even take the field and the elite and they are putting us under serfdom anybody that was classically
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.000]  trained would see it in two seconds if you're classically educated you got to go back and educate
[39:04.000 --> 39:12.000]  yourself on the classics not the modern baloney intellectuals were too arrogant 300 400 500 years
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.480]  ago to lie they might be distorted in their views but they told you what they thought this whole
[39:18.480 --> 39:25.600]  lying on purpose in media is a newer thing in the last 200 years or so because before 200 years ago
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.840]  most people the printing press was 500 but it wasn't ubiquitous until or most people reading
[39:29.840 --> 39:35.280]  until about 200 years ago it was only intellectual intellectual elite to elite so they were all very
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.840]  out in the open and they still do that in globalist publications with each other that like we're
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.080]  idiots would never read it we went read it and brought everybody said look there's they're saying
[39:44.080 --> 39:48.960]  this they're gonna do this oh shut up you racist cook nutball whatever you know just shut up go away
[39:48.960 --> 39:56.240]  but i'm like hey the finally the public did listen we'll play the mcbrane piece when we come back
[39:56.240 --> 40:03.280]  the next segment i'm already burning through this segment but how long is that piece
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.360]  oh so i see i have this whole thing where they do this great job on these promos on the other side
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.640]  but then i get a video list that tells me the length but then those videos never get put on the
[40:16.640 --> 40:20.160]  video list with this group so then i don't ever know and the only reason i'm saying on air is
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.920]  i've asked about 200 times i'm asking nicely for just an email to be sent or it's a message
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.760]  everybody's doing a great job so that i can then know the length of time so i'm just asking on air
[40:29.760 --> 40:32.640]  because a lot of folks think you know i'm just asking these things on air to pontificate for
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.680]  no reason that just goes into the whole computing process of what to do and i'm kind of teleproper
[40:37.680 --> 40:43.280]  free so what we do is kind of strategize here on air which is not a bad thing because most folks
[40:43.280 --> 40:49.120]  don't do that they just hold dry fake thing you know pointed right at you but here it is we'll
[40:49.120 --> 40:56.080]  cover more when we come back EU fears unfair US tax bill will incentivize companies to move the US
[40:56.640 --> 41:04.080]  move back and they say we're breaking global rules well if china has 14 and a half or whatever it is
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.440]  and then we've got a 38.9 and our own government wrote it that way to make the jobs go to china
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.480]  you wonder why everything went there well they had a tax rate less than half of ours and then you
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.600]  wonder why everybody laundered their money through ireland and moved even more jobs there
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.960]  because they had zero remember the big success story ireland it's incredible and trump tried to
[41:24.960 --> 41:31.600]  get zero if we had zero corporate income tax everyone would come back here just like it was
[41:31.600 --> 41:36.400]  before when we set this whole thing up and we had you 80 percent of the world's industry
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.480]  by the 80s it was half of it now it's like 20 percent of it within five years you'd have half
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.280]  the stuff moved back here at real wages and then that would lift the whole world up every
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.240]  economist knows this but they they want a consolidation i know i keep harping and harping
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.640]  and harping and harping it's because this is everything a rigged political and corporate
[41:56.640 --> 42:02.000]  system to screw the average person over make you dependent and put you on welfare so they can run
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.560]  your life and that's the clip that we'll play when we come back start of the next segment

[47:40.720 --> 47:45.120]  trump that we all just had a huge victory with is quote damn good money the american people
[47:45.840 --> 47:52.720]  and actually is a real middle class slash poor people tax guy that is basically jfks classic
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.920]  democrats before they became total you know modern psychopath or classic northern democrat
[47:57.920 --> 48:03.200]  not southern democrat we're going to play that clip in a moment but first jeremy bring together
[48:03.200 --> 48:11.280]  this powerful video uh that has trump introducing the fact that next up is welfare reform getting
[48:11.280 --> 48:17.760]  folks off of the spoiled rotten brainwashing democrat plantation here it is i know people
[48:17.760 --> 48:24.720]  they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all and the person who's not
[48:24.720 --> 48:30.080]  working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better
[48:30.880 --> 48:38.080]  than the person that's working his and her ass off and it's not gonna happen not gonna happen

[48:53.120 --> 49:00.480]  get a job or you're just gonna get the food stamps i'm not looking for a job why should i have to
[49:00.480 --> 49:09.680]  go work at retail and deal with the snobby customers why why should i have to dare choose to do that
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.720]  we call the department of children and families to see what they've been doing to help
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.640]  dcf says hillsboro kids incorporated has been helping by paying adam's rent even providing
[49:20.640 --> 49:37.280]  her furniture adam says it isn't enough somebody needs to pay i honestly

[50:00.880 --> 50:06.240]  and or could be observable more counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.640]  expire now that unemployment is below 10 for each affected county i felt really bad about being on
[50:12.640 --> 50:16.640]  food stamps for a while they're just for people who really really need it i thought and i'm like
[50:16.640 --> 50:22.560]  living the flippant lifestyle in san francisco do you think you really need it well yeah and
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.360]  eventually i just sort of realized that even though i'm 24 like i still have responsibilities
[50:27.360 --> 50:31.680]  i still have like hopes for my future and if i need to be on food stamps to make that happen
[50:31.680 --> 50:38.560]  then maybe i do really need it are you employed yeah how do you feel about that i'm comfortable
[50:38.560 --> 50:45.120]  with it and i feel like i don't need to work for one because i get a check from a government
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.920]  and do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you have $850,000 in the bank
[50:51.680 --> 51:00.400]  no no i don't i'm i'm going by the rules and if they need to change the rules they can change
[51:00.400 --> 51:06.560]  their rules but i don't see i'm doing anything wrong how much do you collect in benefits i gave
[51:06.560 --> 51:15.600]  780 and food stamps $500 and 10 and i get medicaid in week give me my food stamps
[51:19.440 --> 51:26.640]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance now for hundreds of years
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.160]  once rome became an empire they controlled people in the city which was the political
[51:30.160 --> 51:36.000]  control of the whole empire with free handouts and they penalized people that basically produced
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.640]  who were in the middle class you had the ultra rich patricians and you had all the poor people
[51:40.640 --> 51:48.400]  down below that were citizens and then slaves but up beneath that but the same things repeating by
[51:48.400 --> 51:52.320]  design we have the lbj letters all of it when he's president saying we're going to domesticate
[51:52.320 --> 51:56.480]  these people and have these n words vote and democrat the next hundred years and and and it
[51:56.480 --> 52:00.480]  is a program against everybody they were particularly successful black folks because
[52:00.480 --> 52:04.480]  they'd been down dropped before but had their own communities were somewhat successful and
[52:04.480 --> 52:07.200]  then it was like oh you're going to help me actually here yeah get father out of the home
[52:07.200 --> 52:15.280]  there's some money we're going to do this and then it creates just that same spoiled rotten
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.560]  behavior not going to make me work whatever but you're going to go vote for policies that raise
[52:20.560 --> 52:25.040]  taxes in the middle class where all these liberals go and vote for big tax increases but
[52:25.040 --> 52:29.360]  suddenly the irs claims they're behind on some technicality and then an old lady has her house
[52:29.360 --> 52:34.320]  taken and she commits suicide and we see these stories all the time see they're taking people's
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.720]  businesses and houses because they're producing and then they claim you didn't pay or they've fallen
[52:40.720 --> 52:46.080]  hard times they get behind or there's all this irs fraud against people it's been documented
[52:46.080 --> 52:50.960]  like the old hispanic lady that had like a eight top little counter deal for 40 something years and
[52:50.960 --> 52:54.800]  she always deposited the cash every day like six hundred seven hundred bucks at the bank it was
[52:54.800 --> 53:00.400]  all registered but they said well we say that structuring uh and and so you're manipulating
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.720]  we're going to take your was it 80 something thousand dollars she'd saved for her retirement
[53:04.720 --> 53:08.640]  she was going to pay for herself but see they took it away and and they said oh it's legal
[53:08.640 --> 53:12.880]  we have a wall we can do it you've paid your taxes but it's illegal to make under
[53:15.120 --> 53:20.080]  thousand dollar deposits every day and you're like but i i do a cash business mainly but also
[53:20.080 --> 53:23.920]  some checks and things and i do this and this is how it is and we have credit cards as well but
[53:23.920 --> 53:29.200]  we don't care see that's how you dehumanize that's how you enslave that's how you control and then
[53:29.200 --> 53:33.840]  then this lady that looks like she weighs 400 pounds which is fine but she's getting money
[53:33.840 --> 53:38.400]  of food while you know while people starve in the third world this is what she has to say here it is
[53:39.200 --> 53:40.800]  i honestly
[53:44.320 --> 53:51.520]  don't want to work and i'm not going to can't force me i need my now notice she's totally
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.040]  in time like a lady that has 12 14 kids whatever it was and she goes look at all these kids somebody's
[53:57.040 --> 54:01.840]  got to take care of them it's totally lost on her but this was done to destroy her
[54:03.040 --> 54:06.960]  a better grandmother was a slickly dressed hardworking lady didn't have a lot of money but
[54:06.960 --> 54:14.080]  had a lot of dignity and looked like an executive today and then she's a total rundown just out
[54:14.080 --> 54:19.280]  of her mind slob saying somebody take care of my kids and you don't think it's real to understand
[54:19.280 --> 54:25.600]  that's what it's produced and now 47 of the population or more it's almost 50 is like this
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.320]  like mit romney said and the globalists know what they're doing it's a demographic battle of total
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.600]  domesticated slaves that don't know how to do anything or take care of themselves you see when
[54:35.600 --> 54:40.560]  it does it parks they say don't feed the wildlife because it makes them obese lazy and stupid well
[54:40.560 --> 54:46.000]  don't feed the humans because sure if you break your backfall for roof get cancer take care of
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.800]  people that's what welfare is for but not here you don't do anything ever again and oh there's a
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.000]  black guy here it's congressman mr scott and he's getting hundreds of billions of investment in
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.600]  black areas and the black leaders are freaking out because they don't want that they want to sit on
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.480]  top the people they control with the democratic party and not see people empowered they're scared
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.840]  to death because if you can free the black people you can free everybody the blacks are their target
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.640]  the group they already had control of and everything you see done to them is a beta test for everybody
[55:14.640 --> 55:20.240]  else there's a clip of uh seeing him's john king how long will he be there how long will he have a
[55:20.240 --> 55:23.920]  job is he going to get fired for telling the truth he says it's a real gamble though will
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.760]  americans want more money and run their own lives will they want to go to a factory will they want
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.360]  to go work at a job and get paid 30 bucks an hour or will they want to sit there and get 10
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.360]  dollars an hour sitting on their butt watching jerry springer here it is as you watch this the
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.200]  republicans are making a big bet they're taking a big risk i can't will over time the american

[58:19.360 --> 58:24.800]  themselves the resistances that confuse people know we're the resistance we're taking back the
[58:24.800 --> 58:31.360]  planet and we're always going to be resisting evil in ourselves it's an ongoing battle it never ends
[58:31.360 --> 58:38.000]  it's it's the great animating contest of liberty our perfection is our imperfection but knowing
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.600]  god's perfection we can see into perfection and seeing perfection we can know it and worship it
[58:43.600 --> 58:51.200]  and be part of it but through us god can experience imperfection hence we were created expressions of
[58:51.200 --> 58:59.280]  god's mind but autonomous individuals free not robots sentient conscious sharing the mind of god
[58:59.280 --> 59:05.920]  but in a tiny microscopic way but still beautiful like the rays of the sun through crystal
[59:06.800 --> 59:13.200]  projected on the wall not the sun but beautiful not the sun but part of the sun
[59:13.200 --> 59:23.280]  and before the media says i'm sun worshiping it's an allegory to the mind of god now let's play
[59:23.280 --> 59:29.680]  a few minutes of trump announcing the victory that we should be celebrating greatly because
[59:29.680 --> 59:37.520]  prosperity to democrats communist globalist dirtbags parasites ernie sanders scam artists like him
[59:37.520 --> 59:41.760]  rich filthy five six houses you know hundred thousand dollar cars never worked in his life
[59:41.760 --> 59:47.200]  the flim flammer at the college the scam artist it's like high noon to count Dracula so here it is
[59:48.800 --> 59:55.760]  in 34 years but actually really hasn't been done because we broke every record it's the largest
[59:56.560 --> 1:00:02.400]  i always say the most massive but it's the largest tax cut in the history of our country
[1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:11.120]  and reform but tax cut really something special and i noticed this just came out two minutes ago
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:18.320]  they handed it to me at nt plans to increase us capital spending one billion dollars and provide
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:24.720]  one thousand dollar special bonus to more than 200 000 us employees and that's because by the way
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:30.640]  dozens of companies have now announced some more things that's pretty good and
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:38.480]  it's called leadership a whole list of accomplishments that the group behind me have done in terms of
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:45.360]  this administration and this congress but uh you've heard it before records all over the place
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:52.160]  and that will continue and then some because of what we did but uh three point two trillion
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:58.160]  dollars just think of it in tax cuts for american families including doubling the standard deduction
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:04.800]  and doubling the child tax credit the typical family of four earning seventy five thousand
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:08.960]  dollars we'll see an income tax cut of more than two thousand dollars they're going to have two
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.920]  thousand dollars and that's in my opinion going to be less than the average you're going to have a
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:21.280]  lot more than that one thing very important for the farmers the great farmers and the great small
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:27.680]  business owners that were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers we have
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.920]  provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms in the family and
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:41.920]  that to me is a very big factor very big i can't afford a family farm this is going to mean companies
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.160]  are going to be coming back you know i campaigned on the fact that we're not going to lose our
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:50.960]  companies anymore they're going to stay in our country and they're going to stay in our country
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:55.280]  and you've been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect but they have stopped right there
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:58.400]  i'm going to come back with more of the president after breaking up a guest joining us let's back
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:02.720]  it up a little bit you know that's the thing my dad we have an old farm slash ranch and they give
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:06.960]  more and more of it gets sold just to keep the little pieces pieces we've got and then the way
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:11.520]  they've got it set up you run cattle do stuff just to pay the taxes and then everybody has to have a
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:17.920]  couple other jobs on the side and this has all been actuaried in by the big companies
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:27.680]  and there's only one group only one group that has higher levels of suicide than our veterans
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:33.600]  and that's us farmers we were so close to total shutdown and we're still in deep trouble but we
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:39.760]  were fighting back we're conscious now we've been stabbed quite a bit but our heart's still pumping
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:43.280]  we're going to make it i know we are we're going to crush these people when they know it
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:52.640]  please listen carefully because i'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot

[1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:13.360]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:23.200]  important for the farmers the great farmers and the great small business owners that were forced to
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:29.600]  sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers we have provided for the most part
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:35.360]  estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms in the family and that to me is a very big
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:43.680]  factor very big this is this is going to mean companies are going to be coming back you know i
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:47.920]  campaigned on the fact that we're not going to lose our companies anymore they're going to stay
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:52.720]  in our country and they're going to stay in our country and you've been seeing what's been happening
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:57.920]  even at this prospect but they have tremendous enthusiasm right now in this country and we
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:03.440]  have companies pouring back into our country and that means jobs and it means really the formation
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:08.480]  of new young beautiful strong companies so that's going to be very very important
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:13.600]  the pass-throughs you know all about and the small businesses are going to be big beneficiaries
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:19.680]  we are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into this country money that was frozen
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:25.200]  overseas and in parts and worlds and some of them don't even like us and they had the money well
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:33.360]  they're not going to have the money long and uh so it's it's really i guess it's very simple when
[1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:41.120]  you think you haven't heard this expression but we are making america great again you haven't heard
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:49.920]  that i want to i want to have them get up and get the glamour and the glory and i just want to have
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:54.720]  a few of them come up and they'll speak for a little while short if they the shorter the better
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:00.960]  that way we can we can get all of you we'll get everybody up right but uh i want to thank mitch
[1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:08.640]  mcconnell i want to thank what a job what a job and i want to thank paul they're going to speak
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:14.320]  they're going to say a few words but paul ryan and mitch it was a little team we just got together
[1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:20.640]  and we would work very hard didn't we huh it seems like it was a lot of fun it's always a lot of fun
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:26.160]  when you win if you work hard and lose that's not acceptable but i i'm just going to name a few names
[1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:31.280]  and then some all right folks we are back live just more of the big historic victory and i cannot
[1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:36.960]  stress upon everybody enough i know you know this but your friends and family may not the globalist
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:42.000]  admit in the wiki leagues and many other documents many other statements that they've made that they
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.600]  are openly trying to demoralize the west demoralize free market demoralize renaissance and this tax
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:54.880]  bill is far from perfect but it's the biggest in modern history it's as big as kennedy tax cuts
[1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:59.600]  that by the way doubled tax receipts in one year and you ask well why don't democrats want that they
[1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:07.200]  want control and they admit it so this is a big victory the worm is turning in my view it'll be
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:12.080]  so hard for the nasty miller and his whole fake thing to try to bring trump down now even with
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:16.080]  the christmas indictment of of kushner that was supposedly going to happen a few days before
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:20.480]  uh we have that on good sources they may back off on that now miller's saying maybe a year out
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:24.400]  hoping you forget about the criminality of their investigation now that you use come out and said
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:28.800]  this is going to flood jobs back in the u.s. you're supposed to match taxes with us under
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:33.120]  these secret agreements i mean that's in the associated press that we're breaking global
[1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:37.760]  government rules yeah that screwed us over i mean we might have got sucked into your world
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:41.200]  government it was some great deal then later you could have took over but you made it a
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:46.160]  screw job from the beginning you want to tell us who runs the tpp and all this oh trump killed that
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:51.280]  too so i could be critical of trump on quite a few things but frankly i couldn't do what he's done
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.800]  and the global movement that all of you are leading that matt drudge is leading i i mean i
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:02.480]  can't thank everybody in the independent real press but now having talk show hosts you know
[1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:08.160]  john king on cnn and say this is a great deal for people this is really historic 1.5 trillion
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:12.000]  getting rid of the cutting way back the estate tax bringing back the corporate money
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.960]  that this is a big deal and i couldn't think of a better person in the aftermath of this victory
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:23.680]  the conceit libertarian talk show host expert a businessman father a patriot stephan mollinou
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:29.440]  needs no introduction youtube forward slash free domain radio twitter stephan mollinou
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:34.560]  a free domain radio dot com you get a book the art of the argument that's excellent by the way
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:40.160]  so he joins us now to give us his look at this and how he thinks they're going to counter strike
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.640]  or maybe maybe he disagrees maybe this isn't that huge of a victory stephan mollinou thanks for
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:50.480]  coming on with us sir thanks alexa great to be here merry christmas to you your family and your
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.080]  great listenership i really appreciate the time to chat today back at you it is a great victory
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:00.880]  it is a great victory because it does a whole number of things number one it puts money back
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:04.640]  into the hands of the american worker which of course is a great thing you get to keep more of
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:10.000]  your own money and some of that is direct in terms of the tax cuts themselves but another is that
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.360]  by lowering corporate tax rates corporations have more money to invest in upgrades to to pay
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.760]  their workers more so it is a wonderful christmas present for the american worker that's a great
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:24.400]  thing the other great thing is it reveals the democrat party to be basically a combination
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:29.120]  of the grinch and a bond villain i mean it's weird when you think about it oh no american
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:34.000]  workers are getting more money around christmas time that's the worst thing in the world and it's
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:40.880]  like what terrible opportunities are they working with if they post this exactly 34 years since we've
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:45.040]  had a real tax cut for the middle class and workers while we've been deindustrialized which
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.680]  they admit a plan i mean why do you think the EU is so dumb they're openly bitching saying you're
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:54.800]  going to get the jobs now well of course the EU doesn't want to have to restrain their own
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:58.800]  socialist spending so of course they would love a deal where everyone keeps their corporate
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:03.920]  tax rates high and keeps their tax rates high the EU is also being revealed this season as well for
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:10.480]  sanctioning working on massive sanctions against poland while paying billions of euros to turkey
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:15.760]  of all places poland that the west fought to try and free and failed in the second world war who
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:22.320]  fought valiantly against both nazism and communism are being sanctioned while turkey of all places
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.880]  is being rewarded with billions of euros i'm glad you raised that they're threatening poland and
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:32.960]  others with billions and fines a hundred thousand euros explain that to people per illegal that's
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:38.000]  come in military age man the raping the killing going on the welfare they're giving them throwing
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.520]  pensioners out of their section eight housing putting them in i mean this is a crazy plan well
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:50.560]  of course they hate the fact that poland is a christian nation they hate the fact that poland
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.840]  is a proud nation and they hate the fact that polish people having been subjugated and controlled
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.520]  for a significant portion of their history either as poland or the pre-poland country subjugated
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:08.720]  by islam subjugated by communism the fact that they fought so hard to be free that they value
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:12.400]  and treasure their freedom and are willing to stand up against the corrupt tyranny of the
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:17.200]  EU is something that simply cannot be allowed to stand i mean turkey is working nicely with the EU
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:22.720]  but poland wishes to remain in sovereign country and to resist mass immigration from the third world
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:28.560]  and so naturally of course they are fighting it tooth and nail and they also don't want they don't
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:33.040]  want the example you know one prisoner walks through a fence that everyone thinks is locked
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.840]  the other prisoners start getting ideas they can't have one example of a country with borders they
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:42.160]  can't have one example of a country with an in-group preference and they sure as hell can't have a
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:49.680]  country where christianity stands against foreign religions one i'm concerned about though is the
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:54.800]  wild-eyed insanity stuff on malinu where they've gone from laughing at me and yelling in the street
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.000]  to like trying to attack me now they're getting more and more desperate and uh roseo donal trying
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.120]  to make bribes on on twitter saying i'm serious a million dollars two million for senators that
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:10.480]  vote against it uh and and and like saying go let's go kill congressman i mean they're getting
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:15.120]  they're going into complete insane asylum land and i'm not scared of them like they're gonna beat
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:21.680]  us i'm just worried about their mental illness i mean clearly what is wrong with them they are
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:28.720]  addicted to power and they are representing an entire community in in america this is tens possibly
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:35.360]  even a hundred million or more people who probably feel genuinely having been dependent on the state
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:38.560]  for generations and i'm not just talking about the poor we're also talking about the military
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:43.760]  industrial complex and all the people who benefit from the state's awesome power to create and
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:48.480]  redistribute trillions of dollars in the economy that has created a market of people dependent upon
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:53.440]  state power dependent upon the coercive nature of the state apparatus and when someone like
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.680]  donald trump comes along and says we're gonna make the state smaller we're gonna put more people in
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.160]  the free market we're gonna put more people in the tax paying private sector and out of the
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:07.120]  government dependent public sector they panic and they freak out because they view the government
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:12.400]  as the sole source of their survival they do not they no longer have the self-esteem to believe
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:16.400]  that they can survive without wealth exactly you gotta go to break step on malinus stay right
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:19.520]  there because i want to talk about this because literally they're the ones that have always been

[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:27.760]  domesticated and then we're finally struggling back because you know half our wealth isn't
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:31.520]  enough for them and they think we're killing them because they act like we're killing them
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:34.720]  meanwhile we're bringing all this wealth back i'm gonna help them that's what created all the wealth

[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:57.120]  ourselves we can take our country back you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:13.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:22.880]  stefan malinou is our guest drive the shotgun with us in the hour we have the former board
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:28.960]  member of the debos group the head of the aspen group you name it uh ted malik joining us again
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:35.920]  he's finally ready to talk about luciferianism and satanism in the elite uh he himself has
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:42.160]  you know degrees not just in economics and the rest of it but also um in theology and in the
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:46.960]  study of religions and uh it's it's rampant in the globalist but but again whether you believe
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:52.960]  the devil or not it it's an operating system a spirit an attitude like pirates you know catch
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:56.640]  their hair on fire and you'll have skull and crossbones saying if you don't give up we'll kill
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:00.560]  you there's blood dripping out of the skull and a flag it means we'll kill you anyways uh so it's
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:04.480]  it's it's it's kind of an idea of we're gonna hurt everybody we're gonna steal from everybody
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:08.640]  we're gonna invert reality we're gonna be corrupt and anybody who isn't into that you finally run
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.840]  to people that are like that you're just blown away that they get off on blowing systems up
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:20.560]  controlling people dumping people down they get off on it and free market is a system that allows
[1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:25.440]  you to make choices through the market and generally the will of the people in a real market
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:33.360]  is is is the best system but you see a buzz fee editor saying i want total communism for christmas
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:40.960]  okay so again living here in a quasi-free system much better than north korea they're
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:46.000]  making these statements and stefan also wanted to get into christmas because in my view if you're
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.240]  able to say two plus two equals four that's freedom quoting george arwell well if you can
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:56.080]  say christmas it's freedom and it sounds silly but they really want to erase everything whether it
[1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:01.440]  was perfect or bad or good or indifferent because they want to force you to accept their new system
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:06.160]  so that's why they they go after christian culture particularly i don't mean the fake
[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:10.640]  churches and all the corrupt things that are involved with those but i mean the actual idea of
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:16.240]  that and then they make fun of uh you know that and want to destroy it so step on my
[1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:22.000]  new why uh you know just as a researcher looking at like an anthropologist or sociologist why do
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  they want to attack christmas and why are they going after it so much in this culture war and
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.320]  how are they doing in the culture war that feeds back into what we hit at the break what are they
[1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:36.880]  going to do as this all caves in most of them weren't even part of the power structure but they
[1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:41.760]  were living through it feeling like they were running things culturally and we're going to
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:48.160]  excoriate and control and reeducate uh those of us liberal conservative libertarian agnostic
[1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:53.680]  that that didn't fit into their little box i mean really they're a cult of bullies well there are
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:57.840]  those and this is i think very appropriate to christmas time alex there are those in the world
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:03.120]  who want to do good to be virtuous and that is individual action that is going to help the
[1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:07.840]  poor that is going to bring food to people is going to work in soup kitchens it's going to
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:12.720]  speak to someone who's down and raise up their spirits or if you want workers to to make more
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:16.960]  money then it's about starting a business and hiring people and paying them well or if you
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:20.480]  want people to get free health care then it's about donating to a hospital or a church or
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:26.240]  becoming a doctor and uh working pro bono from time to time so there's individual action which
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:30.640]  gives you the satisfaction of having done good in the world but there's people who just want to
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:35.040]  feel good without actually expending the time energy and resources to do good themselves and
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:40.160]  those are the people who want to change the system or the structure or the state or the law
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:45.360]  in order to remove negative stimuli from them poor people sick people but they don't actually
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:49.600]  want to go out and do good individually that's too much work they want to get all of the benefits
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:54.800]  of doing good by advocating for a system that's usually coercive in nature and thus as literally
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:01.280]  as said the the road to hell is paved with good intentions i could i've never heard it said better
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:06.000]  that i mean that's it and so you pointed out the groups out there that just think hey i'm
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.080]  going to be thrown on the street and they don't know any better and that's that's kind of the
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:16.240]  your folks on the bottom of the room but in the last decade or so more and more of that
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:20.320]  pyramidal structure actually thinks they're part of the elite and have been taught kind of the
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:28.160]  upper crust anti-liberty anti-human authoritarianism and so they've the left in its modern sense has
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:33.120]  i believe converted to a crazy form of authoritarianism do you agree with that and and if so why
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:40.320]  i think it's the devil's temptation right the devil takes jesus to a mountain top
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:45.120]  in the desert and shows in the whole world and says all of this can be yours if you follow me
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:51.040]  and this darwinian thirst for material power for material resources it's merely about gene
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:55.680]  reproduction for the most part we are we are driven to seek resources to ensure the survival
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:00.880]  of our offspring and if you take away christian ethics or philosophical ethics or virtues that
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:06.560]  surmount and surpass and restrain the mirnechi and darwinian will for power is a government for
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:12.320]  control of resources society falls apart society is a common code of self-restraint and in under
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:17.120]  darwinism there is no self-restraint you get as many resources by whatever means necessary as
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:21.680]  possible you have just crystallized it and the globalist endorse that they say we're social
[1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:28.560]  darwinist explain what that means to people well social darwinism to some degree is i think
[1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:32.880]  allowing for the state to favor particular groups what one of the things that's happened that's
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:38.320]  been really really tragic is the growth of the single mom industry so to speak where you have
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:44.000]  this breakdown in marriage you have easy divorces you have alimony you have child support and you
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.480]  have the state stepping in for irresponsible women who have children and then they lionized it
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:53.760]  they were not attacking single one but then they lionized it they set it up well it used to be the
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:57.360]  case of course that if you were a single mom your parents would end up having to pay to raise your
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:02.080]  child so your parents had a very strong incentive to restrain the wild tsunami like hormones of
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:06.720]  teenage sexuality with the welfare state taking away the negative consequences of irresponsible
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:11.040]  sexuality it's the old chesterton quote says when you get rid of the big laws you don't end up with
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:15.680]  no laws you end up with an infinity of tiny laws and now we have all of this crazy breakdown in
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:20.880]  sexual morality which is causing massive amounts of predation and massive amounts of single motherhood
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:26.080]  and so this is the welfare state takes resources from more responsible people and gives it to less
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:29.840]  responsible people thus encouraging the reproduction of less responsible people
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:34.000]  personality is largely genetic and therefore you have social engineering you have a kind of
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.520]  dysgenics operating at a social level through the welfare state and it is well exactly the
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.080]  eugenics claimed they were going to clean all that up but instead they made it 50 times worse
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:49.920]  yeah the government should not be involved in providing resources for reproduction that is
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:55.920]  eugenics at a fundamental level whether you have eugenics on a race or class-based level it's wrong
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:00.000]  to take resources from one group and give it to another group because it's fundamentally messing
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.360]  with the DNA of the species usually to extraordinarily terrible effect well we've seen that I don't
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:09.280]  know if you've seen the compilation of videos we might play it again where people go I got 12
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:14.080]  kids you somebody better take care of them it's not enough to get $10,000 a month and free housing
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:18.640]  and free furniture and everything I'm going to sit here on my butt squirting kids out and you're
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:25.360]  going to pay for it oh and it's terrible and children when children are an expense society
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.080]  gets more responsible because responsible people have to pay for those expenses and women choose
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:34.160]  the best provider in a free market the best provider tends to be the smartest the most
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:39.680]  resourceful the most intelligent the most wise the most mature and so you end up with a positive
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:44.320]  eugenics in the free market where smarter people end up with more resources more free market is
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:50.240]  the only humane true eugenics it is absolutely and when you end up with the system where children
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:56.000]  become an asset rather than a liability then what happens is people have children in order to make
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.800]  money and that means they don't have to have anybody responsible sticking around and of course
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:05.360]  the whole welfare state thing where they say you only get welfare if there's no man in the house
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:11.520]  they are paying women to have children and keep fatherhood at bay to keep fathers away instead
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:14.560]  oh my god I gotta go to Brightwell come back I gotta ask you I mean they admit they're doing
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:19.040]  about design just to have control but don't they see what it ends up in it literally ends
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:25.520]  in idiocracy and in idiocracy isn't coming in 300 years we're here step on my new free domain radio

[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:34.160]  know you're busy i'm busy if you'll just commit to go look at the thousands of items from high
[1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:40.160]  quality shortwave radios to books to videos to survival gear to hundreds of great patriot t-shirts
[1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:45.680]  to spread the word and meet like-minded people to hundreds of greats uh high quality vitamins
[1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:54.160]  mineral supplements we really do go out and find out the best research the best scientist and and
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:59.040]  really bring you game changers and i didn't think this was coming until january and i bet on dr
[1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:04.400]  grip's butt about this because it's it's got a bunch of proprietary products in it that are so hard
[1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:09.920]  to get that it's been sold out for over six months and this would be the best seller we ever had
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:14.960]  if we could keep it in but to try to have it at california standards and all the rest of it's
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:19.280]  impossible with these ingredients because you know kale has 20 times the lead that that that you know
[1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:24.560]  that this has uh but that's a food so california lets you have it so we have to put stickers on
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:31.120]  this for california because it doesn't pass that california standard prop 65 they put in 20 years
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:35.840]  ago you know where the buildings say this building's toxic even it's brand new and the cars they sell
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:43.760]  they have big stickers this is toxic and it's just insane so this has i think like a third as much
[1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.160]  lead in it as kale does but it's got herbs in it that have naturally occurring lead in it so
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:52.400]  that we try to even source it where we could have it without it and have it pass california
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:55.440]  standards that by the way you've got a whole foods at 90 percent of it says does not pass
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:33:00.800]  california standards because nobody can okay but again i just said forget it we're not doing it
[1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:04.960]  we're putting the we're putting the sticker on it okay doesn't pass stupid california baloney
[1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:10.880]  standards where the lawyers pass that law the air has more lead in it okay i mean it's unbelievable
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:16.240]  the point is is that it's amazing and it goes in we're not just putting on a formula saying this
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:20.480]  knocks out yeast and candida and then put anything out and then there was a problem we just change it
[1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:25.920]  this is the formula that works taking a six plus months to even get it back in stock and people it
[1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:30.640]  has five star reviews it's insane and if you think just probiotics are good to just place the bad
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:35.040]  bacteria because all the pesticides in the food kill the good bacteria and then you take good
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:39.200]  bacteria so that you can replace it that's a good thing to do we have fluorolife and carnivore
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:43.760]  enzyme they're all excellent 50 billion live enzymes you name it it's i mean 50 billion live
[1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:50.480]  live cultures it's all there but myco zx is amazing and will annihilate the slime walls
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:57.360]  that yeast and fungus is creating the gut to take over your entire biological system and feed itself
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:02.160]  you have to knock that out and let me tell you most people that take this it is insanely dramatic
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:05.600]  if you have a yeast or fungus problem in your gut if you don't have a problem well then
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:10.320]  you're like 10% that just say okay it's got a bunch of good herbs in it and compounds myco zx is back

[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:06.880]  has grown usually 30 40 percent a year we've tripled the last year as everybody knows we're
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:12.000]  under total attack and they have just cut off millions of sponsorship destroyed things i mean
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:17.120]  they've had black ops dis info teams then we got it's it's it's i'm not whining it's actually
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:20.720]  quite entertaining and enjoyable and makes my life exciting i'm seriously i'm not saying that
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:25.760]  that's kind of sad for my family but that's you know i trust in god but they hate the fact that
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:29.600]  you're direct funding as they're trying to shut that off it's so step on is like yeah you know
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:33.440]  we're growing 20 percent every year they've been after him too so he's not gonna whine about it
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:37.840]  he's saying hey we're growing despite the attacks we would have completely taken the culture back
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:44.400]  if if if they weren't fighting back just know this a war is happening it's critical to your own
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:48.960]  interest to know we're not funded by george soros and globals we're funded by you so we
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:54.880]  are your fist and we are taking action stephan well let's sort of take a little bit of an example
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.800]  here just to talk about the financial benefit to the listeners because you know cold hard cash runs
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:05.440]  the world and and numbers don't lie so your channel and my channel um were very very interested
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:11.440]  in donald trump and although he is a man with laws like i've paid for it with 70 000 a month
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.080]  now it's like 5 000 that's how i that's how we pay well i've paid so almost a million
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:21.600]  i i did a lot of shows uh reaching millions of people about the lies that were being told
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:25.840]  about donald trump because for me it was a twofer it was help get people to the truth about trump
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:29.600]  and his agenda and also show just how much the mainstream media lies how do you know they're
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:34.880]  lying they're broadcast and how much did you pay for telling the truth well it was a bit of a
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:39.600]  challenge let's put it that way at times but look i mean just look at so donald trump got in and
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:45.040]  now the biggest tax cut in uh u.s history has just been passed which puts lots of money back into the
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:50.000]  hands of our listeners so if you've helped support at the show 20 bucks a month 50 bucks a month
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.400]  five bucks a month whatever bought some stuff from your store bought my book helped support things
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.160]  i think it's kind of paid off just in terms of you may be getting thousands but i just want to
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:03.440]  explain we went from no mandate we went from 70 000 a month when they delisted us and went like
[1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:09.440]  95 demonetized to again like seven to ten thousand a month i mean i'm not whining i'm people to know
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:14.160]  this is what youtube did to us and admittedly to punish us so i'm not saying hey look at me i'm
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:18.560]  just telling listeners thank god you're there we'd be gone because listeners filled in that gap
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:24.000]  you want to fund the people who are being opposed the most because the people who are being opposed
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.720]  the most are doing the most you know if you're in a war and you're marching in the wrong direction
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:32.240]  you're really not going to reach any opposition nobody's going to be fighting you in fact the
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:36.240]  other the team the other army the enemy are very happy that you're marching in the wrong
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:40.080]  direction it's when you march in the right direction i guess wonder woman style that you
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.720]  run into the blistering fire so look at the people who've got the most smoking craters around them and
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:49.680]  give them some ammo gosh you just it's true and it's not that i'm even whining i want folks to know
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:53.760]  like like i'm a heat seeking missile that goes towards their fire like the world war two analogy
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:58.560]  of they didn't have a radar or satellite then they went towards the flag because they would shoot you
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:02.880]  you know wherever the factories were and it's the same thing we're we're steering into it
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.040]  we just want folks to know exactly as you said whoever's being attacked the most is the key to
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:14.160]  spread there is no substitute for and it's a great kind of radar because when you look at the people
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.160]  who are being attacked the most and listen there are people who are wrong and it depends how you're
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.720]  being attacked if you put it like if i put out an argument that has some incorrect data or i've made
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:28.480]  a reasoning error fantastic you know people will tell me that but instead it's racist dumb you have
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:34.880]  they're not attacking us on what we did right and if they go after you at this hysterical
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:40.560]  venomous puff adder viper strikes personal level yeah he's a this he's a that and they just try to
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:45.600]  bury you in negative adjectives that means you're doing something right and so when people are being
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:51.920]  attacked libel slanted lied about and so on that's when you really want to pay them attention because
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:57.120]  they're not fools the enemies are not fools they know who's having the most impact and they also
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:01.680]  know when the person having the most impact has good reason and evidence behind them because if
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:08.080]  you've got bad reason and evidence you just say oh the data is contradict exactly we have their number
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:14.160]  we know their program and we're winning that's why they hate us and they have openly told they've
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:18.160]  openly told everyone through the uh sore lelinsky book rules for radicals and a lot of other
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:23.920]  publications they've openly said we just want power we just want control we don't have any values we
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.000]  don't have any ethics we don't have any standards but we know our enemies do and we're dying to use
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.960]  them against them yeah so linsky said i worship lucifer i pledge myself lucifer in the intro of

[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:19.840]  jones all right final segment with stefan malinu and i said i want to get the topics he wants to
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:24.160]  cover we've already covered a couple but i gotta raise this because it's come up several points
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:30.560]  faced with libel suit dossier drafter christopher steele who got paid by the FBI to put it out
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:36.240]  hedges on linking trump to russia non-court documents he says he can't i mean it it it has
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:40.640]  imploded okay and then the crimes but that's a secondary thing the big one is i haven't mentioned
[1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:46.560]  yet today is 19 people injured his car deliberately hits pedestrians in melbourne uh you know for every
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:51.040]  car attack one out of a hundred might be somebody else but it's always islamist the other times
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:56.400]  and i noticed that cnn didn't say it was islamist even though he pledged leads to ices
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:02.160]  they said he was mentally ill mental health issues muslim who rammed 18 people with car
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:08.560]  has no link to terror because they say and now they're saying the guy that attacked new york
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:12.400]  was mentally ill well of course they're mentally ill but they're being directed by
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:18.000]  by a monotheistic death call that the left bizarrely is sided with because this is our
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:25.680]  guest just was talking about earlier it's this whole sololensky power what's crazy is you read
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:32.560]  the elite books of carl marx and uh and and vi lennon all these people they they say we love
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:37.200]  lucifer but lennon was a devil worshiper it doesn't mean he's even believes in the devil he is the
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:42.240]  devil you know it's kind of like uh a lot of the top google people say i don't believe in god
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:48.240]  yet i'm gonna be one uh curse well so it's megalomania is what it is and it's the same craziness
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:53.360]  so so i said hey whatever topic you want to cover but i'm just throwing this out because the europeans
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:59.120]  have come out a new poll saying immigration terrorism is the biggest issue 40 percent said while
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:05.040]  they're being oppressed and told if you report what color somebody is will arrest you and then
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:11.760]  we're not joking this is this is like naked crazy authoritarianism i hope this is the last desperate
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:17.600]  gasp of the authoritarian left but you know even though we're getting a few beach heads here i don't
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:25.200]  think we're out of the woods yet stuff i'm on him it's uh horrible and tragic and i'm kind of torn
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:30.640]  i'll tell you straight up alex i'm really ambivalent about this i do want the mainstream media to
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.680]  reform themselves and i kind of don't you know that old saying never interrupt your enemy when he's
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:41.280]  in the process of making one giant mistake after another the fact that they are so doubling down
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:47.920]  on avoiding basic issues like demographics like iq like belief systems like compatibility uh like
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:53.440]  welfare usage like crime statistics the fact that they're so steadfastly covering their eyes
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.840]  sticking their heads in the sand and screaming la la la la like a half upside down ostrich
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.240]  is creating massive market opportunities for us if they reform themselves and if they start telling
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:07.040]  basic truths about the world people will start tuning into them rather than us so it's not like
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:10.960]  i just want people to watch me if they really reform themselves i'd be happy to have fewer
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:14.880]  audiences because that would mean more truth would be getting to the world exactly i don't think they
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:19.600]  can't be in this plague of crazies that's all i want but the left i just want more sanity in the
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:25.280]  world yeah i just now the fact that they are literally delusional i mean of course they're
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:31.680]  talking about mental illness because leftism is a mental illness it is a steadfast denial of basic
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:37.760]  biological empirical reality it is a denial of universal moral values like thou shalt not steal
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:44.080]  thou shalt not kill thou shalt not thirst for demonic power over thy fellow bipeds it is a
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:50.160]  denial of reality it is a denial of virtue it is a denial of compassion and it arises from a childhood
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:55.760]  written empathetic grave of maltreatment and so it is of course they say that these people are
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:03.520]  mentally ill because they're mentally ill expanding on that russia gate weather topics i got hundreds
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:07.920]  but i want to hear what's front and center on on stuff on my own is brain well i want to think
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:11.520]  about christmas just a little bit because you know we spent a lot of time fighting the forces of
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:18.240]  darkness and it is important excuse me to love and remember to turn towards the light so if you've
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:24.080]  had a year of combat i suggest you rest and enjoy your time of christmas it's funny you say that because
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:28.480]  i never rest and i'm committed for next year i apologize i interrupted you just to i'm committed
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:34.320]  to actually taking off next week sorry go ahead well so if you fought the good fight rest enjoy
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:40.480]  and get ready for next year if you haven't then rest anyway and gear up to commit to next year
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:45.600]  which is going to be one hell of a year to be fighting well that's my next question for you
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:50.560]  that's why we're mind-melding yes this was the most insane year in my life everybody else says it
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:58.000]  was good the bad thing i believe was incredible year of change what is 2018 well 2018 is the
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:03.920]  rack and rock of freedom 2018 is the final battle i think because either there's going to be a tipping
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:09.200]  point where people start to go towards the truth tellers and those who have virtue compassion
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:14.800]  empathy and goodness in their heart or they're going to slide down to the satanic pit of this
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:19.920]  office and the liars we have to upper game we who are out there in the public sphere telling the
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:25.280]  truth we have to be more engaging more entertaining more enjoyable we have to use every trick in the
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:31.200]  book to pull people towards the giant geyser light of freedom that we pursue and represent
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:36.560]  we have to upper game and not just stare at the demons in hatred but stare at the light
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:40.160]  and the virtues enjoy because there's only a certain amount of opposition that's going to
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:44.000]  attract people we have to show people what we love as well as what we hate like the old thing
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.520]  about the soldier the soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him he
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:52.080]  fights because he loves what he's protecting he loves what's behind him so we have to remember
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:57.360]  to share the love of freedom the love of free of free markets the love of free speech the love
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:02.720]  of gun ownership we have to remember to share what we love in order to attract people to our
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:07.360]  course and not just simply as the old saying that Nietzsche has said if you hunt monsters your own
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:13.520]  your whole life you have to be very careful you do not turn into one total veritas you know i woke
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:16.160]  up at three thirty in the morning and i couldn't go back to sleep and i wrote on a bunch of notes
[1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:21.760]  and i forgot to bring him a course but that was one of them was to just celebrate and just turn
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:28.400]  loose and appreciate kind of a zen moment all that is good and magnify that and think about the good
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:32.960]  instead of hating the evil so much that i tend to do and there's a place for that but i had that
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:37.360]  i'd never really experienced this much of my life but now that i had the feeling of all
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:43.760]  that was like kind of like not turning loose but feeling the source and like like resting back into
[1:51:43.760 --> 1:51:50.480]  it i mean this really is metaphysical hermetic we i mean we know all this and that's why that's
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:55.440]  why i know next year is the battle of the gods uh you know as you just said the good or dumb are
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:59.520]  wrong because of course things repeat themselves we're not saying the final battle of the gods but
[1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:04.240]  but a model of that because they are going to throw everything and for every action there's
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:10.800]  an opposite and equal reaction quantum mechanics shows and as i feel my personal discernment energy
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:17.280]  increasing because the enemy is now about to throw its full weight against us so don't think just
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:21.120]  because we feel all this energy and strength right now that that's because we're totally
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:25.680]  want to be arrogant that's because we're like godzilla something big's about to come out of
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:30.960]  the ocean the big fight's about to happen well that's true and it is going to be on social media
[1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:34.560]  it's going to be on youtube it's going to be on facebook it's going to be on the internet
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:40.960]  because the internet was the very great equation variable that they did not anticipate uh the
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:45.920]  internet was responsible for getting donald trump in power and keeping hillary clinton the sorceress
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:50.560]  of uh iniquity out of power so they're very aware where the true power resides they can
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:54.400]  read the numbers of subscriptions as well as we can they know where the audience has gone for
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:59.040]  being arrogant to panic that makes them stronger now that they're not arrogant anymore but more
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:04.880]  dangerous right because when people panic cornered animals get more random in their behaviors so yeah
[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:09.680]  you need to be alert but we do need you know we fight ugliness but we worship beauty and we must
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:14.560]  remember to turn away from the ugliness to drink deep of the cup of beauty to inspire people with
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:19.440]  the beauty of the world that we want to create rather than simply showing people all the time how
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:25.280]  ugly is the enemies we face because people will be drawn to that beauty and that beauty that love
[1:53:25.280 --> 1:53:29.440]  you know we may fear the devil but we love god if that's where virtue lives in our hearts and we
[1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:35.200]  must remember to bring people to church rather than to the exorcism all the time you're right you
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:38.480]  that is literally the epiphany i had earlier on it's a common truth like i discovered you're
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:42.080]  absolutely right but i think that's spreading right now is that we need to celebrate our victories
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:48.000]  be thankful and and as you said we fight evil but we love beauty we fight evil to protect beauty
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.600]  and if we allow our all of our actions to be dictated by evildoers we simply are the shadow
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:01.120]  cast by immorality in the world and that is not enough we really must we can we can show the
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:05.520]  darkness by being the light just as much as going down to the dungeons you know if you brighten
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:10.000]  something up and if something's in the way of the light it costs a long and highly visible shadow
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.840]  and if we blaze brightly in our joy of truth and beauty and virtue then we will show the horrifying
[1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:21.360]  nature of those i agree far more than if we go down and fight them all the time how did hercules
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:26.160]  defeat it when he had to go into the dark or his final feat of memory serves and i guess he had to
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:31.200]  like go inwardly the light that was within him to defeat it it wasn't battling anymore he couldn't
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:36.800]  beat the darkness by sheer will he had to think about the light that was in him that god had given
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:44.080]  him to defeat it jesus was not a ninja jesus had no nun checks jesus was somebody who pursued and
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:49.440]  talked about virtue and the light and sacrificed himself for it and in that sacrifice he created
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:55.200]  an epiphany of beauty and virtue that people have been following for thousands of years and that's
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:55:01.280]  not a bad model to be following and that's why they hated so much right right because they could not
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:06.240]  taunt jesus in fighting at their level they could not taunt jesus into fighting at their level
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:12.000]  he transcended their level and provoked a following that was in many ways the true foundation and
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.360]  beauty of western civilization just like they attacked christ they attacked uncle tom because
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.320]  uncle tom wasn't a wimp he was strong he just let them kill him and torture him to bring them down
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:26.640]  and the fools see that go look at this idiot but he sacrificed himself yeah just when they think
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:31.360]  you've lost is the time for your greatest victory and that i think is next year all right wow well
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:34.640]  we'll be there together hopefully they haven't done the internet kill switch thank you stefan very
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:46.080]  powerful thank you
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:57.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:03.600]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:15.360]  all right this short little segment before our next guest joins us a former board member of the
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:21.920]  davos group head of the aspen institute highest levels of the globalist operation he wants to
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:30.080]  get into luciferianism satanism the operating system of the psychopaths we're facing ted malik
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:35.760]  joining us coming up in the next segment but i wanted to get into senator warner because again
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:42.640]  if their whole russia gates falling apart uh if the head of the ppgate dossier has now come out
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:47.760]  in court and said well there isn't russian collusion in it because they're getting sued for saying it
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.160]  so he goes oh no we didn't actually say it the dossier there's no proof it's not real that's in
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:59.360]  the news uh today out of the washington times but they haven't told their minions that yet so warner
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:03.760]  comes out with press conferences almost every day along with that shiftless creature shift
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:10.640]  and they get up there and they go don't you try to fire him you stop it arger and drops like i'm
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:20.320]  not gonna fire him he's falling apart he's a joke it's an embarrassment to them the whole
[1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:25.360]  thing's a fraud it's blowing up in their face but then you're coming out saying don't you fire him
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:30.720]  to act like it's got all this gravity to act like he's scared of it that's their cover story
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:35.120]  and it's so pathetic meanwhile kit daniel just wrote a story that needs to go viral it's on info
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.600]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com and news wars dot com because you know we're winning but
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:44.000]  some of the public does it so it's neck and neck here sometimes well not quite neck and neck now
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:49.120]  we're gonna pull it away but let's not like the wolf says in pulp fiction let's not start you know
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:52.880]  doing you know a lot to each other yet because we're not there yet okay and we're never there
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:57.760]  as soon as you think you're there you know it's all over uh trump reelection odds explode after
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:02.560]  first year tax cuts that's i'll start the next segment with that juicy Ronald Reagan famously
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:06.720]  said he said when i met donald trump it was like i was meeting the president and i knew
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:11.280]  knew he would end up being the president was roger stone seemed to meet with him
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:18.480]  and then uh reagan had folks called stone and called stone back and said that something about
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:24.240]  that guy that that that he needed to run him for office by like reagan never did that so there
[1:58:24.240 --> 1:58:30.480]  you go it's all destiny ladies and gentlemen what matters about trump is delivery the judge
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:37.680]  you treat by its fruits judge it by its fruits for the enemy attacks us they're not stupid they know
[1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:42.880]  i am that they think i'm an insane maniac i try to buy me off ten million dollars a year
[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:48.880]  is what the last number got to eat over a decade ago well we're way surpassed that it's not about
[1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:52.480]  me and ten million dollars but how much money do i have in the bank if i have to fight them
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:55.840]  when they come after me which they're already doing how much money do i have to build an operation
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:01.120]  and try to go after them to oh you want to kill me let's go all the way but here's warner with
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:06.560]  his incredible and it's all fake kind of all powerful and like to look distinguished it's
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:13.840]  all a con game they're all failed actors basically here he is i rise today concerned about the threats
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:19.200]  like the special counsel's critical investigation i'm not saying he is one of russian interference
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:26.560]  in the 2016 last year over the last several weeks a growing chorus sick of irresponsible
[1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:33.920]  and reckless voices have called for president trump to shut down see criticizing your fake
[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:40.320]  investigation is shutting it down no it's not these calls came from the fringes of our political
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:46.000]  discourse those who would refuse and then we figured out we're kicking your ass we said don't do it
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:54.240]  before base political instincts any attempt by this president to remove special counsel moeller
[1:59:54.240 --> 2:00:00.960]  from his position the hillary minion or to pardon key witnesses in any effort to shield them
[2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:10.160]  from accountability or shut down the investigation would be a gross abuse of power well buddy don't
[2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:17.040]  worry it isn't gonna happen you dumbass trying to change the whole subject excuse me i mean what a
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:21.760]  sack of parasitic crap that's the type of stuff the globalist put in this country to get the power
[2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:26.400]  to screw us over and guess what the tide turns come like all those other senators that aren't
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:30.560]  running for reelection and you better start getting ready not to run for it just don't worry

[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.160]  head of the aspen institute been in the highest levels of globalism and he's going to tell some

[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:54.800]  in a moment but first evanka evanka trump talking about uh just the child tax credit
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:03:01.440]  one of the 30 little juicy uh gifts of our own money back to us to choose how we want to spend
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:06.960]  our money and hence social engineer things according to the people's will uh not a bunch
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:14.080]  of hunchback skexies in dc new york and la and hollywood uh who again want to just cuckle everything
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.440]  because they're demonic hunchback demons that know they should be thrown to the furnaces of
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:23.520]  hell immediately uh let's go ahead now and go to this uh this video your name actually has been
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:30.400]  linked to this for a while because you uh were pushing an increase in the child tax credit in
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:35.520]  the ultimate uh final bill it essentially is doubled and i know you also had mike lee with
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:40.560]  you the senator from utah and marco rubio as well explain to the folks at home what it's
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:46.000]  going to do for them well the president was very clear that he really wanted to ensure that this
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:51.840]  bill accomplished two goals of enabling american businesses is to grow and be competitive and
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:58.160]  therefore lead to wage increase for for working americans but to also target relief and middle
[2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:03.680]  income families and the child tax credit is an incredible vehicle to do that we all know the
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:09.440]  cost of raising children has gone up exponentially in this country as until recently wages have
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:15.200]  stagnated so raising children is very expensive but it's the most important investment that we as
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:21.920]  the country can make in the in in the future this is this is the next generation of american workers
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:27.280]  american entrepreneurs and innovators so the child tax credit was doubled their fundability
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:35.600]  was expanded very importantly the standard deduction the standard for the average family
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:40.960]  the standard deduction was actually doubled which is enormously beneficial it's incredible child
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:46.320]  independent tax care credit was maintained as part of the bill the adoption credit was a lot of
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:50.640]  good stuff in there well when you look at the things that were cut the things that were cut
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:55.120]  were the loopholes that benefited lobbyists and the special and yeah the things that were we're
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:59.760]  going to pay more taxes here actually were things like the child tax credit that would have such
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:07.600]  meaningful impact for for everyday americans one of the things that was really so amazing to me
[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:13.520]  in traveling across the country is just the sense of financial fragility most american families
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:19.040]  experience even middle income american families the average american family can't come up with
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:24.560]  four hundred dollars in the event of an emergency and my father is committed to changing that this
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:30.000]  administration is committed to changing that amen let's see the globalist want a bankruptcy
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:36.320]  clout and piven to be able to reorganize everything that's the plan i mean they admitted it's not
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:42.000]  like we're just here seeing it no and it looks like that that's what they say and so when you
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:49.760]  realize that it's just so cold-blooded what they're up to and how close they got us to the edge of that
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:57.920]  precipice and now sweeter it makes this reprieve but we better work harder and realize the globalist
[2:05:57.920 --> 2:06:03.200]  that left us they admit in the new york times that they are just energized uh sorrows gave 18
[2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:08.080]  billion he usually spends about 500 million a year trying to break down the us and now it's 18
[2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:12.640]  million but here's the deal you go see who you can muster on the streets he's trying to beat a huge
[2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:17.520]  wave and historically you just can't do that we're gonna go to ted malin here in just a moment but
[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:24.080]  i wanted to play this clip because this triggered the left uh to have congressman up there tim scott
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:28.560]  who they say could end up being you know the next president down the road who cares he's black all
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:33.760]  I care about his brain and he's a patriot he's shaking with pleasure when he realizes how much
[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:39.040]  true affirmative action under trump's plans already being dumped into inner city areas real jobs high
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:44.400]  paying these aren't just fake make work stuff turning to a social worker with no pay this is the real
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:53.920]  deal and this has got them so incredibly panicked right now this has them scared because they were
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:59.600]  so close to seizing control of america and using it as a pure engine of evil you think the russians
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.960]  were bad when they went in and took the czars out in 1917 at a moment of weakness and turned russia
[2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:11.200]  into an engine of evil and it was bad can you imagine the united states as a pure engine of
[2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:18.640]  evil this has been a mixed bag the last 50 years pure psychopath driven evil by the globalist the
[2:07:18.640 --> 2:07:25.760]  hollywood globalist type i mean good god good god we'd have to go to the emergency backups then
[2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:29.040]  we wouldn't admit that they laid down because they're already get they couldn't get our second they're
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:34.160]  going up the first right now so here's the congressman uh tim scott who's got them all trigger call
[2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:39.200]  him an uncle tom all these names blah blah blah because the left's been good at making black folks
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:42.640]  not think they could be part of the tea party or part of the public party while the public party
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:45.680]  said we want to run you for office you got a good background good person well wake up the
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:49.200]  chief of staff saying we want you in here we've you're a minority with the white house wants to
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:55.040]  hire you come on let's go come on come on come on let's go the democrats aren't playing stranglehold
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:01.360]  saying come on up come on up let's go let's go because they want you literally on their plantation
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:07.360]  let's go this club this president during one of those conversations that we had we talked about
[2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:14.160]  ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country 52 million americans living in
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:19.040]  distressed communities and we talked about legislation that can move those communities
[2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:24.960]  forward got pleased trump has you said yes and as a part of this tax reform package the investing
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:33.040]  and opportunity act has been included which will bring trillions of dollars into poor communities
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:40.880]  because of your willingness to listen thank you thank you
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:48.320]  the president said i only have about 45 more minutes so i'm gonna get to my
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:09:00.720]  he didn't say that okay got it let me just say to those americans who are watching this process
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:06.560]  this is not about washington it's not about the left it's not about the right
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:16.080]  it's about single parent moms who are looking for a reason to be hopeful in 2018
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:26.480]  this tax reform plan delivers for the average single mother a 70 percent tax cut
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:34.560]  for the average family who's working paycheck to paycheck looking for ways to be hopeful
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:42.240]  about their future to have an extra night for dinner out at a restaurant this tax reform package
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:51.120]  cuts their taxes by nearly 60 percent and because of folks like marco rubio and avonka
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:59.520]  when you think about the folks with kids in the household this plan doubles the child tax credit
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:06.720]  and makes about 70 percent of it refundable this is a plan that we can be proud of because it speaks
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:14.080]  to the hearts of everyday americans but it's not the poor workers shouldn't be paying any taxes
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:18.560]  trump had to get rid of it okay they shouldn't be paying anything because their taxes are already
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:26.000]  low but they need it all back it's the middle class tax cuts they're gonna surge 7.3 to 10.1
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:31.680]  they're saying the most analyst i mean this is explosive growth real growth not fake communist
[2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:35.040]  Chinese growth we're all goes to you know a couple hundred generals we're gonna come back with
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:40.080]  ted mount can talk about all this on the other side but this is just massive and i just think
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:45.760]  about the fact that uh trump at that very same podium at the capitol just 11 months ago committed
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:53.120]  to do so much tpp killing and all of it he did it uh so that's uh there again uh so the president
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:57.360]  the capital is at the white house then but i mean it's just right there in that very same area
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.600]  committing to do it i was just right down below when he did it uh and i knew it i knew it might
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:06.640]  gut my instinct said this is real what's happening and it's happened it's not perfect it's a bloody

[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:15.600]  all right ted malek is with us for the balance the transmission and then we've got the fourth hour
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:20.560]  coming up that i'm going to be segueing into with anti kumia it always does an incredible
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:27.040]  job in the war with onshore roger stone coming up ted malek uh was former borbamer of the debos
[2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:32.800]  group of course former head of the aspen institute with the top levels organizations but he's always
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:37.200]  been a patriot i've gone back to writings he did 25 years ago i'm not going to all his phd's
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:42.240]  international political economy and and he's also got degrees you know dealing with religion
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:47.120]  but that's why it's important to get him on he's worked in capital markets with solemn brothers
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:51.360]  and service senior policy positions u.s senate committee on farm relations the u.s state department
[2:16:51.360 --> 2:16:57.200]  i'm not going to get into all that uh the reason i got him on last time i wanted to get into the
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.760]  occult obsessions of some of the globalists he wasn't ready he said yeah it goes on but he said let
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:05.520]  me just think about what i'm willing to get into and then i'll talk about it because i've been
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:10.080]  involved some with hollywood and some with stuff in the uk and they're like when would you come to
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:13.760]  the hellfire club and it's like major directors and people we're gonna go in these catacombs and
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:17.680]  it's like eyes wide shut and once you do it you're in the club and like no so i never did it all and
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:25.280]  i'm sure ted hasn't either um the point is not that i'm scared of it i just uh like going crazy
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:29.120]  i'm scared of like people just being involved in all that stuff because then it leads to other
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:33.760]  things um you know like killing somebody at the end of the night or whatever so ted malik's here
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:38.960]  to to break it all down but he wanted to get into his prolific articles that are published all over
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:44.480]  the place from you name it world that daily to info wars to big establish republicans but
[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:50.960]  u.s tax reform breaks global rule says e you that's how to dw.com big german news they admit
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:55.360]  it's going to move jobs back to us they we have secret combines with you we have agreement you're
[2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:59.520]  not supposed to do it germany demands uk's unconditional surrender on brexit that that's
[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:05.600]  ted malik trump's top e you pick warren's german media have seismic shift in ties uh so here's
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:12.000]  world and daily article let's revisit the budesta pigeon for uh pedophilic cannibalistic and satanic
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:17.520]  art which we can say okay not the pizza place that's how they diverted us off into that but
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:21.920]  but but but but but you know them themselves and the wiki leaks which were ready to really
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:27.600]  release some big stuff on very soon there's lots of that behind the scenes so ted malik joins us now
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:30.880]  when i give them the floor we don't do pre interviews and i haven't talked to him since he
[2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:34.880]  visits his studio a few weeks ago in austin where do you want to start with that palette
[2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:39.200]  that you kind of laid out a few few little pieces of blobs of pain i put there where do you want to
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:45.520]  go first i think there are some we have some times so we have some linkages uh the e you
[2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:54.000]  is part of of course the globalist empire the new world order uh and i think that many of its
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:00.720]  origins are in fact quite evil and i think we we should talk about that i've written about it
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:08.960]  in his leg wars where i described the unconditional surrender the germany is demanding of britain
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:15.360]  of the uk during the brexit negotiations is basically a german takeover of europe making europe
[2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:20.960]  into its own puppet state with its crony capitalism and its fake currency of the euro
[2:19:21.680 --> 2:19:27.360]  but i what i really want to do after our conversation uh just a few weeks ago in studio
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:32.880]  is come back to this question that you asked me that i was unprepared for because uh
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.720]  you know sometimes it's uncomfortable particularly at this time of year but i want to talk about it
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:45.440]  and that is luciferianism luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:52.560]  characteristics that are fixed to lucifer um that tradition has been informed by nosticism
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:58.720]  by satanism and it usually refers to lucifer not as the devil per se but as some kind of
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:04.800]  liberator some kind of guardian some kind of guiding spirit in fact is the true god as opposed
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:14.640]  to jojoba and i think many people in europe particularly are of this system that people
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:23.040]  get in the center of the party in the united states and this statistic is luciferian orientation
[2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:33.120]  is really uh this tradition of a fallen angel of course we know who lucifer is and he's seen
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:38.560]  as one of the morning stars as a symbol of enlightenment as a kind of independence and
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:45.920]  of true human progress turning away from god and turning to lucifer in order to enlighten yourself
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:51.920]  so i did a little research on this and i you'll find this very interesting in his very famous
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:21:00.880]  1971 book which was his final book rules for radicals the very prominent american community
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:07.680]  organizer on the far left saul olinsky wrote at the end of his acknowledgments to that book and i
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:15.360]  want to quote this less we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgement at the very
[2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:21.920]  first radical from our legend's mythology and history and who knows where mythology leaves
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:28.000]  off and history begins or which is which the first radical known to man who rebelled against the
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:38.400]  establishment and did it so effectively that he is uh one his own kingdom was lucifer saul
[2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:48.880]  linsky dedicating rules to radical to his hero lucifer and of course that's him in public just
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:53.440]  saying oh i do this kind of in a you know a little cheaty way or whatever but when you get down to
[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:58.240]  brass tax these people really believe they're setting themselves up as god and they advertise
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:03.360]  just like you're in the french revolution the false revolution the jackabin system versus
[2:22:03.360 --> 2:22:08.720]  our real revolution that they want to become god they want absolute power and he writes about the
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:14.320]  book he believes in nothing but absolute power this is so creepy this is the opposite of of
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:22.720]  chivalry the opposite of christ the opposite of jahova that's what it is we're talking about the
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:28.960]  anti christ we're talking about the fallen angel but for these people turning their you know their
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:35.440]  face against the true god they're turning to this form of anti christ of lucifer and that's the
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:41.280]  foundation for their guidance for their enlightenment for their institutions i would argue even for the
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:47.440]  whole definition of this new world order and we can get into john fedesta and his emails which we
[2:22:47.440 --> 2:22:52.080]  will do that next we're going to break but but truly whether you're an atheist or not they believe
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:56.640]  in the archetype as an operating system like a program you look at what they did to russia
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:02.000]  i mean they tried this whole luciferian operation there they are so angry so i thought the folks
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.560]  high level in hollywood other is they're mad that russia is truly becoming christian they it's literally
[2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:17.520]  spiritual they are so angry well they have to obviously feel very annoyed by any people any
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:24.080]  person any community any nation that turns their hearts back to god and there's increasing evidence
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:29.520]  that lots of people in russia are doing that obviously since that was impossible during the
[2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:35.920]  70 years of heinous communism so they are falling back on these traditions their old religion the
[2:23:35.920 --> 2:23:42.000]  eastern orthodoxy in russia but if you look at the pure statistics alex around the world about
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:48.320]  85 percent of people believe in god in different spiritual traditions in different sacred texts
[2:23:48.320 --> 2:23:57.840]  christianity is obviously the largest of those islam uh hinduism buddhism etc they're all very
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:06.080]  strong faith traditions luciferians detest this and they particularly detest the christian tradition
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:11.600]  because lucifer is the fallen angel away from christ that's right they they said they want to
[2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:16.160]  play all religions off against each other till nothing's left but lucifer we're gonna come back
[2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:20.960]  again i know you're gonna get into this as a theologian you have a degree in but i want to
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:24.560]  get into specifically i know you don't get into private stuff that happened behind closed doors
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:29.120]  just as i as a journalist something's in confidence i can't talk about it but in general the the

[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:25.440]  head of the big three he was the head of the fourth largest bank in the u.s the time again i flew
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:30.720]  to be on the view years ago it's like six seven years ago now and i sat down next to kind of
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:35.440]  recognize him a little from watching financial shows he wasn't a guest but you'd seen him and he
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:39.840]  figured out how i was real quick was folks were shaking my hand and he was telling him his business
[2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:44.960]  dad who was a retired general in san antonio and he just had about a three hour conversation
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:50.640]  by the way he got the perfect suit after being on the plane and got his you know french coat out
[2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:56.240]  hair perfect everything and he says they're all about that and he goes there's a plane's landing
[2:29:56.240 --> 2:30:01.840]  he goes alex you think people are gonna adapt and overcome the marine corps term
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.440]  improvise overcome adapt overcome you know you don't get it that's what you're gonna do
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:16.080]  the general public is gonna adapt to being in the system and he laughed at me and i said
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:20.320]  to him he went once he did this thing in turn getting his jacket out because he waited to
[2:30:20.320 --> 2:30:27.200]  say it after he listened to me for like an hour on the plane we didn't talk the first few hours
[2:30:27.200 --> 2:30:32.720]  looking over up and i'm sitting right next to american airlines and he wanted to have his
[2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:36.960]  piece to be done and i said listen i can't bet against humanity and want to live
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:45.520]  and his back was turning he shuddered and it was that point like i'm not giving my soul up
[2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:49.680]  i get the public stump down i get they'll tear me apart i get i get it you've made him into a
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:54.480]  weapon the point is i can't feel big while they're little i don't want to join you and
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:58.880]  look down on the slaves don't you get it doesn't mean if somebody tries to destroy me i won't

[2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:08.960]  you people virtue signal all day because you have no virtue and studies show that the average
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:13.680]  liberal is always flip the numbers it's in a bunch of british and us studies in canadian but on
[2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:22.560]  average it's what six times more likely to lie nine times more likely to steal or is it vice versa
[2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:26.400]  because they're not real liberals and they've changed all the terms so ted malik you've got
[2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:30.720]  the floor of the segment i'm running ted malik dot com got your new book out secrets of business
[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:34.880]  where you really tell folks what's going on again former board member the devos group so much more
[2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:40.240]  your major uh envoy of the senate government of the senate committee for relations the us state
[2:31:40.240 --> 2:31:45.280]  department big insider but that's been a patriot on a bad guy not everybody in the inside's bad
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:48.800]  the point is you've got a track we're exposing it you're getting into luciferianism you're getting
[2:31:48.800 --> 2:31:53.440]  into their worldview you're getting into who they are where are we historically what is this obsession
[2:31:53.440 --> 2:32:02.080]  with lucifer what are we facing they need a little lay on the sky go ahead and talk about
[2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:10.000]  uh the democrat party the dnc the hillary clinton campaign john pedestrian of course was
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:16.720]  top of all that top of everything they were trying to do everything they were trying to foment
[2:32:16.720 --> 2:32:22.720]  on the rest of us very involved in international organizations all kinds of deals the clinton
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:27.840]  foundation if you look at his emails now the public can for the first time actually look at these
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:33.440]  emails thanks to wikileaks and you can see the references that he made over and over again
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:41.360]  to luciferianism and this is abhorrent also to sexual abuse abuse of children by himself
[2:32:41.360 --> 2:32:47.440]  he uses code words such as cheese which means little girl pasta which means little boy
[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:54.000]  math which means steam and sauce which means orgy and he uses them over and over again these code
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:00.800]  words on the deep web pedophile messaging boards the emails and there are many of them your viewers
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:08.480]  can go look at them they're available online they prove that he is involved very deeply involved
[2:33:08.480 --> 2:33:16.880]  as a committed luciferian and it's in among other things it's his invitation by marina
[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:24.160]  abramavitz to what is called a spirit cooking ritual which i think proves the most revealing now
[2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:30.080]  for the year that was invented by alistair crowley reportedly the most evil man alive
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:39.280]  reportedly sacrificed his own son precisely this is a ritual a specific ritual in which
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:45.920]  participants use the violist human body fluids in order to summon spiritual energies for assistance
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:55.360]  and favor and to any same person this sounds completely ludicrous but to luciferian this
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:01.600]  is the practice of enlightenment it's something that initiates them and something that they
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:07.840]  understand that they have to lower their humanity to a low enough level to be possessed by this evil
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:17.120]  force that's the whole idea to be possessed by lucifer himself and these practices of a luciferian
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:23.520]  religion and anti christianity are i would argue the absolute inversion of christianity
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:29.040]  lower as he says in the emails come we have blood we have semen and this is what they use
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:33.360]  pizza gate to divert off to some pizza store that the media all covered we covered it then they
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:37.760]  claim we were part of it again this is again this is what they're pouring out this is unbelievable
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:44.080]  well you're showing the real thing on the screen we've had black masses when we know about the
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:57.760]  you know holy eucharist the mass we also have cannibalism and pedophilia these are highlights
[2:34:57.760 --> 2:35:04.080]  these are common practices actually amongst luciferians and this makes i think podesta's choice
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:12.160]  of paintings in his own office all the more revealing the paintings in his office and we
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:19.520]  actually have photos of those as well are very disturbing they depict cannibalism and when
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:25.280]  asked in an interview by the you know the political magazine politico about the paintings
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:33.440]  podesta replied that it's better to be the guy with the fork rather than the guy on the table
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:40.960]  this is the guy that was leading the democratic party this is the guy this is a shot of what
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:46.880]  looks like eight-year-old girls begging not to be gangraped in a shower with i guess like
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:52.080]  step to time up the ceiling this is and this is they would tweak photos of dungeons and things
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:56.160]  and then they and then again i didn't realize what was happening at the time when washington post
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:00.640]  new york times cnn all focus on a pizza place instead of the emails in new york we covered the
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:05.520]  pizza place covered the rumors then they said we created it and there's and then i had a crazy
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:09.840]  woman and a bunch of democrats attacked me literally at a restaurant at the night screaming
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:14.960]  do you screw your baby we're going to get you screw your baby and the whole family was just
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:19.200]  like i've got video of it i haven't put it out yet yeah this is podesta's art chained up little
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.520]  children i know and they're and they're so foolish they think that uh they think that they i mean
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:27.840]  behind the scenes it's just unbelievable i can't believe your i just can't handle it i i usually
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:31.680]  came and look at this stuff we're putting on a screen this is tony podesta's art that though
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:38.320]  notice it's lesser magic though mr mallink they put this in 2007 in the paper as a public celebration
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:43.360]  of what they were doing to throw it in our face and to dehumanize us which is a form of mind rape
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:51.520]  so i mean what kind of people are we dealing with what kind of leaders are we dealing with
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:57.200]  if these are their deepest spiritual sentiments and practices chained up children
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:04.480]  i apologize go ahead any kind of respect any kind of accord let alone think of them for public
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:14.400]  office i mean it's beyond attestable it is actually radical evil please continue well i
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:21.440]  i actually uh i think that we have to expose this alex uh where it exists to the degree it exists
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:27.760]  uh the fact that it is at the top of our government that it in fact exists the
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:34.560]  top of our national organizations that it's rampant about your it's the part in your opinion stay

[2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:38.160]  not for the people for the globalist then he already knows all he's got to do is untie it

[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:48.000]  over my friend for the nine minutes we've gotten this segment we'll hold over the next hour i know
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:51.920]  you had some sky problems never have before but it's happening as you break as a big insider
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:56.240]  you're not talking about what you saw inside not breaking any confidences you're only
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:45:00.800]  exposing what is in public domain recap everything you said my friend you have a lot of courage go
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:09.360]  ahead well we were talking about luciferianism about its origin and processes in you know and
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:15.280]  antique history what it amounts to its anti-christian orientation but more specifically for the last
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:20.160]  few minutes we've been talking about the head of the democrat party the head of the clinton
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:28.080]  campaign a number of people in that uh organization who worship lucifer and what that means in their
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:32.640]  emails officially in their emails officially worldnet daily dot com article please continue
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:39.200]  we can't make this stuff up i mean uh it's just too grotesque uh but we also can look at the
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:45.600]  paintings that they have in their offices the pedophilia that they practice the spirit cooking that
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:54.320]  they uh uh become involved in and uh a whole nature of their enlightenment and what that means
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:01.520]  and i we actually also pointed out that's all in ski and his original book uh for radicals
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:06.960]  pointed to the same tradition to lucifer so this is part of the left is part of a turning away
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:14.400]  from our which historically left man left meant left hand path and the french revolution the
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:19.440]  occult it never meant left there wasn't left or right until then please continue that that is an
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:26.160]  actual uh you're correct so logically but what i really want to talk about because this is dark
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:31.920]  and it's evil and it it upsets me and my wife no end even well let's just say you're taking
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:36.160]  up this is a big deal to have somebody like you that's been in these circles at the highest levels
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:40.000]  of it this is a big deal a lot of courage i know you're not going to say it yourself but this is
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:46.160]  a big deal so go ahead well i also taught at yale divinity school as well as yale school of management
[2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:52.000]  i've been in major universities i'm i i'm not making this stuff up i have the uh academic
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.320]  credentials i understand it's depth but i also realize we're talking here about something that
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:06.080]  is radically evil it is anti christian so what what we have to do is expose it for what it is
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:10.480]  and we have to point it out and i think that the public will review it
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:20.400]  well just continue breaking this down well uh i i think that what i'd like to do instead
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:26.640]  is talk about our own tradition because after all it is christmas exactly we know that's what
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:31.280]  that's the theme without us even saying it we know the evil let's celebrate the light right now and
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:37.920]  the beauty that truly despairs that that truly drives off the dark you know we gave five minutes
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:44.000]  or 10 minutes to this very radical and dark light let's let's put the the bright light on our own
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:49.200]  tradition the real root of our being in christian thinking which is rooted in the new testament of
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:55.920]  course and the wonderful insights of st paul they actually have great relevance to us as people not
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:02.000]  not least of all because it's an attempt to spell out in very detailed terms exactly what it means
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:08.720]  to live in the belief that the world is ordered that it's ordered by a loving god that he demands
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:14.480]  love from each one of us not only towards himself but also towards our neighbors at christmas
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:20.960]  and i'm reflecting on this my family's coming home tomorrow flying in from all over the world
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:28.880]  we especially need to reflect on what gift has meant in the christian tradition the tradition
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:35.040]  again that has shaped our western culture that we cannot give up we have to pray for those countries
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:40.000]  like poland and hungry where they're actually battling the european union over this very culture
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:46.560]  right now and this whole concept of charity has loved to which we are commanded to use the original
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:53.200]  term so this giving which is of course part of the christmas tradition we all have these gifts
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:58.560]  under our tree we've all purchased these items we're all excited about the pleasure it's a way
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:03.520]  of opening yourself up to the other it's an invitation to friendship it's very exciting it's
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:11.200]  also very much a part of the american tradition if you think about it americans are really defined i
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:17.280]  would say in many ways by their generosity by their volunteering i mean when tutokul came to america
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:24.400]  you know 180 years ago what he found across the entire american hinterland was this feature
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:32.800]  and we should be rightly proud of it this notion of generosity in america and in europe you don't
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:40.160]  see this very much because this state has taken charge and they carry out all the family functions
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:45.120]  they carry out the charity they carry out all these sacred things but then corrupt them and again
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  they've made it all commercial it can become sick there but that's just it was back when people
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:53.840]  didn't have a lot to give something was a big deal because that spirit made all this wealth
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:58.080]  now we think of nothing giving all this again they distorted everything that's sacred
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:06.560]  indeed and so you have on the hold and in socialism and europe is socialistic to a large extent you have
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:13.680]  this hostility to private giving this hostility to the notion of gift because they want to get
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:18.400]  in the middle of private association men and women community they want to get the middle
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:25.360]  of our private associations that is a cult it shows no respect for private property for industry
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:32.160]  for wealth and it tries to put this uh this this notion of equality and the state paying the
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:38.480]  aperture over and all of us it's not surprising to me when you think of the first act of lenin
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:46.160]  after the bolshevik revolution in russia was to abolish and expropriate all private charities
[2:50:46.160 --> 2:50:50.960]  all gift giving what happened in the second world war when the communists took power
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:57.200]  in hunger they had 10 000 religious voluntary societies in that little tiny country of eight
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:03.920]  million people within two years all of them were abolished they stole the good will of the people
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:09.680]  they stole the good will of people and this is true in communist party wherever you find it in
[2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:16.800]  china today people have to give in secret or they have to give at risk of imprisonment they have
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:22.080]  their underground schools their underground universities their underground churches underground
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:28.800]  medicine and it's the heroic actions and of the few that that lead to that kind of wonderful
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:35.520]  shared experience of the gift and now here's my argument i'm saying that giving is not only natural
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:41.200]  but it's a fundamental part of moral health and by giving which is what we're doing in this season
[2:51:41.200 --> 2:51:48.560]  the existence of the other is fulfilled in love and this kind of gratitude is is absolutely is
[2:51:48.560 --> 2:51:53.760]  absolutely crucial to being a human being if you read the bible and some people do
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:52:01.120]  i hopefully in church over the next few days the first letter to the chrysians of st paul delivers
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:09.920]  his celebrated aconium of the three theological virtues faith hope and charity and that word for
[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:16.480]  charity agape that is so critical a love that has been brought to this world by christ
[2:52:16.480 --> 2:52:24.160]  and which is the love which god extends to all of us and which you're asked to extend to one another
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:30.640]  this is gift love it's what paul talks about in his wonderful overwhelming spirit that's why
[2:52:30.640 --> 2:52:36.480]  i get tears in my eyes talking about this because it's so strong it's so pure it's destiny for
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:44.800]  this species you can feel destiny knocking on the door and st thomas equinus in you know in christian
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:51.440]  history argues that it's the fundamental gift it's granted by god to himself by his own nature
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:59.680]  and to the world in choice so it's my life your gifts are a gift stay there we're gonna come back
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:04.240]  so two seventy seconds stay there two minutes now the breakthrough that's it everything else
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:09.440]  is satanic it wants to hold god is just giving giving giving giving consciousness everything
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:13.280]  all the beauty everything and we're just like bitching and complaining we've been giving
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:19.600]  consciousness on this star base in the middle of the galaxy with unlimited potential i mean we just
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:32.160]  it's thank god thank god support good waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you lie
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:39.280]  from the front lines of the info war i wonder you know kate steinling got shot in the back
[2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:43.520]  couple years ago and san francisco said well he's an illegal alien we got to let him go
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:48.080]  even though i made it he did it well now they won't let her in san francisco put up signs of
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:53.680]  her face saying she had dreams too that video is coming up in the next segment uh ted malik again
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:53:58.160]  we appreciate you joining us your new books out about the secrets of business post can find that
[2:53:58.160 --> 2:54:03.360]  we sell it infoworks store dot com ted malik dot com we got five minutes left you got to go
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:07.520]  what are other big things you want to impart what are you making the big tax victory yesterday
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:10.880]  what do you think this is going next how are they going to strike back because
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:16.720]  their rush investigations falling apart been proven inside jobs spectacularly it shows how arrogant
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:21.200]  they are that was so shoddy how they paid for it they admit it's fake i mean they should all go
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:28.320]  to jail this is crazy well we'll have our special uh council in the new year and hopefully we can
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:34.480]  pick up all those loose ends and bring them to justice i was in tears yesterday when i saw the
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:42.240]  republican congress on the steps there with the president and i mean it's just an incredible
[2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:47.280]  accomplishment it's it's taken you know three decades to bring this about it was four years
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:56.400]  overnight but the leader of this whole exercise is a person that took center stage he shared the
[2:54:56.400 --> 2:55:01.760]  stage with many of its authors of course but without donald trump this wouldn't have happened
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  and so he also you know remind your listeners said uh in the white house and again yesterday
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:18.240]  words that uh we have probably a decade from the white house he's heard them from his own lips
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:23.760]  merry christmas and again it seems like they make fun of it but they're trying to ban it everywhere
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:31.040]  that's what an incredible cult of control freaks uh these people are oh look they've had this war
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:37.600]  against christmas on for you know more than two decades and christmas has become an enormous you
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:44.080]  know commercial occasion now so we've divorced it pretty much from its religious original original
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:49.840]  you know context so i mean where i'd want to go in this last few minutes is basically just to
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:57.840]  remind the listeners that you know my life their lives are a gift and so too are the goods that
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:01.840]  come to me and you and the gifts that we're going to have under our trees in the next few days they
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:07.600]  come from the source that that granted life and and once we see the world in that way which
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:14.480]  frankly is the way of faith then we see the reality of gift love and how the world is ordered
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:21.600]  and we see its power we see the change of gift and gratitude spreads through all things
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:28.080]  and it leads to our own spiritual well-being and we can join to them and these are not burdensome
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:33.360]  chains on the contrary i think their ingredients their main ingredient is actually freedom and
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:38.800]  by linking to these chains we receive a benefit far greater than the one well exactly i mean you
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:43.760]  have a child to take care of them and they take care of you everything is symbiotic in god's plan
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:48.720]  you see the incredible it's like all these atheist mathematicians genetic engineers
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:53.360]  they finally they become masters they go god there's a god it all works so perfectly
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:57:00.640]  and it couldn't just come together by itself and this is the story of christmas god gave
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:07.120]  his only beloved son so that we could have eternal life and that is of course the greatest
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:17.040]  gift of all time it's it's his story it's the great drama of human existence so when we celebrate
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:25.280]  the advent this year we should remember that nativity scene we need to think about that form
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:31.840]  of gift love of god's grace which is bestowed on every one of us on this creation in the first
[2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:38.080]  instance but to every single one of us as human beings and then we can have a very blessed christmas
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:43.920]  because we can celebrate the christ mass i'd explain to somebody the other day that christmas
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:50.480]  actually means if you can believe this christ mass it does it means them the mass of christ
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:58:00.720]  birth and death and risen that's it christ was born in christmas he had his ministry on earth
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:08.640]  for a short period of time he died and ascended into heaven and he takes us there as our final place
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:13.760]  so you have to have the whole sweep of that story and if humanity makes it we're going
[2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:18.880]  to the heavens ted malik incredible it's all allegory it's all there it's all a transmission
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:21.920]  for us to survive if we take it thank you so much we'll be back
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:46.400]  we now take you live to planet earth in the desperate attempt of the species to get off world
[2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:52.800]  ancient transmissions tell us if we accept the computers and merge with them we will be destroyed
[2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:59.120]  forever if we awaken to that program and move forward and our good people we will go to heaven
[2:58:59.120 --> 2:59:04.880]  to the stars ancients looked at that didn't understand it but now it makes crystal clear
[2:59:05.760 --> 2:59:13.920]  sense what we're dealing with the heavens lie before us extended life eternal life
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:21.680]  unlimited energy unlimited information water water everywhere not a drop to drink
[2:59:24.080 --> 2:59:27.440]  that's where we are knowledge all around us we're gonna go to anthony cumming and those
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:32.720]  this hour with his compound media dot com doing a great job but i wanted to hit this piece it's
[2:59:32.720 --> 2:59:39.280]  on info wars dot com and news wars dot com leftist students ripped down races kate stanley
[2:59:39.280 --> 2:59:48.320]  moral boasters you know i literally got heart palpitations well i've never had those before
[2:59:49.520 --> 2:59:58.720]  last couple weeks ago when oan shroyer went downtown and men with guns not guns operating
[2:59:58.720 --> 3:00:04.640]  their free speech or their second amendment but men with guns said you're not going to the capital
[3:00:04.640 --> 3:00:09.120]  rally and then blocked him and attacked him with clubs and you know he's like a patriot i made a
[3:00:09.120 --> 3:00:13.200]  big goal they hit him with clubs would let me in on big deal hey you guys are idiots but he was
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:21.280]  assaulted and they the antifa wouldn't let him get in for a kate stanley memorial for this poor
[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:28.320]  beautiful young woman that lover was just black his panic whatever shot in the back with her father
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:35.280]  her she had dreams too and you've got this guy who's been deported five times
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:41.360]  it's like the railway killer he was deported i forget like 15 times i think he killed like
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:46.160]  40 something people all of them were hispanic by the way it's not that hispanics are serial
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:50.800]  killers or have a hired the innocence of crime it's that they can go to any cutter they want
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:54.480]  and governments just let them in because this globalist operation opened up the americas
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:01:02.320]  so this literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the jury won't even convict him of manslaughter
[3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:06.560]  which would just mean he didn't know he killed her but still you're liable
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:12.080]  seven years in jail in california it's like that in most states serve like three years maybe two
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:18.960]  if you're good behavior maybe one federally you serve 90 states you serve like a third a half
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:25.360]  there's video at the college where somebody put up i had dreams too
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:30.800]  and again she's a white lady i think she has some hispanics in her family it doesn't matter
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:35.680]  hispanics are mix of white folks and natives and the spanish bloods of some north african
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:40.720]  doesn't matter we're all humans beautiful the spanish women all of them are beautiful everybody's
[3:01:40.720 --> 3:01:48.560]  beautiful all of everybody the point is is that she gets killed out with her daddy eating a snow cone
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:54.320]  and the left can't even send the jerk blacked out of mentally ill put in the mental institution
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:02:01.040]  they won't do anything and they say 19 people run over one of them they say is basically dead
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:05.280]  brain dead and they wouldn't even say it's a muslim they go well it's isis but it's mentally ill
[3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:12.400]  yeah the nazis were mentally ill humans go into these weird things uh you and you can say other
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:22.880]  cultures were mentally ill so they they the killer and then we got video at the university
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:29.440]  where they won't even let them put up signs they could put up every other sign they want
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:33.280]  kill the cops you name it that's in the article but you can't put up a sign just saying
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:39.920]  she had dreams too left the students ripped down racist kate stanley memorial posters
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:45.520]  because see they're scared of a martyr and my own reporters at austin can't go to a rally for her
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:50.880]  that was by the way black is spanish everybody you name it there's nobody let me tell you something
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:54.720]  you try to go to a patriot meeting of your some white supremacists will kick your ass you have
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:03:00.480]  your free speech i'm just i'm not doing this because i hate black people or anybody else i'm
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:09.600]  doing this because i want justice and the left is so evil as like a union as like a
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:16.800]  a system that they they will they will defend anything as long as they're white
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:21.440]  which again is using race culture which is very primitive very bad we're fighting nazism which
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:26.160]  means we're fighting this the nazis were race culture it works we're primitive we'll do it
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:33.360]  well they got the whites in i'm not just being not defending leftist to say this but
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:39.360]  it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting two minority groups trying to get
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:45.360]  them to be racist and they got some blacks to do it and i guess a small minority hispanics but
[3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:51.680]  i don't want to bash white people but it's mainly white people you name it jewish uh
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:58.720]  uh german whatever background to push this and you read the southern probably law center adl
[3:03:58.720 --> 3:04:05.840]  put out is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen and so now this dead woman people
[3:04:05.840 --> 3:04:10.080]  can't have a rally in austin forum you can't have hand up signs in san francisco conservative
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:14.480]  students continue mourning the death of kate stanley the woman murdered by a legal alien
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:18.800]  given sanctuary and remember most of his victims were hispanic i'm not just saying that the
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:24.160]  virtue signal that's just being heard i mean people say oh thank you for caring about a hispanic
[3:04:24.160 --> 3:04:29.120]  person in a black i care about everybody folks because i got feelings in san francisco a left
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:34.560]  of students continues to be triggered by her memory and they again pull down the the the
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:39.280]  posters saying it's racist so here they are anti-free speech here's the video
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:45.520]  oh you guys got a problem with the posters
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:51.520]  you guys got a problem with the posters yes and what would that be um the problem
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:03.440]  oh dreams are racist now huh these are white women you know i'm not gonna have this conversation
[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:08.400]  with you you're gonna have that kind of tone so oh my tone right now i don't want to have a
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:15.040]  conversation in the first place you'd rather carry on posters these are women that the state is their
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:26.080]  man so they they take down her picture and notice the jury had most mainly a white jury
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:31.680]  they had to say we will not put a hispanic man in jail because she's white if he'd been hispanic
[3:05:31.680 --> 3:05:39.520]  he'd have gone to prison because they can't ever say their policies are wrong and then they have to
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:47.360]  take her picture now so she had dreams too and she did she's in a coffin she's a skeleton now
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:53.120]  and you know i you're not gonna hear one activist you're not gonna hear those liberal white women
[3:05:53.120 --> 3:05:56.960]  that want to just act like they're on this big jihad and they live in this little fantasy land
[3:05:56.960 --> 3:06:01.680]  university where they can do this probably well they both look like professors or assistant professors
[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:11.760]  most the antifa is did they say hey hispanics i hate that word it's just people you shouldn't
[3:06:11.760 --> 3:06:19.600]  take Gardasil it sterilizes and reduces fertility massively here's the studies and they in Mexico
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:24.880]  tied IMF and World Bank money billions of dollars to giving Hispanic women Gardasil
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:30.480]  and then it sterilizes them it reduces their fertility doesn't completely sterilize them
[3:06:30.480 --> 3:06:36.480]  it's statistical but it reduces it and then i have people go hey man i've had this a few times like

[3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:33.360]  your host anthony kumia
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:43.040]  thank you thank you i want to thank alex jones of course
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:49.440]  merry christmas happy new year to everybody over there over here at info wars uh i was
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:56.880]  listening to alex before uh this uh for the past probably a half hour my god
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:05.680]  my god that the kate steinall debacle over there in california it's heart wrenching
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:16.240]  and infuriating just the sheer anger that you feel looking at something like this
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:23.440]  from beginning to end the second we heard that she was murdered right there in front
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:34.960]  of her her dad i mean just a beautiful creative contributing member of society
[3:09:36.320 --> 3:09:42.160]  and it's rare that we see that in in the news that there's people that actually are doing
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:48.320]  something and and have a family structure she's out with her dad how how much more
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:56.320]  uh american can you get just a dad out with his daughter beautiful day out by the water it's it's uh
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:06.160]  it's just such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country and her life
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:15.680]  is snuffed out by uh someone that shouldn't even have been in this country it's so easy to see
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:24.080]  see it's so simple for any rational human being to see the good and the bad in this the right and
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:32.800]  the wrong the just and the unjust that we see in this entire story from the moment she was she was
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:44.320]  killed until this very second it's not difficult for somebody that has a rational thought process
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:58.000]  to see what's wrong here yet he he's not convicted of like alex said even manslaughter
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:04.960]  you pick up a gun uh and it accidentally discharges and goes into somebody
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:10.480]  there's a pretty good case for manslaughter there and that was the defense
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:18.240]  saying that's what happened you know and they they don't even convict him of that
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:28.240]  based on what evidence now it's based on a thought process and a system over there
[3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:40.000]  there in um california and especially the bay area that says that um that woman's life was not worth
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:49.280]  as much as the life of uh somebody who was deported five times uh obviously a criminal
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:12:01.520]  uh and they let him go because of that this was based on race and culture and and and social
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:11.440]  status all of it the the the idea of of justice and weighing evidence and and calling out uh
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:19.840]  punishment for crimes committed had nothing to do with this uh the legal proceedings in this case it
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:30.160]  was all politically motivated all motivated by uh the the the liberal agenda in california and
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:37.360]  especially up there in the the bay area and we saw the result of that uh is the entire country
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:49.360]  like this thank god no but uh there are many areas in this country that are are completely the opposite
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:56.640]  of what america is supposed to be about and when we come around uh we get around to to christmas
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:13:04.960]  time which we are the the christmas season um we we get nostalgic and we start looking back
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:13.920]  back to uh our our youth and and remembering what america was back then what celebrating christmas
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:24.800]  was how much it was all about family and common values in this country a common culture the idea
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:34.720]  that we all know as americans what's right what's wrong what's good what's bad that made this country
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:42.640]  the place that people did want to come to because the population of this country for the most part
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:48.800]  believe me i know there's been lunatics and fringists uh in america since its inception
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:14:00.400]  but overall when you think back to um america uh you you think back to a time when there was a
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:09.360]  common thread through its people a pride there's a pride in your nation in in living in a place
[3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:17.280]  that is so amazing that people uh die trying to get here and that's what held it together
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:23.120]  that's what held the country together because no matter how different we are and when they talk
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:31.040]  about diversity it's our our differences but we need a common factor in there and and that's
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:41.440]  what made us americans and that common factor was a basic value system and an ideology that we all
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:49.600]  held dear and when you look at a case like uh kate steinle and see that there is a portion of this
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:56.960]  country willing to throw all that away they don't want to be a part of the commonality
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:05.840]  and thread throughout the american people that made this country a a cohesive unit
[3:15:05.840 --> 3:15:11.280]  because no matter where you come from and what your culture is and what you brought
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:16.560]  from the land that you came from or that your ancestors came from to this country
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:27.600]  the one thing that that brought it all together that made us enjoy different foods and different
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:36.880]  uh interests and activities religions was that we were all doing it here in in this amazing
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:43.120]  country where we weren't supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas where there was
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:50.080]  a distinction between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't be doing
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:59.920]  in this country that is really going to the wayside and and that's the thing that people like myself
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:06.880]  and alex and so many other people that call themselves patriots and and to to the laughter
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:12.960]  of certain people when you say you're a patriot and you're proud of your country people laugh
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:21.440]  at that and joke about it while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet uh it's
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:28.800]  because we have that we remember that we we enjoyed it i enjoy thinking back and when you
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:34.240]  say make america great again people laugh at that oh trump's little call sign no there was
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:41.600]  a greatness and it had nothing to do with race or white supremacy it had to do with that common
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:48.720]  thread that runs through us as americans and always has that ran through that that that makes you do
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:57.680]  things for the greater good americans and if we don't realize that very quickly uh we're doomed
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:17:02.400]  as a once great nation we're gonna be back in a matter of moments don't go anywhere

[3:18:40.480 --> 3:18:46.240]  to everybody out there this is my last broadcast here until the new year uh so i want to talk a
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:54.960]  little bit about about christmas um i was saying just before that break i get a bit nostalgic
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:19:02.080]  i think everybody does uh when you think of christmas it's one of those um it's one of those times
[3:19:02.080 --> 3:19:11.760]  of the year when you reflect on uh your youth it was such a big part of of being a kid your parents
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:19.120]  family friends and you tend to remember all the good things when you think back and and
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:27.360]  wax fantastic about days gone by but um i think it truly is one of those times a year where uh
[3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:35.680]  you do remember a lot of good things that that actually happened and i recall christmas back
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:44.000]  um i guess it was uh the 70s i could even remember people who late 60s i do remember late 60s maybe
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:53.600]  first inklings of of thought process of your pal anthony was probably 67 68 i remember i remember
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:20:00.560]  things like the apollo program and uh used to go to the gas station with my dad and uh they would
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:06.320]  give away they would give away these um little lunar modules that you'd put together like a
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:13.600]  little model and oh i love that i love the space program and the the pride it brought uh uh everyone
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:20.480]  here in the united states of america uh just those things from back then and and like i said before
[3:20:20.480 --> 3:20:27.200]  the break when when you say make america great again and people see hashtag maga and and you get this
[3:20:27.200 --> 3:20:37.520]  this uh people that laugh at it or call it racist or sexist oh you want to go back to this time
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:46.080]  when people didn't have rights and people were being beaten in the streets and the no no every
[3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:54.800]  country no matter how great it is has had a period of time that um uh people were being
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:21:02.640]  being plagued by uh injustice doesn't matter how great the country was at the time there were
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:11.120]  always problems nothing's perfect and no no one is talking about making america great again by
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:22.160]  returning to uh injustices and and nightmares of of civil rights infringements and and whatnot
[3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:28.800]  no but when you say make america great again you're talking about a greatness of the people
[3:21:28.800 --> 3:21:37.440]  of this country and and what i i said before about a cohesive people not everyone's thinking the
[3:21:37.440 --> 3:21:45.040]  same but just having a common thread of of being american and being proud of being american and who
[3:21:45.040 --> 3:21:52.720]  you are your culture your background everything that that your ancestors brought here is part of
[3:21:52.720 --> 3:22:00.480]  what makes this country america and i'm thinking back at christmas and and i remember coming into
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:08.560]  new york city as a kid during christmas with my uh family and uh it was just an amazing thing
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:15.760]  the way the city is decorated and no matter how repulsive new york can be uh they're they're
[3:22:15.760 --> 3:22:21.360]  tended to be this niceness that went along with it uh people were in there from the suburbs just
[3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:26.960]  seeing what what new york city was like at christmas time very romantic it's been portrayed in so
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:36.400]  many movies and whatnot and then i walk around now and i i i try to weigh some of the differences
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:43.840]  because as you know christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad work it's not inclusive enough
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:52.880]  it's racist it's islamophobic it's so many terrible things uh and and as i say when i
[3:22:52.880 --> 3:22:57.920]  harken back to my youth i just remember it as being great being just an amazing time you're
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:04.400]  off of school you're going to get presents uh your family is is is there there's a little
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:15.120]  bit more niceness in the streets so walk around now and what do i say i see soldiers with automatic
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:23.840]  weapons i see cement barriers that are set up everywhere uh to protect people that are just trying
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:31.920]  to shop and and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the truth and the truth and the truth
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:36.320]  and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree here and celebrate christmas
[3:23:37.760 --> 3:23:44.880]  signs everywhere see something say something uh there's there's an overhanging threat
[3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:53.520]  a black cloud hovering over christmas now everywhere and this is an exclusive to new york
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:24:03.600]  this is every city uh london uh you see these same barriers and look they paint them red and white
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:10.800]  like they're supposed to like they're supposed to be festive this is a constant reminder
[3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:21.440]  that there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our traditions
[3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:30.400]  wiped from the face of the earth including yes of course christmas uh there's people in this very
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:39.920]  country that sympathize with that that also want our traditions and cultures wiped away um
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:47.520]  when when when you used to come in to a big city and celebrate christmas at least like i said when
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:57.280]  i was a kid back in the late 60s early 70s uh you only thought about christmas and and how much fun
[3:24:57.280 --> 3:25:03.680]  it was and and to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations and everything it seemed to be
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:12.080]  that you still capture a little of that but when you see men walking around various branches of the
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:17.840]  military and the police forces walking around with automatic weapons it's a constant reminder
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:24.480]  and that's uh it's just a sad thing that we need to be constantly reminded even at this time of year
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:32.240]  that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we hold dear and that is a tradition
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:42.960]  there you go that's that's great and that's a a tradition to america that that that one of the
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:51.200]  many traditions that we built this country on and that separates us from other countries
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:58.800]  and other cultures uh you hear liberals constantly saying live and let live let's be tolerant
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:07.200]  let's be tolerant we must accept this and that well why are traditional um
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:17.360]  american traditions the thing that can be sacrificed with impunity and the second you start
[3:26:18.320 --> 3:26:24.080]  defending them you are either a racist or or homophobic or islamophobic is something
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:31.840]  some kind of phobic orist when you're only defending traditions that you remember and
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:39.920]  that were great when i think back to this country the traditional christmas with your family going
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:46.240]  out on in the city and and seeing all the amazing things as a kid can we get back to that i have no

[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:51.280]  the holiday season christmas time and um what would any christmas be without um the progressives
[3:28:52.240 --> 3:29:01.440]  trying to destroy our traditions it is amazing uh christmas is a holiday that is just fair game
[3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:10.560]  fair game for anyone any group that wants to trot upon it trounce it denounce it twist it and turn
[3:29:10.560 --> 3:29:19.920]  it till it's barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition to them
[3:29:21.040 --> 3:29:27.760]  but again people that celebrate christmas uh traditionally through through the liberal left
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:34.240]  liberal left what we've seen from progressives uh are the most intolerant people so intolerant
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:42.160]  yet they happen to be the most tolerant people ever because no one's rioting when when uh these
[3:29:42.160 --> 3:29:49.680]  people just trounce on on our traditions you don't see riots you don't see people
[3:29:50.560 --> 3:29:57.040]  murdering or beating people in the streets because we've uh we've been offended by some of these
[3:29:57.040 --> 3:30:04.640]  things i'm going to tell you a little story here and i want you to um to insert uh mohammad in here
[3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:12.480]  or islam or or any other religion really uh cnn was hyping a new children's book isn't that
[3:30:12.480 --> 3:30:22.480]  adorable a children's book about santa this is great right uh yeah uh we suppose there's supposed
[3:30:22.480 --> 3:30:29.440]  to be some sort of shock factor involved in learning there's a children's book called santa's husband
[3:30:31.600 --> 3:30:38.480]  in which santa is black and gay but frankly now that we're aware of it we'd be more surprised if
[3:30:38.480 --> 3:30:46.320]  there wasn't such a thing would we would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing
[3:30:46.320 --> 3:30:56.720]  as santa's husband where santa is black and gay um after seeing the gaitivity scene
[3:30:58.000 --> 3:31:02.000]  with two josephs the gaitivity scene
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:17.280]  why why do they always pick these christianity whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:28.240]  it will always be christianity and and the the traditional um holidays and services
[3:31:28.240 --> 3:31:34.000]  uh figures religious figures of christianity constantly
[3:31:36.320 --> 3:31:43.600]  they are able to make santa joseph gay change their race make them gay
[3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:49.680]  which would be in a front to oh my god could you imagine look i don't know if this is proper to
[3:31:49.680 --> 3:31:59.280]  say but just imagine you did homo-hamid do you think that would fly do you think everyone
[3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:05.680]  involved with doing something like that would need to strap on kevlar to go to work every day
[3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:13.280]  lest they be gunned down or blown up i do i absolutely do you know why
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:23.040]  why intolerance we talk about or the progressives talk about christianity and and christmas and
[3:32:23.040 --> 3:32:29.120]  all of the holidays pretty much and and our traditions and basic values of christianity
[3:32:30.080 --> 3:32:39.200]  as being intolerant yet when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on
[3:32:39.200 --> 3:32:47.600]  one we just take it we literally turn the other cheek uh complain about it talk about it that
[3:32:47.600 --> 3:32:55.600]  is our right that is our right but do we take to the streets do we destroy property do we
[3:32:55.600 --> 3:33:03.600]  assault people do we murder people because of it no because we are tolerant it's another one
[3:33:03.600 --> 3:33:09.680]  of these crazy backward world things that go on when you talk about progressives it's um
[3:33:10.960 --> 3:33:17.440]  just a grave intolerance going on we all remember charlie hebdo oh boy were they in dutch
[3:33:17.440 --> 3:33:25.200]  when they tried to uh talk about islam yet christianity uh can just be used and abused by
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:33.200]  people the gaitivity scene i've never i've never heard of the gaitivity scene and now i'm just
[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:43.040]  hearing about santa being gay and uh black there is that the gaitivity scene now any other religion
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:52.160]  using any other religious figures in this way i would i would say that that house would be in
[3:33:52.160 --> 3:33:59.680]  flames uh in no time but they're able to do this they practice their freedom of expression on their
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:07.600]  own property and they get complaints they get people like myself and other people in uh uh
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:14.240]  independent media that might um criticize it but no one's going over there and kicking it over or
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:22.160]  throwing a uh molotov cocktail through their window because the the progressives version
[3:34:22.160 --> 3:34:28.640]  of the most intolerant people are the most tolerant people topsy turvy backward world
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:35.920]  that we live in uh i must talk quickly about rosy o donald the the giant gift that keeps giving
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:45.040]  rosy o donald she's lost her mind since trump even said he was running for president uh a few
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:50.640]  years back her and donald trump were in a bit of a battle uh when he was still with the apprentice
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:59.760]  and um she was so uh angry with donald trump's tax plan uh that looks like um it will come to
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:09.280]  fruition that she offered two senators two million dollars each to vote no on it to vote no
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:17.200]  this is a crime there it is she promises to give a two million to senator susan collins and two
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:27.280]  million to senator jake flake to vote no on uh the tax bill two million dollars uh apparently
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:33.840]  this is against the 18 us code 201 criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal officials
[3:35:33.840 --> 3:35:43.040]  by uh whoever and apparently you will be fined three times the amount of the bribe so she could
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:53.600]  be fined twelve twelve million dollars and uh go to prison uh for doing this she's insane
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:36:00.400]  much like the progressive left is is insane but i i i give her one pass and it's like
[3:36:00.400 --> 3:36:06.560]  my good friend michael malice said on my show yesterday uh think about it this is a guy that
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:13.920]  called her fat called her a slob said that uh if she doesn't watch her step he will take her
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:21.920]  girlfriend away and believe me i can do it trump said all these things hilarious hilarious that guy
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:30.080]  is now the president imagine somebody that is uh you are perceived as bullying you over
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:36.000]  over the years and calling you horrible things and not only do uh do they get away with it
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:45.760]  they become the leader of the free world so i almost give uh rosio donnell uh a pass on
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:53.600]  on her insanity um the rest of the left i i don't know what it is self-destructive
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:37:01.280]  personality uh what have you but i really do hope uh some branch of the judicial system goes
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:09.840]  after rosio donnell for offering uh millions of dollars in bribery to uh senators to um vote no
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:19.680]  on a bill that a a legally elected president and and congress um voted on she's out of her mind
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:24.800]  thank you very much info wars alex jones merry christmas happy new year and we'll see you next
