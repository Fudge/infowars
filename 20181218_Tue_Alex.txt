[00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:23.832]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:26.493]  It's the information apocalypse.
[00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:30.315]  We're definitely now in the middle of it.
[00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.156]  Look at these headlines.
[00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:34.679]  Foreigners dump U.S.
[00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.800]  Treasuries as they liquidate a record number of U.S.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.342]  stocks in an attempt to kill our stock market and our economy to stop Trump and the march of nationalism.
[00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:45.963]  That's been the globalist plan.
[00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:51.344]  Unbelievable.
[00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:53.245]  Meanwhile, residents should not panic.
[00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:57.186]  Thousands of Las Vegas homes get zero offers for November.
[00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.297]  That's just some economic indicators.
[00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:08.579]  Meanwhile, New York Times article suggests human extinction a good thing and needs to happen.
[00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.800]  Michael Snyder article up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.621]  MKUltra, far worse than previously known.
[00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.522]  Special report.
[00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:19.163]  Will Generation Z save us from our millennials?
[00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.963]  Paul Joseph Watson video.
[00:01:20.963 --> 00:01:23.384]  Shorted history of pedophilia and the political left.
[00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:24.945]  Greg Reese, Infowars.com.
[00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:25.505]  Special report.
[00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.066]  Expert.
[00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.570]  Bitcoin soon worthless.
[00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.371]  Big surprise.
[00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:34.535]  Raw fruit and vegetables better for your mental health than canned produce.
[00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:42.245]  I mean, there's no way to pick your top stories with all this insanity.
[00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:44.609]  Meanwhile, Fox News, Napolitano says Trump is...
[00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.407]  Unindicted co-conspirator.
[00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:52.211]  Ample evidence to indict the President of the United States.
[00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.755]  More and more, Napolitano's talking about how honest and good Mueller is.
[00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:56.956]  Well, we happen to know why.
[00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:01.962]  That's with Fox News host, reportedly.
[00:02:04.454 --> 00:02:07.695]  That are in the Mueller crosshairs.
[00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:13.817]  Continuing, Michael Savage being silenced by corporate censorship, his attorneys say.
[00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.458]  And I've talked to the Savage camp today.
[00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:20.039]  They can't speak because of contracts, but I can.
[00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.421]  At the bottom of the next hour, we have the Ben Shapiro expert, Vox Day, joining us.
[00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:29.282]  I'm a little bit of a Ben Shapiro expert, because I remember back when he was the lawyer for Talk Radio Network, when he was like 25.
[00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:55.726]  And the thing Savage told me off-record, I've not been authorized to say, but I knew this from other people at Talk Radio Network, 15, 20 years ago, before even Shapiro showed up, and this guy is bad news, he's the Harvard Mafia, and Savage is being taken off the air down to one hour, then he'll be taken completely off within three months.
[00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:59.363]  And Ben Shapiro is being given his audience.
[00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:11.631]  Of course, they're not going to stay, but talk about the royalty of the Weekly Standard, the royalty of the National Review, neocon, blue blood, garbage.
[00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:24.020]  This guy is being force-fed to us at a level I've never before seen, and he's behind the scenes working all over the place to hurt you know who, Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:28.155]  And he is completely up the rear end of Glenn Beck.
[00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.196]  He is the return of Glenn Beck.
[00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.918]  God help us.
[00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:33.679]  God help us.
[00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:39.763]  And if this model of replacing Savage works, they're going after Limbaugh and Hannity next.
[00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:42.745]  I have it from the highest sources.
[00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.386]  And why is this so important?
[00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.408]  Why am I a talk show host, depending on my competition?
[00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:49.129]  Because they're not my competition.
[00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.150]  They're American patriots who care about the country.
[00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.953]  And they're being removed ahead of Trump being removed.
[00:03:56.497 --> 00:04:01.000]  They're taking out anyone loyal to the truth, anyone loyal to the president, anyone loyal to the country.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.804]  Everyone is being attacked, shut down, sued, removed.
[00:04:06.804 --> 00:04:07.504]  Everyone.
[00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:12.348]  And Savage, through his lawyers, said that is happening, but now he can't speak.
[00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.049]  Because of the contracts, I guess he has.
[00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.330]  I say damn the contracts.
[00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:21.066]  And again, I'm not going to get into inside baseball.
[00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:23.307]  I told Savage two years ago this was coming.
[00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:28.509]  I said, I'll build you a platform that no one even knows we've built for you.
[00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.190]  And he said, well, we'll see what happens down the road.
[00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.111]  But I told him this was coming.
[00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.792]  I told him.
[00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:37.173]  So it's bad, folks.
[00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.594]  I haven't even hit one third of the stacks.
[00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:43.986]  Cutie Pie, number one media personality in world history.
[00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:45.967]  A lot of adults never heard of him.
[00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:47.849]  He is the Big Kahuna.
[00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.271]  The left is muscling in to completely shut him down.
[00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:54.634]  They'll break it all down straight ahead and so much more.
[00:04:54.634 --> 00:04:56.515]  Meanwhile, we've got big news on China.
[00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:56.876]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.876]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:03.829]  Big Brother.
[00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:05.631]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.512]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:09.213]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:10.874]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:15.618]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:39.084]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's not a title that I wish I had, but I certainly embrace it because it means we're getting the job done.
[00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:48.886]  You are tuned in to the most censored, most lied about, most demonized, most attacked multimedia transmission in the world.
[00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:57.948]  And we have been, at times, the number one news and information program on the planet.
[00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:01.429]  And despite the fact that we've had many of our tentacles cut off,
[00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:08.295]  Our core operation has never been stronger thanks to all of you out there.
[00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:13.717]  But it is biblical what is going on.
[00:07:13.717 --> 00:07:17.359]  We now have a very clear picture of what is about to happen.
[00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:20.461]  That's why you get next year's news today here.
[00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:28.305]  There is a systematic persecution, removal, curtailing, censoring, banning,
[00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:43.199]  Of not just nationalists and patriots and conservatives and Christians on the internet, but in businesses, in colleges, in churches, and on talk radio and television.
[00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:53.263]  I've talked to many of the top Fox News hosts who have been called into rooms the last two years and screamed at that they better turn against Trump or they will be removed off the air.
[00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:57.405]  About two years ago, Fox became very anti-Trump for a while.
[00:07:57.405 --> 00:07:58.546]  They lost half their ratings.
[00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:03.795]  They ran back and allowed people to be pro-Trump, and all the listeners came back.
[00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:09.017]  But, Sean Hannity never wavered.
[00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:14.098]  When Tucker Carlson was brought on, he was not 100% behind Trump.
[00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.959]  And so that's why they thought he was a good guy.
[00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:19.180]  But once he saw the stakes, he's become pro-Trump, and he's in the crosshairs.
[00:08:21.656 --> 00:08:24.097]  I know the inside baseball on Michael Savage.
[00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:26.858]  I know the inside baseball on Rush Limbaugh.
[00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:28.919]  I know the inside baseball on Sean Hannity.
[00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:33.920]  I know the inside baseball on everything, basically.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.622]  And I'm not at liberty to tell you everything, but let me just get to this point.
[00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:41.303]  Michael Savage is being removed off the air.
[00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:46.385]  Within three months, he won't even be on the air anymore.
[00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:47.525]  They're gonna pay out his contract.
[00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:54.946]  They're killing him slowly, cutting him from three hours to one.
[00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:57.027]  And they're replacing him with Ben Shapiro.
[00:08:57.027 --> 00:09:00.348]  Because hey, if you can't get your own audience, steal it!
[00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:01.089]  But they'll leave.
[00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:06.952]  They're literally grafting this cancer in everywhere.
[00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:10.213]  And we're going to be breaking down who Ben Shapiro is coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:15.616]  It's the anatomy of a snake.
[00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:18.578]  The anatomy of the Neocon Weekly Standard
[00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:29.203]  National Review blueprint to continue to control the Republican Party and to send this country into the New World Order.
[00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:47.035]  And it ties into the move to take down Trump and Judge Andrew Napolitano, who I've had dinner with and been on the phone with and been on the show many times, and who I have associates that are very close friends with, and they say that there are different Fox News hosts who did talk to
[00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:57.939]  Julian Assange, which is not a crime, and that they are connected into Napolitano, and obviously Napolitano is under amazing pressure at Fox to be somewhat anti-Trump.
[00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:11.625]  Now he's all over Shep Smith, the rabid anti-Trumper, every day basically saying Mueller's a wonderful person, Trump could have committed crimes, he's the unindicted co-conspirator.
[00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:19.027]  All of this is part of the season of finding out who's who and who's got metal and who doesn't.
[00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:21.748]  But you better believe I'm still on the horse for a reason.
[00:10:24.855 --> 00:10:45.579]  When they make their move to shut down all the media, which they're doing, all the loyal pro-American media, for old Mueller and the rest of them to make their move on the president, we intend to stay at the helm, and we intend to go down with the ship or win the battle.
[00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:47.879]  And just like they told John Paul Jones, founder of the U.S.
[00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:52.520]  Navy, he was fighting a British ship twice his size, and it appeared his ship was sinking,
[00:10:53.413 --> 00:10:55.335]  The British captain called over the bullhorn.
[00:10:55.335 --> 00:10:59.660]  Are you ready to surrender?
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.363]  And he said, I surrender.
[00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.544]  I've only begun to fight.
[00:11:03.544 --> 00:11:09.631]  And he ended up capturing the British ship, tying his sinking ship to it and saving both.
[00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.692]  And that's what we intend to do.
[00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:13.796]  We are fully in.
[00:11:13.796 --> 00:11:14.496]  Totally committed.
[00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.651]  To the Republic.
[00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.872]  Trump's already gotten two good Supreme Court justices in.
[00:11:18.872 --> 00:11:20.432]  He's already derailed DPP.
[00:11:20.432 --> 00:11:22.874]  He's already tried to bring the economy back for two years.
[00:11:22.874 --> 00:11:25.715]  The globalists are waging a total economic war to shut it down.
[00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:33.619]  And I've never been more satisfied at a spiritual level.
[00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:34.539]  I've never been.
[00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:38.561]  I'm very satisfied.
[00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:39.642]  And I feel close to God.
[00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:43.302]  The last time I said that, they went, Jones is going to commit suicide.
[00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:44.422]  He says he feels close to God.
[00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.662]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:56.684]  When I say I feel close to God, it means I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be, and every cell in my body and my spirit just says, you're doing the right thing.
[00:11:56.684 --> 00:12:00.005]  Now your ancestors are proud of you.
[00:12:00.005 --> 00:12:03.686]  Now you finally are starting to achieve what it was you knew you were supposed to do.
[00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:08.882]  Now there's not that burning, nagging, pushing feeling constantly.
[00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:17.408]  As we step into this, as we see the future, as we see what we've all got to do as men, take our licks and keep kicking as long as we can.
[00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:28.516]  We're going to be examples to the young people, the future generations, and we're joining those men and women that came before us that had the mettle to take us into the future.
[00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:31.608]  And we're not taking their sacrifices for vain.
[00:12:31.608 --> 00:12:36.631]  We're not letting everything they laid down on the line be pitched away.
[00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.513]  We're on the right side of history.
[00:12:39.513 --> 00:12:43.075]  And I am just incredibly honored to have this audience.
[00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:46.938]  I'm incredibly honored to have the amazing minds that listen to this transmission.
[00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:49.099]  And I can feel your strength.
[00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:50.960]  You give me strength.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.461]  And I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:53.042]  You've got mine.
[00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:59.894]  And you've got my will one trillion percent focused on your destiny and my destiny together.
[00:12:59.894 --> 00:13:01.915]  Total commitment.
[00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:05.797]  Doesn't mean I'm not going to falter or stumble.
[00:13:05.797 --> 00:13:08.978]  But you've got my total commitment.
[00:13:08.978 --> 00:13:10.859]  And the enemy knows that.
[00:13:10.859 --> 00:13:13.681]  But I tell you, it's disgusting watching Napolitano.
[00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:14.841]  Disgusting.
[00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:16.842]  Makes me sick.
[00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:19.003]  But this is where you find out who's real and who isn't.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.101]  Matt Drudge has been staying the course.
[00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:24.082]  Sonny Hannity's been staying the course.
[00:13:24.082 --> 00:13:25.323]  Rush Limbaugh's been staying the course.
[00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:27.264]  It doesn't mean any of us are perfect, dammit.
[00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:35.468]  Hindsight's 20-20, but as you get older, and you see the world clearer, and you know the time you're in, you know who's good, and you know who's bad.
[00:13:35.468 --> 00:13:36.988]  Roll Net Daily's good.
[00:13:36.988 --> 00:13:39.269]  InfoWars is good.
[00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:40.110]  Zero Hedge is good.
[00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:43.386]  So many other groups are good people.
[00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:47.647]  And as things get worse and worse now, they say, everybody's like Alex Jones now.
[00:13:47.647 --> 00:13:49.227]  No, they're not like me.
[00:13:49.227 --> 00:13:51.608]  I only saw what was happening and was right.
[00:13:51.608 --> 00:13:52.908]  Now it's here.
[00:13:52.908 --> 00:14:01.271]  And because we and the listeners and many before us saw what was happening, we've got a fighting shot at this.
[00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.411]  That's why they intimidated us.
[00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:03.371]  That's why they attacked us.
[00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:04.732]  That's why they lied about us.
[00:14:04.732 --> 00:14:08.673]  Because they wanted to intimidate others so they wouldn't stand up and do the right thing when the hammer fell.
[00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:14.359]  You know, I read these articles here in front of me and how they tie together.
[00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:17.280]  How the globalists are openly trying to crash the world economy right now.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.723]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:24.385]  There's so much more we're going to be getting to, but foreigners dump U.S.
[00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.626]  Treasuries as they liquidate a record number of U.S.
[00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:26.947]  stocks.
[00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:30.008]  That's all to stop America and its resurgence.
[00:14:30.008 --> 00:14:30.869]  We told you it was coming.
[00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:36.132]  Trump warns you that voting for the Democrats would green light this operation, and now they're doing it.
[00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:38.474]  And I expect this to blow up in the globalist's face.
[00:14:39.718 --> 00:14:44.699]  They're now, one of the top trending terms on Twitter is depression.
[00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:46.700]  Because they want to punish us.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.700]  Just like Bill Maher said.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.641]  And teach us to hate ourselves.
[00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:53.282]  And teach us to hate people that stood up for what was right.
[00:14:53.282 --> 00:14:55.542]  Men who didn't want to be slaves, didn't want you to be slaves.
[00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:58.043]  We're going to go to break.
[00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.284]  When we come back, we're going to look at the eye of the storm.
[00:15:00.284 --> 00:15:01.184]  They're not just moving.
[00:15:02.537 --> 00:15:02.877]  I don't know.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.867]  And they're making their move on him now.
[00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:31.873]  This is a critical point in the entire Matrix space-time continuum.
[00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:32.334]  Believe it.
[00:15:32.334 --> 00:15:35.339]  And I'm gonna break down why it is straight ahead.
[00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:36.321]  Because either way...
[00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:42.812]  Either way you slice it with things like PewDiePie, it's over for the globalists.
[00:15:42.812 --> 00:15:44.173]  Long term.
[00:15:44.173 --> 00:15:45.673]  The question is, which path do we take?
[00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:47.033]  The easy one?
[00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:56.776]  By that, meaning our full force now to stop the disaster, or go into the disaster, which will guarantee the globalists total destruction, but many of us will perish in the melee.
[00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:08.198]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:05.803]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:05.803 --> 00:17:08.706]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:35.188]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:38.230]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:44.155]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:44.155 --> 00:17:47.958]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.219]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:50.560]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.765]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.765 --> 00:17:58.206]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:03.827]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.827 --> 00:18:05.588]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:17.655]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:22.658]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:32.791]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:37.377]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.222]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:52.209]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:54.871]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:59.574]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:01.317 --> 00:19:09.841]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:21.787]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:31.631]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:31.831]  Yo!
[00:20:33.288 --> 00:20:39.251]  You hate, you hate me.
[00:20:39.251 --> 00:20:46.935]  You, you hate, you hate me.
[00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:54.619]  You, you hate, you hate me.
[00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:59.042]  You, you hate, you hate me.
[00:21:01.124 --> 00:21:07.729]  You know why we came in with Rammstein, one of the most popular bands out of Germany in the last 20 years?
[00:21:07.729 --> 00:21:14.254]  Because this is the exact type of crap the left engages in where they claim they're a Nazi band because they speak German.
[00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:21.019]  They're actually a leftist band that I would pretty much call anti-German, though the music is pretty interesting.
[00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:26.323]  But you see, I first learned about their music 20 years ago or so in Lost Highway, which is a great film.
[00:21:29.292 --> 00:21:35.153]  But to understand what's happening with PewDiePie, you have to understand the entire globalist program, and that it's going into high gear.
[00:21:35.153 --> 00:21:38.874]  And it's the final phase of the extinction of speech.
[00:21:38.874 --> 00:21:46.576]  Because censorship only works if you bring in total oppression, total monoculture.
[00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:47.876]  And the political correctness is that.
[00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:52.557]  It destroys all knowledge, it attacks all information, it's hurtful and bad.
[00:21:52.557 --> 00:21:56.058]  It tears apart words, it destroys minds.
[00:21:56.058 --> 00:21:57.458]  It assassinates the truth.
[00:21:58.453 --> 00:22:02.534]  It uses journalism to destroy journalism.
[00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:08.517]  It's an inversion of the renaissance economy and system.
[00:22:08.517 --> 00:22:10.117]  So I'd go through hundreds of examples.
[00:22:10.117 --> 00:22:23.822]  I have the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Vox, you name it, showing PewDiePie, who has 100 million, right at 100 million subscribers over, last time I checked, it was something like 100 billion views.
[00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:26.023]  The multiple YouTube channels, I said 100 billion,
[00:22:28.188 --> 00:22:30.649]  And that's not to mention all his other platforms.
[00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:35.272]  So he's bigger than five Oprah Winfrey's in her entire history of viewers.
[00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:43.656]  He's bigger than Drudge Report when it comes to people actually watching his videos.
[00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:46.918]  Drudge Report is the second biggest site in the world, biggest news site in the world.
[00:22:46.918 --> 00:22:49.819]  Billions of visitors a month.
[00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:56.503]  PewDiePie is the biggest television personality the world's ever seen.
[00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:06.541]  More eyeballs have watched him, more people have seen him in the modern last five years or so than anybody else.
[00:23:06.541 --> 00:23:12.583]  You could argue that somebody like Clint Eastwood's bigger, yes, or Ronald Reagan are better known.
[00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:22.305]  But when it comes to the youth, my 16-year-old son, my 14-year-old daughter, my 11-year-old daughter, all they talk about is PewDiePie.
[00:23:22.305 --> 00:23:23.846]  And this is for about three, four years.
[00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.151]  I don't want the younger one to watch it, but that's all they hear about at school.
[00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:29.131]  Private school doesn't matter.
[00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:31.752]  So, who is this guy?
[00:23:31.752 --> 00:23:33.893]  Three or four years ago, he started talking about me some.
[00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:36.814]  I would get massive traffic off of it, and I went and watched it.
[00:23:36.814 --> 00:23:38.334]  Okay, he's a gamer guy.
[00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:39.175]  He's kind of liberal.
[00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:40.175]  He tells a lot of jokes.
[00:23:40.175 --> 00:23:40.955]  He's a comedian.
[00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:42.556]  He's funny.
[00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:44.376]  Okay.
[00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:46.057]  He made fun of me hilariously.
[00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.337]  I loved it.
[00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:51.659]  I like being made fun of if it's being done good-naturedly, because, I mean, I laugh at myself sometimes.
[00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:59.092]  So this guy is numero uno.
[00:23:59.092 --> 00:24:02.735]  He's not gangster rap, teaching your kids how to kill themselves.
[00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:04.377]  He's not into drugs.
[00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:08.260]  He's into fitness, but he likes video games.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.483]  Over 100 billion people have watched him, if you combine his YouTube channels.
[00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:12.805]  He's got 100 million subscribers.
[00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:15.755]  A couple years ago, Disney tried to take him over.
[00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:17.056]  He wouldn't do what they said.
[00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:18.936]  So they had YouTube demonetize him.
[00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:19.656]  Took the money away.
[00:24:19.656 --> 00:24:20.696]  He wouldn't shut up.
[00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:24.697]  Then they stopped letting all the people that subscribe get notifications.
[00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:27.017]  People just go to his channel.
[00:24:27.017 --> 00:24:28.058]  So they can't suppress him.
[00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:31.818]  They've been trying for three years.
[00:24:31.818 --> 00:24:38.219]  So now they come out, just like they say Rammstein is Nazi, because it's German.
[00:24:38.219 --> 00:24:41.580]  And they show him next to Heinrich Himmler, but it's an actor from Heinrich Himmler.
[00:24:42.813 --> 00:24:49.217]  The Nazi head of the SS and say, look, he's wearing similar glasses.
[00:24:49.217 --> 00:24:52.699]  And oh, look, they were calling him a Nazi.
[00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:56.482]  He joked and said, you know, hail PewDiePie.
[00:24:56.482 --> 00:24:57.762]  This is the stuff they've got.
[00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:00.644]  They say, oh, he's got a short haircut.
[00:25:00.644 --> 00:25:06.728]  It's not even the same haircut as similar, but it's the high and tight haircut that most people have.
[00:25:06.728 --> 00:25:09.410]  It's been popular for about 10 years.
[00:25:11.024 --> 00:25:13.806]  It's the one that David Beckham and everybody popularized.
[00:25:13.806 --> 00:25:15.808]  And it's an old 1920s, 1930s haircut.
[00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:19.611]  You know, both my grandfathers had that haircut.
[00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:20.712]  Hell, I've got that haircut.
[00:25:20.712 --> 00:25:21.753]  Does that mean I'm a Nazi?
[00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:22.313]  No.
[00:25:22.313 --> 00:25:25.696]  It means I don't like messing with my hair all day.
[00:25:25.696 --> 00:25:28.478]  So they talk about how over time he changed his hairstyle.
[00:25:28.478 --> 00:25:33.482]  Well, yeah, in 2011, that was the hairstyle to have a little bit longer hair.
[00:25:34.485 --> 00:25:37.686]  Like Ashton Kutcher or whatever his name is.
[00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:40.867]  2016, it's all the rage to have the hair shorter.
[00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:42.507]  And now the style's even shorter.
[00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:46.588]  You walk into a barbershop, there's black guys, there's Hispanic guys, there's white guys, all getting the same haircut.
[00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:51.989]  I haven't gotten a haircut in like three, four weeks, so it's about time to get one, but it's the haircut PewDiePie's got.
[00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:52.969]  And it's not because he's a Nazi.
[00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:56.670]  Now see, this is, and the left knows this.
[00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.131]  Why are they going after him?
[00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:00.691]  Because he's the biggest thing in the world.
[00:26:00.691 --> 00:26:03.752]  Just 30 years ago, before the internet, if you wanted to have music,
[00:26:04.955 --> 00:26:13.380]  If you wanted to have your own band, if you wanted to have your own radio show, there were mafias, basically, corporate mafias that would come after you.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:20.384]  In pro wrestling, there were regions that nobody could come into unless you were part of that group or you'd get your house burned down.
[00:26:20.384 --> 00:26:29.569]  But the internet has allowed the media to be broken up, so all the old Sumner Redstones, all the big Viacom heads, all the big CBS heads, the News Corp heads, they're really threatened and upset.
[00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:31.490]  They thought they would always control the internet.
[00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.311]  They'd use it as a
[00:26:34.733 --> 00:26:40.178]  Minor league training fishery or nursery to find the talent to get it.
[00:26:40.178 --> 00:26:42.340]  But see, people don't want that.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.183]  I didn't want to be hired by big corporations and controlled.
[00:26:45.183 --> 00:26:47.425]  I was offered up to $10 million a year.
[00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:49.927]  I didn't want to be told what to say.
[00:26:49.927 --> 00:26:57.334]  PewDiePie, he is, with the youth, 20 times bigger than I've ever been.
[00:26:57.334 --> 00:26:57.715]  That's great.
[00:27:00.148 --> 00:27:01.408]  They can't stand that though, you see.
[00:27:01.408 --> 00:27:03.249]  They want a monopoly.
[00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:14.632]  And just like this Me Too movement can be projected on anybody they want, this whole thing of being a Nazi can be projected, and now they've got thousands of publications a week saying, we de-platformed Alex Jones.
[00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:15.912]  It's in the articles.
[00:27:15.912 --> 00:27:18.373]  We can do it to PewDiePie.
[00:27:18.373 --> 00:27:25.475]  But others say, like this headline, it's up on Infowars.com, Why YouTube's Biggest Star Can't Be Cancelled, New York Mag.
[00:27:25.475 --> 00:27:26.275]  And they go through this,
[00:27:27.737 --> 00:27:34.062]  And say he laughed at someone who was an approved of a Nazi.
[00:27:34.062 --> 00:27:38.005]  The guy plays video games for hours every day online.
[00:27:38.005 --> 00:27:42.029]  A guy walks by with some weird rabbi shekel name.
[00:27:43.394 --> 00:27:46.456]  PewDiePie laughs every time somebody gets shot.
[00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.056]  That's what you do.
[00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:48.937]  He snickers and it's like a laugh track.
[00:27:48.937 --> 00:27:50.318]  That's all he does is laugh.
[00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:55.661]  And then because some guy had a name, Rabbi Shekel shoots somebody in the head.
[00:27:55.661 --> 00:27:59.603]  We're showing it to your TV viewer and this becomes the total proof.
[00:27:59.603 --> 00:28:01.665]  Like playing Rammstein.
[00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:05.067]  Or having a short haircut.
[00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:10.350]  Or wearing wireframe glasses that aren't even the same shape as Heinrich Himmler's.
[00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.912]  By the way, he is a Northern European.
[00:28:13.912 --> 00:28:17.537]  He does kind of have a shaped head, a little bit like Himmler's.
[00:28:17.537 --> 00:28:20.360]  And so if you have a, you know, there's probably four or five shapes of heads.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.083]  If you happen to have that shape of head, a lot of black guys have that shape of head too.
[00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:29.091]  If you happen to have that shape of head, that kind of, you know, rectangular shaped head that you want to wear smaller glasses.
[00:28:30.316 --> 00:28:31.937]  But everybody knows that.
[00:28:31.937 --> 00:28:34.379]  He walks in a sunglass hut, they're gonna, what do you think's best?
[00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.900]  Well, let's take you over here, sir.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.863]  They're gonna take you over to those glasses, because that's what looks good with that shape of head.
[00:28:39.863 --> 00:28:54.154]  That turns into Nazi, and the New York Times, everyone's, the Southern Poverty Law Center, George Soros is just breathlessly, ah, ah, ah, we gotta, no, the reason you don't like him is because he has power and viewers, and nobody likes you.
[00:28:54.154 --> 00:28:57.956]  No one wants your university force-fed tyranny.
[00:28:57.956 --> 00:28:58.537]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.092]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:04.092 --> 00:29:08.333]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:09.714]  The Bug Assault.
[00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:15.375]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[00:29:21.117 --> 00:29:22.957]  Makes the perfect stocking stuffer.

[00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.383]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:01.814]  Everybody knows it.
[00:30:01.814 --> 00:30:03.695]  History documents it.
[00:30:03.695 --> 00:30:09.277]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:10.418]  They want to abort children.
[00:30:10.418 --> 00:30:12.159]  They want to disease children.
[00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:13.279]  They want to abuse children.
[00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.920]  They want to confuse children.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.081]  They want their essence.
[00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:17.041]  They want their soul.
[00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:18.362]  They want their spirit.
[00:30:18.362 --> 00:30:20.122]  They want their power.
[00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:21.103]  Because they are our future.
[00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.892]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, our ultimate sacrifice.
[00:30:25.892 --> 00:30:27.853]  It is about the West.
[00:30:27.853 --> 00:30:31.975]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[00:30:31.975 --> 00:30:34.656]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[00:30:34.656 --> 00:30:41.479]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars.
[00:30:41.479 --> 00:30:45.301]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:47.362]  You have the power to override the censors.
[00:30:47.362 --> 00:30:50.463]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[00:30:50.976 --> 00:31:00.498]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[00:31:00.498 --> 00:31:09.540]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.881]  We've been proven dead on.
[00:31:10.881 --> 00:31:14.742]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:31:14.742 --> 00:31:19.383]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[00:31:19.383 --> 00:31:20.423]  Words are not enough.
[00:31:21.249 --> 00:31:27.437]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[00:31:27.437 --> 00:31:33.645]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[00:31:33.645 --> 00:31:37.010]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[00:31:37.622 --> 00:31:39.543]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:43.466]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[00:31:43.466 --> 00:31:49.810]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.051]  I am in your hands.
[00:31:51.051 --> 00:31:59.116]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[00:32:00.217 --> 00:32:06.625]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.187]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:13.093]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:32:13.093 --> 00:32:16.017]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[00:32:16.557 --> 00:32:19.298]  A free gift with every order.
[00:32:19.298 --> 00:32:28.160]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.821]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:37.182]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:32:37.182 --> 00:32:39.563]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:32:40.123 --> 00:32:46.528]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a lost leader.
[00:32:46.528 --> 00:32:48.109]  We are losing money on this.
[00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:49.530]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.872]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[00:32:52.872 --> 00:32:57.876]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:57.876 --> 00:33:03.379]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:33:03.379 --> 00:33:06.041]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:28.557]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.557 --> 00:33:35.841]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:48.649]  And by every time you retweet one of these things, or every time you promote this idea, you are promoting ignorance, racism, genocide, anti-semitism.
[00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:53.432]  These are all things that you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes PewDiePie.
[00:33:54.372 --> 00:33:56.093]  So be careful about this.
[00:33:56.093 --> 00:34:01.676]  If someone decided to... If something were to happen, if PewDiePie were to be sued for this, you could be complicit.
[00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:05.078]  If you retweet it, they could make you pay a fine as well.
[00:34:05.078 --> 00:34:09.580]  Because you have officially published anti-Semitic things.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.402]  So if you are republishing this stuff, you could get in trouble for it.
[00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:15.223]  Be very aware that that is a real thing.
[00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:28.502]  So, the corporate media, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters run by George Soros, a real Nazi collaborator who said that he had the best time of his life helping round up Jews, called it happy-making time on 60 Minutes.
[00:34:28.502 --> 00:34:30.464]  They are moving to take PewDiePie off the air.
[00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:34.869]  Thousands of news articles, oh look at his wire-framed glasses, they look like Himmler's.
[00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:36.831]  He's got a short haircut, he's from Sweden.
[00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:39.038]  On and on and on.
[00:34:39.038 --> 00:34:56.210]  Oh, he was playing a video game once on TV, and out of thousands of hours he does a year, multi-hours a day, and some guy walked by with a handle named Rabbi Shekels, whatever that means, and PewDiePie laughed when somebody got shot, so that means he's a Nazi.
[00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.992]  That's the level of this control, and why is this so important?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.744]  Because the establishment is making its move on everyone's free speech right now.
[00:35:04.744 --> 00:35:12.670]  The story is getting bigger and bigger and it's really important because people are standing up for PewDiePie and this incredible leftist censorship.
[00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:20.897]  And the audio you just heard of your radio listener is from video posted to Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:35:20.897 --> 00:35:27.262]  Video, unhinged history teacher claims PewDiePie is promoting genocide.
[00:35:28.203 --> 00:35:42.178]  You talk about defamation and threatening the middle school students that they will get sued, that they will be fined if they share this man's genocidal links.
[00:35:42.178 --> 00:35:49.766]  Meanwhile, the New York Times today says that human extinction would not be a bad thing, that all humans are bad.
[00:35:51.189 --> 00:35:52.830]  And that we should reduce the world's population.
[00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.173]  That's not Nazi at all.
[00:35:55.173 --> 00:36:06.943]  PewDiePie, who's done nothing, he's the Nazi because he's popular and he has a hundred billion views and a hundred million subscribers and is the number one individual on YouTube, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:06.943 --> 00:36:09.885]  That's why, because these big corporations don't have any viewers.
[00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:12.988]  Obama gives a speech, it has 5,000 views on YouTube.
[00:36:12.988 --> 00:36:15.210]  Anderson Cooper does a daily show on
[00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:18.913]  Facebook, it literally has no more than 10,000 viewers.
[00:36:18.913 --> 00:36:22.616]  They paid him $18 million for it.
[00:36:22.616 --> 00:36:26.739]  And PewDiePie, in the last four years, was the number one star.
[00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:31.843]  YouTube and Disney tried to buy him out, tried to make him do things that he didn't want to do.
[00:36:31.843 --> 00:36:36.467]  So he said no thank you, so they demonetized him.
[00:36:36.467 --> 00:36:44.213]  Just like we have seen done over and over again with Ted Nugent and Philip, stadiums of 20,000, 40,000 people.
[00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:49.501]  He's been told, stop supporting Trump, and we'll let you play in stadiums again.
[00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:57.187]  But only three companies own the big stadiums, and so Ted Nugent can't play basically anywhere except city-owned coliseums like Waco.
[00:36:57.187 --> 00:36:58.868]  And it's totally packed.
[00:36:58.868 --> 00:37:06.033]  But because he won't play ball, he loses $15 million a year.
[00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:07.094]  That's directly from Ted Nugent.
[00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:08.195]  I looked it up in publications.
[00:37:08.195 --> 00:37:09.336]  It's true.
[00:37:09.336 --> 00:37:10.537]  Think of the sacrifice.
[00:37:10.537 --> 00:37:13.840]  Trump's lost $2 billion since he ran for office, with all the boycotts and lawsuits.
[00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.072]  And most people sell out ladies and gentlemen
[00:37:32.537 --> 00:37:39.899]  You know, Charlie Chaplin could joke around and say he was a Nazi and engage in satire.
[00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:41.199]  So could John Cleese.
[00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:44.299]  That's okay, but Hitler Dog does it.
[00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:46.920]  He's banned!
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.461]  These people want to control all knowledge, they want to control all comedy.
[00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:55.982]  It's absolute, total, and complete nauseating garbage.
[00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:57.622]  But it gets worse from there.
[00:37:57.622 --> 00:38:01.083]  New York Magazine laments PewDiePie appears to be too popular to ban.
[00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:17.421]  Meanwhile, PewDiePie fans hacked the Wall Street Journal yesterday and apologized to PewDiePie for the horrible article they wrote that basically Vox copied the controversy over YouTube star PewDiePie and his anti-Semitic jokes explained.
[00:38:17.421 --> 00:38:19.844]  And then it shows the jokes.
[00:38:19.844 --> 00:38:24.489]  He's walking through a multiplayer game, walks by thousands of people a day and they shoot him up games.
[00:38:25.583 --> 00:38:29.546]  And he laughs every time somebody gets shot because one of them had a handle.
[00:38:29.546 --> 00:38:33.868]  Rabbi Shekels, it's over!
[00:38:33.868 --> 00:38:35.810]  Look, he cut his hair shorter.
[00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.751]  That's the Wall Street Journal's main evidence.
[00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:42.454]  And then he had wire-framed glasses like Heinrich Himmler.
[00:38:42.454 --> 00:38:47.557]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:47.557 --> 00:38:50.999]  And he's a right-wing troll, they say.
[00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:53.081]  No, they're all just fabulously
[00:38:54.616 --> 00:38:58.338]  They're fabulously jealous.
[00:38:58.338 --> 00:39:03.001]  They're fabulously angry.
[00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:04.882]  Look at this alchemy they engage in.
[00:39:04.882 --> 00:39:08.203]  PewDiePie the Guardian thinks death to all Jews is a joke.
[00:39:08.203 --> 00:39:11.265]  Are you laughing yet?
[00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:14.287]  That's because the handle of a guy he walks by in a video game
[00:39:16.414 --> 00:39:18.855]  Can somehow be connected to somebody saying, death to all Jews.
[00:39:18.855 --> 00:39:20.536]  How does Rabbi Shekels do that?
[00:39:20.536 --> 00:39:26.498]  And because he's in a video game with thousands of other players and someone's named that, it's like walking by somebody on the street.
[00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:31.500]  Or driving by somebody that's got a Nazi sticker.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.100]  And then you...
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.260]  Or the bad person.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.922]  This is the culture police.
[00:39:38.922 --> 00:39:39.903]  They are the real Nazis.
[00:39:39.903 --> 00:39:45.646]  They are the digital Nazis at Vox, and the London Guardian, and the New York Times, and New York Magazine.
[00:39:45.646 --> 00:39:51.829]  They are funded and run by a real Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:58.073]  They're connected to the intelligence agencies that took 30-plus thousand Nazis out after World War II and protected them.
[00:39:58.073 --> 00:40:00.194]  PewDiePie has no connection to Nazis.
[00:40:00.194 --> 00:40:04.797]  I have no connection to Nazis, except both my grandfathers were in the Army Air Corps and both almost died.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.442]  My only connection to Nazis is they almost made me not exist.
[00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:17.025]  But if I helped round up Jews like George Soros, I'd be getting awards.
[00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:18.426]  You see, that's how they do it.
[00:40:18.426 --> 00:40:21.768]  They hide at point-blank range and say you are what they are.
[00:40:21.768 --> 00:40:23.649]  Hillary's paid off of the Russians?
[00:40:23.649 --> 00:40:26.531]  They say Trump is.
[00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:28.452]  Mainstream media hates America selling us out?
[00:40:28.452 --> 00:40:30.754]  They say I hate America.
[00:40:30.754 --> 00:40:31.394]  It's that simple.
[00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:32.475]  Let's go to another clip here.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.602]  PewDiePie laughs at Rabbi Shekels shooting someone in a game.
[00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.623]  Again, there's all these players shooting each other.
[00:40:40.623 --> 00:40:42.444]  One guy's got a name over his head.
[00:40:42.444 --> 00:40:44.365]  They've all got names over their heads saying who they are.
[00:40:44.365 --> 00:40:47.287]  And because he laughed, well, he's a bad guy.
[00:40:47.287 --> 00:40:48.147]  Here it is.
[00:40:48.147 --> 00:40:49.508]  You sound a lot like PewDiePie.
[00:40:49.508 --> 00:40:53.490]  I'm, of course, skeptical, because I've been on the internet for a while.
[00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.711]  I've been on the internet for a while.
[00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:59.153]  I'm just going to say, hey man, I really appreciate your content.
[00:40:59.153 --> 00:41:02.355]  You've gotten me through some tough times, and I respect the f*** out of you.
[00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:26.409]  So he's wearing VR goggles he's laughing haha you just shot him
[00:41:28.248 --> 00:41:30.609]  I can't even hardly see or even see Rabbi Shekels on there.
[00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:32.050]  I get lost in all the shooting.
[00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.011]  But this is the total mental illness.
[00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:35.532]  But the left isn't mentally ill.
[00:41:35.532 --> 00:41:42.496]  They're telling school children nationwide, it's been in the news, in every public school, from middle school up in college.
[00:41:42.496 --> 00:41:46.038]  I have quite a bit of friends who have daughters and granddaughters in college.
[00:41:46.038 --> 00:41:46.519]  They've all
[00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:47.639]  Come back.
[00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:48.800]  That doesn't mean daughters.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.983]  And said, my God, I'm in journalism class about to graduate.
[00:41:51.983 --> 00:41:56.546]  They call us in and say, Alex Jones is pure evil and if you ever support him, you'll be put in jail.
[00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:57.807]  And he's a racist.
[00:41:57.807 --> 00:42:01.730]  And it's happening at public schools and it's in newspapers they do this.
[00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.592]  Everywhere.
[00:42:04.592 --> 00:42:06.033]  And it's the same thing with PewDiePie.
[00:42:06.033 --> 00:42:07.734]  We just played the video.
[00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:12.178]  If you share him, you're gonna get sued and you might go to jail and it's all over.
[00:42:13.683 --> 00:42:23.649]  This is what they're doing, and they're traumatizing students, telling them they're Nazis, and they want genocide, and they want to kill people, all because the left follows orders.
[00:42:23.649 --> 00:42:30.372]  And they see the New York Times and the Washington Post say PewDiePie's a bad guy, and they all, like attack dogs, run into those classes.
[00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:35.755]  They're putting InfoWars, and yours truly, Alex Jones, officially in curriculum nationwide.
[00:42:35.755 --> 00:42:36.576]  It's all in the newspapers.
[00:42:37.176 --> 00:42:51.046]  And they go in there and they teach lies about me, and say things I never said, and take them out of context, to demonize the First Amendment in journalism classes, and teach the classes how to be censors, priming them for the universities to be good little Nazis.
[00:42:51.046 --> 00:42:57.691]  No, if anybody acts like Nazis, it's the dirtbag left, and whoever that teacher is, trying to terrorize their students.
[00:42:59.312 --> 00:43:08.600]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.483]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.483 --> 00:43:17.529]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.189 --> 00:43:24.455]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:30.761]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:37.788]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:37.788 --> 00:43:37.988]  But!
[00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:51.834]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.834 --> 00:43:56.096]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.096 --> 00:43:59.517]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:43:59.517 --> 00:44:02.578]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:44:02.578 --> 00:44:04.119]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.493 --> 00:44:08.456]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:44:08.456 --> 00:44:13.039]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.
[00:44:14.082 --> 00:44:23.225]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.225 --> 00:44:28.567]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:30.848]  We have those incredible sale prices back.
[00:44:30.848 --> 00:44:34.350]  MFORWARDSTORE.COM on MFORWARDS SELECT STORABLE FOODS.
[00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.830]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:39.832]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:44:39.832 --> 00:44:42.033]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:44:42.033 --> 00:44:43.133]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:44:43.593 --> 00:44:45.575]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:45.575 --> 00:44:48.117]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.117 --> 00:44:53.121]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:58.505]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:10.721]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.721 --> 00:45:12.782]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.782 --> 00:45:15.644]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.644 --> 00:45:17.145]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.145 --> 00:45:20.267]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.507 --> 00:45:20.927]  Absolutely.
[00:45:40.834 --> 00:45:52.564]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:52.564 --> 00:45:55.847]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:45:55.847 --> 00:45:59.049]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:05.094]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:09.637]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[00:46:09.637 --> 00:46:20.143]  That's why I am extending the 12 Days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:20.143 --> 00:46:24.005]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[00:46:24.005 --> 00:46:25.526]  All the sales the last 12 days
[00:46:26.686 --> 00:46:28.748]  50 to 75% off is back.
[00:46:28.748 --> 00:46:29.829]  Free shipping is still there.
[00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:31.230]  Double Patriot points.
[00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.473]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[00:46:34.473 --> 00:46:38.997]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:40.458]  Just go check out the sales.
[00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:42.180]  There's too many to break them all down.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.582]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[00:46:46.323 --> 00:46:48.325]  And thank you again all for your support.
[00:46:48.325 --> 00:46:52.809]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:57.454]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[00:46:57.454 --> 00:47:03.439]  Thank you.
[00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:06.042]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.297 --> 00:47:11.918]  We've got it.
[00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:18.423]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:47:18.423 --> 00:47:22.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:22.826 --> 00:47:28.511]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:47:30.886 --> 00:47:36.510]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are making their move on America and on anybody popular they don't control.
[00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:41.514]  Michael Savage is going from three hours to one hour, and in three months they're going to get rid of him.
[00:47:41.514 --> 00:47:42.895]  That's the inside of baseball.
[00:47:42.895 --> 00:47:49.680]  They're replacing him on these stations where he has number one ratings with Ben Shapiro, who's the never-Trumper neocon.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.464]  They're getting rid of all the opposition to the globalist takeover ahead of it.
[00:47:54.464 --> 00:47:54.864]  And K.A.
[00:47:56.847 --> 00:48:01.430]  H-I, our Sacramento radio station, getting huge ratings with us.
[00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:17.001]  You saw the big national push by Soros Group, by others to attack our stations, make up lies, send them BS, tell them we said things we didn't say, to then remove us off air and say that, you know, we're fake news, we're fiction.
[00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:18.843]  That's more tortious interference, it's more
[00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:22.471]  Defamation with intentional to do harm.
[00:48:22.471 --> 00:48:24.913]  And it's just more of these people are racking up.
[00:48:24.913 --> 00:48:28.015]  But this is the war.
[00:48:28.015 --> 00:48:38.864]  So that's why you need to call every radio station we're on and thank them and explain that you've got George Soros, the Democrat dirtbags doing this and become a sponsor or send them a hundred bucks.
[00:48:38.864 --> 00:48:43.127]  But whatever you do, paint the side of your barn about the local station.
[00:48:43.127 --> 00:48:44.548]  Because that's what they're doing.
[00:48:44.548 --> 00:48:48.972]  That's what these leftist terrorists are doing is terrorizing the First Amendment everywhere.
[00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:55.828]  They're turning the whole country into what they've done to the anti-free speech universities.
[00:48:55.828 --> 00:48:57.210]  This is what they do.
[00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.274]  Now we probably gained 50 radio stations since the mass banning four months ago.
[00:49:02.432 --> 00:49:05.814]  And that's what they're pushing back against is that a lot of this backfired.
[00:49:05.814 --> 00:49:09.336]  A lot of our station owners and managers totally get what's happening.
[00:49:09.336 --> 00:49:10.577]  They're aware of what's going on.
[00:49:10.577 --> 00:49:15.880]  But we need to see, let's put that radio station in Sacramento back up, push back on this.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.941]  Nicely to them.
[00:49:16.941 --> 00:49:18.402]  Say, hey, don't listen to these globalists.
[00:49:18.402 --> 00:49:19.402]  Don't listen to the left.
[00:49:19.402 --> 00:49:20.403]  Call the board of directors.
[00:49:20.403 --> 00:49:21.664]  It's a Christian station.
[00:49:21.664 --> 00:49:23.285]  Tell them, stand with the truth.
[00:49:23.285 --> 00:49:25.886]  Don't stand with these evil globalists.
[00:49:25.886 --> 00:49:28.328]  www.kahi.com
[00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:33.372]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, everywhere they're moving against free speech.
[00:49:33.372 --> 00:49:36.054]  K-A-H-I dot com.
[00:49:36.054 --> 00:49:38.836]  Regardless, we're getting more stations in California.
[00:49:38.836 --> 00:49:40.277]  Call stations in your area.
[00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:45.220]  If you don't have a local station, call them all and say, listen, pick up Alex Jones.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.341]  Get the truth out there.
[00:49:46.341 --> 00:49:47.262]  Learn what's going on.
[00:49:47.262 --> 00:49:50.884]  This is riveting, powerful, pro-liberty talk radio.
[00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:54.007]  Now remember, PewDiePie, who I was getting into,
[00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:56.610]  Adults are like, who's that?
[00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:05.174]  Well, he's a 30-something year old now, a guy from Sweden, who's got 100 million views out there and 100 million subscribers.
[00:50:05.174 --> 00:50:17.780]  And there's now this giant Indian global consortium, like out of Ready Player One, that has hundreds of thousands of people on the payroll to go out and make themselves number one, basically with fake subscriptions, bots, you name it.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.721]  So they've now gotten a little bit ahead of him.
[00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:21.442]  There's a race for who's going to be the biggest.
[00:50:21.442 --> 00:50:22.883]  But the point is, is that
[00:50:23.956 --> 00:50:27.739]  The globalists, big corporations are trying to crush competition everywhere.
[00:50:27.739 --> 00:50:31.762]  I put this video out this morning at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:35.065]  As adults, you're not into PewDiePie.
[00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:45.613]  But for your young teenagers and others who already are, it shows solidarity with the Liberty Movement, with people like PewDiePie who are being censored, and it gets young people aware of what's happening.
[00:50:45.613 --> 00:50:49.816]  PewDiePie has been defending InfoWars for several years when we've been under attack.
[00:50:49.816 --> 00:50:53.539]  He's gone and played the actual clips of what we say versus what they say about us.
[00:50:54.645 --> 00:50:56.926]  And so he's pro-free speech.
[00:50:56.926 --> 00:51:00.007]  That's what we've got to work together when this type of stuff's happening.
[00:51:00.007 --> 00:51:04.329]  So here is the video I shot this morning.
[00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:10.351]  Everyone must subscribe to PewDiePie in his war against the tyrannical T-Series right now.
[00:51:10.351 --> 00:51:14.993]  A giant corporation out of India is trying to get the number one slot on YouTube.
[00:51:14.993 --> 00:51:20.835]  The New York Times, the New York Magazine are all calling for him to be removed off of the air because they hate independent media.
[00:51:20.835 --> 00:51:21.396]  This is like
[00:51:22.356 --> 00:51:24.657]  Ready Player One for real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:24.657 --> 00:51:27.519]  The whole global corporate system trying to bring down PewDiePie.
[00:51:27.519 --> 00:51:28.739]  He's the next target.
[00:51:28.739 --> 00:51:32.581]  So all InfoWarriors have got to go to YouTube right now and subscribe.
[00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:34.502]  Make him too big to ban.
[00:51:34.502 --> 00:51:37.744]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar!
[00:51:37.744 --> 00:51:41.046]  Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna.
[00:51:41.046 --> 00:51:44.267]  T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna.
[00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:47.429]  Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna.
[00:51:47.429 --> 00:51:49.730]  Look at T-Series, they're just crying for the
[00:51:54.307 --> 00:51:58.329]  And again, that's all silliness, folks.
[00:51:58.329 --> 00:52:03.372]  That's who they claim is a Nazi, because they want full control.
[00:52:03.372 --> 00:52:07.334]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're removing everybody ahead of removing Trump.
[00:52:07.334 --> 00:52:16.319]  Michael Savage, in his talk show ratings, The Washington Times reports, has 14.8 million listeners a week just on stations that are rated.
[00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:19.761]  A lot of stations don't subscribe to Arbitron, so they're not shown.
[00:52:20.796 --> 00:52:23.157]  The numbers are he's as big as Rush Limbaugh.
[00:52:23.157 --> 00:52:25.237]  25 million listeners a week.
[00:52:25.237 --> 00:52:35.780]  And Michael Savage being silenced by corporate censorship attorney says, Savage can't speak about it because of his contract, but I can give you the exclusive baseball next hour.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.640]  And it goes into Alex Jones.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.481]  Conspiracy theory.
[00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:39.001]  Think again.
[00:52:39.001 --> 00:52:40.561]  Think Alex Jones, Megyn Kelly.
[00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:44.882]  Just a couple years ago, booting these big money draws would have been unthinkable.
[00:52:44.882 --> 00:52:47.543]  Fast forward a couple politically incorrect blinks later,
[00:52:48.655 --> 00:52:51.637]  And indeed, the unthinkable has occurred.
[00:52:51.637 --> 00:52:57.540]  Michael Savage's lawyer said, in the same vein, could very well be the next nationally known victim of media censorship.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:09.127]  They've cut his hit show from three hours to one hour, replacing it with Ben Shapiro, who happened to be a lawyer at Talk Radio Network that Savage particularly hates.
[00:53:09.127 --> 00:53:13.830]  And I'm not going to get into the private stuff Savage told me, but good lord, it was unbelievable.
[00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.512]  His battles with Talk Radio Network, and now that's the guy.
[00:53:18.732 --> 00:53:22.808]  That they're using to replace him because Shapiro's anti-Trump.
[00:53:23.803 --> 00:53:28.766]  Networks are actually losing millions of dollars in order to keep Michael's voice off these stations, Horowitz said.
[00:53:28.766 --> 00:53:41.653]  Yes indeed, the savage nation could indeed be the next casualty of corporate censorship and what a sad, sorry shame that will be for a nation already suffering from the plight of having too few and far between original thinkers.
[00:53:41.653 --> 00:53:48.657]  Cheryl Chumley wrote the article and I'm in here, the whole deal and the way these golden handcuffs work
[00:53:49.927 --> 00:54:00.591]  For a Gavin McGinnis, and now a Michael Savage, and then a Tucker Carlson, and a Sean Hannity is, you don't get your payout if you talk about what's going on.
[00:54:00.591 --> 00:54:03.792]  Michael Savage has written over a hundred best-selling books.
[00:54:03.792 --> 00:54:05.932]  I think like 10 of them, New York Times number one.
[00:54:05.932 --> 00:54:08.473]  He basically launched the whole modern herbal movement.
[00:54:08.473 --> 00:54:10.134]  He's a doctor of that.
[00:54:10.134 --> 00:54:13.095]  I mean a real MD type herbalist.
[00:54:13.095 --> 00:54:15.095]  There are very few of those.
[00:54:17.486 --> 00:54:26.039]  People don't even know that, that he has one of the biggest supplement companies in the world and Rockstar Energy Drinks.
[00:54:26.039 --> 00:54:27.922]  I mean, he doesn't need any money.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.962]  Michael, let him have it, man.
[00:54:32.962 --> 00:54:37.646]  Don't let Ben Shapiro step in and then try to molest the brains of your audience.
[00:54:37.646 --> 00:54:44.713]  Don't let him rape their brains with his fake, you know, swarmy Ivy League scripting that he does.
[00:54:44.713 --> 00:54:45.974]  Oh, he's such a genius!
[00:54:45.974 --> 00:54:49.177]  Even the liberal media and the conservative media and Bill Morrell says it.
[00:54:49.177 --> 00:54:50.458]  Oh, he's so smart!
[00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:54.022]  Meanwhile, he gets an interview with Tucker Carlson and can't even hardly hold himself together.
[00:54:55.587 --> 00:54:59.429]  If Ben Shapiro was a patriot and doing great, I would step aside.
[00:54:59.429 --> 00:54:59.890]  But he's not.
[00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:12.677]  He's a smarmy little worm who is the heir apparent and who is being foisted and shoved upon everyone and force-fed to us.
[00:55:12.677 --> 00:55:16.899]  And my goodness, behind the scenes, the things Glenn Beck's trying to do to my show to stop it.
[00:55:16.899 --> 00:55:20.121]  And now Ben Shapiro is constantly weeviling around in the background.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.540]  I'm not calling for censorship.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:25.661]  But see, hey, can't you go start your own show?
[00:55:25.661 --> 00:55:31.722]  No, you've got to be given all the big juicy time slots with Michael Savage.
[00:55:31.722 --> 00:55:33.002]  In fact, I was looking at the lineup.
[00:55:33.002 --> 00:55:37.043]  Even when Savage is in rebroadcast, that's where they're going to air Shapiro now.
[00:55:37.043 --> 00:55:40.764]  He's being given Savage's empire.
[00:55:40.764 --> 00:55:41.944]  He didn't build it.
[00:55:41.944 --> 00:55:46.245]  And I predict this, the ratings are going to tank.
[00:55:46.245 --> 00:55:48.206]  The ratings are going to tank.
[00:55:49.634 --> 00:55:50.594]  Unbelievable.
[00:55:50.594 --> 00:55:54.655]  So, they're trying to shut me down, they're trying to shut Savage down, they're coming after everybody.
[00:55:54.655 --> 00:55:56.636]  This is the move to take Trump and America down.
[00:55:56.636 --> 00:55:57.116]  This is it.
[00:55:57.116 --> 00:56:14.001]  So, I'm telling you listeners, call those local stations, thank them, send them a check, call the board of directors, call all the phone numbers and say, don't you listen to the globalist garbage, and just sure up all those stations because these dirtbags are making their move, and they're making their move big time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:16.348 --> 00:56:17.369]  This is a war.
[00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:18.971]  This is an information war.
[00:56:18.971 --> 00:56:21.313]  You must take action.
[00:56:21.313 --> 00:56:23.115]  George Soros is the Nazi collaborator.
[00:56:23.115 --> 00:56:28.220]  How dare him fund groups lying about me and sending them BS stories saying take me off the air.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.881]  That we're doing all these things we're not doing.
[00:56:29.881 --> 00:56:30.842]  They're frauds.
[00:56:30.842 --> 00:56:33.364]  And they're going to be getting sued very soon.
[00:56:33.364 --> 00:56:35.487]  You can set your watch and warrant by it.
[00:56:35.487 --> 00:56:36.788]  Get ready.
[00:56:36.788 --> 00:56:37.589]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:56:38.404 --> 00:56:39.144]  I'm talking about the station.
[00:56:39.144 --> 00:56:40.605]  I'm talking about the people putting this out.
[00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:42.285]  The figurehead they're using.
[00:56:42.285 --> 00:56:44.366]  That said, hey, financially support us.
[00:56:44.366 --> 00:56:45.546]  Get great products at the same time.

[00:56:51.648 --> 00:56:54.649]  In the third dimension, they cannot stop you when you take action.
[00:56:54.649 --> 00:57:00.451]  If you get your orders in by tomorrow, everyone is guaranteed to get it in the continental United States before Christmas.
[00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:02.171]  So do your Christmas shopping here.
[00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:03.092]  Don't fight those crowds.
[00:57:03.092 --> 00:57:04.352]  Don't stress out.
[00:57:04.352 --> 00:57:22.458]  Whether it's MycoZX, or whether it's Ultimate Bone Broth, or Colloidal Silver, or Super Blue 4-Wide Free Toothpaste, or Alpha Power, or Happys, or Secret 12, or DNA Force, or Knockout, or Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, or the Super Wound Gel that is FDA approved, the strongest stuff out there over the counter.
[00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:24.218]  It's in stores for a higher price.
[00:57:24.218 --> 00:57:26.559]  We private label it from the top company in Denver.
[00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:28.040]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.000]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:31.981]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.682]  This is the fight now, folks.
[00:57:33.682 --> 00:57:37.563]  Please commit and financially support us and get great products at the same time.
[00:57:37.563 --> 00:57:39.044]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:57:39.044 --> 00:57:42.806]  We are going to sell out of Alexa Pure Breathe today at $127.
[00:57:42.806 --> 00:57:46.187]  That is 50% off for you and your family.
[00:57:46.187 --> 00:57:47.588]  Give the gift of life.
[00:57:47.588 --> 00:57:48.068]  God bless you.
[00:57:53.357 --> 00:57:59.083]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.083 --> 00:58:06.970]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:10.113]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:10.293 --> 00:58:15.576]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:18.338]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:58:18.338 --> 00:58:27.363]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:32.247]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[00:58:56.855 --> 00:58:58.697]  So let's say it short and sweet.
[00:58:58.697 --> 00:59:01.039]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[00:59:01.039 --> 00:59:03.881]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:06.883]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[00:59:06.883 --> 00:59:10.706]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential.
[00:59:10.706 --> 00:59:12.528]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[00:59:13.348 --> 00:59:25.796]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart, that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:27.697]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.078]  I need to be provisioned.
[00:59:29.078 --> 00:59:33.400]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.281]  But I need your prayers.
[00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:36.162]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[00:59:36.162 --> 00:59:38.123]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[00:59:38.123 --> 00:59:38.864]  We make it easy.
[00:59:39.424 --> 00:59:46.187]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[00:59:46.187 --> 00:59:53.350]  We've got a bunch of huge deals in 4Store.com, so please take action right now.
[00:59:53.350 --> 01:00:03.455]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.455 --> 01:00:05.856]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:06.997]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.818]  The globalists are coming to sexualize your children, they're coming to rob your bank accounts, they're coming to totally conquer you.
[01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:28.706]  The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Soros Group are sending out lies to all our radio stations now and harassing their owners trying to get us taken off the air.
[01:00:28.706 --> 01:00:29.326]  It's backfired.
[01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.947]  We've gotten more stations, but in some cases are being successful.
[01:00:31.947 --> 01:00:33.348]  It's sick.
[01:00:33.348 --> 01:00:35.790]  We've got Roger Stone with huge breaking news in the next segment.
[01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:40.092]  Then we'll go inside the takedown and the plan to take Michael Savage off the air.
[01:00:40.092 --> 01:00:42.374]  But first, here is a key report.
[01:00:42.374 --> 01:00:44.335]  Border hell as Democrats choose treason.
[01:00:45.219 --> 01:00:52.643]  This month, the world took a landmark step forward with the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.
[01:00:52.643 --> 01:01:05.790]  The drawings of lines on maps have never sufficed to confine people whose needs, ambitions, dreams and opportunities expanded their horizons.
[01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:13.156]  We are now committed to safer and fairer ways of managing borders.
[01:01:13.156 --> 01:01:17.961]  The border wall battle will likely define the Trump presidency when it's all said and done.
[01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:21.364]  We believe that when nations respect the rights of their neighbors,
[01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:25.327]  And defend the interests of their people.
[01:01:25.327 --> 01:01:30.750]  They can better work together to secure the blessings of safety, prosperity, and peace.
[01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:35.472]  On the one hand, a populist president has tirelessly railed against the unprotected U.S.
[01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:35.832]  border.
[01:01:35.832 --> 01:01:37.233]  They're on the land.
[01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:38.234]  We release them.
[01:01:38.234 --> 01:01:40.915]  They go someplace into our country.
[01:01:40.915 --> 01:01:45.417]  They're supposed to come back within two or three years for a court case.
[01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:46.418]  But nobody ever comes back.
[01:01:47.665 --> 01:01:57.227]  While the Democrats, who supported border protection in the past, under former Presidents Obama and Clinton, have now chosen to promote their rampant hatred for the President.
[01:01:57.227 --> 01:02:01.208]  The President made clear that he wants a shutdown.
[01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:11.430]  His position, if he sticks to his position for a $5 billion wall, he will get no wall, and he will get a shutdown.
[01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:18.489]  We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration.
[01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:20.130]  And that means shutdowns?
[01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.911]  If it comes to it, absolutely.
[01:02:21.911 --> 01:02:23.632]  This is a very fundamental issue.
[01:02:23.632 --> 01:02:27.554]  At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country.
[01:02:27.554 --> 01:02:30.835]  Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.
[01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:33.237]  The Democrat Party is a simple choice.
[01:02:33.237 --> 01:02:37.479]  They can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration.
[01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:42.222]  The thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.
[01:02:42.222 --> 01:02:43.442]  And you want to shut it down.
[01:02:43.442 --> 01:02:44.563]  You keep talking about it.
[01:02:44.563 --> 01:02:46.284]  The last time, Chuck, you shut it down.
[01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:46.824]  No, no, no.
[01:02:46.824 --> 01:02:48.546]  And then you opened it up very quickly.
[01:02:48.546 --> 01:02:49.006]  20 times.
[01:02:49.006 --> 01:02:50.687]  I don't want to do what you did.
[01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:53.428]  But was President Trump really out of line?
[01:02:53.428 --> 01:02:55.690]  I think the President needs a, you know, call or blow.
[01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:56.991]  He said, I will own this.
[01:02:57.831 --> 01:03:02.713]  So he's willing to shut down the government because border security and national security is so important.
[01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:05.614]  So I think it was a beautiful thing he did.
[01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:09.376]  I think he shows American people that he truly cares about the safety of this country.
[01:03:09.376 --> 01:03:13.978]  And he'll take responsibility for shutting down the government because the Democrats don't want border security.
[01:03:13.978 --> 01:03:19.060]  The New York Daily News wrote, Pelosi said after the meeting it's like a manhood thing for him.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.001]  As if manhood could ever be associated with him.
[01:03:22.001 --> 01:03:23.522]  What an evil dick.
[01:03:23.522 --> 01:03:24.242]  She continues,
[01:03:24.642 --> 01:03:26.503]  I was trying to be the mom.
[01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.064]  I can't explain it to you.
[01:03:28.064 --> 01:03:29.545]  It was so wild.
[01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:35.268]  It goes to show you, you get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.
[01:03:35.268 --> 01:03:40.531]  That is incredibly disgusting language coming from a leader of our representative republic.
[01:03:40.851 --> 01:04:01.930]  Other than the fact that Pelosi has revealed that she is a foul-mouthed champion of perversion, what's most chilling is that she is leading the Democratic majority in the House, a political party that will stop at nothing to victimize its constituents in order to push the hyper-progressive UN agenda, slowly corroding American sovereignty.
[01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:12.141]  Some blame the present dilemma on migration policies, but the causes of the crisis are clearly much broader than that.
[01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:18.488]  They include poor governance, climate change, and basic economic and demographic realities.
[01:04:19.429 --> 01:04:33.261]  We're also watching as extreme nationalists pit one group against another, poisoning the communal bloodstream with hate towards people who are different, whether in nationality, appearance, or creed.
[01:04:33.261 --> 01:04:45.511]  Migration is, by its nature, an international phenomenon which can only be managed through international cooperation, and that is why we are all gathered here in Marrakesh.
[01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:46.652]  John Barrett reporting.
[01:04:58.354 --> 01:05:01.057]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[01:06:09.523 --> 01:06:17.027]  Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[01:06:17.027 --> 01:06:22.009]  Janie was lovely, she was the queen of my night.
[01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:26.132]  There in the darkness with the radio, playing low and low.
[01:06:26.132 --> 01:06:32.635]  The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved, the mountains that we moved.
[01:06:37.389 --> 01:06:39.051]  And she swore!
[01:06:39.051 --> 01:06:41.113]  But America is really about to end.
[01:06:56.067 --> 01:07:08.630]  Is Trump just that last death rattle, that last... of course when he dies and they fight, they're gonna give in, they're gonna let themselves die, but they fight back for a minute or two, and then pretty soon they just say, I can't breathe anymore and you die.
[01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:17.752]  I've been there a few times when family died, one grandfather, good friend of mine as well, he was just 30 years old when he died.
[01:07:17.752 --> 01:07:19.172]  Is that all this show is?
[01:07:19.172 --> 01:07:20.153]  Is that all Trump is?
[01:07:20.153 --> 01:07:21.213]  Is that all you are?
[01:07:21.213 --> 01:07:25.554]  Just a... getting a few final breaths before the death rattle?
[01:07:26.894 --> 01:07:28.134]  I don't think so.
[01:07:28.134 --> 01:07:42.338]  All over the world, humanity's waking up, but I gotta tell you, they're taking Michael Savage off the air from four hours, to three hours, and now to one hour, and the word is, in a couple months, they're gonna just terminate his show.
[01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:52.320]  They're just gonna kill him slowly, leave him on, give Ben Shapiro the hours after him, even though Savage's rating's the best it's ever been, 14.8 million listeners a week,
[01:07:56.374 --> 01:08:01.337]  And they're going to replace him with Ben, the neocon, never-Trumper, Shapiro.
[01:08:01.337 --> 01:08:03.759]  And they're going after Hannity.
[01:08:03.759 --> 01:08:07.422]  They're going after Tucker.
[01:08:07.422 --> 01:08:10.624]  Inside Fox News, they get called in and chewed out.
[01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:13.726]  They get told, you better become anti-Trump.
[01:08:13.726 --> 01:08:18.850]  Boy, Judge Napolitano, he's gotten... Robert Mueller is the man of ultimate integrity.
[01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:20.431]  Why, the president could be indicted.
[01:08:20.431 --> 01:08:23.113]  He could go to jail, even though the law says you can as a president.
[01:08:25.465 --> 01:08:31.249]  Wow, you really learned who your friends are and who your friends aren't.
[01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:39.075]  But the evil's here, and it got sucker punched by us getting Trump in, and the economy came back for two years, but they flipped the light switch.
[01:08:39.075 --> 01:08:40.136]  Foreigners dump U.S.
[01:08:40.136 --> 01:08:42.657]  Treasuries as they liquidate a record amount of U.S.
[01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:44.038]  stocks.
[01:08:44.038 --> 01:08:49.542]  That's all over the news, in an attempt to punish the American rebellion.
[01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:50.303]  And PewDiePie
[01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:58.991]  It was playing a mass player video game with thousands of players and one of them had the name Rabbi Shekels.
[01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:05.873]  And PewDiePie laughed at somebody else shooting somebody when he was playing on his virtual reality headset.
[01:09:05.873 --> 01:09:11.095]  And so he's got to be taken off the air too because he has 77 million subscribers on one channel.
[01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.716]  Count all the stuff up, over 100 million subscribers.
[01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:17.737]  That's right, he's got to be taken down because he wouldn't get bought by Disney a few years ago.
[01:09:19.471 --> 01:09:21.813]  See, these big corporations can't stand an Infowars.
[01:09:21.813 --> 01:09:27.397]  They can't stand something that had 87 million viewers and listeners the week of the election 2016.
[01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.439]  Bigger than the Super Bowl.
[01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.100]  They can't put up with that, so they have to shut it down.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.201]  And to do it, they have to lie about it.
[01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:37.786]  So, what George Soros funds through Media Matters and these law firms is a fake list of twisted things I never said.
[01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:48.965]  They then send it to so-called journalists who put it in the newspaper, who are really political operatives involved in tortious interference, to then target and harass radio and TV stations to take us off the air.
[01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:54.287]  Well, you should want to put the show on to counter all of that.
[01:09:54.287 --> 01:09:55.527]  You know, Media Matters is so upset.
[01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:59.328]  Their videos get 2,000, 3,000 views.
[01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:02.049]  Ours would get a million on average, so they censored us.
[01:10:04.727 --> 01:10:05.887]  Oh, and PewDiePie's bad.
[01:10:05.887 --> 01:10:09.009]  PewDiePie's bad because we've supported his free speech.
[01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:16.391]  But you know the proof, the Wall Street Journal says is that he wears rimmed glasses, wire rimmed glasses, so did Heinrich Himmler, head of the Waffen-SS.
[01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:19.953]  They don't even use a real Himmler there, though.
[01:10:19.953 --> 01:10:23.234]  They just, because he didn't really even wear glasses that were exactly like that.
[01:10:23.234 --> 01:10:24.314]  They use an actor.
[01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:25.355]  And then it gets worse.
[01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:30.657]  PewDiePie used to have longer hair, back when it was in style, but now he has shorter hair.
[01:10:31.516 --> 01:10:33.257]  That's all the proof I need.
[01:10:33.257 --> 01:10:35.717]  Who knew we were all Nazis, Roger?
[01:10:35.717 --> 01:10:45.021]  The real Nazification, the real digital Nazis are the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Newark Magazine, and all the folks that want to muscle in on anybody who has their own thing.
[01:10:45.021 --> 01:10:47.141]  It's not enough to share revenue with Google.
[01:10:47.141 --> 01:10:52.103]  Now they're going to use their clients in the left to come and say we're these horrible creatures.
[01:10:54.022 --> 01:11:00.945]  And then they maneuver us, either being their political creatures, like late-night comics or now these politicos, or we're taken off the air.
[01:11:00.945 --> 01:11:04.326]  And when that doesn't work, they come after our bank accounts.
[01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:04.926]  They sue us.
[01:11:04.926 --> 01:11:06.447]  And people say, well, then why not give up?
[01:11:06.447 --> 01:11:08.147]  Well, I thought we're Americans.
[01:11:08.147 --> 01:11:09.488]  Our listeners haven't given up.
[01:11:09.488 --> 01:11:12.669]  In fact, they've gotten stronger.
[01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:15.870]  The other proof is he denied being a Nazi and said, I'm not a racist a few years ago.
[01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:17.511]  But he said, hail PewDiePie.
[01:11:19.878 --> 01:11:23.299]  You see, that's how they do this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:23.299 --> 01:11:28.582]  Meanwhile, they're funded by a real Nazi collaborator.
[01:11:28.582 --> 01:11:33.264]  They're funded by a real Nazi collaborator named George Soros.
[01:11:33.264 --> 01:11:39.006]  So, their latest thing is to send letters to radio stations that mean absolutely nothing.
[01:11:39.006 --> 01:11:42.447]  But the radio stations give in to it, you know they're going to be back, because it's all about intimidation.
[01:11:42.447 --> 01:11:45.849]  The left's taking the university tyranny, but there's no free speech expanding it.
[01:11:47.847 --> 01:11:50.951]  And they tell you, oh, better take Alex Jones off the air.
[01:11:50.951 --> 01:11:52.353]  And then here's an example of it.
[01:11:52.353 --> 01:11:54.456]  There's an article on Infowars.com showing it.
[01:11:55.310 --> 01:12:00.853]  Wall Street Journal, The Hill published fake news story about Roger Stone and Infowars.
[01:12:00.853 --> 01:12:15.980]  In the article, Stone says about statements he made on this show and others before he was even an employee here, that he'd heard about this Chinese national who was wanted in China, and that he said something he got from one Trump official was inaccurate.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.641]  They took that out of context and did a quote here.
[01:12:19.599 --> 01:12:23.041]  Where they have him saying that it was irresponsible.
[01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:24.241]  That turns into headlines.
[01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:25.442]  Please show them the Hill article, guys.
[01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:27.263]  Just type in Alex Jones.
[01:12:27.263 --> 01:12:28.163]  It's everywhere.
[01:12:28.163 --> 01:12:30.425]  On the top Twitter trends right now.
[01:12:30.425 --> 01:12:35.387]  That Roger Stone admits he published fake news at InfoWars.
[01:12:35.387 --> 01:12:36.848]  He did no such thing.
[01:12:36.848 --> 01:12:42.531]  We have his actual statement he put out that the lawyers wanted him to put out to drop the $100 million lawsuit.
[01:12:43.388 --> 01:12:43.808]  I don't know.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.844]  Roger Stone, then we're going to go inside the removal, the plan to take Michael Savage off the air in three months and replace him with Ben Shapiro.
[01:13:17.844 --> 01:13:20.745]  But they're easing it in.
[01:13:20.745 --> 01:13:26.467]  They're easing, oh you're going from three hours to one hour, Ben's going to get, oh now Ben gets all your show.
[01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:36.652]  So they're really getting the knives out, obviously Roger to move against Trump, but let's specifically talk about this right now and what you really did say in your clarification.
[01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.313]  Thanks Alex, this is really pretty clear.
[01:13:40.313 --> 01:13:48.081]  I reported a story, one of hundreds I've reported here at InfoWars, regarding the Chinese businessman Miles Kwok.
[01:13:48.081 --> 01:13:52.445]  While many things in that story were correct, a couple of them were incorrect.
[01:13:52.445 --> 01:13:56.830]  But all of the research was supplied to me by Sam Nunberg.
[01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:00.354]  So I made the mistake of relying on the representations
[01:14:00.994 --> 01:14:01.934]  We're good to go.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.962]  I have not paid a hundred million dollars, as you might believe.
[01:14:33.962 --> 01:14:37.905]  In fact, today I can honestly say I have paid nothing.
[01:14:37.905 --> 01:14:48.611]  But again, it is symptomatic of the way they tried to use shards of evidence, shards of information, to discredit you.
[01:14:49.371 --> 01:14:50.371]  Thank you for having me.
[01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:14.978]  But it shows how desperate they are, falsely claiming that I said that there's Martian bases with slave children.
[01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:17.598]  There's no video, no audio, no text, never said it.
[01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:26.281]  Or that I'm currently, they misrepresent what I did say in the past, they twist it, exaggerate it, and say Jones won't stop harassing families at their houses of Sandy Hook.
[01:15:26.661 --> 01:15:29.703]  You know, on the 6th anniversary, Jones sent more people to their houses.
[01:15:29.703 --> 01:15:31.404]  They were saying this the last few days.
[01:15:31.404 --> 01:15:36.166]  Just total crazy lies by the mainstream media as they get more desperate.
[01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:38.328]  Let's talk about how they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[01:15:38.328 --> 01:15:39.488]  That's obvious.
[01:15:39.488 --> 01:15:43.490]  The bizarre things coming out of your good friend Judge Napolitano's mouth.
[01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:53.776]  And then Vox Dei joins us to look inside the creepy, evil, weird, weasel world of the little Harvard leftist darling, Ben Shapiro.
[01:15:53.776 --> 01:15:54.757]  It's all coming up.
[01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:03.631]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:06.672]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.672 --> 01:16:12.593]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.593 --> 01:16:16.374]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.374 --> 01:16:17.634]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.634 --> 01:16:18.974]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:25.176]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.176 --> 01:16:26.616]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:27.702 --> 01:16:28.902]  Hear that?
[01:16:28.902 --> 01:16:34.284]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:34.284 --> 01:16:37.185]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:37.185 --> 01:16:40.767]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:40.767 --> 01:16:48.349]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:16:57.711 --> 01:17:01.555]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[01:17:01.555 --> 01:17:05.279]  It's creating 10.8 billion dollars in new wealth a year.
[01:17:05.279 --> 01:17:09.903]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[01:17:09.903 --> 01:17:15.409]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.
[01:17:15.769 --> 01:17:18.852]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[01:17:18.852 --> 01:17:22.415]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.

[01:17:30.363 --> 01:17:38.330]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel will reveal which cannabis stocks are primed to deliver life-changing windfalls in the weeks and months ahead.
[01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:47.355]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor, backing the hottest startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.

[01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:03.505]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:18:03.505 --> 01:18:08.048]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:18.555]  That's why I am extending the 12 Days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:18.555 --> 01:18:22.418]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:23.939]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:27.162]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:28.243]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:18:28.243 --> 01:18:29.644]  Double Patriot points.
[01:18:29.644 --> 01:18:32.867]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:18:32.867 --> 01:18:37.412]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.873]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:18:38.873 --> 01:18:40.175]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:43.998]  Get your orders in by the 19th so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.760]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.203]  We're extending this sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:18:51.203 --> 01:18:55.866]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globals together.
[01:18:55.866 --> 01:18:58.288]  Thank you.
[01:18:58.288 --> 01:19:04.672]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:19:04.672 --> 01:19:06.233]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:19:06.233 --> 01:19:11.156]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50 to 75% off, double Patriot points.
[01:19:11.156 --> 01:19:14.058]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[01:19:14.598 --> 01:19:17.360]  A free gift with every order.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:26.206]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:19:26.206 --> 01:19:29.868]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:19:29.868 --> 01:19:35.232]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:19:35.232 --> 01:19:37.634]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:44.578]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a lost leader.
[01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:46.138]  We are losing money on this.
[01:19:46.138 --> 01:19:47.579]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:50.921]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.
[01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:55.924]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:55.924 --> 01:20:00.866]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:20:00.866 --> 01:20:03.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.735 --> 01:20:27.643]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.643 --> 01:20:32.266]  I'm having a dance, listen to her howl and growl.
[01:20:32.266 --> 01:20:39.672]  I'm having a detention, begging you to touch and go.
[01:20:39.672 --> 01:20:42.234]  I went to look and found,
[01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:49.376]  Listeners, I'm not complaining.
[01:20:49.376 --> 01:20:53.780]  I chose this fight, and I believe in you, and I believe in America, and I believe in humanity worldwide.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:21:01.747]  But I gotta tell you, we got two days left to get your Christmas orders in and get free shipping, a free t-shirt, 50 to 75% off.
[01:21:01.747 --> 01:21:05.530]  A lot of these we lose money on to clear out our inventory and not pay inventory tax.
[01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:08.592]  But most of these are our best-selling items.
[01:21:08.592 --> 01:21:11.334]  I'm talking about X2, X3, Super Mel Vitality.
[01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:19.138]  I'm talking about Alexa Pure Breeze, that the great company that also creates the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration, the very first gravity-fed system.
[01:21:19.138 --> 01:21:21.059]  They wanted to sell out for the year.
[01:21:21.059 --> 01:21:24.500]  They gave you $127 for a unit that some people sell for $400.
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.301]  They don't normally sell for $240.
[01:21:27.443 --> 01:21:28.544]  It was 127.
[01:21:28.544 --> 01:21:32.766]  Same thing for their four-stage ion filter, the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:21:32.766 --> 01:21:34.807]  It's about to sell out year-end.
[01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:37.549]  Give yourself and your family the gift of clean air in your house.
[01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:38.950]  Give the unit as a present.
[01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:42.232]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:21:42.232 --> 01:21:52.298]  You know, I'll be able to talk about this more tomorrow, but I'm fighting every lawsuit they throw at us, and we've knocked out 17 of the 20.
[01:21:52.298 --> 01:21:55.400]  So they filed a couple more last week, but the news didn't even pick up on that.
[01:21:56.414 --> 01:21:59.435]  So it's a war of attrition, but you've been praying for us, you've been supporting us.
[01:21:59.435 --> 01:22:01.515]  It's all funded by Soros, Hillary.
[01:22:01.515 --> 01:22:05.316]  We got internal documents now of how they're doing it with a U.S.
[01:22:05.316 --> 01:22:06.256]  intelligence agency.
[01:22:06.256 --> 01:22:08.597]  It's going to be a huge scandal when it comes out.
[01:22:08.597 --> 01:22:12.597]  I'm also, in the next week, going to destroy, politically, Ben Shapiro.
[01:22:12.597 --> 01:22:17.418]  I have the dirt, all the proof, everything about who he really is.
[01:22:17.418 --> 01:22:18.479]  Whole nine yards.
[01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:19.619]  Get ready.
[01:22:19.619 --> 01:22:22.459]  And they can't stop me because the information's already been given to others.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.841]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:30.022]  I know everyone from Talk Radio Network.
[01:22:30.022 --> 01:22:32.403]  Everyone, except Art Bell, who's dead.
[01:22:32.403 --> 01:22:34.424]  I know all of it, Ben.
[01:22:34.424 --> 01:22:36.125]  So, get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:37.905]  They're firing Michael Savage.
[01:22:37.905 --> 01:22:42.027]  They're killing him softly, from four hours to three to one this month.
[01:22:42.027 --> 01:22:43.167]  And then he's gone.
[01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:44.148]  He's gone in three months.
[01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:51.591]  And Savage is obviously being told if he talks about it, he won't get his contract paid out.
[01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:56.014]  But this is, I predict Savage is going to go off the reservation.
[01:22:56.014 --> 01:23:00.658]  His lawyer already has in a Washington Times article, Michael Savage being silenced by corporate censorship.
[01:23:00.658 --> 01:23:03.460]  Attorney says, hey, I'm going down swinging here.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.902]  OK, I'm going down swinging.
[01:23:05.902 --> 01:23:06.983]  All right.
[01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:08.884]  You know, the Pepe the Frog thing.
[01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:11.206]  The artist makes a thing with a bunch of images of the campaign.
[01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:13.168]  Little stupid frogs, one of the things on there.
[01:23:13.168 --> 01:23:14.208]  I'm like, yeah, sure, we'll sell it.
[01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:14.769]  People like that.
[01:23:16.104 --> 01:23:17.686]  They sue us and say, give us the money you made.
[01:23:17.686 --> 01:23:19.928]  Well, it was like $27,000.
[01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.710]  But we had to pay the licensing, pay for it.
[01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:24.493]  It was like $15,000 is what we made.
[01:23:24.493 --> 01:23:25.854]  They sent a whole team from California.
[01:23:25.854 --> 01:23:26.655]  They're in there right now.
[01:23:26.655 --> 01:23:28.176]  They're not asking about Pepe the Frog.
[01:23:28.176 --> 01:23:31.880]  They're asking about who owns what, who's behind it, how do you make your money?
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.462]  It's all about taking us down.
[01:23:33.462 --> 01:23:35.084]  It's Hillary Clinton's law firm.
[01:23:35.084 --> 01:23:36.305]  It's a joke.
[01:23:36.305 --> 01:23:39.068]  And they don't know that through this process, we're getting everything.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:52.812]  So, this is total war, but I need everyone to go to Infowarsstore.com and buy some t-shirts, buy some books, buy some videos, buy some non-humor airline seeds, buy some products, because let me tell you, I'm not a wimp, but I don't bitch and complain.
[01:23:52.812 --> 01:23:54.033]  I want to beat these people.
[01:23:54.033 --> 01:23:56.915]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:23:56.915 --> 01:23:58.256]  They took Gavin McGinnis off.
[01:23:58.256 --> 01:24:03.181]  They're taking people off the air every week who have top ratings and are good people.
[01:24:03.181 --> 01:24:06.104]  And we built our own infrastructure knowing this was coming a long time ago.
[01:24:06.946 --> 01:24:15.431]  And so this is like literally David versus Goliath, whatever you want to call it, the Alamo, Masada, whatever you want to call it, folks.
[01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:19.253]  We're up here on the hill, surrounded by enemies, and we're going to fight.
[01:24:19.253 --> 01:24:27.298]  But we need your prayers, your support, and to tell those local stations this is a great opportunity to carry us even more, to stand with America against these lies.
[01:24:28.158 --> 01:24:29.398]  God Almighty!
[01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.259]  I'm ranting, Roger.
[01:24:30.259 --> 01:24:31.039]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:24:31.039 --> 01:24:32.980]  I want to get more into this with you.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:38.121]  But I mean, what do you make of the treachery and the evil and these Fox News hosts turning against Trump?
[01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:41.382]  And Flynn, the judge says, hey, you didn't do anything wrong today.
[01:24:41.382 --> 01:24:43.983]  Just say that you were pressured and I'm not going to give you any time.
[01:24:43.983 --> 01:24:44.903]  Say you're not guilty.
[01:24:44.903 --> 01:24:47.004]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:24:47.004 --> 01:24:50.745]  And Flynn said, no, I'm guilty because they're holding other crap over his head.
[01:24:50.745 --> 01:24:52.046]  And we all know what it is.
[01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:52.806]  It's turkey.
[01:24:52.806 --> 01:24:53.426]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:24:54.713 --> 01:25:00.236]  Well, Alex, first of all, let me say that if I'm with you and Dr. Michael Savage, I'm in damn good company.
[01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:01.497]  But there's no question.
[01:25:01.497 --> 01:25:09.861]  I now understand why it is so centrally important to the globalists and to the two-party political establishment to silence InfoWars.
[01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:11.862]  It was about this moment.
[01:25:11.862 --> 01:25:14.684]  So I am smeared today in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:14.684 --> 01:25:21.748]  They make false accusations about a simple settlement I make regarding one story I report out of hundreds
[01:25:22.248 --> 01:25:32.491]  In which many of the facts were correct, but a few of the facts supplied by Sam Nunberg, who misread a Federal Election Commission report, was incorrect.
[01:25:32.491 --> 01:25:41.413]  So I offer a simple apology, and that is blown up on the internet into, Stone admits that everything he's ever said on InfoWars is a lie.
[01:25:41.413 --> 01:25:44.654]  Well, I never said anything of the kind.
[01:25:44.654 --> 01:25:46.874]  Judge Napolitano, I'm scratching my head.
[01:25:46.874 --> 01:25:49.375]  This guy is one of my oldest and dearest friends.
[01:25:49.935 --> 01:25:55.919]  It was me who recommended to Governor Tom Kaine that he appoint Andrew Napolitano to the bench.
[01:25:55.919 --> 01:26:01.122]  And until recently, he was one of the most articulate critics of the Mueller investigation.
[01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:12.670]  Now, suddenly, he thinks Mueller is without blemishes and that Donald Trump can be indicted for something that is not even a crime, according to the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission.
[01:26:13.212 --> 01:26:15.093]  What have they got on the judge?
[01:26:15.093 --> 01:26:16.833]  What are they hanging over his head?
[01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:20.795]  I don't know, but something here just doesn't seem right.
[01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.725]  Yeah, there's widespread speculation.
[01:26:31.725 --> 01:26:37.587]  As you know, somebody is fighting a subpoena that has been levied by Mr. Mueller.
[01:26:37.587 --> 01:26:39.668]  And that whole matter is sealed.
[01:26:39.668 --> 01:26:49.892]  When there was a hearing on this in a federal courthouse two days ago, they cleared the entire floor so that nobody could even see who the attorneys were who came and went.
[01:26:49.892 --> 01:26:51.313]  Widespread speculation.
[01:26:51.753 --> 01:27:02.821]  Unconfirmed is that that may be former Fox News personality James Rosen, a good friend of Judge Napolitano's, also a good friend of mine.
[01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:14.069]  It was from Rosen to Napolitano to Charles Hortel that I got a tip, incorrect as it turns out, that the WikiLeaks disclosures would regard the Clinton Foundation.
[01:27:14.509 --> 01:27:16.311]  And I said that publicly.
[01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:18.212]  It came from a perfectly legal source.
[01:27:18.212 --> 01:27:18.872]  Sure, exactly.
[01:27:18.872 --> 01:27:20.994]  So what's going on with Flynn?
[01:27:20.994 --> 01:27:24.997]  The judges, basically today, I was just watching Fox during the break, they said, hey, you can go free.
[01:27:24.997 --> 01:27:25.738]  We know you didn't do anything.
[01:27:25.738 --> 01:27:27.079]  Why are you pleading guilty?
[01:27:27.079 --> 01:27:30.741]  Just say that they didn't read your rights or warn you, which they did, then I'll let you go.
[01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:32.263]  Why are you going to say you're guilty?
[01:27:32.263 --> 01:27:33.383]  And Flynn said, I'm guilty.
[01:27:33.383 --> 01:27:34.604]  Let's get this over with.
[01:27:34.604 --> 01:27:36.686]  That tells me they're holding some more stuff over his head.
[01:27:39.795 --> 01:27:40.976]  Prosecute his son.
[01:27:40.976 --> 01:27:42.798]  That's what I believe the matter is.
[01:27:42.798 --> 01:27:46.561]  Look, I think General Flynn is a great patriot.
[01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:51.625]  And I think this story is a great tragedy and an extraordinary overreach.
[01:27:51.625 --> 01:27:56.970]  It's a perfect example of what happens when they have no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:03.756]  So now we invent perjury traps and process crimes in an attempt to take down those around the president.
[01:28:04.136 --> 01:28:09.000]  General Flynn exposed what the Clintons and the Obamas were doing in the Middle East.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.402]  He exposed the falsity of the Arab Spring.
[01:28:12.402 --> 01:28:15.384]  And that made him a target for the deep state.
[01:28:15.384 --> 01:28:17.065]  My heart goes out to him today.
[01:28:17.065 --> 01:28:22.730]  He is clearly a man who should have moved in court to withdraw his guilty plea.
[01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:23.890]  But you're right, Alex.
[01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:25.892]  Something is being held over his head.
[01:28:27.045 --> 01:28:32.387]  You're going to be in studio Thursday and Friday co-hosting with myself, Owen Schroyer, David Knight, and more.
[01:28:32.387 --> 01:28:34.568]  It's the ATX, the new Alamo.
[01:28:34.568 --> 01:28:41.471]  Whether we go down or stand, we're going to send shockwaves throughout eternity with our fight, and we're going to beat the globalists in the end.
[01:28:41.471 --> 01:28:44.193]  It's hard for us that are in the leadership, but we need your prayers.
[01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:47.194]  We need your financial support at infowarestore.com.
[01:28:47.194 --> 01:28:47.914]  Get in there.

[01:29:27.379 --> 01:29:31.241]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:36.223]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[01:29:47.527 --> 01:29:48.087]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:48.087 --> 01:29:50.388]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:03.570]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:08.133]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:18.640]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.503]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:30:22.503 --> 01:30:24.024]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:30:24.804 --> 01:30:27.227]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[01:30:27.227 --> 01:30:28.328]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:30:28.328 --> 01:30:29.710]  Double Patriot points.
[01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:32.954]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:30:32.954 --> 01:30:37.479]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:30:37.479 --> 01:30:38.940]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.242]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:30:40.242 --> 01:30:42.004]  Get your orders in by the 19th.
[01:30:42.004 --> 01:30:44.066]  You're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:30:44.807 --> 01:30:46.828]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:30:46.828 --> 01:30:51.269]  We're extending this sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:30:51.269 --> 01:30:55.930]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globals together.
[01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:58.511]  Thank you.
[01:30:58.511 --> 01:30:59.851]  Everybody knows it.
[01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:01.752]  History documents it.
[01:31:01.752 --> 01:31:05.033]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history.
[01:31:05.825 --> 01:31:07.326]  That wants to hurt children.
[01:31:07.326 --> 01:31:08.447]  They want to abort children.
[01:31:08.447 --> 01:31:10.209]  They want to disease children.
[01:31:10.209 --> 01:31:11.330]  They want to abuse children.
[01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:12.952]  They want to confuse children.
[01:31:12.952 --> 01:31:14.133]  They want their essence.
[01:31:14.133 --> 01:31:15.074]  They want their soul.
[01:31:15.074 --> 01:31:16.415]  They want their spirit.
[01:31:16.415 --> 01:31:18.176]  They want their power.
[01:31:18.176 --> 01:31:20.418]  Because they are our future.
[01:31:20.418 --> 01:31:23.922]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[01:31:23.922 --> 01:31:25.904]  It is about the West.
[01:31:25.904 --> 01:31:30.067]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:31.609]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[01:31:32.822 --> 01:31:39.524]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for Infowars.
[01:31:39.524 --> 01:31:43.325]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[01:31:43.325 --> 01:31:45.386]  You have the power to override the censors.
[01:31:45.386 --> 01:31:49.067]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[01:31:49.067 --> 01:31:57.550]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.533 --> 01:32:07.578]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.578 --> 01:32:08.918]  We've been proven dead on.
[01:32:08.918 --> 01:32:12.780]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.402]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[01:32:17.402 --> 01:32:18.463]  Words are not enough.
[01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:25.475]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[01:32:25.475 --> 01:32:31.239]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[01:32:31.239 --> 01:32:35.662]  They've created their Tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[01:32:35.662 --> 01:32:37.583]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:37.583 --> 01:32:41.606]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:42.171 --> 01:32:47.853]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[01:32:47.853 --> 01:33:01.939]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[01:33:01.939 --> 01:33:04.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.448 --> 01:33:24.117]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:24.117 --> 01:33:28.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:38.149]  And by every time you retweet one of these things, or every time you promote this idea, you're promoting ignorance, racism, genocide,
[01:33:39.242 --> 01:33:41.023]  Anti-Semitism?
[01:33:41.023 --> 01:33:46.766]  These are all things that you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes PewDiePie.
[01:33:46.766 --> 01:33:48.507]  So be careful about this.
[01:33:48.507 --> 01:33:54.089]  If someone decided to... If something were to happen and PewDiePie were to be sued for this, you could be complicit.
[01:33:54.089 --> 01:33:57.491]  If you retweet it, they could make you pay a fine as well.
[01:33:57.491 --> 01:34:01.173]  Because you have officially published anti-Semitic things.
[01:34:01.986 --> 01:34:05.788]  So if you are republishing this stuff, you could get in trouble for it.
[01:34:05.788 --> 01:34:08.149]  Be very aware that that is a real thing.
[01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:09.549]  You sound a lot like PewDiePie.
[01:34:09.549 --> 01:34:13.351]  I'm of course skeptical, because I've been on the internet for a while.
[01:34:13.351 --> 01:34:15.552]  I've been on the internet for a while.
[01:34:15.552 --> 01:34:19.133]  I'm just gonna say, hey man, I really appreciate your content.
[01:34:19.133 --> 01:34:25.616]  You've gotten me through some tough times, and I respect the f*** out of you.
[01:34:25.616 --> 01:34:27.797]  I didn't say anything.
[01:34:28.559 --> 01:34:29.040]  Oh no!
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.582]  You just shot him!
[01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:33.064]  Oh good job!
[01:34:33.064 --> 01:34:34.266]  Come back here!
[01:34:44.619 --> 01:34:47.460]  If you're a radio listener, you're like, what was I just listening to the last minute?
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:52.161]  If you're a TV viewer, you're like, okay, I see a, looks like an 8th or 9th grade class.
[01:34:52.161 --> 01:35:03.904]  It's a school teacher saying, if you go to PewDiePie's YouTube channel with close to 100 million subscribers and 100 billion views, that you're a bad person, and you're a Nazi, and you're involved in genocide.
[01:35:03.904 --> 01:35:05.585]  Talk about defamation!
[01:35:05.585 --> 01:35:10.246]  This is what they teach in schools all over the Western world about PewDiePie, Alex Jones, Donald Trump.
[01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:13.067]  They teach in journalism class all these incredible lies about us.
[01:35:14.196 --> 01:35:25.119]  And meanwhile, they've got the left attacking, but they've got the neocons from the Weekly Standard going under, a National Review that famously were designed to control the conservative movement.
[01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:27.019]  That's been declassified.
[01:35:27.019 --> 01:35:28.760]  And they've got Ben Shapiro.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.820]  And everybody knows I'm not an infighter.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.561]  I love Sean Hannity overall.
[01:35:32.561 --> 01:35:34.121]  I love Tucker Carlson.
[01:35:34.121 --> 01:35:35.321]  I love Matt Drudge.
[01:35:35.321 --> 01:35:37.182]  I love all the other talk show hosts.
[01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:40.131]  That care about America.
[01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:54.221]  They're not perfect, I'm not perfect, but someone that has been popping up in my life, since I heard about him from talk radio network host, and not just Michael Savage, I heard about him from other people, and I used to not even care.
[01:35:54.221 --> 01:35:56.362]  I'm like, why are you calling me up?
[01:35:56.362 --> 01:35:58.824]  They're not so much Savage, but he'd bring it up too.
[01:35:58.824 --> 01:36:03.047]  Other big host, about this horrible little snot-nosed young lawyer that everyone hated.
[01:36:04.147 --> 01:36:08.789]  And they tell me all these stories, and I've got a good memory, so we're talking 15 years later?
[01:36:08.789 --> 01:36:10.030]  Yeah, Shapiro's been around that long.
[01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:18.554]  10 years later, you're sitting there going, well, what's going on with Roy Masters and the guy that owned Talk Radio Network?
[01:36:18.554 --> 01:36:21.776]  That's where Shapiro, according to all those people, comes from.
[01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:22.636]  I'm not paying attention to him.
[01:36:22.636 --> 01:36:25.577]  He pops up at WorldNet daily, you know, 10, 12 years ago.
[01:36:25.577 --> 01:36:29.059]  Vox Day knows him pretty well, mentors him.
[01:36:29.059 --> 01:36:32.341]  And then starts saying a few years ago, hey, this dude's really bad news.
[01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:36.465]  It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi figures out Darth Vader's bad.
[01:36:36.465 --> 01:36:42.409]  And so I appreciate him coming on in a rush today because I knew about this, but I hadn't really been paying attention.
[01:36:42.409 --> 01:36:45.071]  I'm so busy keeping Infowars going under attack.
[01:36:45.071 --> 01:36:51.875]  It comes out in the Washington Times that Michael Savage, even though he has the highest ratings ever, is going from three hours to one hour.
[01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:54.177]  And he basically says, it looks like they're taking me off the air.
[01:36:54.177 --> 01:36:56.758]  They're going to pay out my contract in one hour.
[01:36:56.758 --> 01:36:59.100]  Others then predict around him, I'm not going to say him,
[01:37:00.327 --> 01:37:02.208]  That he'll just be off in three months.
[01:37:02.208 --> 01:37:04.089]  So they're killing him softly.
[01:37:04.089 --> 01:37:05.730]  And who are they replacing him with?
[01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:14.515]  Ben Shapiro, who's never really done talk radio other than being a guest, is literally being put in his place with his audiences on these stations.
[01:37:14.515 --> 01:37:19.878]  And again, it's so crazy because Savage would always bring up Shapiro and how much he hates him.
[01:37:19.878 --> 01:37:22.460]  I would talk bad about Shapiro and he would call me.
[01:37:23.479 --> 01:37:26.742]  And tell me, oh my God, you don't know how bad he is.
[01:37:26.742 --> 01:37:28.403]  And then now I tried to call Savage this morning.
[01:37:28.403 --> 01:37:29.524]  He said, I can't talk about it.
[01:37:29.524 --> 01:37:31.265]  You know, it's lawyer stuff.
[01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:32.486]  I just can't discuss it.
[01:37:32.486 --> 01:37:34.988]  But his lawyers are in the news.
[01:37:34.988 --> 01:37:39.512]  But the stuff he told me years ago, and again, I wasn't like into gossip.
[01:37:39.512 --> 01:37:41.093]  And Savage is not a gossiper either.
[01:37:41.093 --> 01:37:42.494]  I'm like, okay, yeah, whatever.
[01:37:42.494 --> 01:37:43.375]  Let's talk about the New World Order.
[01:37:45.836 --> 01:38:14.522]  The stuff he told me then started clicking this morning what the other host told me and I'm gonna make some calls but my god folks Ben Shapiro is a maniac loon and then he gets these scripts he puts out and they all call him a genius on the left he's an ever trumper this is Glenn Beck 2.0 man and I'm telling you it's like the Godzilla movies when one big monster comes to get Godzilla and can't beat him one even twice as worse comes out of the ocean and this is it folks so Vox Dei
[01:38:15.876 --> 01:38:30.740]  I'm so against infighting, which he doesn't do, and I respect his work, I've known him for a decade, best-selling author, also invented comic book producer, that I'm just like, no, I don't want Vox Dei on, even though he doesn't do interviews, he does our show, about how bad Shapiro is.
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.041]  I just, I don't want to be that person.
[01:38:32.041 --> 01:38:32.861]  But now I realize...
[01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:40.829]  Just like Glenn Beck was in the position of sabotaging us off radio stations and behind the scenes, these are leftist folks and they're very dangerous.
[01:38:40.829 --> 01:38:42.691]  So Vox, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:43.892]  You've got Jordanetics out.
[01:38:43.892 --> 01:38:46.495]  We're selling it at infowarestore.com for Christmas.
[01:38:46.495 --> 01:38:47.135]  Everybody should get it.
[01:38:47.135 --> 01:38:50.098]  We'll tell people about that in a moment because this is the double-headed
[01:38:51.119 --> 01:38:55.761]  Creature coming out of the ocean in America right now because they don't want to just defeat the opposition.
[01:38:55.761 --> 01:39:15.290]  They want to lead it So this is 2.0 controlled opposition give us your analysis in this segment and the next I know you got to go then on what we're really facing with Ben Shapiro because the real takeaway here is Michael Savage is being taken off the air for being number one and replaced with him and They're trying to hold him down with threats of legal action.
[01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:18.552]  Not just the money if he if he squirms just like
[01:39:19.592 --> 01:39:20.813]  Gavin McGinnis last week.
[01:39:20.813 --> 01:39:23.174]  I mean, this means they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[01:39:23.174 --> 01:39:25.296]  Go ahead.
[01:39:25.296 --> 01:39:28.498]  Yeah, well, I should probably give you a little bit of background.
[01:39:28.498 --> 01:39:33.941]  I've known Ben Shapiro for 16 years, I believe.
[01:39:33.941 --> 01:39:37.403]  We were both contributors at World Net Daily.
[01:39:37.403 --> 01:39:48.690]  And what was interesting to me was that Ben was quite young, of course, and he never wrote anything except for
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.521]  And this is at WorldNetDaily.
[01:40:17.321 --> 01:40:22.783]  Yeah, this is at WorldNetDaily back in 2003-2004, that time frame.
[01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:36.069]  And back around that time frame, I got nationally syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, which was the elite press syndicate.
[01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:40.030]  Ben got syndicated by Creator Syndicate, which
[01:40:41.912 --> 01:40:49.898]  Had this way of pushing people by telling newspapers that if you want one of our popular columnists, you need to take one of the less popular ones.
[01:40:49.898 --> 01:40:53.120]  And they started pushing him really hard.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:56.783]  Remember, this is back in like 2003 2004 timeframe.
[01:40:56.783 --> 01:41:02.087]  And it was interesting because Ben ended up having a crisis of conscience.
[01:41:02.087 --> 01:41:07.431]  And he sent me some emails and said, Hey, you know, I've never had a I've never had an original thought for myself.
[01:41:08.386 --> 01:41:13.129]  All I'm doing is repeating the talking points that people are giving me.
[01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:17.131]  You know, what do you think I should do?
[01:41:17.131 --> 01:41:22.674]  And I told him, look, you know, you need to decide for yourself what you want to be.
[01:41:22.674 --> 01:41:27.156]  Do you want to be your own voice or do you want to be someone else's voice?
[01:41:27.156 --> 01:41:34.860]  And in retrospect, it's very clear that he decided to take the wide and easy path.
[01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:44.270]  And that's why you're seeing him promoted incessantly because he's nothing but a talking puppet.
[01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:52.591]  And that's why you see him aligning with people like Dave Rubin, people like Jordan Peterson.
[01:41:52.591 --> 01:42:02.533]  All of these figures are being pushed forward and propped up because they are meant to be the official approved opposition.
[01:42:03.675 --> 01:42:24.552]  Because the left wing wants to publicly oppose itself, thereby depriving, you know, moving the Overton window to the left and depriving the genuine opposition, which can be anyone from Rush Limbaugh to Mike Cernovich to you and so forth.
[01:42:24.552 --> 01:42:29.757]  They want to deprive the genuine nationalist opposition of any voice in the media.
[01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:48.242]  And so that's why you're seeing Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson talk about setting up an alternative to Patreon, because you've got the hard SJW globalist left, and they're trying to set up a near-left fake opposition.
[01:42:48.242 --> 01:42:56.147]  And they're going to gatekeep as well, because that's what I've always noticed about Shapiro, is back from his days controlling talk radio as well, very young when they got him out of Harvard.
[01:42:58.143 --> 01:43:02.847]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:43:57.290 --> 01:44:01.254]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.254 --> 01:44:04.537]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:10.823]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.823 --> 01:44:13.585]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.326 --> 01:44:18.127]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:24.609]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.609 --> 01:44:29.571]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.327 --> 01:44:34.250]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:41.457]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.457 --> 01:44:46.141]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.141 --> 01:44:52.366]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.366 --> 01:44:56.330]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.154 --> 01:45:04.542]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:45:04.542 --> 01:45:06.104]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:45:06.104 --> 01:45:11.011]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:13.935]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:17.216]  A free gift with every order.
[01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:26.078]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:45:26.078 --> 01:45:29.739]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:45:29.739 --> 01:45:35.100]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.481]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:45:38.021 --> 01:45:42.903]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.443]  So this is a lost leader.
[01:45:44.443 --> 01:45:46.024]  We are losing money on this.
[01:45:46.024 --> 01:45:47.444]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:45:47.444 --> 01:45:49.445]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:45:49.445 --> 01:45:50.765]  And don't fight the crowds.

[01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:17.605]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:47:30.789 --> 01:47:31.870]  All right, Vox Day.
[01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:37.574]  It's a very successful, best-selling author, syndicated columnist.
[01:47:37.574 --> 01:47:44.318]  He's also just published Jordanetics, A Journey into the Mind of Humanity's Greatest Thinker.
[01:47:44.318 --> 01:47:46.200]  And of course, that's sarcastic.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:53.765]  Dealing with Jordan Peterson, how the left has embraced him by actually saying, oh, he's so intellectual, so then the right thinks, oh my gosh, he must be God.
[01:47:53.765 --> 01:47:55.206]  This is how they control reality.
[01:47:56.437 --> 01:47:58.218]  We also have all the Alt Hero comics.
[01:47:58.218 --> 01:48:00.059]  They have one through five now out.
[01:48:00.059 --> 01:48:02.600]  We have them in stock at mpulwarestore.com.

[01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:45.214]  Every stocking for young people especially needs Alt Hero, London Calling, The War in Paris which this came out
[01:48:46.246 --> 01:48:48.634]  Six months ago and it's all come true.
[01:48:48.634 --> 01:48:50.178]  As Vox predicted, he lives in Europe.
[01:48:50.178 --> 01:48:51.583]  Smart cookie.

[01:49:03.491 --> 01:49:07.572]  And we need the funding, because we're kicking their butt, but they are gunning for us.
[01:49:07.572 --> 01:49:15.374]  Like we're a big battleship in World War I, winning a major battle at sea, but we've got all their attack frigates aimed at us, and their cruisers, and we're on fire.
[01:49:16.547 --> 01:49:19.288]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone knows I'm out of gossip about other talk show hosts.
[01:49:19.288 --> 01:49:22.168]  I'm not one of these men that can't handle somebody else being successful.
[01:49:22.168 --> 01:49:25.589]  In fact, I would love to support Ben Shapiro.
[01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:31.331]  But I have just confirmed, when I was told by three talk show hosts, that I ignored because I'm not into this.
[01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.391]  And these people never gossip.
[01:49:32.391 --> 01:49:34.892]  They brought up Ben Shapiro years ago.
[01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:46.010]  And I will tell you Michael Savage again calls me sometimes and he, when I attack Shapiro, and he is shaking with anger about him and the things he's told me are unbelievable.
[01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:54.038]  And then I went, wait a minute, it hit me this morning, I went, oh my God, two other big hosts told me stuff even worse.
[01:49:54.038 --> 01:49:58.262]  One of these people told me how they wanted to beat him to death.
[01:49:58.262 --> 01:50:00.504]  Now, this is a respected talk show host.
[01:50:01.403 --> 01:50:03.223]  And it just made me think.
[01:50:03.223 --> 01:50:04.364]  So you were a mentor to him.
[01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:05.744]  You were one of the top guys at World Net Daily.
[01:50:05.744 --> 01:50:06.344]  Let's go back.
[01:50:06.344 --> 01:50:09.304]  You knew him when he was just going to college before he went to Harvard.
[01:50:09.304 --> 01:50:10.525]  And I know I'm running over you.
[01:50:10.525 --> 01:50:17.026]  It's just it's just it's so insane how this is all coming together, Vox, and just how dangerous this guy is.
[01:50:17.026 --> 01:50:29.428]  Well, the thing is, I called him out back in 2005 when he was of an age to join the military and he was running around saying that the U.S.
[01:50:29.428 --> 01:50:31.068]  should establish an empire.
[01:50:31.952 --> 01:50:42.556]  His literal words on August 11, 2005 were, no one said empire was easy, but it is right and good, both for Americans and for the world.
[01:50:42.556 --> 01:50:50.580]  And what he was calling for was an invasion of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Pakistan, and others.
[01:50:52.711 --> 01:50:58.353]  Yeah, I mean, what you have to understand about the neocons is that they are not merely left-wing.
[01:50:58.353 --> 01:51:03.735]  They are the left-wing opponents of Joseph Stalin.
[01:51:03.735 --> 01:51:07.437]  They're the students of Trotsky, Leon Trotsky.
[01:51:07.437 --> 01:51:15.460]  And they came to the United States after Stalin defeated Trotsky and essentially kicked most of his followers out.
[01:51:16.767 --> 01:51:36.876]  And so they realized that they couldn't make much traction in the Democratic Party, so they reinvented themselves as fake conservatives, literally neo-conservatives, and they attempted to control the Republican Party, which John Podhoretz himself admitted was the purpose of the Weekly Standard, which, as you know, recently failed.
[01:51:38.382 --> 01:51:54.783]  Their whole point has been to gatekeep and redirect the Republican Party and the American people away from nationalism, away from America first, and away from Christianity.
[01:51:55.868 --> 01:51:59.713]  So simply put, Ben Shapiro is a dyed-in-the-wool, third-generation, fourth-generation Trotskyite.
[01:52:15.948 --> 01:52:17.488]  There's no question about this.
[01:52:17.488 --> 01:52:19.929]  There's no question about this whatsoever.
[01:52:19.929 --> 01:52:23.070]  And you see him get called out occasionally.
[01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:35.233]  He runs around saying that everyone who is racist and bigoted should be disemployed and they should be hunted down and thrown out of their jobs.
[01:52:35.233 --> 01:52:40.255]  And then at the same time, he turns around and says, well, I don't care about the browning of America.
[01:52:40.255 --> 01:52:40.735]  I don't care.
[01:52:41.135 --> 01:52:42.656]  If Americans are replaced?
[01:52:42.656 --> 01:52:49.960]  I mean, he sounds exactly like Bill Kristol and John Podhoretz and all the other fake... Well, no, he says Americans are lazy.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:52.942]  He's an acolyte of Mr. Kristol.
[01:52:52.942 --> 01:52:54.362]  Precisely.
[01:52:54.362 --> 01:53:00.946]  So really, Ben Shapiro is Kristol and his father's, who was the head of the Trotskyites, revenge.
[01:53:00.946 --> 01:53:08.731]  And that's why they have a hard-on for Russia, is that they went in, they took over Russia, they got kicked out, these globalists, these atheists, and
[01:53:10.616 --> 01:53:14.579]  And now they're angry, and that's why they hate Russia so much.
[01:53:14.579 --> 01:53:19.622]  Well yeah, what people tend to forget about Stalin is that Stalin was a nationalist.
[01:53:19.622 --> 01:53:21.543]  He wasn't Russian, he was Georgian.
[01:53:21.543 --> 01:53:25.105]  But he had no interest in world revolution.
[01:53:25.105 --> 01:53:26.926]  And, whereas Trotsky did.
[01:53:26.926 --> 01:53:36.192]  And so, they got kicked out by Stalin, and then after the fall of the wall, they managed to worm their way back in.
[01:53:36.192 --> 01:53:37.613]  But Putin kicked them out again.
[01:53:38.405 --> 01:53:46.614]  And so that's why the neocons hate Putin and Russia so much, is because Putin is a Russian nationalist.
[01:53:46.614 --> 01:53:56.225]  And so the nationalists of any stripe, as you know, and you've talked about this before, the real struggle is no longer left-right ideological, it's actually
[01:53:57.219 --> 01:54:03.786]  Globalist vs. Nationalist on the material level, God vs. Satan, Jesus vs. Satan on the spiritual level.
[01:54:03.786 --> 01:54:09.873]  And that's why even the WikiLeaks shows Soros wants to overthrow Israel because it's National vs. Globalist.
[01:54:11.235 --> 01:54:11.776]  Exactly.
[01:54:11.776 --> 01:54:26.569]  You know, when you look at Israeli parties like Zihut and the other Israeli nationalists, they have no interest in ruling over Ukraine or getting involved in Russia or China.
[01:54:26.569 --> 01:54:29.632]  That's not part of the Israeli nationalist program.
[01:54:29.632 --> 01:54:37.479]  Now that there is a Jewish homeland, the Israelis want to focus on building it up just like any other
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.641]  And it's an absolute fact that the Trotskyites, as you know, and it's been even quoted in the Wall Street Journal, they admitted it years ago,
[01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:10.228]  That they wanted to basically take over the conservative movement because it was blocking communism, but use it to take back over Russia and then the world.
[01:55:10.228 --> 01:55:19.696]  They just saw America as a bigger vehicle for global domination, as you said, because Stalin, for all of his horrible things he did, was trying to make Russia an industrialized power.
[01:55:20.776 --> 01:55:24.938]  So he's very czarist or Putin-esque in that vein.
[01:55:24.938 --> 01:55:29.760]  And so that's why the left went from hating, from loving him to hating Uncle Joe.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.741]  And of course, you were saying Peterson's much more dangerous.
[01:55:31.741 --> 01:55:40.965]  And I was not disagreeing with you, but I thought, I'm telling you, they're pushing Shapiro on YouTube, Google, the algorithms, and he's behind the scenes trying to take me off the air.
[01:55:40.965 --> 01:55:45.006]  And I said, whatever network Beck's involved with, this is the new guy.
[01:55:45.006 --> 01:55:48.028]  And now Michael Savage is being taken off the air.
[01:55:49.048 --> 01:55:50.609]  And replaced with this guy.
[01:55:50.609 --> 01:55:55.172]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:55:55.172 --> 01:56:01.757]  Yeah, it's astonishing, especially when you look at the fact that Savage is the number two most popular radio host in the country.
[01:56:01.757 --> 01:56:03.718]  This clearly is not a business decision.
[01:56:03.718 --> 01:56:07.681]  This clearly is something that is being done for other reasons.
[01:56:07.681 --> 01:56:08.462]  And we know what they are.
[01:56:08.462 --> 01:56:10.483]  You know, it's the same reason that, I mean,
[01:56:10.683 --> 01:56:15.665]  I mean, what you have to understand is Ben Shapiro is a total mediocrity.
[01:56:15.665 --> 01:56:17.846]  He's not particularly smart.
[01:56:17.846 --> 01:56:27.830]  No, he's a little man, he has scripted lines, and then the left appraises him, and the establishment appraises him, and conservatives go, here's a guy we can get behind and not get friction.
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:31.431]  Yeah, because you just let the fox in the damn hen house.
[01:56:31.431 --> 01:56:35.493]  Yeah, it's exactly like the Harlem Globetrotters versus the Washington Generals.
[01:56:37.233 --> 01:56:52.361]  The left, the conventional left that everybody recognizes is the Harlem Globetrotters, and then Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, all these, the intellectual dark web as the New York Times.
[01:56:52.361 --> 01:56:54.262]  Joe Rogan's now joined it.
[01:56:54.262 --> 01:56:55.523]  Joe Rogan too.
[01:56:55.523 --> 01:57:01.446]  They are all set up to be the Washington generals so they can go out there, convince
[01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:06.214]  As much of the right as possible to follow them into defeat.
[01:57:06.214 --> 01:57:07.375]  That's what they're there to do.
[01:57:07.375 --> 01:57:11.199]  They're there to gatekeep and mislead and lead.
[01:57:12.964 --> 01:57:17.087]  The right and lead the nationalists and lead the Christians into defeat.
[01:57:17.087 --> 01:57:19.648]  That's why, I mean, think about how ridiculous it is.
[01:57:19.648 --> 01:57:25.091]  Yeah, look at how the New York Times shows Joe Rogan and Shapiro and all of them in a big flattery piece.
[01:57:25.091 --> 01:57:26.572]  These are the OK conservatives.
[01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:27.052]  These are the ones.
[01:57:27.052 --> 01:57:29.194]  Yeah, maybe they're a little bad, but you know what?
[01:57:29.194 --> 01:57:29.834]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:57:29.834 --> 01:57:31.035]  I know the inside baseball on that.
[01:57:31.035 --> 01:57:33.196]  Do five more with us, Fox, for even longer if you can.
[01:57:33.196 --> 01:57:34.997]  And we've got Owen Schroer coming on with big breaking news.
[01:57:34.997 --> 01:57:36.418]  This is not about gossip.
[01:57:36.418 --> 01:57:39.860]  It's not about, no, it's about understanding how the globalists are trying to take us down.
[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:40.961]  And there's now no doubt.
[01:57:41.957 --> 01:57:47.360]  And I can't believe that I've been sitting on top of the bombshell on Shapiro that I will release soon.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:55.745]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.745 --> 01:57:57.206]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.206 --> 01:58:01.908]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:04.990]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at InfoWareStore.com,
[01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:07.152]  I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.152 --> 01:58:27.311]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:31.796]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.796 --> 01:58:35.480]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:40.466]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.466 --> 01:58:43.189]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:44.571]  Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:44.571 --> 01:58:46.073]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.939 --> 01:58:53.403]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[01:58:53.403 --> 01:58:57.946]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[01:58:57.946 --> 01:59:08.455]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:08.455 --> 01:59:12.318]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[01:59:12.318 --> 01:59:13.839]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:17.042]  50 to 75% off is back.
[01:59:17.042 --> 01:59:18.123]  Free shipping is still there.
[01:59:18.123 --> 01:59:19.524]  Double Patriot points.
[01:59:19.524 --> 01:59:22.767]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[01:59:22.767 --> 01:59:27.291]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:59:27.291 --> 01:59:28.772]  Just go check out the sales.
[01:59:28.772 --> 01:59:30.093]  There's too many to break them all down.
[01:59:30.093 --> 01:59:33.876]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[01:59:34.617 --> 01:59:36.638]  And thank you again all for your support.
[01:59:36.638 --> 01:59:41.099]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:59:41.099 --> 01:59:45.760]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:51.362]  Thank you.
[01:59:51.362 --> 01:59:57.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.904 --> 02:00:01.325]  Breakfast where the news is spread.
[02:00:15.061 --> 02:00:19.705]  It's all over.
[02:00:19.705 --> 02:00:25.791]  For the unknown soldier.
[02:00:25.791 --> 02:00:26.812]  Alright, Vox stays with us.
[02:00:26.812 --> 02:00:28.994]  Two more segments and then Owen Schloer is coming in.
[02:00:28.994 --> 02:00:31.456]  Loaded for bear.
[02:00:31.456 --> 02:00:34.939]  Again, I have just... I don't focus on Ben Shapiro.
[02:00:34.939 --> 02:00:36.301]  I do my own thing covering the Globalist.
[02:00:37.185 --> 02:00:40.928]  But man, man, have all the planets aligned on this guy.
[02:00:40.928 --> 02:00:43.730]  It's kind of like Darth Vader when he's got somebody in target sight.
[02:00:43.730 --> 02:00:44.851]  I mean, it's like on.
[02:00:50.345 --> 02:00:53.086]  Man, I tell you, they really know how to pick them.
[02:00:53.086 --> 02:01:01.088]  Getting back to Vox Day, talk show host, best-selling author of the new book, Jordan Nettix, A Journey into the Mind of Humanity's Greatest Thinker.
[02:01:01.088 --> 02:01:02.068]  I read it a few weeks ago.
[02:01:02.068 --> 02:01:03.748]  We sell it at infowarstore.com.
[02:01:03.748 --> 02:01:04.548]  Everybody should order this.
[02:01:04.548 --> 02:01:06.749]  You've got two days to get your orders in before Christmas.
[02:01:06.749 --> 02:01:11.350]  And his alt-hero comic book series for adults and children is super politically incorrect and awesome.
[02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:12.510]  And give them the Globals to run for their money.
[02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:18.592]  Vox, continuing here, we'll get into other points about him, but then after the break,
[02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:21.727]  Clearly they're trying to take everybody off the air now.
[02:01:21.727 --> 02:01:22.647]  It's hit fever pitch.
[02:01:22.647 --> 02:01:23.648]  Now it's everybody.
[02:01:23.648 --> 02:01:25.890]  I was first.
[02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.351]  Michael Savage, all of it.
[02:01:27.351 --> 02:01:28.752]  They're gunning for Tucker Carlson.
[02:01:28.752 --> 02:01:31.534]  They're gunning for... They're going for broke.
[02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:35.677]  That means that there's a big event about to happen.
[02:01:35.677 --> 02:01:37.878]  Well, you would tend to think so.
[02:01:37.878 --> 02:01:43.643]  It's really kind of remarkable to see the extent to which the deplatforming is taking place.
[02:01:43.643 --> 02:01:45.564]  Obviously, I've experienced an amount of it.
[02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:47.145]  You've experienced quite a bit of it.
[02:01:48.897 --> 02:01:53.721]  But the thing is, is that this is only going to make us stronger in the long run.
[02:01:53.721 --> 02:01:55.463]  The weak sisters are going to fall out.
[02:01:55.463 --> 02:02:07.673]  You know, to a certain extent, it's our own fault for allowing ourselves to make use of the platforms that belong to people who consider themselves our enemies.
[02:02:07.673 --> 02:02:10.055]  And so, but there's a lot of ways to hit back.
[02:02:10.055 --> 02:02:16.321]  You know, I mean, we literally, we got deplatformed by a crowdfunding site and
[02:02:17.268 --> 02:02:24.031]  We are going to be hitting back so hard that there is a chance that this particular site is not going to survive.
[02:02:24.031 --> 02:02:27.753]  And, you know, it involves being smart.
[02:02:27.753 --> 02:02:44.641]  It involves, you know, making sure that you read up on all the various terms of service in terms of use, because, you know, the left, the globalist left is getting careless because they wrongly believe they have enough power.
[02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:56.244]  And this is a common mistake that the left has historically made everywhere from Chile to Spain, you know, again and again.
[02:02:56.244 --> 02:03:05.570]  And we're about to go through that kind of experience in the United States and in a number of countries across the West.
[02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:09.612]  The key thing that people on the right have to understand is that there's a reason why
[02:03:10.839 --> 02:03:14.521]  The globalists are so desperate to gatekeep us.
[02:03:14.521 --> 02:03:30.329]  There's a reason why they're so desperate to raise up a Jordan Peterson, a Ben Shapiro, to limit and misdirect and divide us, because they know that the numbers and the truth are on our side.
[02:03:32.486 --> 02:03:51.150]  Can you imagine what it's like for Michael Savage, who's written over 100 books, many of New York Times bestsellers, has an actual doctorate in botany, does care about the country, is number one in his time slot, and then a lawyer that was hired to literally, in his words, do terrible things to him when he tried to leave Talk Radio Network.
[02:03:51.150 --> 02:03:52.130]  I mean, I would never bring this up.
[02:03:52.130 --> 02:03:54.210]  Savage would just bring it up.
[02:03:54.210 --> 02:03:56.371]  Is now the guy being given his show.
[02:03:56.371 --> 02:04:01.252]  I mean, man, that would make me get really upset.
[02:04:01.252 --> 02:04:02.072]  Well, I have to admit,
[02:04:02.782 --> 02:04:14.087]  I was pretty annoyed when, you know, I got signed by Universal Press Syndicate because they wanted me to eventually replace William F. Buckley.
[02:04:14.087 --> 02:04:19.169]  Now, you know, 12 years later, that sounds entirely insane.
[02:04:19.169 --> 02:04:23.471]  But it did make a little bit of sense at the time because, you know, I was probably
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.083]  Well, they were also trying to compromise you.
[02:04:44.105 --> 02:04:48.872]  Yeah, maybe they were, but they did a really incompetent job.
[02:04:48.872 --> 02:04:50.013]  No, I agree.
[02:04:50.013 --> 02:04:51.996]  Let's come back and talk about that in 60 seconds.
[02:04:51.996 --> 02:04:53.218]  Vox Day is our guest.
[02:04:53.218 --> 02:04:54.279]  Infowars.com.
[02:04:54.279 --> 02:04:55.121]  Newswars.com.

[02:06:08.863 --> 02:06:11.485]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:11.485 --> 02:06:27.476]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.476 --> 02:06:36.202]  The intellectual grandchild of the Trotskyites, heir apparent, the man that delivered America into the one world government.
[02:06:37.555 --> 02:06:45.281]  Ben Shapiro, and his fatherly figure, Jordan Peterson.
[02:06:45.281 --> 02:06:55.788]  We've been told by all the big HBO shows, from Vice to Bill Maher, that these are the conservatives that are smart, and other conservatives that run around parroting them.
[02:06:55.788 --> 02:07:03.394]  And the reason I raise this is, Michael Savage, from nowhere, already accomplished best-selling author,
[02:07:04.884 --> 02:07:09.230]  Helps create the blueprint for the relaunch of the republic that Trump has adopted.
[02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:14.597]  I'd say, I'm not going to give a credit here, but I was a large part of it, our audience was a large part of it.
[02:07:14.597 --> 02:07:16.340]  Savage was a huge part of it.
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:19.704]  Ron Paul, people like Vox Dei, drudge for the platform, but...
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:30.049]  Then you have this guy who's a globalist, who Vox Dei basically tootled, who Vox Dei helped at WorldNetDaily until he figured out that he wanted an empire in tyranny.
[02:07:30.049 --> 02:07:34.413]  He learned, this pupil's got really dark inclinations.
[02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.874]  I'm not going to be associated with him.
[02:07:35.874 --> 02:07:37.736]  And he was writing articles about him a decade ago.
[02:07:37.736 --> 02:07:39.878]  Does that tell you how dangerous he thought he was?
[02:07:39.878 --> 02:07:40.919]  And Vox didn't normally do that.
[02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:43.802]  He'd been a big syndicated columnist for decades.
[02:07:43.802 --> 02:07:45.343]  So Vox, the time we have here,
[02:07:46.357 --> 02:07:55.264]  Looking at this, Michael Savage being taken off the air from three hours to one, the word is in three months he's off the air, they're going to pay out his contract, threatening to sue him.
[02:07:55.264 --> 02:07:56.905]  He doesn't even care about the money.
[02:07:56.905 --> 02:08:01.269]  Threatening to sue him if he talks about what happened because of the non-disclosure.
[02:08:01.269 --> 02:08:05.192]  But I can talk about it because I know other people involved, not from Savage.
[02:08:05.192 --> 02:08:09.015]  And I know what Savage has said about previous things.
[02:08:09.015 --> 02:08:11.137]  And again, we don't gossip folks.
[02:08:11.137 --> 02:08:12.578]  I don't sit around on the phone with people.
[02:08:12.578 --> 02:08:13.699]  Michael Savage doesn't do that.
[02:08:14.685 --> 02:08:19.994]  The phone rings when I tear into Shapiro and he's like, oh, you don't know how bad he is.
[02:08:19.994 --> 02:08:21.296]  Oh, I wish I could tell you.
[02:08:21.296 --> 02:08:22.478]  Oh my God.
[02:08:22.478 --> 02:08:23.940]  Oh.
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.823]  And Savage isn't normally like that.
[02:08:25.823 --> 02:08:27.746]  And I'm going to stop right there out of respect for Savage.
[02:08:29.724 --> 02:08:36.389]  You talk about a bee under the bonnet here, and now he's going to take Savage's slot, hoping he can steal the audience.
[02:08:36.389 --> 02:08:38.771]  Well, they may be able to silence Savage.
[02:08:38.771 --> 02:08:40.653]  They're not silencing me, because here's the deal.
[02:08:40.653 --> 02:08:44.035]  All these other men I know, almost all of them, Savage has me on.
[02:08:44.035 --> 02:08:45.236]  He's not afraid of the competition.
[02:08:45.236 --> 02:08:46.477]  We're not in competition.
[02:08:46.477 --> 02:08:48.459]  We're in competition against the globalists.
[02:08:49.304 --> 02:08:51.005]  Nationals versus globalists.
[02:08:51.005 --> 02:08:52.886]  We want to save the country and the world.
[02:08:52.886 --> 02:08:55.508]  I love knowing Michael Savage is out there or Rush Limbaugh is out there.
[02:08:55.508 --> 02:08:58.930]  They're not perfect, but they still love the country and have good basic values.
[02:08:58.930 --> 02:08:59.711]  They've got problems.
[02:08:59.711 --> 02:09:04.794]  So do I. But man, when you talk about Ben Shapiro, these are the left's Trojan horse.
[02:09:04.794 --> 02:09:09.677]  I'll continue for the seven minutes we have there, Vox Day, and people get their pen and paper ready.
[02:09:09.677 --> 02:09:11.339]  I'll give their website out before you leave us.
[02:09:11.339 --> 02:09:14.040]  So what are we facing here?
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.643]  Well, what we're facing is attempts to
[02:09:19.159 --> 02:09:31.930]  Marginalize everyone who is perceived as any sort of threat to the globalists, to the One World Order, to the Satanists, and so forth.
[02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:37.975]  I mean, you have to understand that everybody is deceived to some extent.
[02:09:37.975 --> 02:09:44.681]  You know, I mean, I used to talk about, you know, like the Judeo-Christian ethic.
[02:09:45.819 --> 02:09:47.521]  You know, it's totally false.
[02:09:47.521 --> 02:09:48.561]  There's no such thing.
[02:09:48.561 --> 02:09:51.084]  There's a Christian ethic and that's it.
[02:09:51.084 --> 02:10:03.174]  You know, when you look at everything that people like Shapiro talk about, everything they say is meant to mislead you.
[02:10:03.174 --> 02:10:12.843]  It's meant to sound good to you and then mislead you and misdirect you and guide you in a direction away from that which is threatening
[02:10:13.504 --> 02:10:16.105]  To the people who are trying to build the Tower of Babel again.
[02:10:16.105 --> 02:10:23.989]  You know, if you look at the references, here's the thing that's encouraging for those of us who are Christians.
[02:10:23.989 --> 02:10:33.113]  We know that we are going to win because God tells us in the Bible, the nations are still around at the end.
[02:10:33.113 --> 02:10:35.634]  And so that means that all of their attempts are going to fail.
[02:10:35.634 --> 02:10:42.417]  And the interesting thing is, if you look at the history of unification, whether you're talking about
[02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:53.454]  The unification that occurs in the Bible, whether you're talking about the unification of Europe that has occurred in history and so forth, it is always, always, always evil.
[02:10:53.454 --> 02:10:56.796]  The unification of Europe was first attempted by Napoleon.
[02:10:56.796 --> 02:11:04.040]  He actually managed to unify the entire continent of Europe under his empire.
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:07.481]  Then Hitler managed to do much the same thing.
[02:11:07.481 --> 02:11:08.682]  Now we've seen the EU
[02:11:09.705 --> 02:11:12.406]  Do exactly the same thing.
[02:11:12.406 --> 02:11:23.148]  All of these attempts to unify and create empire are mini attempts to rebuild the Tower of Babel.
[02:11:23.148 --> 02:11:34.250]  And so, when you look at a Shapiro, when you look at a Jordan Peterson, and you look at what their policies are meant to do, they are always, always, always in line with that.
[02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:38.591]  And what you see about the intellectual dark web, what you see about the controlled opposition,
[02:11:39.818 --> 02:11:46.726]  What you see about these characters is that none of them are ever Christians.
[02:11:46.726 --> 02:11:48.829]  None of them are ever Christians.
[02:11:48.829 --> 02:11:59.021]  And that's because Christianity is the one force that is totally opposed to the concept of a world government under anything
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.941]  But Jesus Christ.
[02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:08.323]  By the way, I've had these people reach out to me and they, you know, it's an awkward conversation so I won't say who, but they usually go, you know, there's a problem, Alex.
[02:12:08.323 --> 02:12:09.144]  There's a problem.
[02:12:09.144 --> 02:12:14.766]  And it basically comes down to my Christianity that I won't accept all the other, quote, systems to run my life.
[02:12:14.766 --> 02:12:17.127]  And it really is spiritual.
[02:12:17.127 --> 02:12:17.847]  Oh, there's no question.
[02:12:17.847 --> 02:12:19.287]  I mean, I think one of the reasons why
[02:12:22.535 --> 02:12:32.823]  You know, you mentioned that you thought that perhaps part of why I was offered that high prestige syndication by UPS was because they wanted to corrupt me.
[02:12:32.823 --> 02:12:35.284]  But honestly, they didn't even try.
[02:12:35.284 --> 02:12:44.631]  And I suspect that's because they understand that I care about my faith.
[02:12:44.631 --> 02:12:46.873]  And I am much more concerned about
[02:12:47.705 --> 02:12:53.673]  What Jesus Christ happens to think about anything, than I am about, you know, a nicer house or a better car.
[02:12:53.673 --> 02:12:55.255]  No, no, no, you're a good writer.
[02:12:55.255 --> 02:12:57.517]  Back in the time, the country wasn't as much trouble as it is now.
[02:12:57.517 --> 02:13:04.206]  But now, it's clearly, you're not nationalist, you're not Christian, and then you'll be left alone.
[02:13:05.652 --> 02:13:06.413]  Well, yeah, that's true.
[02:13:06.413 --> 02:13:10.576]  But what's interesting is what a bunch of intellectual mediocrities they are.
[02:13:10.576 --> 02:13:18.361]  You noted correctly that the subtitle of Jordanetics was a journey into the mind of humanity's greatest thinker.
[02:13:18.361 --> 02:13:26.387]  It's actually astonishingly appalling for anyone who is even a moderately decent thinker to
[02:13:28.391 --> 02:13:38.539]  Follow the incoherence and the stream of citations and the nonsensical tangents that leap from one subject to the next without making any sense to us.
[02:13:38.539 --> 02:13:42.061]  But he does it with that leftist super confidence.
[02:13:42.061 --> 02:13:46.224]  And so he's a what he is is a fop.
[02:13:46.224 --> 02:13:46.825]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:46.825 --> 02:13:48.946]  But I call it preemptive mirroring.
[02:13:48.946 --> 02:13:52.089]  I actually go into some detail in this in the book.
[02:13:52.089 --> 02:13:56.632]  And what he's really good at doing is creating this fog of a word salad
[02:13:57.279 --> 02:14:08.585]  That reflects your own, that allows you to reflect your own opinion back to yourself, but your own opinion is now reinforced with the gravitas of his supposed authority.
[02:14:08.585 --> 02:14:09.105]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:14:09.105 --> 02:14:21.532]  He puts out a pantheistic statement of buzzwords so basically anyone listening thinks whatever they've been programmed with is right, but really you're just learning to follow him so he can then slide in the whole unification theory.
[02:14:22.987 --> 02:14:31.110]  Yeah, that's part of it, but what it's all based on is you feeling good about him confirming what you already believe.
[02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:44.676]  And the fact that you and I might believe different things and be sitting next to each other, we hear him say the same thing, he says the same thing, but we hear it differently and we perceive it differently.
[02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:49.038]  And then it's really a con man's game.
[02:14:49.038 --> 02:14:52.319]  And it's kind of funny because every now and then he screws up.
[02:14:52.879 --> 02:14:57.883]  And then he desperately tries to come up with some excuse.
[02:14:57.883 --> 02:15:03.467]  But of course, like Owen Benjamin says, liars always lie and they have to lie some more.
[02:15:03.467 --> 02:15:07.831]  So usually he digs himself in even deeper when he's trying to cover his ass for his last mistake.
[02:15:07.831 --> 02:15:08.672]  No, I totally agree.
[02:15:08.672 --> 02:15:10.293]  We'll come back soon, Vox.
[02:15:10.293 --> 02:15:12.875]  We're very excited about the great work you're doing.
[02:15:12.875 --> 02:15:16.418]  And again, obviously they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[02:15:16.418 --> 02:15:18.639]  They're really scared about the yellow vest.
[02:15:18.639 --> 02:15:19.200]  30 seconds on that.
[02:15:21.777 --> 02:15:26.161]  The Gilets Jaunes movement is much bigger than people realize.
[02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:29.805]  I have seen yellow vests in Italy.
[02:15:29.805 --> 02:15:33.028]  I've seen them in Switzerland.
[02:15:33.028 --> 02:15:34.570]  They're all over the place.
[02:15:34.570 --> 02:15:42.198]  I mean, I'm talking about you go, you drive by a school in Italy, and you'll see kids wearing the yellow vest.
[02:15:43.163 --> 02:15:51.227]  You know, it is now the European sign of resistance, and don't be fooled by, like, the fake demands and stuff.
[02:15:51.227 --> 02:15:54.008]  Hold on, you said you were gonna bring Owen here, but you gotta finish up on the other side.
[02:15:54.008 --> 02:15:54.688]  We can't leave you there.
[02:15:54.688 --> 02:15:55.309]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:55.309 --> 02:16:04.173]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[02:16:25.416 --> 02:16:26.637]  Hear that?
[02:16:26.637 --> 02:16:32.022]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:16:32.022 --> 02:16:34.924]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:34.924 --> 02:16:38.507]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:17:47.305 --> 02:17:52.047]  Everybody knows it.
[02:17:52.047 --> 02:17:59.689]  History documents it.
[02:17:59.689 --> 02:18:05.291]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[02:18:05.291 --> 02:18:06.411]  They want to abort children.
[02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:08.172]  They want to disease children.
[02:18:08.172 --> 02:18:09.272]  They want to abuse children.
[02:18:09.272 --> 02:18:10.913]  They want to confuse children.
[02:18:10.913 --> 02:18:12.093]  They want their essence.
[02:18:12.093 --> 02:18:13.033]  They want their soul.
[02:18:13.033 --> 02:18:14.354]  They want their spirit.
[02:18:14.354 --> 02:18:15.354]  They want their power.
[02:18:16.118 --> 02:18:18.340]  Because they are our future.
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:22.002]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[02:18:22.002 --> 02:18:23.823]  It is about the West.
[02:18:23.823 --> 02:18:27.966]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:29.547]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:41.282]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[02:18:41.282 --> 02:18:43.343]  You have the power to override the censors.
[02:18:43.343 --> 02:18:46.983]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:18:46.983 --> 02:18:55.485]  And I know you've been taking action, and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[02:18:56.468 --> 02:19:05.492]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:19:05.492 --> 02:19:06.852]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:19:06.852 --> 02:19:10.714]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:19:10.714 --> 02:19:15.095]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[02:19:15.095 --> 02:19:16.396]  All words are not enough.
[02:19:17.225 --> 02:19:23.407]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[02:19:23.407 --> 02:19:29.609]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:19:29.609 --> 02:19:33.611]  They've created their Tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:19:33.611 --> 02:19:35.532]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:19:35.532 --> 02:19:39.513]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[02:19:40.106 --> 02:19:45.791]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:19:45.791 --> 02:19:59.421]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:19:59.421 --> 02:20:02.263]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[02:20:23.233 --> 02:20:24.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:41.545 --> 02:20:47.927]  Now, Vox Day, voxday.com, voxday.blogspot.com, YouTube, VoxVersity.

[02:20:56.671 --> 02:21:03.633]  I couldn't put it down when I read it to understand the leftist attempt to take over the nationalist movement.
[02:21:03.633 --> 02:21:06.995]  We have his alt-hero comic books as well.

[02:21:25.886 --> 02:21:27.026]  Yeah, I lose money on that.
[02:21:27.026 --> 02:21:33.551]  It's end of year, we're clearing out all the inventory, even all our best sellers, everything free shipping, everything double Patriot points.
[02:21:33.551 --> 02:21:36.674]  Okay, finishing up, Vox, I appreciate your time.
[02:21:36.674 --> 02:21:38.255]  We were getting into the announcement that
[02:21:39.434 --> 02:21:42.275]  The Michael Savage Show is going to be cancelled.
[02:21:42.275 --> 02:21:45.275]  And he's not allowed to tell you that, but I can tell you that from other sources.
[02:21:45.275 --> 02:21:46.995]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:21:46.995 --> 02:21:47.796]  I've confirmed it.
[02:21:47.796 --> 02:21:50.536]  He's going from three hours to one hour starting next month.
[02:21:50.536 --> 02:21:52.696]  And then he will be cancelled three months after.
[02:21:52.696 --> 02:21:55.897]  So they are smothering him with a pillow for being number one.
[02:21:55.897 --> 02:22:01.898]  And the great one, the new leader, the Führer, Ben Shapiro is going to be here.
[02:22:01.898 --> 02:22:06.899]  So finishing up with what you were saying about the state of the world as we hit the break, Vox Dei.
[02:22:08.523 --> 02:22:15.670]  Well, the important thing to understand is that the reason that Michael Savage can be cancelled is because he doesn't have his own platform.
[02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:22.457]  You know, if you were working for CBS rather than for yourself at InfoWars, you'd be done.
[02:22:22.457 --> 02:22:29.584]  And so, conservatives and people on the right and people who are nationalists and people who love America,
[02:22:30.702 --> 02:22:40.008]  And people who are Christians need to understand that they need to stop playing on the turf of the people who want to destroy everything they love.
[02:22:40.008 --> 02:22:45.332]  And they also need to stop supporting the organizations and corporations
[02:22:46.132 --> 02:22:47.153]  That hate them.
[02:22:47.153 --> 02:22:57.785]  And, you know, I realize I'm preaching, I'm literally preaching to the choir here, since people who are watching this are already supporting what you're doing and supporting... We're on over 250 stations, new listeners every minute.
[02:22:57.785 --> 02:22:59.688]  I mean, you're talking, they're talking a lot of new people, too.
[02:22:59.688 --> 02:23:00.909]  I mean, they need to know this.
[02:23:00.909 --> 02:23:06.976]  Yeah, so the thing is, is that you are in a cultural war.
[02:23:08.217 --> 02:23:17.166]  You're not in a intranational ideological struggle for the direction that we should all go.
[02:23:17.166 --> 02:23:26.256]  You are in an existential cultural war with people who want to destroy Christianity, who want to destroy America,
[02:23:27.342 --> 02:23:30.004]  And who want to destroy Western civilization.
[02:23:30.004 --> 02:23:30.504]  Let's explain.
[02:23:30.504 --> 02:23:31.625]  They don't want to just conquer you.
[02:23:31.625 --> 02:23:32.725]  They want to overwrite you.
[02:23:32.725 --> 02:23:36.527]  Explain for those that new listeners what existential war means.
[02:23:36.527 --> 02:23:40.890]  It means total, real, every level, complete.
[02:23:40.890 --> 02:23:41.470]  Exactly.
[02:23:41.470 --> 02:23:48.414]  And the only reason that the war has not really gotten into violence yet is because we outnumber them.
[02:23:48.414 --> 02:23:51.176]  We can still completely defeat them.
[02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:56.223]  Without it getting to the level... You're right, they're the mouse taming the lion.
[02:23:56.223 --> 02:23:58.604]  They're the mouse taming the lion.
[02:23:58.604 --> 02:24:08.348]  Right, and that's why they're constantly raising up the Ben Shapiros and the Jordan Petersons in order to try to neutralize the stronger force.
[02:24:08.348 --> 02:24:11.969]  And so that's why we need to understand that we are the strong horse.
[02:24:11.969 --> 02:24:20.633]  We merely need to stand up for what we believe in, stop being afraid, and start supporting the people who stand up for the stuff that
[02:24:21.254 --> 02:24:29.869]  You really believe in, and not these fake conservatives, these fake Americans like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro.
[02:24:30.697 --> 02:24:38.145]  And I've noticed the leftist greatest power is showing their meth head, Antifa, and their idiot purple hair people, and all their Prozac heads.
[02:24:38.145 --> 02:24:40.628]  We think, oh those are a bunch of idiots, they're at the crazy universities.
[02:24:40.628 --> 02:24:42.911]  No, they're going into the CIA and NSA.
[02:24:42.911 --> 02:24:44.392]  They're teaching your kids.
[02:24:44.392 --> 02:24:45.533]  They're spying on you.
[02:24:45.533 --> 02:24:46.374]  They're doxing you.
[02:24:46.374 --> 02:24:47.916]  They're becoming lawyers.
[02:24:47.916 --> 02:24:52.021]  And they believe they are the ruling class, and they have a right to hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[02:24:52.521 --> 02:24:55.163]  Okay, and they think they're smarter than you.
[02:24:55.163 --> 02:25:10.112]  But if you just get aggressive and stop financially supporting globalists, and start supporting independent real folks, and start really just calling into C-SPAN, talk radio, go to a Hillary event, go to a leftist event, get in their face, you're gonna find once you do it, you're not scared anymore.
[02:25:10.112 --> 02:25:12.334]  Really impressed with the work you're doing, Vox, I'm glad that
[02:25:13.430 --> 02:25:15.672]  Well, what bothered me about Ben Shapiro was that he was of an age to join the military.
[02:25:41.892 --> 02:25:43.433]  Yeah, I knew what he was.
[02:25:43.433 --> 02:25:52.420]  I named him the littlest chicken hawk back in 2005 because he was of an age to join the military.
[02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:55.222]  And, you know, I have a lot of friends in the military.
[02:25:55.222 --> 02:25:57.044]  My family was heavily military.
[02:25:57.044 --> 02:26:01.888]  I actually went to enlist with the Marines at the beginning of Desert Shield.
[02:26:01.888 --> 02:26:06.031]  And the fact that he was advocating
[02:26:07.272 --> 02:26:12.897]  I mean, you were right about him when he was a nobody, saying, danger, danger Will Robinson.
[02:26:30.086 --> 02:26:33.929]  Yeah, but you know, at the time I didn't think that he would.
[02:26:33.929 --> 02:26:45.280]  I would have been shocked back then to find out that he has become as significant a cultural and media figure as he's become because I know that he's not that smart.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:46.721]  And imagine, let me explain something.
[02:26:46.721 --> 02:26:51.185]  You don't start a talk radio show in two months and then be given Michael Savage's.
[02:26:51.185 --> 02:26:55.869]  That'd be like you're in high school football and you're a sophomore.
[02:26:55.869 --> 02:26:56.790]  You're not even a starter.
[02:26:58.314 --> 02:27:03.121]  And you're given the top draft pick for the NFL.
[02:27:03.121 --> 02:27:04.723]  No, it's absolutely absurd.
[02:27:04.723 --> 02:27:11.053]  And what you see is Ben Shapiro runs twice he's like publicly proposed debates.
[02:27:11.053 --> 02:27:13.096]  And I said, sure, Ben, I'll debate you.
[02:27:14.523 --> 02:27:17.506]  And, I mean, he ran away like the roadrunner.
[02:27:17.506 --> 02:27:18.808]  It was hilarious.
[02:27:18.808 --> 02:27:25.135]  And, you know, this is supposed to be this feared, uh, whip-smart debater.
[02:27:25.135 --> 02:27:29.880]  And again, his only claim is the left protesting, but then the real left brings him on TV.
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.041]  Vox Day, thanks for the time.
[02:27:31.041 --> 02:27:32.163]  Look forward to having you on again soon.
[02:27:33.476 --> 02:27:34.376]  Thanks Alex.
[02:27:34.376 --> 02:27:34.616]  Thank you.
[02:27:50.345 --> 02:27:55.087]  And being given Michael Savage's show, and Michael Savage contractually can't defend himself.
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:27:56.207]  Well, you know what?
[02:27:56.207 --> 02:27:57.568]  I'm going to defend Michael Savage.
[02:27:57.568 --> 02:28:08.011]  Well, and I think that what's really happening here is Savage's biggest audience, well his two biggest audiences are KSFO and then I believe it's KABC in New York City, and that's the one he's being squeezed out of.
[02:28:08.011 --> 02:28:12.213]  As of right now, the last I heard, he's going to be able to maintain some of his stations.
[02:28:12.213 --> 02:28:15.254]  They're only going to carry him for one hour, but he's going to have to go to a podcast format.
[02:28:16.234 --> 02:28:21.315]  This is how when they get rid of somebody they say, oh you have a weekend show.
[02:28:21.315 --> 02:28:22.796]  They've been trying to squeeze him out of TV.
[02:28:22.796 --> 02:28:25.356]  They're getting rid of him and giving Shapiro a show.
[02:28:25.356 --> 02:28:28.317]  They're doing this so Shapiro doesn't get the blame of the audience.
[02:28:28.317 --> 02:28:31.778]  They're knifing Savage and going, get in here kid, take his place!
[02:28:31.778 --> 02:28:32.298]  Really?
[02:28:32.298 --> 02:28:32.878]  Is it alright?
[02:28:32.878 --> 02:28:34.058]  Are they going to blame me?
[02:28:34.058 --> 02:28:35.979]  No kid, they won't notice what we're doing.
[02:28:35.979 --> 02:28:37.179]  Kill Savage, shut him up quick!
[02:28:37.759 --> 02:28:44.004]  I think it's good because, I mean, Shapiro's radio program is gonna fail, so... If we expose it, and boy does he need to fail.
[02:28:44.004 --> 02:28:47.207]  What a piece of un-American trash.
[02:28:47.207 --> 02:28:50.329]  God, this guy is as phony as a plastic banana.
[02:28:50.329 --> 02:28:51.010]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:51.450]  Stay with us.

[02:33:15.129 --> 02:33:16.930]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:16.930 --> 02:33:18.810]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:20.510]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:22.171]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:22.171 --> 02:33:26.892]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.454 --> 02:33:32.277]  Whippin'!
[02:33:47.457 --> 02:33:48.638]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:33:48.638 --> 02:33:49.138]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:49.138 --> 02:33:50.499]  I'm here live with Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:50.499 --> 02:33:53.842]  The most hated, demonized, lied-about broadcast in the world.
[02:33:53.842 --> 02:33:56.584]  And Owen's pretty close behind me, doing a great job.
[02:33:56.584 --> 02:33:57.805]  I'm trying to keep up with you.
[02:33:57.805 --> 02:33:59.967]  There with the War Room, you've got David Knott doing an amazing job, 8 a.m.
[02:33:59.967 --> 02:34:00.327]  every morning.
[02:34:00.327 --> 02:34:03.349]  We've got a lot of new shows we're going to be adding soon, a lot of new things we're doing.
[02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:05.271]  That's why the Globals are so scared.
[02:34:05.271 --> 02:34:06.291]  But Owen Troyer's here.
[02:34:06.291 --> 02:34:08.213]  Owen, just something that just broke, we should just throw out here.
[02:34:08.213 --> 02:34:09.114]  The Hill is reporting.
[02:34:10.435 --> 02:34:13.382]  So you have no idea if it's true, they lie so much, but actually this is a ruling.
[02:34:13.382 --> 02:34:19.317]  Judge rules cops schools had no duty to shield students in Parkland shooting lawsuit.
[02:34:20.134 --> 02:34:20.654]  That's right.
[02:34:20.654 --> 02:34:25.017]  And of course, they've ruled that before because you have a duty to protect yourself.
[02:34:25.017 --> 02:34:34.464]  That's why you should understand that when you send your children to a victim disarmament zone, you're advertising it's a place for the left to prepare the shooter, the brainwashed person, and protect them.
[02:34:34.464 --> 02:34:35.764]  Now, I never said nobody died there.
[02:34:35.764 --> 02:34:38.126]  I never said they were crisis actors.
[02:34:38.126 --> 02:34:44.991]  I said they picked four anti-gunners from the drama department to go be the anti-gun spokesperson for the 3,000 children.
[02:34:44.991 --> 02:34:47.672]  So CNN and others said Jones says nobody died.
[02:34:47.672 --> 02:34:48.953]  Jones is bullying the children.
[02:34:48.953 --> 02:34:49.894]  None of it was true.
[02:34:50.814 --> 02:34:52.175]  And YouTube took us off.
[02:34:52.175 --> 02:34:52.855]  We showed the proof.
[02:34:52.855 --> 02:34:53.636]  They had to put us back.
[02:34:53.636 --> 02:34:56.817]  But they later just got rid of me and didn't even give a reason.
[02:34:56.817 --> 02:34:58.858]  Or they said I beat up a kid, which I didn't.
[02:34:58.858 --> 02:35:01.520]  It was a video from ABC News of a kid attacking somebody.
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.160]  They pushed him down.
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:03.160]  But it sounds good.
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.301]  You know, Jones got taken out of there.
[02:35:04.301 --> 02:35:05.562]  He beats children.
[02:35:05.562 --> 02:35:09.664]  So now they're reporting that Broward County, also known as Coward.
[02:35:09.664 --> 02:35:16.267]  Let's remove the BR, but a C. The Coward, Coward County.
[02:35:19.622 --> 02:35:26.551]  We have all this weird corrupt election fraud going on, mass shootings, you name it, that they're good people standing down and doing nothing.
[02:35:26.551 --> 02:35:28.053]  Well, what did we really report back then?
[02:35:28.053 --> 02:35:29.194]  We had all the students on.
[02:35:29.194 --> 02:35:30.276]  There was a stand down.
[02:35:30.276 --> 02:35:33.359]  The police were all waiting outside during this happening.
[02:35:33.359 --> 02:35:35.923]  And so there we are, vindicated again, and the judge says, hey,
[02:35:37.449 --> 02:35:40.411]  If somebody comes in the school to kill your kids, that's been protected.
[02:35:40.411 --> 02:35:45.395]  The leftist program said that Mr. Cruz had committed all these burglaries and attacks and threats.
[02:35:45.395 --> 02:35:50.799]  Because his last name was Cruz, even though he wasn't Hispanic, well, it's part of a leftist program to not put him in jail.
[02:35:50.799 --> 02:35:56.623]  So they protected him every step of the way to kill your children and to stand down and that's the Democrats for you, Owen.
[02:35:56.983 --> 02:36:06.792]  Well, now kind of flashing back to that time, Alex, I'm realizing now how much devastating information we put out to disrupt their narrative.
[02:36:06.792 --> 02:36:09.775]  And if you look at this now, OK, look at all the facts that have come out.
[02:36:09.775 --> 02:36:11.736]  We were right about the police standing down.
[02:36:11.736 --> 02:36:14.899]  We were right about the FBI standing down on Cruz.
[02:36:14.899 --> 02:36:15.980]  And we were.
[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:19.523]  And then what happened is they had a vote on the school board.
[02:36:19.523 --> 02:36:19.984]  They voted 13 to 1.
[02:36:21.525 --> 02:36:23.286]  to arm their teachers, Alex.
[02:36:36.852 --> 02:36:43.714]  Having guns on the campus, while it doesn't sound good, nobody wants to think that way, was going to be the ultimate conclusion here, and that's what they reached.
[02:36:43.714 --> 02:36:50.136]  But you won't see any of that reported on all the news outlets, Alex, that want to ban your right to own a firearm.
[02:36:50.136 --> 02:36:53.357]  Which, by the way, Trump's administration is going to ban bump stocks, Alex.
[02:36:53.357 --> 02:36:54.277]  That's an F to me.
[02:36:54.677 --> 02:36:55.117]  I don't like that.
[02:36:55.117 --> 02:36:56.718]  Yeah, that's hurt Trump really, really bad.
[02:36:56.718 --> 02:37:01.599]  But, you know, he asked the N.R.N., he said, sir, they're garbage, they're not any use.
[02:37:01.599 --> 02:37:03.520]  So Trump sees it as, so what?
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.060]  And that's a big, big F for Trump.
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:06.421]  But let's shift back.
[02:37:06.421 --> 02:37:10.742]  Ben Shapiro to go national as Michael Savage cuts back to one hour.
[02:37:10.742 --> 02:37:11.962]  That's Radio Insight.
[02:37:11.962 --> 02:37:13.943]  So you read that, you think, oh, Savage is retiring.
[02:37:13.943 --> 02:37:16.324]  No, Savage can't talk as a contract.
[02:37:16.324 --> 02:37:19.105]  He's been told his show's gone from three hours to one.
[02:37:19.105 --> 02:37:19.985]  They're just going to get rid of it.
[02:37:20.425 --> 02:37:21.686]  They just don't want to piss people off.
[02:37:21.686 --> 02:37:23.227]  Well, here's your new person.
[02:37:23.227 --> 02:37:24.368]  You tune in to hear Michael Savage.
[02:37:24.368 --> 02:37:31.032]  Instead, you get Ben Shapiro, the amazing... He always makes this face right here, like... I can't even do it either.
[02:37:31.032 --> 02:37:31.652]  No, you can't even.
[02:37:31.652 --> 02:37:33.574]  Don't even try.
[02:37:33.574 --> 02:37:34.674]  You're too manly.
[02:37:34.674 --> 02:37:40.318]  I mean, he's... Imagine if you mixed a clone of him with Brian Stelter.
[02:37:40.318 --> 02:37:41.619]  Let me try to do a Shapiro face.
[02:37:41.619 --> 02:37:42.119]  I can do it.
[02:37:42.119 --> 02:37:42.940]  Go back to camera one, please.
[02:37:48.496 --> 02:37:49.157]  You can't do it.
[02:37:49.157 --> 02:37:50.439]  Look, hold on, hold on.
[02:37:50.439 --> 02:37:51.280]  Look at the satisfaction.
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:51.761]  Look, look, look.
[02:37:51.761 --> 02:37:57.229]  No, just try to be... Try to be the most condescending, arrogant punk.
[02:37:57.229 --> 02:37:58.150]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:59.613]  That's not bad, actually, right there.
[02:37:59.613 --> 02:38:01.115]  Hey, how you doing, Ben?
[02:38:01.115 --> 02:38:03.338]  You know I'm a Trotskyist, you dumb Americans.
[02:38:06.768 --> 02:38:12.454]  I just, that's the look like I just got all Michael Savage's stations even though I just got on talk radio two months ago and have no ratings.
[02:38:12.454 --> 02:38:15.457]  I'm Ben Shapiro, I'm Ben Shapiro.
[02:38:15.457 --> 02:38:21.463]  Think about this Alex, Fox News never allows you on air, never allows Michael Savage on air.
[02:38:21.463 --> 02:38:25.568]  You guys are bigger than Ben Shapiro who gets boosted and amplified by Fox News every day.
[02:38:25.568 --> 02:38:26.529]  He's a good boy!
[02:38:27.369 --> 02:38:27.929]  He's a good boy.
[02:38:27.929 --> 02:38:32.431]  He's a nice neocon who thinks we should invade every country in the Middle East.
[02:38:32.431 --> 02:38:33.352]  But it's beyond that.
[02:38:33.352 --> 02:38:35.473]  It's the snivelling-ness of him.
[02:38:35.473 --> 02:38:43.257]  But, see, when you meet some of these people, Alex, doesn't it kind of stun you to realize how many people are just in it because they want to be famous or make some money?
[02:38:43.957 --> 02:38:47.562]  Oh, that's what you run into is the people that are in local TV or whatever.
[02:38:47.562 --> 02:38:53.789]  They're literally narcissistic loons that are in love with getting in front of some camera and talking to maybe 5,000 people.
[02:38:53.789 --> 02:38:55.271]  I mean, we're in a total war.
[02:38:55.271 --> 02:38:56.212]  They're coming after us.
[02:38:56.212 --> 02:38:57.013]  This is exciting.
[02:38:57.013 --> 02:38:58.235]  This is a fight.
[02:38:58.235 --> 02:38:59.276]  It isn't about being on air.
[02:39:00.317 --> 02:39:06.181]  I don't think I've seen you spend one minute in makeup since I've been working here for three years.
[02:39:06.181 --> 02:39:09.103]  These people that go on television, and look, I'm not insulting everybody on television.
[02:39:09.103 --> 02:39:09.924]  I have friends who go on television.
[02:39:09.924 --> 02:39:14.967]  The point is, they spend an hour and a half before they go on TV just in makeup.
[02:39:14.967 --> 02:39:17.289]  And that's most of the men out there, too, Alex.
[02:39:17.289 --> 02:39:18.169]  So how long do you do it?
[02:39:18.169 --> 02:39:20.831]  Well, Owen, you know, obviously I'm not gay, but you're a quite handsome guy.
[02:39:20.831 --> 02:39:21.532]  You don't need to.
[02:39:22.032 --> 02:39:23.513]  Me, it might be a little easier on the eyes.
[02:39:23.513 --> 02:39:24.194]  I just don't like it.
[02:39:24.194 --> 02:39:25.675]  I just can't do it.
[02:39:25.675 --> 02:39:28.938]  Every once in a while, if I have, like, ingrown hair or something, I put a little dot of something on there.
[02:39:28.938 --> 02:39:30.840]  But, you know, it's not about what I look like.
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:31.881]  It's about the information.
[02:39:31.881 --> 02:39:32.702]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:39:32.702 --> 02:39:39.007]  I'm so busy just getting information right up to show time, I don't even have time to think about what I look like.
[02:39:39.007 --> 02:39:40.789]  Half the time, my hair is a mess.
[02:39:40.789 --> 02:39:41.449]  I don't even care.
[02:39:41.449 --> 02:39:44.072]  Well, I can tell you this.
[02:39:44.072 --> 02:39:47.755]  That was a delicious Luby's cheesesteak at lunch.
[02:39:47.755 --> 02:39:48.776]  All part of the special diet.
[02:39:49.764 --> 02:39:52.365]  I'm surprised you're able to button that jacket back up.
[02:39:52.365 --> 02:39:53.285]  I need to go on a diet.
[02:39:53.285 --> 02:39:59.547]  I lost a ton of weight, but I've been... I've quit working out for a long time, and I'm not as fat as I used to be, but I just work all the time.
[02:39:59.547 --> 02:40:02.387]  You know, it's kind of hard when they're just attacking constantly.
[02:40:02.387 --> 02:40:04.928]  Well, plus, you know, I mean, you take care of your kids.
[02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:06.428]  The media wants to act like you don't care about your kids.
[02:40:06.428 --> 02:40:07.189]  You really do.
[02:40:07.189 --> 02:40:08.849]  Well, the media says I don't have my children.
[02:40:08.849 --> 02:40:09.389]  Well, that's true.
[02:40:09.389 --> 02:40:11.250]  You actually have your children a lot.
[02:40:11.250 --> 02:40:13.530]  In fact, I saw Rex today.
[02:40:13.530 --> 02:40:15.231]  He's doing good.
[02:40:15.231 --> 02:40:15.911]  I have a mom.
[02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:19.851]  90% of the time.
[02:40:19.851 --> 02:40:21.432]  But see, that's what they do, Alex.
[02:40:21.432 --> 02:40:27.538]  It's the same thing with, it's kind of like the same vein they do with Shapiro, where they put out the story like, oh, you know, Savage must be gone.
[02:40:27.538 --> 02:40:29.279]  You know, he's quitting on us.
[02:40:29.279 --> 02:40:30.020]  He's gone.
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:31.221]  But Shapiro's here to save us.
[02:40:31.221 --> 02:40:32.622]  It's like, no, Savage got him.
[02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:36.685]  Well, the company goes, non-disclosure, you can't tell people we're getting rid of Ziz.
[02:40:36.685 --> 02:40:39.768]  And Shapiro do what he tells them, Ziz.
[02:40:39.768 --> 02:40:41.389]  So he's in charge now.
[02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:42.650]  Hillary gave the green light.
[02:40:43.371 --> 02:40:45.032]  Shapiro, I mean, you know, he's the arbiter.
[02:40:45.032 --> 02:40:46.813]  He's a good never-Trumper.
[02:40:46.813 --> 02:40:49.594]  He's not gonna say a word when we get rid of Trump.
[02:40:49.594 --> 02:40:56.617]  We need to silence every one of these loudmouth Americans before we take that Trump out.
[02:40:56.617 --> 02:40:58.278]  Shapiro's ready!
[02:40:58.278 --> 02:40:59.379]  You put him in!
[02:40:59.379 --> 02:41:00.519]  Sir, he's never been on air.
[02:41:00.519 --> 02:41:01.600]  He can hardly talk.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:03.561]  He reads off talking points.
[02:41:03.561 --> 02:41:05.422]  It don't matter!
[02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:07.042]  He's my boy!
[02:41:07.042 --> 02:41:08.643]  He goes on and on!
[02:41:08.643 --> 02:41:09.984]  He gets an audience.
[02:41:10.663 --> 02:41:12.584]  I can't do Shapiro anymore.
[02:41:12.584 --> 02:41:13.425]  The guy just sucks.
[02:41:13.425 --> 02:41:14.765]  It's just too bad.
[02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:15.906]  Which is too bad, you know?
[02:41:15.906 --> 02:41:18.187]  I wish that people on the right could all have the same agenda.
[02:41:18.187 --> 02:41:23.190]  Every photo is this look where he just goes, you know, I'm going to steal your freedom.
[02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:24.431]  You can't stand against me.
[02:41:24.431 --> 02:41:25.491]  No one can stand against me.
[02:41:25.491 --> 02:41:27.392]  I'm too powerful.
[02:41:27.392 --> 02:41:30.454]  And he's always hedging his bet on Donald Trump and President Trump.
[02:41:30.454 --> 02:41:31.875]  Oh, well just wait.
[02:41:31.875 --> 02:41:33.756]  Just wait until I release the information on him.
[02:41:35.370 --> 02:41:41.356]  Well Alex, you know, we do have some news that's kind of the same developing news from last night.
[02:41:41.356 --> 02:41:46.762]  There's going to be a continuance in the Flynn sentencing, so they have not concluded that.
[02:41:46.762 --> 02:41:50.306]  What's happening there is the judge is like, you didn't do anything, say you're not guilty.
[02:41:50.306 --> 02:41:50.566]  I am guilty!
[02:41:52.668 --> 02:42:02.697]  It's the weirdest thing, they're saying you were never guilty, you didn't lie to the FBI, but they're also saying at the same time you sold your country down the drain and you're an embarrassment.
[02:42:02.697 --> 02:42:04.638]  That's right out of the judge's mouth.
[02:42:04.638 --> 02:42:10.303]  So it's like, wait a second, you're saying that he was set up, I mean they admit he was entrapped, and Flynn isn't even trying to fight this.
[02:42:10.303 --> 02:42:12.865]  He's like just, he's just done.
[02:42:12.865 --> 02:42:14.567]  He's just like, look, I'm just done with this.
[02:42:14.567 --> 02:42:20.272]  I'm done with the legal fees, I'm done coming to court, I'm done dealing with lawyers, just give me whatever sentence and just move on.
[02:42:20.672 --> 02:42:23.855]  Meanwhile, Hillary literally is working against the country at every level.
[02:42:23.855 --> 02:42:25.037]  The big news when we come back.
[02:42:25.037 --> 02:42:26.838]  We're doing news blitz when we come back.
[02:42:26.838 --> 02:42:33.025]  The globalists as we speak are trying to flush the stock market and housing and everything down to stop Trump.
[02:42:33.025 --> 02:42:37.309]  And America, the New York Times has written an article saying humans should be extincted.
[02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:41.634]  We've got a bunch of other articles here that are super incredibly important.
[02:42:41.634 --> 02:42:42.314]  Chinese internet.
[02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:50.310]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[02:43:04.261 --> 02:43:05.622]  We've been proven dead-on.
[02:43:05.622 --> 02:43:09.485]  You've been proven dead-on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:43:09.485 --> 02:43:14.108]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[02:43:14.108 --> 02:43:16.009]  Words are not enough.
[02:43:16.009 --> 02:43:28.518]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open, free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:43:28.518 --> 02:43:31.740]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:43:32.366 --> 02:43:34.288]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:43:34.288 --> 02:43:38.771]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globally anti-human future.
[02:43:38.771 --> 02:43:44.556]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:43:44.556 --> 02:43:45.797]  I am in your hands.
[02:43:45.797 --> 02:43:53.843]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to infowars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and fund the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:43:54.964 --> 02:44:01.373]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:44:01.373 --> 02:44:02.935]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:44:02.935 --> 02:44:07.842]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off, double Patreon points.
[02:44:07.842 --> 02:44:10.765]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[02:44:11.286 --> 02:44:14.049]  A free gift with every order.
[02:44:14.049 --> 02:44:22.896]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:44:22.896 --> 02:44:26.580]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:31.944]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:44:31.944 --> 02:44:34.327]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[02:44:34.867 --> 02:44:39.732]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:44:39.732 --> 02:44:41.273]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:44:41.273 --> 02:44:42.835]  We are losing money on this.
[02:44:42.835 --> 02:44:44.276]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:44:44.276 --> 02:44:46.278]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:44:46.278 --> 02:44:47.599]  And don't fight the crowds.
[02:44:47.599 --> 02:44:49.040]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:50.542]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[02:44:56.843 --> 02:45:01.305]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[02:45:01.305 --> 02:45:05.867]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[02:45:05.867 --> 02:45:16.352]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:16.352 --> 02:45:20.214]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[02:45:20.214 --> 02:45:21.755]  All the sales the last 12 days
[02:45:22.515 --> 02:45:24.958]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[02:45:24.958 --> 02:45:26.039]  Free shipping is still there.
[02:45:26.039 --> 02:45:27.441]  Double Patriot points.
[02:45:27.441 --> 02:45:30.685]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[02:45:30.685 --> 02:45:35.210]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:36.671]  Just go check out the sales.
[02:45:36.671 --> 02:45:38.013]  There's too many to break them all down.
[02:45:38.013 --> 02:45:41.797]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[02:45:42.538 --> 02:45:44.559]  And thank you again all for your support.
[02:45:44.559 --> 02:45:49.001]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:45:49.001 --> 02:45:53.663]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globalists together.
[02:45:53.663 --> 02:45:56.665]  Thank you.
[02:45:56.665 --> 02:46:02.928]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[02:46:02.928 --> 02:46:03.788]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[02:46:04.694 --> 02:46:07.038]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[02:46:07.038 --> 02:46:09.883]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[02:46:09.883 --> 02:46:12.888]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[02:46:12.888 --> 02:46:18.537]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential, and down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[02:46:19.338 --> 02:46:31.782]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[02:46:31.782 --> 02:46:33.703]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[02:46:33.703 --> 02:46:39.405]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[02:46:39.405 --> 02:46:40.265]  But I need your prayers.
[02:46:40.265 --> 02:46:42.146]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[02:46:42.146 --> 02:46:44.127]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:44.867]  We make it easy.
[02:46:45.427 --> 02:46:52.173]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[02:46:52.173 --> 02:46:59.860]  We've got a bunch of huge deals in fourstore.com, so please take action right now.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:02.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:10.758 --> 02:47:14.179]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.179 --> 02:47:22.680]  Don't show it, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:30.202]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:30.202 --> 02:47:35.843]  Good music right here.
[02:47:35.843 --> 02:47:36.583]  California Dreams?
[02:47:39.326 --> 02:47:41.252]  I found a little shirt for my name.
[02:47:43.846 --> 02:47:58.314]  Man, we sit here and we're confident about this, but we're seeing horrible censorship, and now PewDiePie, the number one video host in the world, over 100 billion views, 77 million subscribers, the list goes on and on.
[02:47:58.314 --> 02:48:11.821]  They're calling him a Nazi for having a short haircut and wearing round glasses, and in one video game, where he plays video games every day online, some guy had Rabbi Shekel's name, and he laughs and said, oh look, that guy shot somebody, another person, and that turns into he's a Nazi.
[02:48:13.032 --> 02:48:40.883]  The authoritarianism of the digital Nazis is simply unprecedented, and to see them making this move, Owen, you made the point during the break, Michael Savage is number one in all the big cities he's on in his time slot, number one on the big New York station, and they're taking him from three hours to one hour, not letting him tell the world he's really being cancelled, to give it to Ben Shapiro, who has terrible ratings and went into talk radio just a few months ago, that's like, that's like giving
[02:48:42.927 --> 02:48:47.391]  Somebody, you know, who can't even, who's not out of diapers yet, letting them drive a car.
[02:48:47.391 --> 02:48:51.815]  And it just shows how this guy is a complete puppet and will do whatever he's told.
[02:48:51.815 --> 02:49:04.546]  Well, and to me, I think it sucks just for the radio industry in general, Alex, because what you've just done on a lot of these syndicated stations that Savage was on is you've probably now killed those radio stations.
[02:49:04.546 --> 02:49:06.728]  They're not going to be able to sell advertising.
[02:49:06.728 --> 02:49:10.111]  They're not going to be able to probably exist much longer or at least have big ratings like they did with Savage.
[02:49:10.111 --> 02:49:11.191]  There'll just be a bunch of hype at first.
[02:49:11.191 --> 02:49:12.492]  Oh my god, Ben Shapiro's here.
[02:49:12.492 --> 02:49:13.512]  Oh, he's such a genius.
[02:49:13.512 --> 02:49:15.333]  The liberals told me he's a genius.
[02:49:15.333 --> 02:49:18.755]  And it'll die down after a month or two and the ratings will be kaput.
[02:49:18.755 --> 02:49:22.776]  And unfortunately, I think this is probably going to kill a lot of radio stations, Alex.
[02:49:22.776 --> 02:49:25.257]  I mean, you know... Well, they could just pick our show up.
[02:49:25.257 --> 02:49:26.418]  Of course they can.
[02:49:26.418 --> 02:49:28.559]  I mean, radio stations pick our show up and they don't even tell us.
[02:49:29.468 --> 02:49:31.710]  Well, what I like, well that's we don't tell them.
[02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:37.075]  We don't list a list of them because we don't want the couple leftists to call up and it's all empty threats.
[02:49:37.075 --> 02:49:40.078]  But, Owen, this shows to me what we already know.
[02:49:40.078 --> 02:49:41.039]  They're making their move on Trump.
[02:49:41.039 --> 02:49:42.080]  They are going after everybody.
[02:49:43.752 --> 02:49:44.333]  Well, let's see.
[02:49:44.333 --> 02:49:50.278]  If you remove Alex Jones from the internet, which is what they've effectively done, removing him from social media, which here's a perfect example.
[02:49:50.278 --> 02:49:55.383]  Like last night, Alex, you see the narrative come out how they're going to indict President Trump.
[02:49:55.383 --> 02:49:58.166]  So you're like, OK, look, I'm competitive.
[02:49:58.166 --> 02:50:00.708]  I mean, InfoWars is competitive with Fox News, folks.
[02:50:00.708 --> 02:50:01.249]  And we are.
[02:50:01.249 --> 02:50:03.391]  We've already trumped CNN and MSNBC.
[02:50:03.391 --> 02:50:04.131]  We're on this.
[02:50:04.131 --> 02:50:05.873]  We had way more subscribers than all of them combined.
[02:50:05.993 --> 02:50:12.577]  So what happens is, Alex, you realize your role in the information war, and you have to counter this narrative.
[02:50:12.577 --> 02:50:15.479]  So we go live last night, but guess what?
[02:50:15.479 --> 02:50:17.541]  You're not allowed to go on the main highway.
[02:50:17.541 --> 02:50:22.724]  You're not allowed to go into the arena where all the eyes are, because they don't want you countering the narrative.
[02:50:22.724 --> 02:50:27.427]  They want to be able to say whatever it is, totally unchecked, and you're not able to access it.
[02:50:27.427 --> 02:50:28.288]  Here's an example.
[02:50:28.288 --> 02:50:33.491]  Five, six weeks ago, when the Yellow Vest thing started, they were nationalist, anti-globalist, anti-open borders.
[02:50:33.491 --> 02:50:35.112]  The media said, no, they're anti-gas tax.
[02:50:35.112 --> 02:50:35.753]  Well, that was part of it.
[02:50:36.314 --> 02:50:40.639]  And then five weeks later they go, okay, now it's turned into a nationalist movement.
[02:50:40.639 --> 02:50:43.003]  But it shows how they try to brand everything up front.
[02:50:43.003 --> 02:50:49.672]  And they don't want us there to go, no, here's interviews with Yellow Vest, we sent reporters there, here's what they're all saying, why are you here?
[02:50:49.672 --> 02:50:53.337]  New World Order, open borders, radical Islam, taxes are too high.
[02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:59.590]  And the same cliche that we hear, first impressions, you know, you only get one and they're the most important.
[02:50:59.590 --> 02:51:01.290]  That's what happens with these narratives.
[02:51:01.290 --> 02:51:06.411]  So the first narrative you see on a topic on television or wherever, that's the one you believe.
[02:51:06.411 --> 02:51:10.872]  And so that's why they have to totally eradicate you from the airwaves.
[02:51:10.872 --> 02:51:12.432]  And the same thing goes for Michael Savage.
[02:51:12.432 --> 02:51:17.473]  Now, Savage, you know, I don't necessarily think his role is countering narratives.
[02:51:17.473 --> 02:51:18.113]  He does that.
[02:51:18.113 --> 02:51:19.133]  But his role is, guess what?
[02:51:19.133 --> 02:51:20.254]  He's a nationalist.
[02:51:20.254 --> 02:51:21.134]  He's real.
[02:51:21.134 --> 02:51:22.534]  He doesn't buy corporate media.
[02:51:23.114 --> 02:51:28.059]  So they're just going down the list and whoever is helping Americana, they're removing ahead of the big event, taking President Trump out, which is why
[02:51:42.478 --> 02:51:49.600]  He's got to understand Fox News is making their move on Hannity and everybody right now, and they're going to do it right before they get Trump.
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:55.942]  And you'll know, right before they get Trump, whether it's assassination or whatever it's going to be, Sean Hannity will be taken off the air.
[02:51:55.942 --> 02:51:56.842]  Yeah, watch Hannity.
[02:51:56.842 --> 02:52:01.484]  And then Sean Hannity will like, he'll get hit by a car by outside his house.
[02:52:01.484 --> 02:52:02.664]  They're going to kill Sean Hannity.
[02:52:02.664 --> 02:52:03.544]  They're going to kill him.
[02:52:03.544 --> 02:52:04.645]  Or yeah, Tucker Carlson.
[02:52:04.645 --> 02:52:05.325]  Oh, same thing with me.
[02:52:05.325 --> 02:52:08.466]  If you hear Alex Jones is dead, you better be, it's on.
[02:52:08.846 --> 02:52:13.952]  Well, and I don't know if you've talked to Michael Savage about this either, and this is a little more inside baseball.
[02:52:13.952 --> 02:52:16.075]  Michael Savage and Laura Ingraham, really good friends.
[02:52:16.075 --> 02:52:21.842]  Laura Ingraham got a program on Fox News about six months ago, promised Michael Savage she would have him on.
[02:52:21.842 --> 02:52:22.462]  Promised!
[02:52:22.462 --> 02:52:25.005]  Said, don't worry Michael, I'm gonna beat your blacklist, I'm gonna have you on.
[02:52:25.005 --> 02:52:25.165]  Nope.
[02:52:26.127 --> 02:52:26.707]  Nope.
[02:52:26.707 --> 02:52:28.288]  And she still goes on every night.
[02:52:28.288 --> 02:52:29.629]  I'm not talking trash on Laura Ingraham.
[02:52:29.629 --> 02:52:30.330]  That's just how it works.
[02:52:30.330 --> 02:52:32.011]  The point is, it's how controlled.
[02:52:32.011 --> 02:52:33.712]  It's not like we're trying to get on Fox.
[02:52:33.712 --> 02:52:35.293]  It's because Savage wouldn't sell out to Fox.
[02:52:35.293 --> 02:52:38.955]  They tried to give me Fox news shows with ManCow and stuff.
[02:52:38.955 --> 02:52:39.776]  And it was just stupid.
[02:52:39.776 --> 02:52:41.397]  It was weekend shows and I wasn't going to do it.
[02:52:41.397 --> 02:52:43.338]  The point is, that's what's going on.
[02:52:43.338 --> 02:52:45.079]  This shows us the canary in the coal mine.
[02:52:45.079 --> 02:52:46.460]  They're taking everybody off.
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:48.582]  That's why.
[02:52:48.582 --> 02:52:50.063]  They've got the Southern Property Law Center.
[02:52:51.414 --> 02:52:59.209]  Through local fake journalists sending out fake things we never said or did to stations and saying, take them off and sending them to the corporate heads of it.
[02:52:59.209 --> 02:53:02.074]  A lot of stations have said, well, this makes us mad.
[02:53:02.074 --> 02:53:03.116]  We're going to take it from at night.
[02:53:04.398 --> 02:53:06.699]  During the day, we're not going to be intimidated.
[02:53:06.699 --> 02:53:10.921]  But one station said, OK, Sacramento, we're breaking this news.
[02:53:10.921 --> 02:53:15.683]  We're going to take you off, Alex, because, well, the owners, they just don't want the trouble.
[02:53:15.683 --> 02:53:18.285]  Well, see, the trouble is the left is the trouble.
[02:53:18.285 --> 02:53:20.446]  We're covering what's really happening.
[02:53:20.446 --> 02:53:22.187]  And again, I run my own show.
[02:53:22.187 --> 02:53:24.508]  I'm not and I get Savage follows his contract.
[02:53:24.508 --> 02:53:26.829]  Savage cannot tell the world through his lawyer.
[02:53:27.935 --> 02:53:36.138]  His lawyer, though, came out and obliquely said, well, they took Alex Jones off and others, and that's what this probably really is, and, you know, they're not just really cutting his show.
[02:53:36.138 --> 02:53:37.778]  He's not happy about this.
[02:53:37.778 --> 02:53:39.519]  He's got the best ratings ever.
[02:53:39.519 --> 02:53:42.540]  They're about to just take him fully off the air.
[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:44.421]  They just don't want it to be a big thing.
[02:53:44.421 --> 02:53:52.524]  They want to just transfer the audience happily over to Ben Shapiro, steal it, and then just send him off into the sunset.
[02:53:52.524 --> 02:53:55.205]  But again, it's not just the money of his contract they've got to pay out.
[02:53:55.205 --> 02:53:56.025]  He doesn't care about the money.
[02:53:57.085 --> 02:54:05.253]  Michael Savage, obviously, they'll sue him if he talks about what's really going on.
[02:54:05.253 --> 02:54:07.294]  It's the same thing with Gavin McGinnis.
[02:54:07.294 --> 02:54:12.980]  You know, Gavin McGinnis, I get this from Gavin, I got it from somebody else, he has to go out and say Glenn Beck's a wonderful person.
[02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:17.163]  No, the day after Glenn Beck took over CRTV, he was fired.
[02:54:17.163 --> 02:54:19.285]  And so, it's the same crap.
[02:54:19.285 --> 02:54:21.788]  And then, you know, Glenn Beck has him on and pats him on the head and does all this.
[02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:25.812]  These white shoe-boy SOBs have a formula.
[02:54:25.812 --> 02:54:26.552]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:54:26.552 --> 02:54:28.013]  There's one organization.
[02:54:28.013 --> 02:54:28.854]  Well, there's Drudge Report.
[02:54:28.854 --> 02:54:29.714]  That's two.
[02:54:29.714 --> 02:54:31.015]  There's Drudge Report and Infowars.
[02:54:31.015 --> 02:54:33.917]  DrudgeReport.com, NewsWars.com, Infowars.com.
[02:54:33.917 --> 02:54:34.637]  There's Alex Jones.
[02:54:34.637 --> 02:54:35.678]  There's Matt Drudge.
[02:54:35.678 --> 02:54:39.300]  Those are the only things that are independent and free other than President Trump.
[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:39.801]  Okay?
[02:54:39.801 --> 02:54:40.761]  Nothing else is free.
[02:54:40.761 --> 02:54:43.903]  Everybody else is under Fox News or under the Republican Party.
[02:54:43.903 --> 02:54:44.684]  They all get threatened.
[02:54:44.684 --> 02:54:46.265]  Their wives get threatened.
[02:54:46.265 --> 02:54:47.906]  Their families get... Let me tell you, folks.
[02:54:47.906 --> 02:54:50.287]  The stuff... And I'm not complaining.
[02:54:50.287 --> 02:54:51.128]  I mean, I asked for this fight.
[02:54:52.349 --> 02:54:54.756]  The stuff they do behind the scenes, the crap they pull.
[02:54:55.765 --> 02:54:59.566]  And you really learn, this is a group of thugs, of bullies, of criminals.
[02:54:59.566 --> 02:55:01.046]  Of course we've got to fight them.
[02:55:01.046 --> 02:55:04.547]  And the fact that you've been standing with us has changed the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:04.547 --> 02:55:07.788]  That's why today, go to m4warrestore.com.
[02:55:07.788 --> 02:55:08.428]  Today and tomorrow.
[02:55:08.428 --> 02:55:12.089]  Get your orders in by noon, because we can get them out that day.
[02:55:12.089 --> 02:55:15.470]  But it's guaranteed you'll get it before Christmas if you get them in by tomorrow at about noon.
[02:55:15.470 --> 02:55:18.131]  Most places you can even get them in, you know, by Friday and you'll get them.
[02:55:18.131 --> 02:55:23.152]  But to be guaranteed anywhere, the 50 states, that means Hawaii, Alaska, everything.
[02:55:24.562 --> 02:55:32.144]  Infowarstore.com, store-wide free shipping, free t-shirt in every order, 50 to 75% off.
[02:55:32.144 --> 02:55:38.146]  Everything is at cost or a loss leader to urine clearance, but it's all our best items.
[02:55:38.146 --> 02:55:53.111]  X2, X3, Supramel Vitality, Alpha Power, Brain Force Plus, the ultimate nootropic, the amazing concentrated fluoride-free iodine, coital silver fortified super blue toothpaste for adults and children, and the mouthwash, and the immune gargle.
[02:55:53.111 --> 02:55:53.511]  It's all.
[02:55:55.373 --> 02:56:01.079]  50 to 75% off and you get the t-shirt and you get the free shipping.
[02:56:01.079 --> 02:56:02.100]  So let me explain.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:05.403]  You buy a $7 tube of toothpaste.
[02:56:05.403 --> 02:56:07.786]  You get a t-shirt, costs us like $5.
[02:56:07.786 --> 02:56:08.947]  You get free shipping.
[02:56:08.947 --> 02:56:11.270]  So we're losing money on that because the toothpaste costs like $3 too.
[02:56:12.489 --> 02:56:14.010]  But I want you to experience how great it is.
[02:56:14.010 --> 02:56:23.213]  Knockout, DNA Force, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Super Silver Wound Gel, highest rated in the country, approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sale.
[02:56:23.213 --> 02:56:24.994]  Ours is a private label, $10 less.
[02:56:24.994 --> 02:56:27.495]  What you get in major stores is the strongest out there.
[02:56:27.495 --> 02:56:32.557]  A lot of big combo deals, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:32.557 --> 02:56:40.200]  Owen, when you, obviously news is breaking all the time, when you host the War Room, in about an hour and five minutes from now at 3 o'clock Central, what are you going to be covering?
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:41.642]  Well, all kinds of news.
[02:56:41.642 --> 02:56:48.030]  I'm going to be talking about the billions of dollars of aid that we just gave to Mexico, but we can't get a wall.
[02:56:48.030 --> 02:56:52.636]  We're going to talk about some interesting stuff happening in Texas right now when it comes to
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:57:02.024]  First, a teacher losing her job because she says she won't sign a compact not to boycott, saying she won't boycott Israel.
[02:57:02.024 --> 02:57:08.506]  Then you've got a story talking about all these Muslim schools that have been popping up in Texas, so that's a local issue.
[02:57:08.506 --> 02:57:18.331]  And then, by the way, this is kind of crazy, and I wasn't planning on talking about this, there was a admitted ISIS terrorist that was arrested that just got released here in Texas as well, so that's crazy.
[02:57:18.331 --> 02:57:22.653]  We'll be covering a lot of Trump's new texts today, Flynn's
[02:57:23.593 --> 02:57:26.296]  Case in court today and what that means.
[02:57:26.296 --> 02:57:30.021]  And a lot more stuff, Alex, on The War Room, which is right there.
[02:57:30.021 --> 02:57:33.344]  Not quite as banned as the Alex Jones Show yet, but right there along with it.
[02:57:33.344 --> 02:57:34.526]  And that's the key, folks.
[02:57:34.526 --> 02:57:34.986]  We love you.
[02:57:34.986 --> 02:57:35.507]  We appreciate you.
[02:57:35.507 --> 02:57:36.087]  You're awesome.
[02:57:36.087 --> 02:57:38.150]  I can't think of words to describe how great you are.
[02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:43.276]  Only you can hand link and text message folks about the local stations and about the Internet.
[02:57:43.276 --> 02:57:43.596]  Stay with us.
[02:57:43.596 --> 02:57:44.117]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:45.256 --> 02:57:51.760]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:58.584]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:58.584 --> 02:58:14.114]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:58:15.276 --> 02:58:19.097]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[02:58:46.912 --> 02:58:52.959]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.959 --> 02:58:55.883]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[02:58:55.883 --> 02:59:00.008]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[02:59:00.008 --> 02:59:00.448]  We're the top
[02:59:01.505 --> 02:59:10.632]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:10.632 --> 02:59:15.977]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:35.532]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:45.900]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:59:49.338 --> 02:59:51.983]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.326 --> 03:00:20.131]  Alright, there he is folks, Paul Joseph Watson from her Britannic Majesties, England.
[03:00:20.131 --> 03:00:24.094]  We'll be introducing him coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:24.094 --> 03:00:27.477]  Now, by the way, Paul's back in the news.
[03:00:27.477 --> 03:00:35.744]  That's right, they've come out and said that he's a fake news person, that the video of Acosta touching and grabbing and shoving the woman is a lie, a deep fake.
[03:00:37.282 --> 03:00:37.823]  That's right.
[03:00:37.823 --> 03:00:41.590]  This is true evidence of their attempts at mind control.
[03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:43.373]  But what about these articles?
[03:00:43.373 --> 03:00:44.596]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[03:00:44.596 --> 03:00:48.603]  Chinese internment camp factory sends sportswear to the US.
[03:00:49.411 --> 03:00:55.856]  Now they'd never talk about this when Obama was in, but now that Trump's in there's at least some soul in the mainstream media.
[03:00:55.856 --> 03:01:04.123]  Barbed wire and hundreds of cameras ring a massive compound of more than 30 dormitory schools, warehouses and workshops in China's far west.
[03:01:04.123 --> 03:01:15.112]  Dozens of armed officers and a growing Doberman stand, a growling Doberman stand guard outside behind locked gates, men and women are selling sportswear that can end up on U.S.
[03:01:15.112 --> 03:01:17.214]  college campuses and sports teams.
[03:01:17.794 --> 03:01:19.596]  So, more and more, this is coming out.
[03:01:19.596 --> 03:01:24.300]  The glories of communism, meanwhile, where they've banned Christianity.
[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:30.906]  Washington City evicts baby Jesus from Public Park after a handful of complaints, but relocations sparked dozens more complaints.
[03:01:30.906 --> 03:01:36.372]  And the way this happens is, two or three leftists call the radio station, never even listened to it, don't care.
[03:01:37.366 --> 03:01:42.107]  They'd steal your birthright in a second, and then say, take Alex Jones off, he's a Nazi.
[03:01:42.107 --> 03:01:46.188]  Oh God, it was in the paper, they say they're a Nazi, better take him off.
[03:01:46.188 --> 03:01:49.429]  That's the newspaper, why it's big and powerful.
[03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:50.950]  No, no one reads it.
[03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:51.990]  It's all a con game.
[03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:53.030]  Same thing here.
[03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:56.311]  Take down this thing, we're complaining, and then a hundred people get mad.
[03:01:56.311 --> 03:01:58.492]  It's all crap, it's the mouse that roared.
[03:01:58.632 --> 03:02:04.200]  Well, it's these leftist email chains that I'm on a few of them and I suggest Infowarriors out there do this.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:04.981]  I mean, honestly.
[03:02:04.981 --> 03:02:06.844]  Go sign up for Sleeping Giants.
[03:02:06.844 --> 03:02:14.575]  Yeah, you sign up for these leftist email chains in your local area and they'll send out all their directives and you can get ahead of them and kind of stop some of them, actually.
[03:02:15.419 --> 03:02:18.540]  I was able to do a couple of those here in Austin, Texas.
[03:02:18.540 --> 03:02:22.862]  You just go out and like, oh, they're going to call on this day.
[03:02:22.862 --> 03:02:28.585]  So, you know, you call, you could actually call first and be like, hey, I want to warn you, you're about to get a hundred calls from leftists complaining about this nativity scene.
[03:02:28.585 --> 03:02:29.265]  It's all fake.
[03:02:29.265 --> 03:02:30.726]  It's all been manufactured.
[03:02:30.726 --> 03:02:33.527]  So then you kind of soften the blow when they hear it and they're like, oh.
[03:02:33.527 --> 03:02:37.489]  And again, they just, oh, they don't care if it's a mosque, they don't care if it's a satanic temple thing.
[03:02:37.489 --> 03:02:41.110]  They just crave controlling Christians because we're the producers.
[03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:42.211]  They see us as their food.
[03:02:42.711 --> 03:02:51.975]  Actually, Alex, there is one thing I want to mention because I think it's indicative as to exactly where the Democrats want to take America versus anyone who's not a Democrat.
[03:02:51.975 --> 03:02:53.956]  A story came out in the USA Today yesterday.
[03:02:53.956 --> 03:02:57.157]  The 50 most expensive zip codes in the United States.
[03:02:57.157 --> 03:02:58.838]  Every one of them is liberal.
[03:02:58.838 --> 03:02:59.518]  They're rent-seekers.
[03:03:00.831 --> 03:03:05.932]  They were all in New York or California, and I think it was, I think it was 40 of them.
[03:03:05.932 --> 03:03:07.413]  40 of them were in California.
[03:03:07.413 --> 03:03:08.873]  So think about this, Alex.
[03:03:08.873 --> 03:03:25.397]  The state of California, which has the highest debt of any other state, which has the most poverty, most drug use, most homelessness, most literally feces on the streets of any other state in the United States, and yet they have all the richest people too.
[03:03:25.977 --> 03:03:28.458]  Isn't it amazing how that works in Democrat California?
[03:03:28.458 --> 03:03:38.302]  So you have the wealthiest people in California with the most money and the best land, and then you have the poorest people that get their drugs and feces ridden streets to live on.
[03:03:38.302 --> 03:03:39.623]  That's California!
[03:03:39.623 --> 03:03:41.243]  That's the Democrat America!
[03:03:41.243 --> 03:03:43.024]  That's socialism right there!
[03:03:44.329 --> 03:03:47.050]  Just like Venezuela or anywhere else, they do this on purpose.
[03:03:47.050 --> 03:03:48.250]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[03:03:48.250 --> 03:03:48.930]  Keep them poor.
[03:03:48.930 --> 03:03:49.650]  Keep them desperate.
[03:03:49.650 --> 03:03:50.851]  Keep them dumb.
[03:03:50.851 --> 03:03:53.211]  I'm just amazed that people don't see this, Alex.
[03:03:53.211 --> 03:03:55.752]  I mean, this is not rhetoric.
[03:03:55.752 --> 03:03:56.672]  This isn't hyperbole.
[03:03:56.672 --> 03:03:58.332]  I'm not suggesting anything.
[03:03:58.332 --> 03:03:59.953]  This isn't bias.
[03:03:59.953 --> 03:04:00.953]  It's a fact!
[03:04:00.953 --> 03:04:01.593]  It's a fact.
[03:04:01.593 --> 03:04:03.393]  These people are inherently evil.
[03:04:03.393 --> 03:04:06.474]  Owen Schroyer, in about 55 minutes, you take over three hours.
[03:04:06.474 --> 03:04:07.614]  The War Room.
[03:04:07.614 --> 03:04:08.234]  Godspeed.
[03:04:08.234 --> 03:04:09.455]  Great job, my friend.
[03:04:09.455 --> 03:04:10.175]  Now, tell everybody again.
[03:04:11.678 --> 03:04:13.820]  They say I'm banned on all this social media.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:15.441]  They'd already shadow banned us a few years ago.
[03:04:15.441 --> 03:04:19.464]  You on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube can promote NewsWars.com.
[03:04:19.464 --> 03:04:21.245]  It doesn't get blocked as the bots as much.
[03:04:21.245 --> 03:04:26.209]  We're going to launch new websites that are easy to promote as well that just mirror our information.
[03:04:26.209 --> 03:04:29.471]  You can't be stopped from plugging that local radio station that carries the show.
[03:04:29.471 --> 03:04:36.236]  You can't be stopped from texting your friends and family and sending them articles and videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:36.596 --> 03:04:38.197]  Or Paul Watson's videos on YouTube.
[03:04:38.197 --> 03:04:38.938]  Get them.
[03:04:38.938 --> 03:04:39.438]  Get them out.
[03:04:39.438 --> 03:04:40.459]  Realize it's a war.
[03:04:40.459 --> 03:04:42.160]  And you are the majority.
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:44.102]  Black, white, old, young that live with liberty.
[03:04:44.102 --> 03:04:45.002]  You take action.
[03:04:45.002 --> 03:04:46.664]  Nothing can stop you.
[03:04:46.664 --> 03:04:49.346]  Let's introduce Paul Watson in 60 seconds.
[03:04:49.346 --> 03:04:50.266]  And then I'm ejecting.

[03:06:05.012 --> 03:06:09.856]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:06:09.856 --> 03:06:11.517]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:11.517 --> 03:06:13.299]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:13.299 --> 03:06:19.884]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.884 --> 03:06:22.066]  And Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Schroer.
[03:06:22.066 --> 03:06:26.489]  I'm getting out of here in a few minutes because Paul's always got a ton of important things to cover.
[03:06:26.489 --> 03:06:28.251]  But he's in the news again today.
[03:06:29.386 --> 03:06:33.007]  Like PewDiePie, so I thought we would get his take on that.
[03:06:33.007 --> 03:06:38.629]  But first, it is your last chance today and tomorrow, anywhere in the continental U.S.

[03:06:54.620 --> 03:06:55.961]  Here's a bottle of X3.
[03:06:55.961 --> 03:06:58.402]  Here's a bottle of Supermill Vitality.
[03:06:58.402 --> 03:07:00.182]  Here is an Infowars t-shirt.
[03:07:00.182 --> 03:07:01.503]  Oh, they're going to get a t-shirt.

[03:07:15.969 --> 03:07:16.969]  It's a clearance sale.
[03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:17.990]  Never had a sale this big.
[03:07:19.457 --> 03:07:23.939]  It's really our thank you to you, plus I think the products are so good, a lot of you that haven't tried them are gonna get hooked on them.
[03:07:23.939 --> 03:07:26.620]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:29.181]  Globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[03:07:29.181 --> 03:07:33.122]  Well, the 12 Days of Christmas ends tomorrow.
[03:07:33.122 --> 03:07:38.524]  To get the biggest deals in our history, without you, the globalists will shut us down with your help.
[03:07:38.524 --> 03:07:41.265]  We're gonna give them one hell of a fight.
[03:07:41.265 --> 03:07:45.727]  So help me stay on the horse here and get great products and don't fight the crowds, the traffic.
[03:07:46.914 --> 03:07:48.695]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:07:48.695 --> 03:07:53.278]  Just make sure, though, again, you have that note in the package if you're going to be sending it out to friends or family.
[03:07:53.278 --> 03:07:56.000]  You don't have to get it yourself and mail it back out.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.982]  Just, you know, put the mailing address when you pay for it.
[03:07:58.982 --> 03:08:01.844]  Make sure the mailing address is the address you want it sent to.
[03:08:01.844 --> 03:08:02.585]  They'll see the address.
[03:08:02.585 --> 03:08:03.125]  They'll open it up.
[03:08:03.125 --> 03:08:04.266]  There'll be a note there.
[03:08:04.266 --> 03:08:09.229]  At checkout, you can put a note and say, hey, it's your dad, it's your mom, or it's whoever.
[03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.830]  Here is the gift.
[03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:11.911]  That way, you're not just buying for yourself.
[03:08:11.911 --> 03:08:12.912]  You're buying for others.
[03:08:12.912 --> 03:08:15.514]  You're not just in your own town and getting it and having to mail it to them later.
[03:08:16.923 --> 03:08:21.170]  Whatever you do, take action, because the globalists are moving on everybody.
[03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:28.904]  I mean, look, I feel more hurt by Michael Savage, what he's going through, than I even feel for myself, because when one of us is getting picked on and screwed over,
[03:08:30.181 --> 03:08:30.702]  I feel it.
[03:08:30.702 --> 03:08:32.063]  That's called empathy.
[03:08:32.063 --> 03:08:34.645]  And the psychopaths think that's a weakness and that's our strength.
[03:08:34.645 --> 03:08:43.133]  But I feel bad for him because he's under the control of that big CBS syndicator and they've made a deal to put Ben Shapiro in his show even though his ratings are number one.
[03:08:43.133 --> 03:08:45.054]  I mean this is outrageous.
[03:08:45.054 --> 03:08:47.657]  And then his contract, he can't tell you what they're doing to him.
[03:08:48.362 --> 03:08:50.403]  Well, this is the layers of arrogance, though, Alex.
[03:08:50.403 --> 03:08:54.006]  It's just like they thought they could kind of ghost you on social media with the shadow bands.
[03:08:54.006 --> 03:08:54.787]  You were still effective.
[03:08:54.787 --> 03:08:55.927]  You were still number one.
[03:08:55.927 --> 03:08:57.669]  So they just went ahead and just chopped you off.
[03:08:57.669 --> 03:08:58.269]  Same with Savage.
[03:08:58.269 --> 03:09:00.110]  They thought, oh, let's just keep him off Fox News.
[03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:01.571]  We'll keep him on these little radio stations.
[03:09:01.571 --> 03:09:02.632]  He'll have no impact.
[03:09:02.632 --> 03:09:04.053]  He won't be able to sell any books.
[03:09:04.053 --> 03:09:07.776]  Every book he writes becomes the number one bestseller, you know, on New York Times or whatever.
[03:09:07.776 --> 03:09:11.118]  So that's their problem, is they can't stop us.
[03:09:11.118 --> 03:09:12.739]  They can't stop us, so they have to kill us.
[03:09:12.739 --> 03:09:13.199]  That's right.
[03:09:13.199 --> 03:09:14.440]  You're coming up in about 50 minutes.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:16.482]  Paul Watson, make this announcement.
[03:09:17.179 --> 03:09:18.372]  We may have to let Paul go.
[03:09:20.241 --> 03:09:29.789]  Poodiepie lost his Disney contract because he wouldn't go under their control and let YouTube control him with his 77 million subscribers and 100 billion or whatever it is viewers.
[03:09:29.789 --> 03:09:32.231]  Well, so many views.
[03:09:32.231 --> 03:09:36.294]  The Vox is reporting, Wall Street Journal's reporting, Poodiepie, what's the proof?
[03:09:36.294 --> 03:09:39.577]  He wears wire glasses that are somewhat similar to Himmler.
[03:09:39.577 --> 03:09:41.979]  That's a fake photo of Himmler and it's worse.
[03:09:41.979 --> 03:09:43.540]  He's got a haircut like Paul Watson.
[03:09:43.540 --> 03:09:46.543]  Exhibit A. Can we get a shot of Paul, please, on screen?
[03:09:46.543 --> 03:09:47.344]  Full screen for Paul, please.
[03:09:48.220 --> 03:09:49.902]  Paul, gotta let you go, dude.
[03:09:49.902 --> 03:09:51.543]  You got a Hitler haircut.
[03:09:51.543 --> 03:09:56.367]  They even said in the news it's a Hitler haircut, so it's over for you.
[03:09:56.367 --> 03:09:58.650]  I mean, Wall Street Journal says it's the proof.
[03:09:58.650 --> 03:10:06.216]  I mean, and meanwhile, they're editing a live video on France TV, signs that say bad things about Macron.
[03:10:06.937 --> 03:10:14.340]  So they've now got running man level editing where there's an article on Infowars.com where they're covering up signs and images in live time, Paul.
[03:10:14.340 --> 03:10:20.203]  So, Paul, do you want to apologize for your Hitler haircut?
[03:10:20.203 --> 03:10:21.843]  I can only deeply apologize, Alex.
[03:10:21.843 --> 03:10:25.765]  Yeah, I think there was an article about Eric Trump about 18 months ago.
[03:10:25.765 --> 03:10:27.186]  He had a similar haircut.
[03:10:27.186 --> 03:10:31.127]  It's not because it's generally a popular haircut across the Western world, Alex.
[03:10:31.127 --> 03:10:32.988]  Obviously, that has nothing to do with it.
[03:10:32.988 --> 03:10:34.669]  It's all because we're secretly fascist.
[03:10:35.251 --> 03:10:50.994]  That PewDiePie scandal, by the way, they had a BuzzFeed reporter, Joe Bernstein, who claimed that, and you talked about this earlier, because he appeared in a game with a character called Rabbi Shekel, that was the avatar of the person playing the game, that that makes him a Nazi.
[03:10:50.994 --> 03:10:51.535]  That's like saying,
[03:10:52.248 --> 03:11:04.074]  Alex, anytime you go outside your door, anybody who you come into the near vicinity with, you automatically adopt all their political beliefs and all their extremist political beliefs.
[03:11:04.074 --> 03:11:05.895]  He was laughing at the fact that the guy
[03:11:06.883 --> 03:11:15.389]  was doing an effusive speech about how much he loved PewDiePie, and then one of the other characters in the game killed him, so his audio was cut off.
[03:11:15.389 --> 03:11:17.690]  That's what was funny about it.
[03:11:17.690 --> 03:11:23.154]  He claimed, Bernstein of BuzzFeed News, that it was some anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.
[03:11:23.154 --> 03:11:26.976]  Just absolute... You're going to take over and do that, but that's what all Nazis say.
[03:11:26.976 --> 03:11:28.357]  Scroll back up for TV viewers.
[03:11:28.357 --> 03:11:30.298]  There's an article on Infowars.com.
[03:11:30.298 --> 03:11:35.302]  Government-owned French TV is now in live videos, able to edit
[03:11:36.102 --> 03:11:36.762]  I don't know.
[03:11:49.295 --> 03:11:54.158]  That the misleading video shared by Infowars editor-at-large Paul Watson was asked about the clip.
[03:11:54.158 --> 03:11:57.701]  Sanders' response is, the question is, did the reporter make contact or not?
[03:11:57.701 --> 03:11:59.502]  The video is clear, he did.
[03:11:59.502 --> 03:12:00.403]  We stand by our statement.
[03:12:00.403 --> 03:12:01.683]  All you did was zoom in.
[03:12:01.683 --> 03:12:02.464]  We've already done this.
[03:12:02.464 --> 03:12:08.848]  But they're accusing you at the media lab of a deep fake.
[03:12:08.848 --> 03:12:13.912]  A deep fake is Running Man, where Mad Dog Ben Richards actually tries to stop them killing the food riot.
[03:12:14.465 --> 03:12:18.727]  But then they edit the video and show him going, I'm going to kill them!
[03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:19.987]  You won't stop me!
[03:12:19.987 --> 03:12:21.168]  We're in Running Man right now.
[03:12:21.168 --> 03:12:23.989]  Yeah, so Paul, what do you make of this?
[03:12:23.989 --> 03:12:27.731]  French TV is doing deep fakes, you're not.
[03:12:27.731 --> 03:12:30.852]  Oh, the French TV channel, which is state-owned.
[03:12:30.852 --> 03:12:32.653]  It was just human error, Alex.
[03:12:32.653 --> 03:12:33.793]  They said it was human error.
[03:12:33.793 --> 03:12:40.156]  Just a mistake that they deliberately doctored the protest placard to edit out the insult against Macron.
[03:12:40.743 --> 03:12:46.106]  No, deepfake or a doctored video is when you deliberately edit something to mislead.
[03:12:46.106 --> 03:12:53.331]  As I said a million times and Trump backed me up on this, that wasn't doctored because I didn't deliberately edit anything to mislead.
[03:12:53.331 --> 03:13:01.215]  They used that to distract from the narrative that basically Jim Acosta put his hands on a woman when he swatted her away with his left arm.
[03:13:01.215 --> 03:13:02.816]  They used it to distract from that.
[03:13:02.816 --> 03:13:03.937]  So it's not doctored.
[03:13:03.937 --> 03:13:05.258]  That's not a deepfake.
[03:13:05.758 --> 03:13:09.080]  You can't claim that that's a deepfake when it wasn't deliberately done to mislead.
[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:14.484]  It was just a different edit, a different upload, different frame rate of a video which was... Paul, I agree.
[03:13:14.484 --> 03:13:16.466]  You're taking over right now.
[03:13:16.466 --> 03:13:17.366]  You're taking over right now.
[03:13:17.366 --> 03:13:19.428]  I agree.
[03:13:19.428 --> 03:13:22.069]  You're going to recap it all coming up.
[03:13:22.069 --> 03:13:23.530]  They're getting ready to take Trump out though.
[03:13:23.530 --> 03:13:26.993]  I mean, the fact that... Don't you agree with the fact that they're taking everybody off the air right now?
[03:13:26.993 --> 03:13:28.774]  Michael Savage, Gab McGinnis.
[03:13:28.774 --> 03:13:31.276]  I mean, this is total... This means they're making their move, Paul.
[03:13:33.132 --> 03:13:35.295]  I think the backlash is growing though, Alex.
[03:13:35.295 --> 03:13:39.620]  The response to Sorgan of Akkad losing his Patreon was vast.
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:47.690]  It's unfortunate some of these people didn't respond in kind when you were de-platformed, but Sam Harris, who is quite a mainstream intellectual,
[03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:57.834]  deleted his own Patreon account in protest against Patreon de-platforming Sargon of Akkad, who is a YouTuber, and they're losing money, they're hemorrhaging money.
[03:13:57.834 --> 03:14:01.976]  Thousands of dollars from each individual creator every day they're losing.
[03:14:01.976 --> 03:14:05.178]  They had to put out a statement and kind of backpedal on it a little bit.
[03:14:05.678 --> 03:14:07.039]  So they're in big trouble.
[03:14:07.039 --> 03:14:15.704]  So when finally starting to see a backlash, people leaving these platforms in protest against their mistreatment of their own users.
[03:14:15.704 --> 03:14:18.886]  So I think the backlash has really started in earnest now, Alex.
[03:14:18.886 --> 03:14:19.847]  All right, you're taking over.
[03:14:19.847 --> 03:14:20.307]  Great job.
[03:14:20.307 --> 03:14:26.031]  You'll also be hosting during the first hour on Thursday when Owen is going to be taking over the command base.
[03:14:26.411 --> 03:14:27.871]  Great job, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:27.871 --> 03:14:30.932]  You've got some great videos out today as well that you'll be playing and talking about.
[03:14:30.932 --> 03:14:32.172]  Paul Watson takes over.
[03:14:32.172 --> 03:14:36.413]  War Room is in 45 minutes at InfoWars.com forward slash show and local stations.
[03:14:36.413 --> 03:14:39.374]  Please spread the word.
[03:14:39.374 --> 03:14:40.214]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:14:40.214 --> 03:14:43.915]  Yeah, we're talking about today about two issues mainly.
[03:14:43.915 --> 03:14:46.515]  I've talked about it before, cultural relativism.
[03:14:46.515 --> 03:14:53.817]  You always see these stories about, you know, female backpackers going on these holidays to these remote locations in Africa, in the Middle East.
[03:14:53.817 --> 03:14:54.657]  And what happens to them?
[03:14:55.157 --> 03:15:11.393]  They wind up raped and killed and it's happened once again with two rock climbers, two mountain climbers in Morocco, a Dane and a Swede, I believe it was, who met a violent death after going to this remote location and were basically, according to some reports,
[03:15:11.873 --> 03:15:12.694]  Beheaded.
[03:15:12.694 --> 03:15:22.500]  This is not the first time we've seen this, so I'm going to get into the psychology behind that, the psychology of cultural relativism and this idea among leftists, which we've seen before.
[03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:27.083]  There was an American couple killed by ISIS recently in similar circumstances.
[03:15:27.083 --> 03:15:28.964]  This idea that evil doesn't exist.
[03:15:29.524 --> 03:15:38.052]  And that our view of other cultures being dangerous or being deadly is just because we misunderstand their cultures, when no, evil does exist.
[03:15:38.052 --> 03:15:43.458]  The world has dangerous places, it has dangerous people, and you have to be cognizant of that.
[03:15:43.458 --> 03:15:45.079]  You have to have discernment.
[03:15:45.079 --> 03:15:46.781]  So we're going to get into that and more.
[03:15:46.781 --> 03:15:51.025]  We're going to get into Harvard saying that there needs to be 50% female firefighters.
[03:15:51.605 --> 03:15:53.727]  Coming next on the Alex Jones Show Live, don't go away.
[03:15:53.727 --> 03:15:54.768]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.768 --> 03:15:58.691]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.691 --> 03:16:00.232]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.232 --> 03:16:03.194]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.194 --> 03:16:08.378]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.738 --> 03:16:09.940]  I can help you too.
[03:16:09.940 --> 03:16:12.863]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.863 --> 03:16:15.085]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:15.085 --> 03:16:19.530]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:16:23.194 --> 03:16:29.541]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.
[03:16:29.801 --> 03:16:33.644]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey Clean Water.
[03:16:33.644 --> 03:16:35.226]  The Berkey guy has you covered.
[03:16:35.226 --> 03:16:37.048]  At home, work and on the go.

[03:16:53.117 --> 03:16:56.680]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.680 --> 03:17:00.262]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.262 --> 03:17:02.383]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:17:02.383 --> 03:17:04.405]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:17:22.879 --> 03:17:26.363]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads and Pillows are often an Amazon choice.

[03:17:54.227 --> 03:18:00.631]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:18:00.631 --> 03:18:02.191]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:18:02.191 --> 03:18:07.094]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double page rate points.
[03:18:07.094 --> 03:18:10.016]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:18:10.536 --> 03:18:13.298]  A free gift with every order.
[03:18:13.298 --> 03:18:22.145]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:18:22.145 --> 03:18:25.827]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:18:25.827 --> 03:18:31.191]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:18:31.191 --> 03:18:33.573]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:18:34.113 --> 03:18:38.974]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:18:38.974 --> 03:18:40.514]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:18:40.514 --> 03:18:42.094]  We are losing money on this.
[03:18:42.094 --> 03:18:43.515]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:18:43.515 --> 03:18:45.515]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:18:45.515 --> 03:18:46.855]  And don't fight the crowds.
[03:18:46.855 --> 03:18:51.856]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:18:51.856 --> 03:18:54.317]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:18:54.317 --> 03:19:02.658]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:04.681]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:19:04.681 --> 03:19:08.543]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:19:08.543 --> 03:19:13.186]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[03:19:13.186 --> 03:19:15.068]  Words are not enough.
[03:19:15.068 --> 03:19:21.252]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[03:19:21.252 --> 03:19:27.476]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalists and the dominant world force.
[03:19:27.476 --> 03:19:30.838]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:19:31.445 --> 03:19:33.365]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:19:33.365 --> 03:19:37.806]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the global anti-human future.
[03:19:37.806 --> 03:19:43.627]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:19:43.627 --> 03:19:44.847]  I am in your hands.
[03:19:44.847 --> 03:19:57.289]  And we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:19:57.289 --> 03:19:59.930]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.259 --> 03:20:14.281]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.281 --> 03:20:18.041]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:18.041 --> 03:20:20.762]  We are live.
[03:20:20.762 --> 03:20:22.722]  It's the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.722 --> 03:20:29.764]  In the next segment, we're going to play my video, which went up late last night on YouTube, the cultural significance of TikTok.
[03:20:30.754 --> 03:20:41.800]  You don't really need to understand what TikTok is to understand what's going on with Generation Z. They've basically created a trolling culture as a backlash to millennial outrage culture.
[03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:43.061]  They're into edgy humor.
[03:20:43.061 --> 03:20:44.622]  They're into edgy banter.
[03:20:44.622 --> 03:20:48.524]  And it is a ray of light because they're not of the same breed.
[03:20:48.524 --> 03:20:59.871]  They're not this safe space, permanently triggered, mentally fragile generation that we saw with the millennials who are now basically running the social media companies that are deplatforming everyone.
[03:21:00.351 --> 03:21:06.356]  So there is hope in Generation Z, which of course is people born after 1995.
[03:21:06.356 --> 03:21:12.020]  So we're going to play that video in the next segment because it is very hopeful indeed.
[03:21:12.020 --> 03:21:15.142]  But I want to talk about this in this segment.
[03:21:15.142 --> 03:21:17.804]  Headline out of Sputnik.
[03:21:17.804 --> 03:21:22.388]  Norwegian Danish female hikers reportedly meet violent death in Morocco.
[03:21:23.135 --> 03:21:32.557]  A criminal investigation has been launched after the bodies of two backpackers in their 20s were found with violent injuries reportedly caused by a sharp object.
[03:21:32.557 --> 03:21:41.038]  Now, I read another report about this out of Morocco News and it said that they were beheaded.
[03:21:41.038 --> 03:21:47.099]  Other reports say that they had their throats slit, but obviously a violent murderous attack.
[03:21:47.099 --> 03:21:51.060]  Two women, a Norwegian and a Dane, have been found dead in the mountainous area in Morocco.
[03:21:52.136 --> 03:22:02.719]  The Norwegian national broadcaster NRK reported the women were both in their 20s and were on a backpacking trip in the North African country.
[03:22:02.719 --> 03:22:09.621]  Now, of course, Morocco is noted for being very misogynistic, very hateful towards women.
[03:22:09.621 --> 03:22:19.443]  Many of the migrant rapists who have come into Europe over the past few years, including many who were involved in the mass molestation of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015, were Moroccan.
[03:22:22.071 --> 03:22:29.374]  And this goes back to something I've talked about several times before, which is both moral and cultural relativism.
[03:22:29.374 --> 03:22:34.776]  Remember the story from a few months ago about that couple?
[03:22:34.776 --> 03:22:41.099]  You had a left-wing couple who bicycled around the world to prove that the world wasn't evil.
[03:22:41.099 --> 03:22:49.342]  In fact, there was a headline, murdered by ISIS, round-the-world cyclist couple who wrote of kind lovely people in travel blog.
[03:22:50.269 --> 03:22:51.890]  The London Evening Standard.
[03:22:51.890 --> 03:23:06.276]  So basically this left-wing couple, 29 years old, vegan, vegetarian, gave up their job to travel the world by bike to prove that everybody was lovely and kind and forgiving.
[03:23:06.276 --> 03:23:13.219]  In fact, I'm going to read the quote from the guy of this couple who went on this bicycle trip around the world
[03:23:14.815 --> 03:23:18.937]  This is what he said in his own blog, which I read at length, and I'll get into that in a second.
[03:23:18.937 --> 03:23:23.418]  He said, You read the papers and you're led to believe that the world is a big scary place.
[03:23:23.418 --> 03:23:25.959]  People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted.
[03:23:25.959 --> 03:23:26.860]  People are bad.
[03:23:26.860 --> 03:23:28.060]  People are evil.
[03:23:28.060 --> 03:23:28.880]  I don't buy it.
[03:23:28.880 --> 03:23:36.844]  Evil is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own.
[03:23:36.844 --> 03:23:42.906]  By and large, humans are kind, self-interested, sometimes myopic, but kind, generous, and wonderful.
[03:23:43.466 --> 03:23:47.409]  No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.
[03:23:47.409 --> 03:23:53.374]  That couple ended up being slaughtered by ISIS terrorists.
[03:23:53.374 --> 03:23:57.678]  Which is absolutely tragic, but it's not as if it was a one-off thing, okay?
[03:23:58.590 --> 03:24:12.541]  So they made this trip on the basis that our view of evil in the West is just based on us misunderstanding other cultures and that really the vast majority of people are kind and evil doesn't really exist.
[03:24:12.541 --> 03:24:16.625]  It's just a Western misconception of other cultures.
[03:24:16.625 --> 03:24:22.049]  But if you read their blog before they died, which I did, they did about 40 blog posts.
[03:24:22.049 --> 03:24:25.192]  I read about 10 of them, if not less.
[03:24:25.192 --> 03:24:26.453]  And in every single one,
[03:24:27.119 --> 03:24:40.769]  They're mistreated by the people in these different North African and Middle Eastern countries, including Morocco, where this other couple, this female mountain couple, was just killed and beheaded potentially.
[03:24:40.769 --> 03:24:46.214]  So you read their blog and in every single instance they're getting harassed, they're getting stalked.
[03:24:46.214 --> 03:24:50.877]  In Morocco they talk about being stalked by a weird guy trying to sell them drugs.
[03:24:50.877 --> 03:24:55.841]  They talk about a guy accusing them of being racist because they refused to buy something off of him.
[03:24:56.590 --> 03:25:04.233]  They talk about one instance in Morocco where a guy literally tried to run them over with his car when they were on their bikes.
[03:25:04.233 --> 03:25:08.315]  So in almost every blog in every country they go to.
[03:25:08.315 --> 03:25:15.257]  Another case where they refused to take a photograph with somebody and the person tried to physically assault them.
[03:25:15.257 --> 03:25:20.980]  In almost every country they talk about being mistreated, being harassed, being stalked.
[03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:21.660]  In some cases
[03:25:22.390 --> 03:25:28.678]  Run over, attempted run over or violently attacked by people in all these different countries.
[03:25:28.678 --> 03:25:30.881]  Having said, oh no, evil doesn't exist.
[03:25:30.881 --> 03:25:33.384]  Everybody's kind and wonderful and lovely.
[03:25:33.384 --> 03:25:38.190]  They end up being killed by ISIS terrorists.
[03:25:38.190 --> 03:25:41.154]  Who then made an ISIS propaganda tape, again.
[03:25:42.344 --> 03:25:43.625]  Goes to the point.
[03:25:43.625 --> 03:25:45.066]  Evil exists.
[03:25:45.066 --> 03:25:48.688]  The world is not a utopia no matter how much you want it to be.
[03:25:48.688 --> 03:26:00.695]  It does not fit into your left-wing idealist version of moral relativism, of cultural relativism, where all cultures are equal and we just misunderstand them.
[03:26:00.695 --> 03:26:03.296]  No, all cultures are not equal.
[03:26:03.296 --> 03:26:06.658]  All countries are not as safe as each other.
[03:26:06.658 --> 03:26:09.059]  There are some bad people in all countries.
[03:26:09.059 --> 03:26:09.860]  I'm not saying there isn't.
[03:26:10.464 --> 03:26:19.433]  But if you go to places like Morocco, like Tajikistan, you go into these wild mountainous areas, chances are you're going to run into trouble.
[03:26:19.433 --> 03:26:26.560]  And just believing that the world is good and evil doesn't exist is not going to get you out of that situation.
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:28.482]  Now, does that mean that you should just never go anywhere?
[03:26:28.482 --> 03:26:30.283]  You should never travel the world, never do anything?
[03:26:30.283 --> 03:26:31.144]  No!
[03:26:31.144 --> 03:26:32.966]  But go in there with discernment.
[03:26:33.877 --> 03:26:39.479]  Don't go in there thinking that you're never going to be attacked, that everybody's going to be lovely and cuddly and fine.
[03:26:39.479 --> 03:26:42.401]  No, that's not how the world works.
[03:26:42.401 --> 03:26:45.022]  In fact, there was another example of this.
[03:26:45.022 --> 03:26:50.824]  Headline, New York Times, performance artist killed on peace trip is mourned.
[03:26:50.824 --> 03:27:00.949]  This was a performance artist, an Italian, who hitchhiked from the Balkans through the Middle East to send a message of peace and marriage between different peoples and nations.
[03:27:01.881 --> 03:27:11.605]  33-year-old woman, Pippa Backer, again, went on a trip to prove that the world is peaceful, sending a message of peace, Islam is a religion of peace.
[03:27:11.605 --> 03:27:12.485]  What happened?
[03:27:12.485 --> 03:27:15.886]  She was raped and strangled to death.
[03:27:15.886 --> 03:27:18.007]  You see it over and over again.
[03:27:18.007 --> 03:27:21.869]  This is the tyranny of cultural relativism.
[03:27:21.869 --> 03:27:23.489]  So you have to have discernment.
[03:27:23.489 --> 03:27:30.372]  You have to understand that evil exists, and no, it's not just us bigoted, myopic Westerners
[03:27:31.852 --> 03:27:33.413]  Misunderstanding other cultures.
[03:27:33.413 --> 03:27:34.614]  I've made the point many times.
[03:27:34.614 --> 03:27:36.195]  Some cultures are better than others.
[03:27:36.195 --> 03:27:38.277]  Some countries are better than others.
[03:27:38.277 --> 03:27:53.687]  You have to prepare if you're going to these countries, especially if you're going to these outer, wild regions where people are literally trying to run you over, where they're literally stalking you, where they're calling you racist as they harass you.
[03:27:53.687 --> 03:28:00.212]  But then you go back to your blog, which was quoted by the New York Times in the case of this couple unfortunately killed by ISIS,
[03:28:01.770 --> 03:28:04.552]  And they say no.
[03:28:04.552 --> 03:28:14.520]  The notion that the world's an evil place, that evil exists in the world, is just a complete misconception that we've invented to deal with it psychologically.
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:22.587]  And in every single case, the people who believe that, in these prominent cases at least that get in the news, end up being raped and killed.
[03:28:23.382 --> 03:28:35.332]  And it's absolutely tragic, but it goes to the heart of this ridiculous utopianism that leftists have embraced, which flies in the face of the reality of the world and that evil exists in the world.
[03:28:35.332 --> 03:28:40.997]  And it looks like it might have unfortunately happened again, with the deaths and potential beheadings.
[03:28:41.718 --> 03:28:45.600]  ...of this Norwegian and Danish hiker in Morocco.
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:49.341]  Absolutely tragic, but not unexpected.
[03:28:49.341 --> 03:28:49.822]  We'll be back.
[03:28:49.822 --> 03:28:52.523]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:28:52.523 --> 03:28:53.663]  Don't go.
[03:28:53.663 --> 03:28:55.624]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.624 --> 03:29:02.527]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.527 --> 03:29:04.988]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops.
[03:29:05.148 --> 03:29:10.849]  Your circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:16.631]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.631 --> 03:29:18.551]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:18.551 --> 03:29:20.832]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.832 --> 03:29:25.213]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:25.213 --> 03:29:27.093]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.393 --> 03:29:35.317]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:29:54.346 --> 03:29:55.686]  Everybody knows it.
[03:29:55.686 --> 03:29:57.587]  History documents it.
[03:29:57.587 --> 03:30:03.169]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[03:30:03.169 --> 03:30:04.289]  They want to abort children.
[03:30:04.289 --> 03:30:06.050]  They want to disease children.
[03:30:06.050 --> 03:30:07.170]  They want to abuse children.
[03:30:07.170 --> 03:30:08.791]  They want to confuse children.
[03:30:08.791 --> 03:30:09.971]  They want their essence.
[03:30:09.971 --> 03:30:10.932]  They want their soul.
[03:30:10.932 --> 03:30:12.252]  They want their spirit.
[03:30:12.252 --> 03:30:14.013]  They want their power.
[03:30:14.013 --> 03:30:14.993]  Because they are our future.
[03:30:16.241 --> 03:30:19.804]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, that ultimate sacrifice.
[03:30:19.804 --> 03:30:21.745]  It is about the West.
[03:30:21.745 --> 03:30:25.888]  And it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[03:30:25.888 --> 03:30:28.550]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:35.375]  And I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for Infowars.
[03:30:35.375 --> 03:30:39.178]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[03:30:39.178 --> 03:30:41.240]  You have the power to override the censors.
[03:30:41.240 --> 03:30:44.382]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[03:30:45.013 --> 03:30:54.396]  I know you've been taking action, I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[03:30:54.396 --> 03:31:02.898]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.898 --> 03:31:04.358]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:04.358 --> 03:31:09.060]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:14.061]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:14.281 --> 03:31:34.458]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.958 --> 03:31:38.941]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:31:38.941 --> 03:31:42.604]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:42.604 --> 03:31:47.608]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:31:47.608 --> 03:31:50.351]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:50.351 --> 03:31:52.792]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:54.298 --> 03:32:03.608]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:03.608 --> 03:32:06.471]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:06.471 --> 03:32:12.518]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:13.178 --> 03:32:19.441]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:19.441 --> 03:32:25.745]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.745 --> 03:32:32.668]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.809 --> 03:32:35.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:10.515 --> 03:33:15.437]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:33:15.437 --> 03:33:18.578]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.578 --> 03:33:21.939]  But Paul, TikTok's just a mindless app for teenagers.
[03:33:21.939 --> 03:33:23.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:25.280]  It's mostly that, fair enough.
[03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:27.061]  But something else is going on.
[03:33:27.061 --> 03:33:31.783]  In 2018, TikTok garnered more downloads than YouTube, Facebook or Instagram.
[03:33:31.783 --> 03:33:38.185]  And as even its most ardent haters admit, it has gained a foothold in the psyche of tomorrow's young adult.
[03:33:38.505 --> 03:33:39.626]  What is TikTok?
[03:33:39.626 --> 03:33:47.856]  It's basically a platform for users to create 15-second videos which normally take the format of dancing, lip-syncing, comedy, or memes.
[03:33:47.856 --> 03:33:57.266]  It's also the latest frontline in the culture war between millennials and Generation Z. Why is the media slowly beginning to churn out hit pieces against TikTok?
[03:33:57.366 --> 03:34:03.408]  Why are lefty tech bloggers like Taylor Lorenz becoming increasingly more condescending towards TikTok users?
[03:34:03.408 --> 03:34:11.530]  Why is Twitter littered with complaints from social justice warriors that TikTok is a platform for toxic masculinity and internalized misogyny?
[03:34:11.530 --> 03:34:16.792]  Why are millennial moral gatekeepers becoming so nervous about TikTok?
[03:34:16.792 --> 03:34:25.595]  Because any aspect of youth culture that they don't control, which allows for anything other than anodyne, sterile, predictable, obedience,
[03:34:26.155 --> 03:34:27.116]  terrifies them.
[03:34:27.116 --> 03:34:30.980]  They're constantly trying to tear down PewDiePie for the same reason.
[03:34:30.980 --> 03:34:31.941]  TikTok, you know what?
[03:34:31.941 --> 03:34:37.646]  We're not so different, you and I. They're constantly trying to tear down meme culture in general for the same reason.
[03:34:37.646 --> 03:34:49.457]  If they can't segregate it into echo chambers, if they can't censor it, if they can't ban it, if in many cases they can't even understand it, then it represents a threat to their colonization of society.
[03:34:49.557 --> 03:35:02.445]  As Joshua Sitarella writes, 4chan trolling culture and ironic conservatism has seeped deeply into the mainstream of Gen Z's online experience, and TikTok is merely a reflection of that tendency.
[03:35:02.445 --> 03:35:08.008]  I'm here to tell you that there's actually only one gender, and that gender is male.
[03:35:08.008 --> 03:35:09.609]  Women are property.
[03:35:09.609 --> 03:35:13.872]  Easily the most famous and widely replicated TikTok, the hit or miss song.
[03:35:15.651 --> 03:35:18.953]  Hit or miss, I guess they never miss, huh?
[03:35:18.953 --> 03:35:22.595]  You got a boyfriend, I bet he doesn't kiss ya!
[03:35:22.595 --> 03:35:25.777]  He gon' find another girl and he won't miss ya!
[03:35:25.777 --> 03:35:28.378]  He gon' skip then hit the dab like Wiz Khalifa!
[03:35:28.378 --> 03:35:29.059]  Yeah, that one.
[03:35:29.059 --> 03:35:34.682]  The lyrics to the original are somewhat socially conservative, because they condemn ethos and porn stars.
[03:35:34.682 --> 03:35:39.244]  This is the perfect example of why I only enjoy TikTok, just making fun of these thirsty for attention girls.
[03:35:39.244 --> 03:35:44.427]  Probably the second most famous and widely replicated TikTok, the I'm Already Tracer song.
[03:35:44.867 --> 03:35:45.767]  I'll be Tracer.
[03:35:45.767 --> 03:35:46.828]  I'm already Tracer.
[03:35:46.828 --> 03:35:47.488]  Yeah, that one.
[03:35:47.488 --> 03:36:05.855]  That song began its life as a kind of droopy corporate feminism, respect women virtue signal, with the female singer refusing to play a support role in the video game Overwatch, before TikTokers took it and turned it into a deliberately over-the-top misogynistic demand for women to shut up and get back in the kitchen.
[03:36:05.855 --> 03:36:07.015]  I'll be Bastion.
[03:36:07.015 --> 03:36:08.115]  You're a Bastion.
[03:36:08.115 --> 03:36:09.336]  You're a rental Winston.
[03:36:09.336 --> 03:36:10.316]  I wanna be Winston.
[03:36:10.316 --> 03:36:11.597]  I guess I'll be Genji.
[03:36:11.597 --> 03:36:12.517]  I'm already Genji.
[03:36:20.644 --> 03:36:22.065]  Which is precisely the point.
[03:36:22.065 --> 03:36:27.430]  TikTok trolling culture is a backlash to millennial outrage culture.
[03:36:27.430 --> 03:36:35.177]  Generation Z is overcompensating and being more edgy and offensive than the progressive zeitgeist allows.
[03:36:44.487 --> 03:36:48.130]  It's a kind of self-correcting cultural realignment.
[03:36:48.130 --> 03:36:55.594]  Just as in a political sense the election of Trump and the global populist wave was a kind of self-correcting evolutionary realignment.
[03:36:55.594 --> 03:36:58.877]  Listen, kids are biologically driven to rebel.
[03:36:58.877 --> 03:37:02.799]  They're innately predisposed to seek out the ultimate taboos.
[03:37:02.799 --> 03:37:07.202]  The coolest and therefore the most censored behavior and material.
[03:37:07.202 --> 03:37:09.944]  What could be more taboo than a good make-me-a-sandwich meme?
[03:37:10.564 --> 03:37:10.884]  I think.
[03:37:24.502 --> 03:37:28.586]  I wasn't joking when I said conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:37:28.586 --> 03:37:35.254]  And although Gen Z is the most conservative generation since World War II, maybe conservatism is the wrong word.
[03:37:35.254 --> 03:37:39.138]  The new counterculture is just the opposite of the dominant culture.
[03:37:39.138 --> 03:37:43.403]  And what could be more dominant and domineering than a political dogma?
[03:37:43.923 --> 03:38:07.792]  Intersectional identity politics and political correctness exists to ruin fun, to censor satire, and to eliminate individual identity in favor of one boring, homogenous, amorphous blob, while simultaneously promoting apathetic, empty lifestyles that promise hedonistic bliss, but deliver nothing but vicuity, hopelessness, and depression.
[03:38:07.792 --> 03:38:09.552]  Enter TikTok traditionalism.
[03:38:09.552 --> 03:38:11.133]  Oh, you're with her now?
[03:38:12.518 --> 03:38:22.241]  Okay, I guess I'll just have to show you what you're missing.
[03:38:22.241 --> 03:38:27.182]  The imminent mainstream backlash against TikTok is also a continuation of Gamergate.
[03:38:27.182 --> 03:38:35.984]  It's about depriving young men, predominantly young white men, god forbid, of a space in which to express themselves and have fun.
[03:38:35.984 --> 03:38:41.426]  But TikTok is also a space for non-white people to engage in self-deprecating humor.
[03:38:48.834 --> 03:38:56.242]  Which is an absolute nightmare if you're a lefty who is continually trying to balkanize and divide people by race.
[03:38:56.242 --> 03:39:01.427]  Day one in Mexico and so far I'm pretty normal, pretty natural.
[03:39:03.174 --> 03:39:04.896]  All right, day two.
[03:39:04.896 --> 03:39:07.198]  It's pretty good.
[03:39:07.198 --> 03:39:09.701]  It's over.
[03:39:09.701 --> 03:39:12.884]  If you want to get really pretentious, you can take it a step further.
[03:39:12.884 --> 03:39:13.285]  Yeah.
[03:39:13.285 --> 03:39:14.006]  Let's do that.
[03:39:14.006 --> 03:39:19.832]  Observing Gen Z's digital culture over the past several years has meant moving from platform to platform with them.
[03:39:19.932 --> 03:39:22.973]  As they change their usernames and preferred networks frequently.
[03:39:22.973 --> 03:39:29.414]  It's as if they don't care about building a following or about being recognised in the way platform loyal millennials do.
[03:39:29.414 --> 03:39:41.017]  They only want to join in the interpersonal fabric of memetic activity and savour the last bit of human connection left on our cold, data-collecting, psychographic profiling platforms.
[03:39:41.317 --> 03:39:45.882]  Making TikTok videos is linking oneself to the cultural duet chain.
[03:39:45.882 --> 03:39:48.905]  They build narratives of collective participation.
[03:39:48.905 --> 03:39:55.011]  Their memetic actions are mostly meaningless and in that way mirror the meaninglessness of most actions in today's society.
[03:39:55.011 --> 03:39:56.393]  Political action has failed.
[03:39:56.573 --> 03:40:05.180]  Mass protest has failed, even capitalism has failed, yet somehow we continue our zombie march to the tireless drumbeat of neoliberal austerity.
[03:40:05.180 --> 03:40:15.668]  The younger generation now mimes the zombie forms of gaming avatars in order to laugh at a world in which they themselves have no autonomy and are controlled by outside forces.
[03:40:15.888 --> 03:40:19.031]  Young people face a future that was set in motion years ago.
[03:40:19.031 --> 03:40:22.935]  They will soon inherit a worse economy than any recent American generation.
[03:40:22.935 --> 03:40:38.389]  While millennials earnestly tweet about the stress of their student loans and freelance precarity, Gen Z TikToks in a joyous nihilism, mocking a society in which self-determination and upward mobility have long since collapsed.
[03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:39.991]  Or in other words, it's a revolt.
[03:40:39.991 --> 03:40:41.853]  Roll against the modern world.
[03:40:41.853 --> 03:40:48.699]  But Paul, you're only talking about TikTok as part of a cynical ploy to attract a new audience to your political dogma!
[03:40:48.699 --> 03:40:49.459]  Yeah, and?
[03:40:49.459 --> 03:40:52.822]  But seriously, the audience is already there!
[03:40:52.822 --> 03:40:59.568]  I'm not responsible for creating a generation captivated by edgy, offensive, transgressive humour.
[03:40:59.568 --> 03:41:00.269]  You did that!
[03:41:00.549 --> 03:41:08.516]  With your safe spaces, with your trigger words, with your insufferable mental fragility, and your relentless jihad against joy.
[03:41:08.516 --> 03:41:11.418]  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
[03:41:11.418 --> 03:41:16.362]  Generation Z is a natural, evolutionary, self-correcting antibody.
[03:41:16.442 --> 03:41:19.964]  To the millennial pathogen that has infected our culture.
[03:41:19.964 --> 03:41:25.006]  And TikTok is merely the latest vehicle for that antibody to neutralize its target.
[03:41:25.006 --> 03:41:31.730]  Which is why the vehicle for the pathogen, the mainstream media, will now begin to relentlessly attack TikTok.
[03:41:31.730 --> 03:41:33.411]  Hey!
[03:41:33.411 --> 03:41:34.511]  Whoa, that's cool!
[03:41:34.511 --> 03:41:35.492]  Check this out, guys!
[03:41:36.998 --> 03:41:37.479]  Ow!
[03:41:37.479 --> 03:41:38.640]  Oof!
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:40.022]  I'm so shut!
[03:41:40.022 --> 03:41:41.243]  That's lit!
[03:41:41.243 --> 03:41:42.464]  Wow!
[03:41:42.464 --> 03:41:45.067]  Oh my goodness, thanks for showing us that.
[03:41:45.067 --> 03:41:45.307]  What?
[03:41:45.307 --> 03:41:45.988]  Holy smokes!
[03:41:45.988 --> 03:41:46.969]  So get ready.
[03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:50.212]  The same thing they're doing to PewDiePie, they'll do to TikTok.
[03:41:50.212 --> 03:41:55.938]  TikTok is a platform for hate speech, bullying, misogyny, racism, a gateway drug to the alt-right!
[03:41:55.938 --> 03:41:57.219]  You're gonna hear it all.
[03:41:57.219 --> 03:41:57.880]  And once again...
[03:41:58.300 --> 03:42:02.765]  No one will care because it's all sound and fury signifying nothing.
[03:42:02.765 --> 03:42:12.777]  The legacy media in its final death throes lashing out, clamouring for relevance, clamouring for control, clamouring to police, thought, speech and humour.
[03:42:12.777 --> 03:42:14.539]  And as ever, failing.
[03:42:18.450 --> 03:42:22.232]  That video is available on YouTube right now.
[03:42:22.232 --> 03:42:23.132]  Get it, get it out.
[03:42:23.132 --> 03:42:30.696]  If there is hope, then it is with Generation Z. Again, their trolling culture is a response to millennial outrage culture.
[03:42:30.696 --> 03:42:34.398]  Coming up after the break, we're going to talk about the effort to make U.S.
[03:42:34.398 --> 03:42:40.802]  fire departments more diverse and inclusive by making 50% of firefighters women.
[03:42:40.802 --> 03:42:42.122]  Good luck with that.
[03:42:42.122 --> 03:42:42.623]  We'll be back.
[03:42:42.623 --> 03:42:43.703]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:43.703 --> 03:42:45.424]  Live breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:42:45.424 --> 03:42:46.725]  Now go away.
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:59.525]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:42:59.525 --> 03:43:01.087]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:43:01.087 --> 03:43:05.991]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50-75% off double-paid reappoints.
[03:43:05.991 --> 03:43:08.933]  Let's extend that sale, but also add
[03:43:09.473 --> 03:43:12.214]  A free gift with every order.
[03:43:12.214 --> 03:43:21.057]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:43:21.057 --> 03:43:24.738]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[03:43:24.738 --> 03:43:30.100]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:32.481]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:43:33.021 --> 03:43:39.447]  In the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a loss leader.
[03:43:39.447 --> 03:43:41.009]  We are losing money on this.
[03:43:41.009 --> 03:43:42.450]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:43:42.450 --> 03:43:45.773]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds.

[03:44:54.142 --> 03:45:03.191]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[03:45:03.191 --> 03:45:04.532]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:45:04.532 --> 03:45:08.396]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:45:08.396 --> 03:45:12.780]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:14.101]  All words are not enough.
[03:45:14.904 --> 03:45:21.086]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies, you have been on target.
[03:45:21.086 --> 03:45:27.308]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:45:27.308 --> 03:45:31.270]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:45:31.270 --> 03:45:33.191]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:45:33.191 --> 03:45:37.192]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[03:45:37.788 --> 03:45:43.455]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:45:43.455 --> 03:45:52.746]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to infowars4.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:45:54.665 --> 03:45:59.106]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[03:45:59.106 --> 03:46:03.668]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[03:46:03.668 --> 03:46:14.171]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:14.171 --> 03:46:18.012]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds, and support the InfoWars.
[03:46:18.012 --> 03:46:19.553]  All the sales the last 12 days
[03:46:20.333 --> 03:46:22.756]  Fifty to seventy-five percent off is back.
[03:46:22.756 --> 03:46:23.857]  Free shipping is still there.
[03:46:23.857 --> 03:46:25.238]  Double Patriot points.
[03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:28.481]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[03:46:28.481 --> 03:46:33.026]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Mico ZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[03:46:33.026 --> 03:46:34.487]  Just go check out the sales.
[03:46:34.487 --> 03:46:35.769]  There's too many to break them all down.
[03:46:35.769 --> 03:46:39.612]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[03:46:40.333 --> 03:46:42.355]  And thank you again all for your support.
[03:46:42.355 --> 03:46:46.820]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:46:46.820 --> 03:46:51.485]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[03:46:51.485 --> 03:46:56.810]  Thank you.
[03:46:56.810 --> 03:46:59.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.909 --> 03:47:13.576]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:13.576 --> 03:47:15.861]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.861 --> 03:47:19.531]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:21.946 --> 03:47:24.607]  We are live in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.607 --> 03:47:32.151]  I'm going to get back into a few final news stories here in a second, but before I do that, I want to tell you about the great specials available.
[03:47:32.151 --> 03:47:33.512]  The Christmas specials.
[03:47:33.512 --> 03:47:39.775]  This is our unprecedented Christmas special, available for a limited time over at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:39.775 --> 03:47:48.059]  Over the past 12 days at InfoWarsStore.com, we've launched some of our biggest specials ever to help you stock up for Christmas and support the InfoWar.
[03:47:48.059 --> 03:47:50.440]  These specials were such massive loss leaders
[03:47:51.201 --> 03:48:00.967]  That we could only promote them for 24 hours, but now we're bringing back all of our Christmas Mega Specials at infowarsstore.com for a very limited time.
[03:48:00.967 --> 03:48:03.509]  Many of them are already selling out completely.
[03:48:04.611 --> 03:48:14.017]  We've made the decision to completely sell through our 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying the ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[03:48:14.017 --> 03:48:16.158]  What could be a better cause than that?
[03:48:16.158 --> 03:48:32.728]  So this is your last chance to take advantage of these super, uh, Christmas super specials, including Brain Force for a massive 55% off, Bodies 60% off, the last run of Super Male Vitality for 55% off, The Ultimate Bone Broth is available for 55% off,
[03:48:34.213 --> 03:48:35.754]  Super Blue Toothpaste.
[03:48:35.754 --> 03:48:37.195]  Who doesn't need toothpaste?
[03:48:37.195 --> 03:48:38.576]  Why not get it from us?
[03:48:38.576 --> 03:48:41.098]  It's available for 60% off.
[03:48:41.098 --> 03:48:45.320]  The Alpha Power is also up there on InfoWarsStore.com for 60% off.
[03:48:45.320 --> 03:48:52.305]  Plus, you get free shipping, double Patriot points, and a free t-shirt with every single order.

[03:49:01.130 --> 03:49:03.532]  So, if you want to take advantage of those specials,
[03:49:04.355 --> 03:49:09.897]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and support this network.
[03:49:09.897 --> 03:49:17.580]  Now, Harvard Business Review reports, making US fire departments more diverse and inclusive.
[03:49:17.580 --> 03:49:19.761]  See, they found there's a problem.
[03:49:19.761 --> 03:49:31.125]  Not only are most firefighters white, 82%, 96% of firefighters in the United States of America are men, and we have to change that.
[03:49:31.832 --> 03:49:36.055]  Because it's going to be a great idea to make 50% of them women, isn't it?
[03:49:36.055 --> 03:49:37.717]  Yes!
[03:49:37.717 --> 03:49:39.778]  Picture a typical firefighter.
[03:49:39.778 --> 03:49:40.919]  Who comes to mind?
[03:49:40.919 --> 03:49:42.821]  If you imagined a white man!
[03:49:42.821 --> 03:49:43.782]  God forbid.
[03:49:43.782 --> 03:49:45.663]  That's understandable.
[03:49:45.663 --> 03:49:50.167]  96% of US career firefighters are men and 82% are white.
[03:49:50.167 --> 03:49:54.590]  How dare white men save lives?
[03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:56.972]  Sounds pretty racist to me.
[03:49:56.972 --> 03:49:58.133]  Sounds pretty sexist to me.
[03:49:59.850 --> 03:50:07.593]  The homogeneity is striking, especially when you compare it to the US military, which is 85% men and 60% white.
[03:50:07.593 --> 03:50:10.614]  Again, we need more women on frontline combat roles, don't we?
[03:50:10.614 --> 03:50:13.535]  That's also an extremely good idea because they're well suited to it.
[03:50:14.617 --> 03:50:18.318]  Local police forces are 88% men and 73% white.
[03:50:18.318 --> 03:50:22.800]  Again, being a police officer, stopping crime, catching criminals.
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:25.080]  If you're white, that's bad, that's racist.
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:32.783]  Many fire departments recognize their lack of diversity as a problem and say they're committed to increasing racial and gender diversity.
[03:50:32.783 --> 03:50:39.925]  So again, if they get it to the levels at which the demographics, you know, when it's in line with the demographics of the country,
[03:50:40.606 --> 03:50:42.427]  Which is what?
[03:50:42.427 --> 03:50:43.788]  13% black people in the United States.
[03:50:43.788 --> 03:50:44.589]  Is that going to be enough?
[03:50:44.589 --> 03:50:47.190]  It's like with the whole Oscars so white thing.
[03:50:47.190 --> 03:50:59.478]  They had a year where, in fact, they had every single year black people were represented in the Oscars at the exact level of their population in the United States, at the exact demographic level.
[03:50:59.478 --> 03:51:01.179]  So it was on par.
[03:51:01.179 --> 03:51:04.721]  There was no discrimination, but no, that's not diverse enough.
[03:51:05.586 --> 03:51:07.948]  And how dare white people save lives?
[03:51:07.948 --> 03:51:09.709]  How dare men save lives?
[03:51:09.709 --> 03:51:17.875]  Because it's going to be a great idea to get disabled transgender Muslims in the firefighting forces, isn't it?
[03:51:17.875 --> 03:51:21.597]  As Rita Paharney notes, I think you just flashed up the tweet there.
[03:51:21.597 --> 03:51:26.281]  Yes, firefighters must be representative of every minority group in the community.
[03:51:26.281 --> 03:51:30.844]  Can't wait to be rescued by an old fat transgender woman of colour in a wheelchair.
[03:51:32.054 --> 03:51:37.937]  Now this reminds me of another article and another controversy which came out in 2015.
[03:51:37.937 --> 03:51:45.800]  New York Post headline, woman to become New York firefighter despite failing crucial fitness test.
[03:51:45.800 --> 03:51:47.561]  This actually happened.
[03:51:47.561 --> 03:51:55.525]  The FDNY for the first time in history, this was 2015, will allow someone who failed its crucial fitness test to join the bravest
[03:51:56.221 --> 03:52:12.046]  Rebecca Wax, 33, is set to graduate from the Fire Academy without passing the Functional Skills Training Test, a grueling obstacle course of job-related tasks performed in full gear with a limited air supply, an insider has revealed.
[03:52:12.046 --> 03:52:22.850]  So they're allowing women to join firefighters even if they failed the physical tests which require them, which are required of them to join in the first place.
[03:52:22.850 --> 03:52:23.110]  Okay?
[03:52:23.857 --> 03:52:25.577]  Men and women are different.
[03:52:25.577 --> 03:52:26.458]  They're better.
[03:52:26.458 --> 03:52:30.058]  They excel at different jobs, at different tasks.
[03:52:30.058 --> 03:52:31.799]  And that's okay.
[03:52:31.799 --> 03:52:33.799]  Men have more upper body strength.
[03:52:33.799 --> 03:52:35.779]  They're better firefighters.
[03:52:35.779 --> 03:52:41.080]  They're more inclined to apply to become firefighters because it's a masculine job.
[03:52:41.080 --> 03:52:41.540]  Okay?
[03:52:41.540 --> 03:52:44.021]  And that's perfectly normal.
[03:52:44.021 --> 03:52:46.261]  That's why 96% of U.S.
[03:52:46.261 --> 03:52:48.682]  career firefighters are men.
[03:52:48.682 --> 03:52:50.002]  Because it's a man's job.
[03:52:50.683 --> 03:52:52.766]  You don't need to diversify it.
[03:52:52.766 --> 03:52:56.993]  If you do that, you will literally cost lives.
[03:52:56.993 --> 03:53:02.702]  Again, people say, oh, but diversification, diversity, political correctness, it's just about being nice.
[03:53:02.702 --> 03:53:04.084]  It's just about being polite.
[03:53:04.084 --> 03:53:04.124]  No!
[03:53:05.131 --> 03:53:19.886]  If you try to level that and make it 50-50 or even 80-20, people will literally die because women don't have the upper body strength in extreme situations to rescue people and to save lives.
[03:53:19.886 --> 03:53:23.710]  How stupid do you need to be to not recognize that?
[03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:24.971]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:53:25.726 --> 03:53:29.388]  So, they could literally have women who have failed the physical test.
[03:53:29.388 --> 03:53:31.769]  And here's another point, it's not just physical.
[03:53:31.769 --> 03:53:36.411]  In fact, someone messaged me on Twitter about this when I posted it about an hour ago.
[03:53:36.411 --> 03:53:39.132]  They said that their friend was a firefighter.
[03:53:39.132 --> 03:53:40.813]  Let me find the exact tweet.
[03:53:40.813 --> 03:53:50.938]  He said, a personal friend of mine told the woman, they're talking about the Grenfell Tower, when people were trapped in a high tower, they weren't going to get out, they were done, they were going to perish, they were going to die.
[03:53:51.798 --> 03:53:59.466]  And his firefighter friend, a man, told the woman he was coming and to relax knowing she didn't have a hope.
[03:53:59.466 --> 03:54:00.828]  So again, he makes the point.
[03:54:00.828 --> 03:54:03.991]  Huge emotional and physical resilience is required.
[03:54:03.991 --> 03:54:08.536]  Huge emotional resilience is required on top of the physical tests.
[03:54:08.536 --> 03:54:13.361]  So no, you should not be allowed to become a firefighter if you fail the physical test.
[03:54:13.948 --> 03:54:27.279]  And just on the basic common sense of it, allowing people who are less proficient at firefighting, at rescuing people, at being physically strong, allowing more people to do that is going to result in more lives being lost.
[03:54:27.279 --> 03:54:29.541]  It's just a basic fact.
[03:54:29.541 --> 03:54:34.365]  But again, underscores this whole thing about diversity.
[03:54:34.365 --> 03:54:35.446]  We have to have diversity.
[03:54:35.446 --> 03:54:39.990]  We have to be politically correct when it's not just about being polite or being fair.
[03:54:41.781 --> 03:54:47.546]  This literally will cost lives, but you've got Harvard Business Review pushing for it because U.S.
[03:54:47.546 --> 03:54:51.749]  fire departments are not inclusive enough.
[03:54:51.749 --> 03:54:54.391]  Absolutely absurd pablum.
[03:54:54.391 --> 03:54:56.253]  Ridiculous.
[03:54:56.253 --> 03:54:59.515]  It has to be for every available opportunity.
[03:54:59.515 --> 03:55:07.822]  Meanwhile, talking about political correctness, Kentucky radio station plays Baby It's Cold Outside on repeat amid backlash.
[03:55:07.822 --> 03:55:08.963]  There was no backlash.
[03:55:08.963 --> 03:55:11.205]  It was like four people on Twitter, get over it.
[03:55:11.829 --> 03:55:17.072]  We're not afraid to play it, or a Kentucky radio station certainly made its opinion on the controversial.
[03:55:17.072 --> 03:55:24.335]  Why is it contro... It's only controversial amongst permanently offended idiots.
[03:55:24.335 --> 03:55:26.156]  1940s song, baby, it's cold outside.
[03:55:26.156 --> 03:55:31.658]  Known this weekend by playing it on repeat during a two-hour marathon on Sunday.
[03:55:31.658 --> 03:55:38.862]  And in fact, they had a poll, I think I talked about this last week, where it was like 73% or something said that it wasn't offensive.
[03:55:39.804 --> 03:55:52.632]  So you've literally got 27% of Americans who cannot tolerate, are so mentally fragile, they cannot tolerate hearing this song without being triggered and thinking it's rape culture.
[03:55:52.632 --> 03:55:56.035]  And people wonder why depression is exploding.
[03:55:56.035 --> 03:56:02.659]  People are so mentally fragile, they cannot even cope with hearing a classic song from the 40s.
[03:56:02.659 --> 03:56:04.120]  At Christmas!
[03:56:04.120 --> 03:56:06.681]  It's a Christmas song!
[03:56:06.681 --> 03:56:07.402]  Jesus Christ.
[03:56:08.436 --> 03:56:09.997]  Moving on to World News.
[03:56:09.997 --> 03:56:13.899]  Iraqi Afghan migrants vastly over-represented in sex attack statistics.
[03:56:13.899 --> 03:56:16.361]  This is out of Finland.
[03:56:16.361 --> 03:56:18.062]  Statistics for the first 11 months of 2018.
[03:56:19.565 --> 03:56:33.634]  Show Iraqi asylum seekers and migrants being suspected in a total of 157 sexual offences, making them the most numerous of any foreign group in the statistics, despite only being the third largest minority in the country behind Russians and Estonians.
[03:56:33.634 --> 03:56:41.700]  So, as in every single European country, migrants from the Middle East are over-represented in sex attacks.
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:49.205]  Meanwhile, Sweden's moderate party leader, Ulf Christensen, says that it's crucial for Swedish students to learn Arabic if they're to be successful in the future.
[03:56:50.094 --> 03:56:53.719]  Again, reverse colonization in effect.
[03:56:53.719 --> 03:56:57.143]  Italy's migrant crackdown expulsions up, squatter camps cleared.
[03:56:58.562 --> 03:57:08.285]  Six months after they instituted this policy, the country's Populist Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, has driven migrant deportations up 28%.
[03:57:08.285 --> 03:57:10.886]  That is why the globalists hate his guts.
[03:57:10.886 --> 03:57:17.808]  He's actually halved the number of deaths coming across the ocean as well, because he hasn't incentivised those migrants coming in the first place.
[03:57:17.808 --> 03:57:19.648]  But no, that's bad, that's evil.
[03:57:19.648 --> 03:57:24.170]  To actually save half the amount of lives of migrants, that's racist, that's terrible.
[03:57:24.170 --> 03:57:25.010]  He's a bad person.
[03:57:26.062 --> 03:57:29.003]  Berlin school rejects son of nationalist politician AFD.
[03:57:29.003 --> 03:57:31.303]  We've seen that before in the United Kingdom with UKIP.
[03:57:31.303 --> 03:57:34.744]  But that is going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:34.744 --> 03:57:37.224]  Coming up next, War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:57:37.224 --> 03:57:38.965]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:57:38.965 --> 03:57:44.926]  Don't go away.
[03:57:44.926 --> 03:57:48.787]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.566 --> 03:57:53.688]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.688 --> 03:57:56.369]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.369 --> 03:58:00.651]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.651 --> 03:58:08.155]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:08.155 --> 03:58:10.576]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:14.002 --> 03:58:16.223]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.223 --> 03:58:17.203]  They called it U.N.
[03:58:17.203 --> 03:58:18.724]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[03:58:18.724 --> 03:58:19.264]  2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.264 --> 03:58:31.168]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:31.168 --> 03:58:32.749]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:32.749 --> 03:58:35.970]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:58:35.970 --> 03:58:37.370]  I mean, what?
[03:58:37.370 --> 03:58:38.370]  I mean, never!
[03:58:45.117 --> 03:58:51.079]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[03:58:51.079 --> 03:58:52.879]  So I'll say it short and sweet.
[03:58:52.879 --> 03:58:55.240]  We need your support now, more than ever.
[03:58:55.240 --> 03:58:58.081]  You've come through a thousand times, so I'm not bitching at you.
[03:58:58.081 --> 03:59:01.081]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[03:59:01.081 --> 03:59:04.922]  The attacks on InfoWars have become absolutely exponential.
[03:59:04.922 --> 03:59:06.743]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[03:59:07.563 --> 03:59:19.991]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart, that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[03:59:19.991 --> 03:59:21.912]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[03:59:21.912 --> 03:59:23.293]  I need to be provisioned.
[03:59:23.293 --> 03:59:27.615]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshippers.
[03:59:27.615 --> 03:59:28.476]  But I need your prayers.
[03:59:28.476 --> 03:59:30.357]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[03:59:30.357 --> 03:59:32.338]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[03:59:32.338 --> 03:59:33.079]  We make it easy.
[03:59:33.619 --> 03:59:40.385]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the Globalist and not with Bezos and Amazon, and you'll help provision us.
[03:59:40.385 --> 03:59:47.731]  We've got a bunch of huge deals in fourstore.com, so please take action right now.
[03:59:47.731 --> 03:59:50.353]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
