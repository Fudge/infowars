[00:00.000 --> 00:23.920]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23.920 --> 00:26.600]  It's the Information Apocalypse.
[00:26.600 --> 00:33.600]  We're definitely now in the middle of it.
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.640]  Foreigners dump U.S. treasuries as they liquidate a record number of U.S. stocks in an attempt
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.440]  to kill our stock market and our economy to stop Trump in the March of Nationalism.
[00:44.440 --> 00:46.960]  That's been the globalist plan.
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.960]  Unbelievable.
[00:48.960 --> 00:59.760]  Meanwhile, residents should not panic. Thousands of Las Vegas homes get zero offers for November.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.480]  That's just some economic indicators.
[01:01.480 --> 01:08.040]  Meanwhile, New York Times articles suggest human extinction, a good thing, and needs
[01:08.040 --> 01:09.040]  to happen.
[01:09.040 --> 01:16.560]  Michael Snyder article upon infowars.com, MKUltra, far worse than previously known, special report.
[01:16.560 --> 01:19.200]  Well, generations, these save us from our millennials.
[01:19.200 --> 01:23.440]  Paul Joseph Watson video, shorted history of pedophilia and the political left.
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.080]  Greg Reese in fullwars.com, special report.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.080]  Expert.
[01:28.080 --> 01:30.600]  Bitcoin soon worthless.
[01:30.600 --> 01:31.600]  Big surprise.
[01:31.600 --> 01:34.680]  Raw fruit and vegetables better for your mental health than canned produce.
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.560]  I mean, there's no way to pick your top stories with all this insanity.
[01:41.560 --> 01:49.000]  Meanwhile, Fox News, the Poletano says Trump is unindicted co-conspirator, ample evidence
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.320]  to indict the president of the United States.
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.280]  More and more, the Poletano's talking about how honest and good Mueller is, but we happen
[01:56.280 --> 01:59.120]  to know why.
[01:59.120 --> 02:08.760]  As with Fox News host, reportedly, that are in the Mueller crosshairs, continuing Michael
[02:08.760 --> 02:12.440]  Savage being silenced by corporate censorship.
[02:12.440 --> 02:16.520]  His attorneys say, and I've talked to the Savage camp today.
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.080]  They can't speak because of contracts, but I can.
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.720]  At the bottom of the next hour, we have the Ben Shapiro expert, Vox Day joining us.
[02:24.720 --> 02:28.080]  I'm a little bit of a Ben Shapiro expert, because I remember back when he was the lawyer for
[02:28.080 --> 02:31.840]  talk radio network, he was like 25.
[02:31.840 --> 02:38.480]  And the thing Savage told me off record, I've not been authorized to say, but I knew this
[02:38.480 --> 02:46.800]  from other people at talk radio network 15, 20 years ago, before even Shapiro showed up.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.120]  And this guy is bad news.
[02:49.120 --> 02:50.760]  He's the Harvard mafia.
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.760]  And Savage is being taken off the air down to one hour, then he'll be taken completely
[02:54.760 --> 02:57.120]  off within three months.
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.320]  And Ben Shapiro is being given his audience, of course they're not going to stay, but talk
[03:01.320 --> 03:10.400]  about the royalty of the weekly standard, the royalty of the national review, neocon
[03:10.400 --> 03:11.760]  blue blood garbage.
[03:11.760 --> 03:17.600]  This guy is being force fed to us at a level I've never before seen.
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.120]  And he's behind the scenes working all over the place to hurt, you know who, Alexander
[03:23.120 --> 03:25.360]  Emrick Jones.
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.200]  And he is completely up the rear end of Glenn Beck.
[03:28.200 --> 03:33.120]  He is the return of Glenn Beck, God help us.
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.120]  God help us.
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.640]  And of this model of replacing Savage works, they're going after Limbaugh and Hannity Next.
[03:39.640 --> 03:42.800]  I have it from the highest sources.
[03:42.800 --> 03:44.440]  And why is this so important?
[03:44.440 --> 03:49.200]  Why am I a talk show host, depending on my competition, because they're not my competition.
[03:49.200 --> 03:53.760]  They're American patriots who care about the country and they're being removed ahead of
[03:53.760 --> 03:56.600]  Trump being removed.
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.280]  They're taking out anyone loyal to the truth, anyone loyal to the president, anyone loyal
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.280]  to the country.
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.560]  Everyone is being attacked, shut down, sued, removed, everyone.
[04:07.560 --> 04:12.560]  And Savage through his lawyers said that is happening, but now he can't speak because
[04:12.560 --> 04:14.000]  of the contracts I guess he has.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.280]  I say damn the contracts.
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.000]  And again, I'm not going to go to inside baseball.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.200]  I told Savage two years ago this was coming.
[04:23.200 --> 04:27.320]  I said, I'll build you a platform that no one even knows we've built for you.
[04:27.320 --> 04:30.240]  And he said, well, we'll see what happens down the road.
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.040]  But I told him this was coming.
[04:33.040 --> 04:36.960]  I told him it's it's bad folks.
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.840]  I haven't even hit one third of the stacks.
[04:40.840 --> 04:44.160]  Cutie Pie, number one media personality in world history.
[04:44.160 --> 04:45.960]  A lot of adults ever heard of him.
[04:45.960 --> 04:47.880]  He is the big kahuna.
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.720]  The left is muscling in and completely shut him down.
[04:50.720 --> 04:54.320]  We'll break it all down straight ahead and so much more.
[04:54.320 --> 04:56.600]  Meanwhile, we've got big news on China.
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.600]  Stay with us.
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.960]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative

[05:42.960 --> 05:48.200]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality Crill Oil concentrate.

[06:22.120 --> 06:37.520]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's not a title that I wish I had, but I certainly embrace
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.560]  it because it means we're getting the job done.
[06:40.560 --> 06:46.200]  You are tuned in to the most censored, most lied about, most demonized, most attacked
[06:46.200 --> 06:48.960]  multimedia transmission in the world.
[06:48.960 --> 06:58.080]  And we have been, at times, the number one news and information program on the planet.
[06:58.080 --> 07:04.080]  And despite the fact that we've had many of our tentacles cut off, our core operation
[07:04.080 --> 07:08.400]  has never been stronger, thanks to all of you out there.
[07:08.400 --> 07:13.800]  But it is biblical what is going on.
[07:13.800 --> 07:17.480]  We now have a very clear picture of what is about to happen.
[07:17.480 --> 07:20.560]  That's why you get next year's news today here.
[07:20.560 --> 07:30.240]  There is a systematic persecution, removal, curtailing, censoring, banning of not just
[07:30.240 --> 07:37.160]  nationalists and patriots and conservatives and Christians on the internet, but in businesses,
[07:37.160 --> 07:43.120]  in colleges, in churches, and on talk radio and television.
[07:43.120 --> 07:48.360]  I've talked to many of the top Fox News hosts who have been called into rooms the last two
[07:48.360 --> 07:52.760]  years and screamed at that they better turn against Trump or they will be removed off
[07:52.760 --> 07:54.760]  the air.
[07:54.760 --> 07:57.440]  About two years ago, Fox became very anti-Trump for a while.
[07:57.440 --> 07:59.600]  They lost half their ratings.
[07:59.600 --> 08:03.960]  They ran back and allowed people to be pro-Trump and all the listeners came back.
[08:03.960 --> 08:09.200]  But Sean Hannity never wavered.
[08:09.200 --> 08:14.320]  When Tucker Carlson was brought on, he was not 100% behind Trump.
[08:14.320 --> 08:17.440]  And so that's why they thought he was a good guy, but once he saw the stakes, he's become
[08:17.440 --> 08:21.560]  pro-Trump and he's in the crosshairs.
[08:21.560 --> 08:24.040]  I know the inside baseball on Michael Savage.
[08:24.040 --> 08:26.800]  I know the inside baseball on Rush Limbaugh.
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.760]  I know the inside baseball on Sean Hannity.
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.960]  I know the inside baseball on everything, basically.
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.800]  And I'm not at liberty to tell you everything, but let me just get to this point.
[08:38.800 --> 08:41.440]  Michael Savage is being removed off the air.
[08:41.440 --> 08:46.480]  Within three months, he won't even be on the air anymore.
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.160]  They're going to pay out his contract.
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.600]  They're killing him slowly, cutting him from three hours to one, and they're replacing
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.080]  him with Ben Shapiro.
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.520]  Because, hey, if you can't get your own audience, steal it, but they'll leave.
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.120]  They're literally grafting this cancer in everywhere.
[09:07.120 --> 09:10.920]  And we're going to be breaking down who Ben Shapiro is coming up in the next hour.
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.680]  It's the anatomy of a snake.
[09:15.680 --> 09:23.640]  The anatomy of the neocon, weekly standard, national review blueprint to continue to control
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.280]  the Republican Party and to send this country into the New World Order.
[09:29.280 --> 09:32.520]  And it ties into the move to take down Trump.
[09:32.520 --> 09:36.120]  And Judge Andrew DePolitano, who I've had dinner with and been on the phone with and
[09:36.120 --> 09:41.760]  on the show many times, and who I have associates that are very close friends with, and they
[09:41.760 --> 09:49.400]  say that there are different Fox News hosts who did talk to Julian Assange, which is not
[09:49.400 --> 09:52.400]  a crime, and that they are connected into DePolitano.
[09:52.400 --> 09:58.080]  And obviously, DePolitano is under amazing pressure at Fox to be someone anti-Trump.
[09:58.080 --> 10:05.480]  Now, he's all over Shep Smith, the rabid anti-Trumper, every day basically saying Mueller's a wonderful
[10:05.480 --> 10:11.680]  person, you know, Trump could have committed crimes, he's the undidied co-conspirator.
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.760]  All of this is part of the season of finding out who's who and who's got metal and who
[10:17.760 --> 10:18.760]  doesn't.
[10:18.760 --> 10:24.960]  But you better believe I'm still on the horse for a reason.
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.280]  When they make their move to shut down all the media, which they're doing, all the loyal
[10:29.280 --> 10:31.200]  pro-American media.
[10:31.200 --> 10:38.640]  For old Mueller and the rest of them to make their move on the president, we intend to
[10:38.640 --> 10:45.800]  stay at the helm, and we intend to go down with the ship or win the battle.
[10:45.800 --> 10:49.520]  Just like they told John Paul Jones, founder of the U.S. Navy, he was fighting a British
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.520]  ship twice the size, and it appeared his ship was sinking, and the British captain called
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.920]  over the bullhorn, are you ready to surrender?
[10:59.920 --> 11:03.720]  And he said, I surrender, I've only begun to fight.
[11:03.720 --> 11:09.240]  And he ended up capturing the British ship, tying his sinking ship to it and saving both.
[11:09.240 --> 11:10.760]  And that's what we intend to do.
[11:10.760 --> 11:16.080]  We are fully in, totally committed to the Republic.
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.560]  Trump's already gotten two good Supreme Court justices in, he's already derailed TPP, he's
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.120]  already tried to bring the economy back for two years, the globalists are waging a total
[11:24.120 --> 11:33.560]  economic war to shut it down, and I've never been more satisfied at a spiritual level.
[11:33.560 --> 11:40.520]  I've never been, I'm very satisfied, and I feel close to God.
[11:40.520 --> 11:43.840]  The last time I said that they went, Jones is going to commit suicide, he says he feels
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.840]  close to God.
[11:44.840 --> 11:45.840]  No, it's the opposite.
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.600]  I say I feel close to God, it means I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be, and every
[11:51.600 --> 11:56.760]  cell in my body and my spirit just says, you're doing the right thing.
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.080]  Now your ancestors are proud of you.
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.760]  Now you finally are starting to achieve what it was you knew you were supposed to do.
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.920]  Now there's not that burning, nagging, pushing feeling constantly.
[12:08.920 --> 12:14.160]  As we step into this, as we see the future, as we see what we've all got to do as men,
[12:14.160 --> 12:19.320]  take our licks and keep ticking as long as we can, we're going to be examples to the
[12:19.320 --> 12:25.120]  young people, the future generations, and we're joining those men and women that came
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.080]  before us that had the metal to take us into the future, and we're not taking their sacrifices
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.080]  for vain.
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.160]  We're not letting everything they laid down the line be pitched away.
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.040]  We're on the right side of history, and I am just incredibly honored to have this audience.
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.400]  I'm incredibly honored to have the amazing minds that listen to this transmission, and
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.840]  I could feel your strength, and you give me strength, and I want to thank you all for
[12:51.840 --> 12:52.840]  your prayers.
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.880]  You've got mine, and you've got my will one trillion percent focused on your destiny
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.120]  and my destiny together.
[13:00.120 --> 13:06.960]  Total commitment doesn't mean I'm not going to falter or stumble, but you've got my total
[13:06.960 --> 13:12.720]  commitment, and the enemy knows that, but I tell you, it's disgusting watching the
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.520]  ball at all now, disgusting, makes me sick, but this is where you find out who's real
[13:18.520 --> 13:20.080]  and who isn't.
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.360]  Matt Drudge has been staying the course, Sonhandi's been staying the course, or Slim
[13:24.360 --> 13:25.360]  Boss has been staying the course.
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.200]  It doesn't mean any of us are perfect, damn it, hindsight's 20-20, but as you get older
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.120]  and you see the world clearer, and you know the time you're in, you know who's good, and
[13:33.120 --> 13:35.560]  you know who's bad.
[13:35.560 --> 13:42.160]  Role net daily is good, info wars is good, zero hedge is good, so many other groups are
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.320]  good people, and as things get worse and worse now, they say, everybody's like Alex Jones
[13:47.320 --> 13:52.960]  now, no they're not like me, I only saw what was happening and was right, now it's here,
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.480]  and because we and the listeners and many before us saw what was happening, we've got
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.400]  a fighting shot at this.
[14:01.400 --> 14:04.160]  That's why they intimidated us, that's why they attacked us, that's why they lied about
[14:04.160 --> 14:07.880]  us, because they wanted to intimidate others so they wouldn't stand up to the right thing
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.520]  when the hammer fell, you know, I read these articles here in front of me and how they
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.760]  tie together, how the globalists are openly trying to crash the world economy right now,
[14:17.760 --> 14:23.360]  we're going to be covering that, there's so much more we're going to be getting to,
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.080]  but foreigners dump US treasuries as they liquidate a record number of US stocks, that's
[14:27.080 --> 14:32.200]  all to stop America, and it's re-assurgence, we told you it was coming, Trump warns you
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.160]  that voting for the Democrats would green light this operation, and now they're doing it,
[14:36.160 --> 14:41.360]  and I expect this to blow up in the globalist face, they're now with the top trending terms
[14:41.360 --> 14:48.760]  on Twitter is depression, because they want to punish us, just like Bill Marsh said, and
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.520]  teach us to hate ourselves, and teach us to hate people that stood up for what was right,
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.120]  men who didn't want to be slaves, didn't want you to be slaves, we're going to go to break,
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.760]  we come back, we're going to look at the eye of the storm, they're not just moving against
[15:02.760 --> 15:08.560]  all the conservatives, they're moving against wild cards, like PewDiePie, who has 100 million
[15:08.560 --> 15:15.840]  views on YouTube alone, close to a million, excuse me, 100 million subscribers, and they're
[15:15.840 --> 15:20.360]  now making their move on him, a lot of adults are like who's this guy, we don't care, he's
[15:20.360 --> 15:26.440]  real popular under 20, he's number one in the world, and they're making their move on
[15:26.440 --> 15:33.000]  him now, this is a critical point in the entire matrix space time continuum, believe it, and
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.640]  I'm going to break down why it is straight ahead, because either way, either way you slice
[15:38.640 --> 15:44.680]  it with things like PewDiePie, it's over for the globalist, long term, the question is
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.840]  which path will we take, the easy one, by that meaning our full force down to stop the
[15:48.840 --> 15:53.600]  disaster, or go into the disaster, which will guarantee the globalist total destruction
[15:53.600 --> 15:59.520]  that many of us will perish in the melee.

[17:28.880 --> 17:34.240]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.240 --> 17:35.240]  the world.
[17:35.240 --> 17:38.280]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.280 --> 17:44.240]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.040]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:48.040 --> 17:49.040]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:49.040 --> 17:50.560]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.560 --> 17:57.120]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available
[17:57.120 --> 18:00.400]  at Amazon Books.
[18:00.400 --> 18:05.640]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing Pollen Block.
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.840]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.840 --> 18:37.840]  symptoms.
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.520]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[18:40.520 --> 18:41.520]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.520 --> 18:46.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.240]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[20:43.240 --> 20:56.240]  You, you have, you have me.
[20:56.240 --> 21:05.280]  to us to us you know why we came in with romstein one of the most popular bands out of germany in
[21:05.280 --> 21:11.040]  the last 20 years because this is the exact type of crap the left engages in where they claim they're
[21:11.040 --> 21:16.720]  a nazi band because they speak german they're actually a leftist band but i would pretty
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.920]  much call anti-german though the music is pretty interesting but you see i first learned about
[21:21.920 --> 21:30.160]  their music 20 years ago or someone lost highway which is a great film but to understand what's
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.560]  happening with pewdiepie you have to understand the entire globalist program and it's going into
[21:34.560 --> 21:40.240]  high gear and it's final phase of the extinction of speech because censorship only works
[21:41.600 --> 21:47.680]  see if you bring in total oppression total monoculture and the political correctness is that
[21:47.680 --> 21:54.160]  it destroys all knowledge it attacks all information is hurtful and bad it tears apart words it
[21:54.160 --> 22:00.880]  destroys minds it assassinates the truth it uses journalism to destroy journalism
[22:02.320 --> 22:10.240]  it's an inversion of the renaissance economy and system so i go through hundreds of examples i have
[22:10.240 --> 22:14.960]  the new york times the washington post the wall street journal vox you name it showing pewdiepie
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.200]  who has a hundred million right at a hundred million subscribers over last time i checked
[22:21.040 --> 22:26.080]  it was it was something like a hundred billion views the multiple youtube channels i said a hundred
[22:26.080 --> 22:33.120]  billion and that's not to mention all his other platforms so he's bigger than five oprah wemfrees
[22:33.120 --> 22:39.120]  in her entire history of viewers she's big uh he's he's he's bigger than than drudge report
[22:39.120 --> 22:45.200]  when it comes to people actually watching his videos drudge report is the second biggest site in
[22:45.200 --> 22:52.480]  the world biggest new site in the world billions of visitors a month pewdiepie is the biggest
[22:53.360 --> 23:00.240]  television personality the world's ever seen more eyeballs have watched him more people have seen
[23:00.240 --> 23:07.840]  him in the modern last five years or so than anybody else you could argue that you know somebody
[23:07.840 --> 23:13.920]  like clonnie swood's bigger yes or or or ronald reagan are better known but when it comes to the youth
[23:14.560 --> 23:20.800]  my 16 year old son my 14 year old daughter my 11 year old daughter all they talk about
[23:20.800 --> 23:26.800]  pewdiepie and this is for about three four years normally that's a younger one watch it but that's
[23:26.800 --> 23:32.400]  all they hear about at school private school doesn't matter so who is this guy three or four years ago
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.880]  he started talking about me some i would get massive traffic off of it and i went and watched it okay
[23:36.880 --> 23:42.720]  he's a gamer guy he's kind of liberal he tells a lot of jokes he's a comedian he's funny okay
[23:44.160 --> 23:49.200]  he made fun of me hilariously i loved it i like being made fun of if it's if it's being done good
[23:49.200 --> 23:59.280]  naturally because i mean i laugh at myself sometimes so this guy is numero uno he's not
[23:59.280 --> 24:05.200]  gangster rap teaching your kids how to kill themselves he's not into drugs he's into fitness
[24:05.200 --> 24:10.720]  but he likes video games over a hundred billion people have watched him if you combine his youtube
[24:10.720 --> 24:15.520]  channels he's got a hundred million subscribers a couple years ago disney tried to take him over
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.840]  he wouldn't do what they said so they had youtube demonetizing took the money away he wouldn't
[24:19.840 --> 24:25.040]  shut up then they stopped letting all the people that subscribe get notifications people just go
[24:25.040 --> 24:28.960]  to his channel so they can't suppress it they've been trying for three years
[24:28.960 --> 24:36.000]  so now they come out just like they say romstein is nazi because it's german
[24:38.080 --> 24:43.200]  and they show him next to heinrich hemler but it's an actor from heinrich hemler the nazi
[24:43.920 --> 24:52.560]  head of the ss and say look he's wearing similar glasses and oh look they were calling him a nazi
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.280]  he joked and said you know hail beauty pie this is the stuff they've got they say oh he's got a
[24:59.280 --> 25:05.040]  short haircut it's not even the same haircut is similar but it's it's the it's it's the high and
[25:05.040 --> 25:11.680]  tight haircut that most people have it's been popular for about 10 years it's the one that david
[25:11.680 --> 25:17.520]  beckham and everybody popularized and it's an old 1920s 1930s haircut you know both my grandfathers
[25:17.520 --> 25:23.200]  had that haircut hell i've got that haircut does that mean i'm a nazi no it means i'm
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.320]  don't like messing with my hair all day so they talk about how over time he changed his hairstyle
[25:28.320 --> 25:35.840]  well yeah 2011 that was the hairstyle to have a little bit longer hair like ashton putster or
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.680]  whatever his name is 2016 it's all the rage to have the hair shorter and now the style is even
[25:41.680 --> 25:45.360]  shorter you're walking to barbershop there's black guys there's hispanic guys there's white
[25:45.360 --> 25:49.200]  guys all getting the same haircut i've gotten a haircut in like three four weeks so it's about
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.800]  time to get one but it's it's it's the haircut beauty pie's guy and it's not because he's a nazi
[25:52.800 --> 25:59.920]  now see this is and the left knows this why are they going after him because he's the biggest
[25:59.920 --> 26:05.600]  thing in the world just 30 years ago before the internet if you wanted to have music if you wanted
[26:05.600 --> 26:10.240]  to have your own band if you wanted to have your own radio show there were mafias basically
[26:10.240 --> 26:16.080]  corporate mafias that would come after you in pro wrestling there were regions that nobody could
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.800]  come into unless you were part of that group or you'd get your house burned down but the internet
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.680]  has allowed the media to be broken up so all the old summoner redstones all the big viacom heads
[26:25.680 --> 26:29.840]  all the big cbs heads the newscore heads they're really threatened and upset they thought they
[26:29.840 --> 26:38.800]  would always control the internet they'd use it as a minor league training fishery or nursery
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.360]  to find the talent to get it but see people don't want that i didn't want to be hired by
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.560]  big corporations and controlled i was offered up to 10 million a year uh i didn't want to be told
[26:48.560 --> 26:57.680]  what to say beauty pie he he is with the youth 20 times bigger than i've ever been that's great
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.560]  they can't stand that though you see they want a monopoly and just like this me too movement can
[27:04.560 --> 27:09.680]  be projected on anybody they want this whole thing of being a nazi can be projected and now
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.800]  they've got thousands of publications a week saying we deplatformed alex jones it's in the
[27:14.800 --> 27:21.920]  articles we can do it to beauty pie but others say like this headline it's up on info wars.com
[27:21.920 --> 27:28.880]  why youtube's biggest star can't be cancelled new york mag and they go through this and say he
[27:28.880 --> 27:36.000]  laughed at someone who was an approved of a nazi the guy plays video games for hours every day
[27:36.000 --> 27:44.960]  online a guy walks by with some weird rabbi shekel name he beauty pie laughs every time somebody
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.160]  gets shot that's what you do he snickers in it's like a laugh track that's all he does is laugh
[27:50.160 --> 27:56.080]  and then because some guy had a name rabbi shekel shoots somebody in the head we're showing it to
[27:56.080 --> 28:04.000]  your tv viewer and this becomes the total proof like playing romstein or having a short haircut
[28:04.800 --> 28:11.440]  or wearing wireframe glasses that aren't even the same shape as hindrick hemmlers by the way
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.760]  he is a northern european he does kind of have a shaped head a little bit like hemmlers and so if
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.200]  you have a you know there's probably four or five shapes of heads if you happen to have that shape
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.680]  ahead a lot of black guys have that shape ahead too happen to have that shape ahead that kind of
[28:25.680 --> 28:31.200]  you rectangular shaped head that you want to wear smaller glasses but everybody knows that

[32:37.440 --> 32:42.560]  another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have
[32:42.560 --> 32:48.240]  beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this this is
[32:48.240 --> 32:52.640]  our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free shipping everything and don't fight the crowds
[32:52.640 --> 32:58.000]  in four store dot com in fours live dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine god
[32:58.000 --> 33:26.560]  bless you and thank you for your support you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:26.560 --> 33:31.680]  the alex jones show because there is a war on your mind
[33:35.680 --> 33:40.160]  and by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea
[33:40.960 --> 33:49.680]  you are promoting ignorance racism genocide anti-semitism these are all things that you
[33:49.680 --> 33:55.920]  are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes purified so be careful about this
[33:55.920 --> 33:59.920]  if someone decided to if something were to happen if puny pie were to be sued for this
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.440]  you could be complicit if you retweet it they could make you pay a fine as well because you
[34:05.440 --> 34:11.920]  have officially published anti-semitic things so if you are republishing this stuff you could
[34:11.920 --> 34:19.360]  get in trouble for it be very aware that that is a real thing so the corporate media the southern
[34:19.360 --> 34:23.600]  primary law center media matters run by george furrow so real nazi collaborator who said that he
[34:23.600 --> 34:27.760]  had the best time of his life helping round up jews called it happy making time on 60 minutes
[34:28.320 --> 34:32.800]  they are moving to take puny pie off the air thousands of news articles oh look at his wire
[34:32.800 --> 34:38.880]  framed glasses they look like himlers he's got a short haircut he's from sweden uh on and on and on
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.160]  oh he was playing a video game once on tv and out of thousands of hours he does a year multi
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.560]  hours a day and some guy walked by with a handle named rabbi shekels whatever that means and puny
[34:50.560 --> 34:57.920]  pie laughed when somebody got shot so that means he's a nazi that's the level of this control and
[34:57.920 --> 35:03.920]  why is this so important because the establishment is making its move on everyone's free speech right
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.880]  now the story uh is getting bigger and bigger and it's really important because people are
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.680]  standing up for puny pie and this incredible leftist censorship and the audio you just heard
[35:13.680 --> 35:21.680]  of your radio listener is from video posted to info wars dot com by paul joseph watson video
[35:21.680 --> 35:29.440]  unhinged history teacher claims puny pie is promoting genocide you talk about defamation
[35:29.440 --> 35:37.200]  and threatening the middle school students that they will get sued that they will be fined
[35:37.200 --> 35:45.760]  if they share this man's genocidal links meanwhile the new york times today says that human extinction
[35:45.760 --> 35:52.720]  would not be a bad thing that all humans are bad and that we should reduce the world's population
[35:52.720 --> 35:59.120]  that's not nazi at all puny pie who's done nothing he's the nazi because he's popular
[35:59.120 --> 36:04.400]  and he has 100 billion views and 100 million subscribers and is the number one individual
[36:04.400 --> 36:09.680]  on youtube ladies and gentlemen that's why because these big corporations don't have any viewers
[36:09.680 --> 36:16.800]  obama gives a speech it has 5000 views on youtube anderson cooper does a daily show on uh facebook
[36:16.800 --> 36:23.120]  it literally has no more than 10 000 viewers they paid him 18 million dollars for it and puny pie
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.640]  in the last four years was the number one star youtube and disney tried to buy him out tried
[36:28.640 --> 36:33.920]  to make him do things that he didn't want to do so he said no thank you so they demonetized him
[36:36.320 --> 36:44.640]  just like we have seen done over and over again with ted nugent can fill up stadiums of 20 000 40
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.680]  000 people he's been told stop supporting trump and we'll let you play in stadiums again but only
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.120]  three companies own the big stadiums and so ted nugent can't play basically anywhere except city
[36:55.120 --> 37:02.640]  owned coliseums like waco and it's totally packed but because he won't play ball he loses 15 million
[37:03.200 --> 37:09.440]  dollars a year that's directly from ted nugent i looked it up in publications it's true think of
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.760]  the sacrifice trump's lost two billion since he ran for office with all the boycotts and lawsuits
[37:14.480 --> 37:20.160]  and attacks puny pie has lost in the last four years it's estimated over 70 million dollars and
[37:20.160 --> 37:26.160]  some will say well okay he's already rich the point is is that he's staying to his integrity
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.560]  and most people sell out ladies and gentlemen you know charlie chaplin could joke around and
[37:34.560 --> 37:43.200]  say he was a nazi and and and and engaged in satire so could john clase that's okay but hitler dog
[37:43.200 --> 37:50.080]  does it he's banned these people want to control all knowledge they want to control all comedy
[37:50.080 --> 37:57.760]  it's absolute total and complete nauseating garbage but it gets worse from there new york
[37:57.760 --> 38:03.680]  magazine limits puny pie appears to be too popular to ban meanwhile puny pie fans hacked the wall
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.600]  street journal yesterday and apologized to puny pie for the horrible article they wrote that basically
[38:09.600 --> 38:17.680]  vox copied the controversy over youtube star puny pie and his anti-semitic jokes explained
[38:17.680 --> 38:23.120]  and then it shows the jokes he's walking through a multiplayer game walks by thousands of people
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.080]  a day and they shoot them up games and he laughs every time somebody gets shot because one of them
[38:28.080 --> 38:36.480]  had a handle rabbi shekels it's over look he cut his hair shorter that's the wall street
[38:36.480 --> 38:44.240]  journals main evidence and then he had wire framed glasses like hindrick himmler it's all over ladies
[38:44.240 --> 38:55.440]  and gentlemen and he's a right wing troll they say no they're all just fabulously fabulously
[38:57.360 --> 39:05.840]  jealous they're fabulously angry look at this alchemy they engage in puny pie the guardian
[39:05.840 --> 39:13.200]  thinks death all jesus is a joke are you laughing yet and that's because the handle of a guy he walks
[39:13.200 --> 39:19.360]  by in a video game can somehow be connected to somebody saying death's all jews how does rabbi
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.840]  shekels do that and because he's in a video game with thousands of other players and someone's name
[39:23.840 --> 39:29.280]  that it's like walking by somebody on the street or driving somebody by somebody that's got a nazi
[39:29.280 --> 39:39.920]  sticker and then you are the bad person this is the culture police they are the real nazis they
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.040]  are the digital nazis at vox and the london guardian and the new york times and new york
[39:45.040 --> 39:52.320]  magazine they are funded and run by a real nazi collaborator george soros they're connected
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.600]  to the intelligence agencies that took 30 plus thousand nazis out of the world war two and protected
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.760]  them puny pie has no connection to nazis i have no connection to nazis except both my
[40:01.760 --> 40:10.080]  grandfathers were in the army air court and both almost died my only connection to nazis is they
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.000]  almost made me not exist but if i help round up jews like george soros i'd be getting awards
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.480]  you see that's how they do it they hide at point blank range and say you are what they are hillary
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.320]  paid off of the russians they say trumpish mainstream media hates america selling us out
[40:28.320 --> 40:36.560]  they say i hate america it's that simple let's go another clip here puny pie laughs at rabbi
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.200]  shekels shooting someone in a game again there's all these players shooting each other one guy's got
[40:41.200 --> 40:45.440]  a name over his head they've all got names over their heads saying who they are and because he
[40:45.440 --> 40:51.120]  laughed well he's a bad guy here it is you sound a lot like puny pie i'm of course skeptical because
[40:51.120 --> 40:57.760]  i've been on the web for a while and then the internet for a while i'm just gonna say hey man i really
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.000]  appreciate your content you've gotten me through some tough times and i respect the
[41:02.000 --> 41:22.480]  so
[41:22.480 --> 41:29.440]  he's wearing vr goggles he's laughing ha ha you just shot him i can't even hardly see or even see
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.000]  rabbi shekels on there i get lost in all the shooting but this is the total mental illness but
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.480]  the left isn't mentally ill they're telling schoolchildren nationwide it's been in the news
[41:38.480 --> 41:44.480]  in every public school from middle school up in college i have quite a bit of friends who have
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.680]  daughters and granddaughters in college they've all come back i must be daughters and said my god
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.400]  i'm in journalism class about to graduate they call us in and say alex jones is pure evil and if
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.200]  you ever support him you'll be put in jail and he's a racist and it's happening at public schools and
[41:59.200 --> 42:06.640]  it's in newspapers they do this everywhere and it's the same thing with pewdie pie we just played
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.160]  the video if you share him you're gonna get sued you might go to jail and it's all over
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.480]  this is what they're doing in their traumatizing students telling them they're nazis and they
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.920]  want genocide and they want to kill people all because the left follows orders and they see
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.320]  the new york times and the washington posts say pewdie pie is a bad guy and they all like attack
[42:28.320 --> 42:34.560]  dogs run into those classes they're putting info wars and yours truly alex jones officially in
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.520]  curriculum nationwide it's all the newspapers and they go in there and they teach lies about me
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.520]  and say things i never said and take them out of context to demonize the first amendment in
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.960]  journalism classes and teach the classes how to be censors priming them for the universities
[42:48.960 --> 42:55.920]  to be good little nazis no if anybody acts like nazis it's the dirtbag left and whoever that teacher
[42:55.920 --> 43:02.400]  is trying to terrorize their students the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.760]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it
[43:07.760 --> 43:13.360]  lowers iq it literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[43:13.360 --> 43:19.200]  viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.680]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply
[43:23.680 --> 43:29.520]  of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[43:29.520 --> 43:35.360]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.560]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the
[43:40.560 --> 43:46.640]  research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[43:46.640 --> 43:53.440]  super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it

[47:50.320 --> 47:59.440]  all the opposition to the globalist takeover ahead of it and ka hi our sacramento radio station
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.600]  getting huge ratings with us you saw the big national push by soros group by others to attack
[48:05.600 --> 48:13.120]  our stations make up lies send them a bs tell them we said things we didn't say to then remove us
[48:13.120 --> 48:18.720]  off air and say that you know we're fake news we're fiction that's more tortuous interference it's more
[48:19.760 --> 48:25.760]  defamation with intentional to do harm and it's just more of these people are racking up but this
[48:25.760 --> 48:32.880]  is the war so that's why you need to call every radio station we're on and thank them and explain
[48:32.880 --> 48:38.160]  that you've got george soros the democrat dirtbags doing this and become a sponsor or send them a
[48:38.160 --> 48:43.600]  hundred bucks but whatever you do paint the side of your barn about the local station because that's
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.080]  what they're doing that's what these leftist terrorists are doing is terrorizing the first
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.920]  amendment everywhere they're turning the whole country into what they've done to the anti-free
[48:53.920 --> 49:00.240]  speech universities this is what they do now we probably gained 50 radio stations since the mass
[49:00.240 --> 49:05.520]  banning four months ago and that's what they're pushing back against is that a lot of this backfire
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.760]  and a lot of our station owners and managers totally get what's happening they're aware of
[49:09.760 --> 49:14.880]  what's going on but we need to see let's let's put that radio station Sacramento back up push back
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.200]  on this nicely to them say hey don't listen to these globalists don't listen to the left

[49:23.760 --> 49:32.160]  these evil globalists www.kahi.com so there you go ladies and gentlemen everywhere they're moving
[49:32.160 --> 49:39.520]  against free speech khi.com regardless we're getting more stations in california call stations
[49:39.520 --> 49:45.040]  in your area if you don't have a local station call them all and say listen pick up alex jones
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.640]  get the truth out there learn what's going on this is riveting powerful pro-liberty talk radio

[49:57.760 --> 50:03.200]  well 30-something-year-old now a guy from sweden who's got 100 million views out there
[50:03.200 --> 50:08.800]  and 100 million subscribers and there's now this giant indian global consortium
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.120]  like how to ready player one that has hundreds of thousands of people on the payroll to go out
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.000]  and make themselves number one basically with fake subscriptions bots you name it so they've
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.760]  now gotten a little bit ahead of him there's a race for who's going to be the biggest but
[50:21.760 --> 50:26.880]  the point is is that the globalist big corporations are trying to crush competition
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.960]  everywhere i put this video out this morning at info wars dot com as adults you're not into
[50:32.960 --> 50:39.520]  pewdiepie but for your young teenagers and others who already are it shows solidarity
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.080]  with the liberty movement with people like pewdiepie who are being censored and it gets
[50:44.080 --> 50:48.320]  young people aware of what's happening pewdiepie has been defending info wars for several years
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.960]  when we've been under attack he's gone and played the actual clips of what we say versus what they
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.040]  say about us and so he's he's pro free speech that's what we've got to work together on this
[50:59.040 --> 51:06.080]  type of stuff's happening so here is the video i shot this morning everyone must subscribe
[51:06.080 --> 51:11.920]  to pewdiepie in his war against the tyrannical t-series right now a giant corporation out of
[51:11.920 --> 51:16.640]  india is trying to get the number one slot on youtube the new york times the new york magazine
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.120]  are all calling everyone to be removed off of the air because they hate independent media this is
[51:21.120 --> 51:26.480]  like ready player one for real ladies and gentlemen the whole global corporate system trying to bring
[51:26.480 --> 51:31.680]  down pewdiepie he's the next target so all info warriors have got to go to youtube right now
[51:31.680 --> 51:54.960]  and subscribe make him too big to van i'm alex jones and this is the info war and again that's all
[51:54.960 --> 52:03.680]  silliness folks that's who they claim is a nazi because they want full control and ladies and
[52:03.680 --> 52:09.280]  gentlemen they're removing everybody ahead of removing trump michael savage in his talk show
[52:09.280 --> 52:15.760]  ratings of the washington's reports has 148 14.8 million listeners a week just on stations that
[52:15.760 --> 52:21.440]  are rated a lot of stations don't subscribe to arbitrage they're not shown the numbers are he's
[52:21.440 --> 52:27.840]  as big as rush limbaugh 25 million listeners a week and michael savage being silenced by corporate
[52:27.840 --> 52:32.800]  censorship attorney says savage can't speak about it because of his contract but i can give you the
[52:32.800 --> 52:39.360]  exclusive baseball next hour and it goes into alex jones conspiracy theory think again think alex
[52:39.360 --> 52:44.080]  jones meghan kelly just a couple years ago booting these big money draws would have been
[52:44.080 --> 52:50.080]  unthinkable fast forward a couple politically incorrect blinks later and indeed the unthinkable
[52:50.080 --> 52:55.680]  has occurred like savage's lawyers said in the same vein could very well be the next nationally
[52:55.680 --> 53:01.040]  known victim of media censorship they've cut his hit show from three hours to one hour replacing it
[53:01.040 --> 53:08.000]  with ben shapiro who happened to be a lawyer at talk radio network that savage particularly hates
[53:08.880 --> 53:13.680]  and i'm not going to get into the private stuff savage told me but good lord it was it was unbelievable
[53:13.680 --> 53:21.360]  his battles to talk radio network and now that's the guy that they're using to replace him because
[53:21.360 --> 53:26.240]  shapiro's anti-trump networks are actually losing millions of dollars in order to keep michael's
[53:26.240 --> 53:31.600]  voice off these stations or what said yes indeed the savage nation could indeed be the next casualty
[53:31.600 --> 53:37.520]  of corporate censorship and what a sad sorry shame that will be for a nation already suffering
[53:37.520 --> 53:43.200]  from the plight of having too few and far between original thinkers sharyl chumley wrote the article
[53:43.200 --> 53:51.520]  and uh i'm in here the whole deal and the way these golden handcuffs work for a gavin mcginnis
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.040]  and now michael savage and then a tucker carlson and a sean hannity is you don't get your pay out
[53:58.080 --> 54:03.760]  if you talk about what's going on michael savage has written over a hundred best-selling books i
[54:03.760 --> 54:08.320]  think like ted up new york times number one he basically launched the whole modern herbal movement
[54:08.320 --> 54:15.760]  he's a doctor of that i mean a real md type herbalist uh there are very few of those and
[54:17.280 --> 54:22.880]  people don't even know that that he has one of the biggest supplement companies in the world
[54:23.840 --> 54:33.040]  and rockstar energy drinks i mean he doesn't need any money and michael let him have it man don't
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.080]  let ben shapiro step in and then try to molest the brains of your audience don't let him
[54:38.080 --> 54:44.880]  rape their brains with his fake you know swarmy ivy league uh scripting that he does oh he's
[54:44.880 --> 54:48.880]  such a genius even the liberal media and the conservative media and bill morrell says it
[54:48.880 --> 54:53.200]  oh he's so smart meanwhile he gets an interview with tucker carlson and can't even hardly hold
[54:53.200 --> 55:00.080]  himself together ben shapiro was a patriot and doing great i would step aside but he's not he's a
[55:00.080 --> 55:09.920]  smarmy little worm who is the heir apparent and who is being foisted and shoved upon everyone
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.040]  and forced said to us and my goodness behind the scenes the things glenbeck's trying to do to my
[55:15.040 --> 55:22.160]  show to stop it and now ben shapiro is constantly weeviling around the background i'm not calling
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.640]  for a censorship but see hey can't you go start your own show no you've got to be given
[55:26.640 --> 55:32.800]  all the big juicy time slots with michael savage in fact i was looking at the lineup
[55:32.800 --> 55:36.080]  even when savage is in rebroadcast that's where they're going to air shapiro now
[55:36.880 --> 55:44.400]  he's being given savage's empire he didn't build it and i predict this it the ratings are going
[55:44.400 --> 55:52.080]  to tank the ratings are going to tank unbelievable so they're trying to shut me down
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.280]  they're trying to shut savage down they're coming after everybody this is the move to

[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:31.840]  taken off the air it's backfired we've gotten more stations but in some cases are being successful
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:37.040]  it's sick we've got roger stone with huge breaking news the next segment then we'll go inside the
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:42.640]  takedown and the plan to take michael sabbage off the air but first here is a key report border
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:48.240]  hell as democrats choose treason this month the world took a landmark step forward with the
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:55.200]  adoption of the global compact for safe borderly and regular migration the drawings of lines on maps
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:04.960]  have never suffice to confine people whose needs ambitions dreams and opportunities expanded their
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:14.320]  horizons we are now committed to safer and fairer ways of managing borders the border wall battle
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:19.520]  will likely define the trump presidency when it's all said and done we believe that when nations
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:26.080]  respect the rights of their neighbors and defend the interests of their people they can better work
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.000]  together to secure the blessings of safety prosperity and peace on the one hand a populist
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:37.280]  president has tirelessly railed against the unprotected us border they're on the land we
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:42.640]  release them they go someplace into our country they're supposed to come back within two or three
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:50.480]  years for a court case but nobody ever comes back while the democrats who supported border protection
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:55.840]  in the past under former presidents obama and clinton have now chosen to promote their rampant
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:03.920]  hatred for the president the president made clear that he wants a shutdown his position if he sticks
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:11.360]  to his position for a five billion dollar wall he will get no wall and he will get a shutdown
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:17.600]  we're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:22.160]  illegal immigration and that means this is a this is a very if it comes to it absolutely this is a
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.800]  very fundamental issue at stake is the question of whether or not the united states remains a sovereign
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.640]  country whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.440]  the democrat party is a simple choice they can either choose to fight for america's working
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.240]  class or to promote illegal immigration the thing i think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:45.040]  the government over a dispute and you want to shut it down you keep talking about the last time
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:50.000]  chuck you shut it down no no no and then you owe 20 times quickly and i don't want to do what you
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:55.280]  did but was president trump really out of line i think the president needs a you know called a
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:03:00.560]  blow he said i will own this so he's willing to shut down the government because border security
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:05.760]  and national security is so important so i think he i think it was beautiful thing he did i think
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:10.000]  he shows american people that he truly cares about the safety of this country and he'll take
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.080]  responsibility to shut down the government because the democrats don't want border security the new
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:19.360]  york daily news wrote polosi said after the meeting it's like a manhood thing for him as if
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:26.320]  manhood could ever be associated with him what an evil dig she continues i was trying to be the mom
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:32.560]  i can't explain it to you it was so wild it goes to show you you get into a tinkle contest with
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:38.160]  a skunk you get tinkle all over you that is incredibly disgusting language coming from a
[1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:43.680]  leader of our representative republic other than the fact that polosi has revealed that she is a
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:49.680]  foul mouthed champion of perversion what's most chilling is that she is leading the democratic
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:55.680]  majority in the house a political party that will stop it nothing to victimize its constituents
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:01.920]  in order to push the hyper progressive un agenda slowly corroding american sovereignty
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:09.920]  some blame the present dilemma on migration policies but the causes of the crisis are clearly
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:17.760]  much broader than that they include poor governance climate change and basic economic and demographic
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:25.360]  realities we're also watching as extreme nationalists pit one group against another poisoning the
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:31.440]  communal bloodstream with hate towards people who are different whether in nationality appearance
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:39.840]  or creed migration is by its nature an international phenomenon which can only be managed through

[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:28.000]  something that had 87 million viewers and listeners the week of the election 2016
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.360]  bigger than the superbowl they can't put up with that so they have to shut it down and to do it
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:35.600]  they have to lie about it so but george soros funds through media matters and these law firms
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:41.200]  is a fake list of twisted things i never said they then sent it to so-called journalist who put
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:45.760]  it the newspaper who really political operatives involved in torches interference to then target
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:50.960]  and harass radio and tv stations to take us off the air well you should want to put the show on
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:57.440]  to counter all of that you know media matters are so upset their their their videos get 2000
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:02.080]  3000 views ours would get a million on average so they censor this
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.240]  oh and putie pie's bad beauty pie's bad because we've supported his free speech
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:13.840]  but you know the proof the wall street journal says is it he wears rim glasses wire rim glasses
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:20.160]  so did hindrick himmler head of the voffin ss they don't use a real himmler there though they just
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.400]  see they really even wear glasses that were exactly like that they use an actor and then
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:30.400]  it gets worse cutie pie used to have longer hair back when it was in style but now he has shorter
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:37.120]  hair that's all the proof i need who knew we were all nazis roger the real notification the real
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:42.000]  digital nazis are the wall street journal the new york times new york magazine and all the folks
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.400]  that want to muscle in on anybody who has their own thing it's not enough to share revenue with google
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:52.080]  now they're going to use their clients in the left to come and say we're these horrible creatures
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:58.240]  and then they maneuver us either being their political creatures like late night comics
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:03.440]  or now these politicos or we're taking off the air and when that doesn't work they come after
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.040]  our bank accounts they sue us and people say well then why not give up well i thought we're
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:13.520]  americans our listeners haven't given up in fact they've gotten stronger the other proof is he
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:17.520]  denied being a nazi and said i'm not a racist a few years ago but he said hail putie pie
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:24.880]  you see that's that's how they do this ladies and gentlemen meanwhile they're funded by a real
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:33.680]  nazi collaborator they're funded by a real nazi collaborator named george soros so their
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.280]  latest thing is to send letters to radio stations that mean absolutely nothing
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:41.600]  but the radio stations give into it you know they're going to be back because it's all about
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:45.840]  intimidation the left's taking the university tyranny but there's no free speech expanding it
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:52.160]  and they tell you oh better take all the shows off the year and then here's an example of it
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:57.440]  there's an article on info wars dot com showing it wall street journal the hill published fake
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:04.000]  news story about roger stone and info wars in the article stone says about statements he made on
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:09.280]  this show and others before he was even an employee here that he'd heard about this chinese national
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:15.280]  who was wanted in china and then he said something he got from one trump official was inaccurate
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:21.920]  they took that out of context and did a quote here where they have him saying that it was
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:26.720]  irresponsible that turns into headlines please show them the hill article guys just type an
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:31.840]  auctions it's everywhere on the top twitter trends right now that roger stone admits he
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:38.240]  published fake news and info wars he did no such thing we have his actual statement he put out
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:43.840]  that the lawyers wanted him to put out to drop the hundred million dollar lawsuit against him
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:48.240]  stone admits to publishing false statements on enforce and it's and then they force feed it
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:52.320]  on twitter once i'm removed to make up the top twitter search it's been up and down the top
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:13:00.800]  10 searches today and then once they do that they put out a video as well saying that oh you see
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:05.840]  info wars is fake again so they can then say that we're fake when we all know the kings of fake news
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:10.800]  is the wall street journal the new york times and cnn so joining us is roger stone that we're
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:16.160]  going to go inside the removal uh the plan to take michael's savage off the air in three months
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:22.160]  and replace him with ben Shapiro but they're easing it in they're easing oh you're going from three
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:27.600]  hours at one hour ben's going to get through oh now ben gets all your show so uh this they're really
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:32.640]  getting the knives out obviously roger to move against trump but let's let's specifically
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:38.480]  talk about this right now uh and and and what you really did say in your clarification thanks alex
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:44.400]  this is really pretty clear uh i reported a story one of hundreds i've reported here at info wars
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.400]  uh regarding a chinese businessman myles quack while many things in that story were correct a
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:56.640]  couple of them were incorrect but all of the research was supplied to me by sam nunberg
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:02.800]  so i made the mistake of relying on the representations of sam nunberg and i said to the
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:08.160]  wall street journal that was just as irresponsible as they're relying on the representations
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:15.120]  of randy critico regarding the wiki leaks disclosures that turns into a faux headline a fake headline
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:21.520]  stone admits irresponsible reporting for info wars i never said anything of the kind now
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:28.400]  i am solely responsible for the content of that report and i have issued the appropriate apology
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:35.120]  to mr quack i have not paid a hundred million dollars as you might believe in fact today i can
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:43.200]  honestly say i have paid nothing uh but again uh it is symptomatic of the way they tried to use
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:51.040]  shards of evidence shards of information to discredit you uh and the wall street journal
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:58.000]  and the associated press have you attributed to me things i never said i'm solely responsible for
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:03.760]  that report but they try to leave you the impression that everything i have ever reported on info wars
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:10.080]  is incorrect or irresponsible and that is of course not the case but it shows how desperate
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:14.800]  they are that falsely claiming that i said that there's martian bases with slave children
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.160]  there's no video no audio no text never said it uh or that i'm currently then then they misrepresent
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.640]  what i did say in the past they twisted exaggerated and say jones won't stop harassing families at
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.600]  their houses of sandy hook you know on the sixth anniversary jones sent more people to their houses
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:35.440]  they were saying this the last few days just total crazy lies by the mainstream media as they get
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:39.280]  more desperate let's talk about how they're getting ready to make their move on trump that's obvious
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:44.320]  the bizarre things coming out of your good friend judge on paletano's mouth uh and then vox day

[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:06.080]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week

[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:10.400]  to the globalists and to the two-party political establishment to silence info wars it was it was
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:16.160]  about this moment so i am smeared today in the wall street journal they make false accusations
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:22.960]  about a simple settlement i make regarding one story i report out of hundreds in which many of
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:29.360]  the facts were correct but a few of the facts supplied by sam nunberg who misread a federal
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:36.240]  election commission report was incorrect so i offer a simple apology uh and that is blown up
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:42.080]  on the internet into stone admits that everything he's ever said on info wars is a lie well i never
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:48.320]  said anything of the kind judge napolitano i'm scratching my head this guy is one of my oldest
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:54.800]  and dearest friends it was me who recommended to governor tom cain that he appoint andrew napolitano
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:00.960]  to the bench and until recently he was one of the most articulate critics of the Mueller investigation
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:07.360]  now suddenly he thinks Mueller is without blemishes and that donald trump can be indicted for something
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:13.040]  that is not even a crime according to the former chairman of the federal election commission
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:19.360]  what have they got on the judge what are they hanging over his head i don't know but something here
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.920]  is just doesn't say it what about the fox news host we know was talking to wiki leagues and
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:28.240]  as a subject and reportedly napolitano has talked to him so what it's not illegal tell us about that
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.800]  yeah there's widespread speculation uh as you know somebody is fighting a subpoena uh
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.480]  that has been levied by uh mr. Mueller and that whole matter is sealed when there was a hearing
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:46.000]  on this in a federal courthouse two days ago they cleared the entire floor so that nobody
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:53.200]  could even see who the attorneys were who came and when widespread speculation unconfirmed is that
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:27:01.040]  that may be former fox news personality james rosen a good friend of judge napolitano's also
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:08.560]  a good friend of mine it was from rosen to napolitano to charles or tell that i got a tip
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:14.320]  incorrect as it turns out that the wiki leagues disclosures would regard the clinton foundation
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:20.160]  and i said that publicly it came from a perfectly legal sure exactly so what what's going on with
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:24.320]  flinn the judge is basically today i was just watching fox during the break they said hey you
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:28.080]  can go free we know you didn't do anything why are you putting guilty just say that they didn't
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:31.520]  read you your rights or warn you which they didn't and i'll let you go why are you gonna say you're
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:35.920]  guilty and flinn said i'm guilty let's get this over with that tells me they're holding some more
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:44.720]  stuff over his head execute his son that's what i believe the matter is oh i think general flinn
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:51.440]  is a great patriot and i think this story is a great tragedy uh and an extraordinary overreach
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:56.800]  it's a perfect example of what happens when they have no evidence whatsoever of russian collusion
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:04.000]  so now we invent perjury traps and process crimes in an attempt to take down those around the president
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.600]  general flinn exposed what the clintons and the obamas were doing in the middle east he exposed
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:16.560]  the falsity of the arab spring and that made him a target for the deep state my heart goes out to him
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:22.880]  today he is clearly a man who should have moved in court to to withdraw his guilty play but you're
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:28.960]  right alex something is being held over his head you're going to be in studio thursday and friday

[1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:16.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:32.560]  and by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:42.080]  you're promoting ignorance racism genocide anti-semitism these are all things that you
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:48.320]  are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes pewdiepie so be careful about this
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:52.320]  if someone decided to if something were to happen if pewdiepie were to be sued for this
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:57.840]  you could be complicit if you retweeted they could make you pay a fine as well because you
[1:33:57.840 --> 1:34:04.320]  have officially published anti-semitic things so if you are republishing this stuff you could
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:13.600]  get in trouble for it be very aware that that is a real thing you sound a while like pewdiepie i'm
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:37.200]  in the internet for a while yeah i'm just gonna say hey man i really appreciate your content you've
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:47.440]  come back here if you're a radio listener like what was i just listening to the last minute
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.400]  if you're a team of your you're like okay i see a just like an eighth or ninth grade class it's a
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:57.040]  school teacher saying if you go to pewdiepie's youtube channel with close to 100 million subscribers
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:03.760]  and 100 billion views that you're a bad person when you're a nazi and you're involved in genocide
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:08.320]  talk about defamation this is what they teach in schools all over the western world about pewdiepie
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:14.240]  alex jones john trump they teach in journalism class all these incredible lies about us and
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:19.920]  meanwhile they've got the left attacking what they've got the neocons from the weekly standard
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:25.200]  going under a national review that famously were designed to control the conservative movement that's
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:31.120]  been declassified and they've got ben Shapiro and everybody knows i'm not an infighter i love
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  sean hannity overall i love tucker carlson i love matt drudge i love all the other talk show hosts
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:43.280]  that care about america they're not perfect i'm not perfect but someone that has been popping up in
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:50.960]  my life since i heard about him from talk radio network host and not just michael savage
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.240]  i heard about him from other people and i used to not even care i'm like why are you calling me up
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:01.360]  they're not so much savage but he's bringing up to other big host about this horrible little snot
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:06.080]  knows young lawyer that everyone hated and they tell me all these stories and and i've got a good
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.400]  memory so we're talking 15 years later yes Shapiro's been around that long 10 years later
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:17.360]  you're you're you're sitting there going well what's going on with roi masters and you know the guy
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:21.840]  that own talk radio network that's where Shapiro according to all these people comes from i'm not
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:26.720]  paying attention to him he pops up at world net daily you know 10 12 years ago vox day knows him
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:32.240]  pretty well mentors him and then starts saying a few years ago hey this dude's really bad news
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:37.840]  he's like obi-wan kenobi figures out Darth Vader's bad uh and so i want and i appreciate him coming
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.800]  on in a rush today because i knew about this but i hadn't really been paying attention i'm so busy
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:47.520]  keeping info wars going under attack it comes out in the washington times that michael savage even
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:52.400]  though he has the highest ratings ever is going from three hours to one hour and he basically says
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.680]  it looks like they're taking me off the air they're going to pay out my contract but i'm on an hour
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:02.000]  others then predict around him i'm not going to say him that he'll just be off in three months
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:07.200]  so they're killing him softly and who are they replacing him with and Shapiro who's never really
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:12.720]  done talk radio other than being a guest is literally being put in his place with his audiences
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:18.560]  on these stations and again it's so crazy because savage would always bring up Shapiro and how much
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:25.040]  he hates him i would talk bad about Shapiro and he would call me and tell me oh my god you don't
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:29.840]  know how bad he is and then now i tried to call savage this morning he said i can't talk about it
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:33.440]  you know it's lawyer stuff i just can't discuss it but his lawyers are in the news
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.320]  but the stuff he told me years ago and again i wasn't like into gossip and savage is not a
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:43.360]  gospel either i'm like okay yeah whatever let's talk about the new world order
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:49.280]  the stuff he told me then started clicking this morning what the other host told me and
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:57.200]  i'm going to make some calls but my god folks ben Shapiro is a maniac loon and then he he gets
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.520]  these scripts he puts out and they all call him a genius on the left he's the never-trumper this
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:07.440]  is glen back 2.0 man and i'm telling you it's like the godzilla movies when one big monster comes to
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:12.400]  get godzilla and can't beat him one even twice as worse comes out of the ocean and this is it folks
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:19.760]  so vox day i'm so against in fighting which he doesn't do and i respect his work nobody for a
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:26.000]  decade best-selling author also a big independent comic book producer that i'm just like no i don't
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.880]  want vox day on you know he doesn't do interviews he does our show about how bad Shapiro is i just
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:35.600]  i don't want to be that person but now i realize just like glen beck was in the position of sabotaging
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:41.120]  us off radio stations and behind the scenes these are leftist folks and they're very dangerous so vox
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:45.920]  thanks for coming on uh you've got jordan eddix out we're selling it at info or store.com for
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:49.440]  christmas everybody should get it we'll tell people about that in a moment because you this is the
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:54.240]  double-headed uh creature coming out of the ocean in america right now because they don't want to
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.440]  just defeat the opposition they want to lead it so this is 2.0 controlled opposition give us your
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:04.320]  analysis in this segment and the next uh i know you've got to go then uh on what we're really facing
[1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:09.520]  with ben Shapiro because the real takeaway here is michael sabbage is being taken off the air
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:14.480]  for being number one and replaced with him and they're trying to hold him down with threats of
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:20.720]  legal action not just the money uh if he if he squirms just like uh gavin mcginnis last week i
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.760]  mean this means they're getting ready to make their move on trump go ahead yeah well i should
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:32.880]  probably give you a little bit background uh i've known ben Shapiro for 16 years i believe
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:42.080]  uh we were both contributors at world net daily and what was interesting to me was that ben was
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:51.360]  quite young of course and he never wrote anything except for the basic republican talking points
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:59.520]  and he wasn't very popular either i had access to all of the readership data and
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  and of all the weekly columnists uh pat Buchanan was number one and colter was number two i was
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:14.960]  number three uh michelle malkin was number four and ben Shapiro was around like number 19 or 20
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:21.360]  and this is at world net daily yeah this is at world net daily back in 2003 2004 that time frame
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:31.120]  and back around that time frame i got nationally syndicated by universal press syndicate which
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:42.960]  was the elite press syndicate um ben got syndicated by creator syndicate which uh had this way of
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:47.920]  pushing people by telling newspapers that if you want one of our popular columnists you need to
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:53.760]  take one of the less popular ones and they started pushing him really hard remember this is back in
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:41:01.840]  like 2003 2004 time frame and it was interesting because ben ended up having a crisis of conscience
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:06.800]  and he sent me some emails and said hey you know i've never had a i've never had an original thought
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:14.480]  for myself uh all i'm doing is repeating the talking points that people are giving me um
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:19.120]  you know what do you think i should do and i told him look you know you need to
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.480]  decide for yourself what you want to be do you want to be your own voice or do you want to
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:33.920]  be someone else's voice and in retrospect it's very clear that he decided to take the uh wide
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:41.040]  and easy path and that's why you're seeing him promoted incessantly because he's nothing
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:49.040]  but a talking puppet and that's why you you see him aligning with people like Dave Rubin
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:57.520]  people like uh jordan peterson uh all of these figures are being pushed forward and propped up
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:05.200]  because they are meant to be the official approved opposition because the left wing wants to
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:11.760]  uh publicly oppose itself thereby depriving you know moving the overton window to the left
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:20.640]  and depriving the genuine opposition which can be anyone from rush limbaugh to uh mike
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:28.080]  cernovich to you um and so forth uh they want to deprive the genuine nationalist opposition of any
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:34.160]  voice in the media and so that's why you're seeing Dave Rubin and jordan peterson talk about
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:41.920]  setting up an alternative to patreon because you've got the the hard sjw globalist left
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:49.280]  and they're trying to set up uh a near left fake opposition and they're gonna gatekeep as well
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.120]  because that's what i've always noticed about Shapiro is back from his days at controlling
[1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:59.920]  talk radio as well very young when they got him out of harvard you deserve a deep restful sleep

[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:05.040]  more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:11.280]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:17.360]  ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:25.120]  levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.640]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next
[1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:36.080]  we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:43.360]  within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:49.680]  the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:55.520]  can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:02.960]  purify it in the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:06.640]  of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week let's not just
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:11.280]  extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75 percent off double patriot points let's
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:18.720]  extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order even if it's a tube of fluoride free

[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:29.040]  supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be
[1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:34.240]  selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:38.320]  sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next

[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:17.040]  their attack frigates aimed at us and their cruisers and we're on fire now ladies and gentlemen
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:20.560]  everyone knows i'm not a gossip about other talk show host i'm not one of these men that can't handle
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:26.880]  somebody else being successful in fact i would love to support ben Shapiro but i have just confirmed
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:31.680]  and when i was told by three talk show host that i ignored because i'm not into this and these people
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  never gossiped they brought up ben Shapiro years ago and i will tell you michael sabbage again calls
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:43.760]  me sometimes and he went when i attacked Shapiro and he is shaking with anger about him and the
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:48.480]  things he's told me are unbelievable and then i went wait a minute hit me this morning i went
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:55.840]  oh my god two other big hosts told me stuff even worse one of these people told me how they wanted
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:03.360]  to beat him to death now this is a respect to talk show host and it just made me think so you
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:06.640]  were a mentor to him you were one of the top guys at world net daily let's go back you knew him when
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:10.720]  he was just going to college before he went to harvard and i know i'm running over you it's just
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:15.280]  it's just it's so insane how this is all coming together box and just how dangerous this guy is
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:25.440]  well the thing is i called him out back in 2005 when he was of an age to join the military
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:32.960]  and he was running around saying that the u.s should establish an empire his literal words
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:41.120]  uh on august 11 2005 were no one said empire was easy but it is right and good both for americans
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:48.560]  and for the world and what he was calling for was a invasion of iran saudi arabia syria
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:54.800]  egypt pakistan and others so the neocon plan yeah i mean what you have to understand about the
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:51:02.080]  neocons is that they are not merely left-wing they are the left-wing opponents of joseph stahl
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:09.680]  they're the students they're the students of of trotsky leon trotsky and they they came to the
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:15.440]  united states after stalin uh defeated trotsky and essentially kicked most of his followers out
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:21.440]  and so they realized that they couldn't make much traction in the democratic party so they
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:28.080]  reinvented themselves as as fake conservatives literally neoconservatives and they attempted
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:34.400]  to control the republican party which john potteritz himself admitted was the purpose of the weekly
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:43.280]  standard which as you know recently failed um their whole point has been to gatekeep and redirect
[1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:53.120]  the republican party and the american people away from nationalism away from america first
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:52:00.160]  and away from christianity we know they they are world revolutionaries and that's why they
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:06.800]  want to establish this global empire that's why they're constantly pushing for invading everything
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:12.160]  and everyone so simply point ben Shapiro is a died-in-wall third generation fourth generation
[1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:19.680]  trotskyite exactly and there's no question about this there's no question about this whatsoever
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:24.720]  and you know you you see him get called out occasionally he he runs around saying that
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:29.520]  everyone who is racist should be uh and and bigoted should be
[1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:35.600]  disemployed and they should be hunted down and and thrown out of their jobs and then at the
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:40.960]  same time he turns around and says well i don't care about the browning of america i don't care
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:47.440]  if americans are replaced i mean he sounds exactly like bill crystal and john potteritz and all the
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:54.640]  other things well no he says americans are lazy he's an acolyte of mr crystal precisely and so really
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:00.800]  ben Shapiro is is crystal and his father's who was the head of the trotskyites revenge
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:04.800]  and that's why they had a hard on for russia is that is that they went in they took over russia
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:11.600]  they got kicked out these globalists uh these atheists and and and and and now they're angry
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.960]  and that's why they hate russia so much well yeah what people tend to forget about Stalin
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:23.040]  is that Stalin was a a nationalist he wasn't russian he was georgian but he had no interest
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:30.880]  in world revolution and whereas trotsky did and so they got kicked out by Stalin and then after
[1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:38.960]  the fall of the wall they managed to worm their way back in but putin kicked them out again and so
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:46.480]  that's why the neocons hate putin and russia so much is because putin is a russian nationalist
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:52.560]  and so um the nationalists of any stripe as as you know and you've talked about this before
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:58.160]  the real struggle is no longer left right ideological it's actually globalist versus
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:04.400]  nationalist on the material level god versus satan jesus versus satan on the and that's why even the
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:09.040]  wiki league shows soros wants to overthrow israel because it's it's it's national versus
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:17.200]  versus globalist exactly you know when you when you look at israeli parties like z-hut and the other
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:25.280]  israeli nationalists they have no interest in ruling over ukraine or getting involved in russia
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:31.360]  or china yeah that that's not part of the israeli nationalist program now that there is a jewish
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:39.520]  homeland the the israelis want to focus on building it up just like any other nation with a homeland
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:45.200]  does but when you've got these world revolutionaries like ben shepiro like bill crystal like john
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:52.800]  potrots they desperately want to use what is left of american power and the american military
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.480]  to try to establish their world revolution and it's an absolute fact that the trotsky
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:01.440]  it's as you know it's been even quote in the wall street journal they've met it years ago
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:06.400]  that they wanted to basically take over the conservative movement because it was blocking
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:11.280]  communism but use it to take back over russia and then the world they just saw america as a
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:17.360]  bigger vehicle for global domination as you said because stalin for all of his horrible things he did
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:23.520]  was trying to make russia an industrialized power uh so he's very czarist uh or putin eski in that
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:29.520]  vein uh and so that's why the left went from hating uh from loving him to hating uncle joe
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:33.040]  and of course you were saying peters is much more dangerous and i was not disagreeing with you but
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:38.400]  i thought i'm telling you they're pushing superior on youtube google the algorithms and he's behind
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:44.240]  the scenes trying to take me off the air and i said whatever network becks involved with this is
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:51.120]  the new guy and now michael sabbage is being taken off the air and replaced with this guy i mean this
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:58.640]  is unbelievable yeah it's astonishing especially when you look at the fact that sabbage is the
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:04.160]  number two most popular radio host in the country this clearly is not a business decision this clearly
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:09.120]  is something that is being done for other reasons and we know what they are you know it's the same
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:16.320]  reason that i mean what you have to understand is ben Shapiro is a total mediocrity he's not
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:22.720]  particularly smart no he's a little man he has scripted lines and then the left and praises him
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.560]  and the and the establishment praises him the conservatives go here's a guy we can get behind
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:32.480]  and not get friction yeah because you just let the fox in the damn henhouse yeah it's exactly like
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:39.280]  the harlem globetrotters versus the washington generals the the left the the conventional
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:46.720]  left that everybody recognizes is the harlem globetrotters and then jordan peterson ben Shapiro uh
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:53.360]  dav rubin all these these the intellectual dark web as the new york time joe rogan's now joined it
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:57:00.320]  joe rogan too they are all set up to be the washington generals so they can go out there
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:07.280]  convince as much of the right as possible to follow them into defeat that's what they're there to do
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:15.440]  they're there to gatekeep and mislead and lead the right and lead the nationalists and lead the
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:20.080]  christians into defeat that's why i mean think about how ridiculous it is yeah look at the new
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.760]  time shows joe rogan and Shapiro and all of them in a big flattery piece these are the okay
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:29.840]  conservatives these are the ones yeah maybe they're a little bad but you know what oh my gosh i know
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:33.600]  the inside baseball on that do five more whether this box really longer we can and we've got oh
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:37.440]  and shroyer coming on did breaking news this is not about gossip it's not about no it's about
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:42.480]  understanding how the globalists are trying to take us down and there's now no doubt and i can't
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:47.600]  believe that i've been sitting on top the bomb show on Shapiro that i will release soon it's really
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:53.040]  hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to

[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:18.320]  from their money vox continuing here let's we'll get into other points about him but then after the
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:22.960]  break clearly they're trying to take everybody off the air now it's hit fever pitch now it's
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:28.640]  everybody i was first michael sabbage all of it they're they're gunning for tucker carlson
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:33.040]  they're gunning uh for they're go they're going for broke that means that there's a big event
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:40.320]  about to happen well you tend to think so um it's really kind of remarkable to see the extent to
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:45.680]  which the deplatforming is taking place um obviously i've experienced an amount of it you've
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:52.640]  experienced quite a bit of it um but the thing is is that this is only going to make us stronger in
[2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:58.800]  the long run the weak sisters are going to fall out um you know to a certain extent it's our own fault
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:05.920]  for allowing ourselves to make use of the platforms that belong to people who consider
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:11.680]  themselves our enemies and so but there's a lot of ways to hit back you know i mean we literally
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:19.200]  but we got deplatformed by a uh crowdfunding site and we are going to be hitting back so hard
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:26.400]  that there is a chance that this particular site is not going to survive and you know it it involves
[2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:32.320]  being smart it involves you know making sure that you read up on all the various terms of
[2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:39.280]  service in terms of use because you know the the left the globalist left is getting careless
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:48.400]  because they wrongly believe they have enough power and this is a common mistake that the left
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:57.040]  has historically made everywhere from Chile to um Spain uh you know again and again and and we're
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:03.280]  about to go through that kind of experience in the united states and in a number of countries
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:09.280]  across the west um the key thing that people on the right have to understand is that there's a reason
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:16.560]  why the globalists are so desperate to gatekeep us there's a reason why they're so desperate to
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:26.160]  raise up a Jordan Peterson a Ben Shapiro to limit and misdirect and divide us because they know
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:34.560]  that the numbers and the truth are on our side can you imagine what it's like for Michael Savage
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:38.640]  who's written over a hundred books many of New York Times bestsellers has an actual doctorate
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:44.640]  and bought me does care about the country it's number one in his time slot and then a lawyer
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:49.360]  that was hired to literally in his words do terrible things to him when he tried to leave
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:55.120]  talk radio network i mean i'll never bring this up savage would just bring it up is now the guy
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:04:02.000]  being given his show i mean man that would make me get really upset well i have to admit
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:09.280]  i was pretty annoyed when you know i got signed by universal press syndicate
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:16.400]  because they wanted me to eventually replace william f buckley now you know 12 years later
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:22.000]  that sounds entirely insane but it did make a little bit of sense of the time because you know
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:29.440]  i was probably the most intelligent of the you know the the young columnists of that era
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:33.920]  and you know that was what william f buckley was known for so it made sense in that context
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:35.920]  they're also trying to they were trying to compromise you
[2:04:39.680 --> 2:04:42.640]  well you know that's how they do it when you are at the top of your game they try to hire you
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:50.400]  yeah um maybe they were but they did a really incompetent job no i agree let's come back and

[2:06:05.200 --> 2:06:21.040]  the wage war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:32.160]  the intellectual grandchild of the trotskyites
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:36.160]  era parent the man to deliver america to the one world government
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:47.840]  and Shapiro and his fatherly figure jordan peterson we've been told by all the big hbo shows from
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:54.800]  vista bill mar that these are the conservatives that are smart and other conservatives that run
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:07:01.840]  around parroting them and the reason i raised this is michael sabich from nowhere already
[2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:07.920]  accomplished best-selling author helps create the blueprint for the relaunch of the republic
[2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:12.800]  that trump has adopted i'd say i'm gonna give a credit here but i was a large part of it our
[2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:18.000]  audience the large part of it sabich was a huge part of it ron paul people like vox day
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:23.200]  drudge for the platform but then you have this guy who's a globalist who vox day
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:28.000]  basically toodled who vox day helped at world net daily until he figured out
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.720]  that he wanted to empire in tyranny he learned this this show this this pupils got got really
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:36.880]  dark inclinations i'm not going to be associated with him and he was writing articles about him
[2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:40.800]  a decade ago does that tell you how dangerous he thought he was and vox didn't normally do that
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:47.280]  it's been a big syndicated columnist for decades so vox the time we have here looking at this
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:51.680]  michael sabich being taken off the air from three hours to one the word is in three months
[2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:55.840]  he's off the air they're going to pay out his contract threatening to sue him he doesn't even
[2:07:55.840 --> 2:08:00.400]  care about the money threatening to sue him if he talks about what happened is the non-disclosure
[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:05.520]  but i can talk about it because i know other people involved not from savage i know what
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:11.680]  savage you know has said about previous things and again we don't gossip folks i don't sit around
[2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:16.240]  the phone with people michael sabich doesn't do that but the phone rings when i tear into
[2:08:16.240 --> 2:08:22.000]  to to supero and he's like oh you don't know how bad he is oh i wish i could tell you oh my god
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:27.680]  oh and savages are normally like that and i'm going to stop right there out of respect for savage
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:34.320]  but you talk about a bee under the bonnet here and now he's going to take savages slot
[2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:38.960]  hoping he can steal the audience well i they may be able to silence savage they're not
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:43.920]  silent speakers here's the deal all these other men i know almost all of them savage has me on
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.760]  he's not afraid of the you know competition because we're not in competition we're competition
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:53.040]  against the globalist nationalist versus globalist we want to save the country in the world i love
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:56.400]  knowing a michael savages out there or rush limbaugh's out there they're not perfect but they
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:01.280]  still love the country and have good basic values they've got problems so do i but man when you
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:06.160]  talk about a bin chapiro these are the last trojan horse continue for the seven minutes we have
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:10.720]  their vox day and people get their pen and paper ready i'll give their website out before you
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:17.440]  leave us so it's just what are we facing here well what we're facing is attempts to
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:28.880]  marginalize everyone who is perceived as any sort of threat to the globalists to the one world order
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:36.240]  to the satanists and so forth i mean you have to understand that everybody is deceived to some
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:45.440]  extent you know i mean i used to talk about uh you know like the judeo christian ethic you know
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:52.320]  it's totally false there's no such thing there's a christian ethic and that's it you know um when
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:10:00.000]  you when you look at everything that people like chapiro talk about everything they say
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:08.480]  is meant to mislead you it's meant to sound good to you and then mislead you and misdirect you
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:14.160]  and guide you in a direction away from that which is threatening to the people who are
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:20.320]  trying to build the tower of babel again you know if you look at the references and here's
[2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:26.160]  here's the thing that's encouraging for those of us who are christians we know that we are
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:33.280]  going to win because god tells us in the bible the nations are still around at the end and so
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:38.480]  that means that all of their attempts are going to fail and the interesting thing is if you look at
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:45.120]  the history of unification whether you're talking about the unification that occurs in the bible
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.920]  whether you're talking about the unification of europe that has occurred in history and so forth
[2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:56.000]  it is always always always evil you know the unification of europe was first attempted by
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:03.120]  napoleon he actually managed to unify the entire continent of europe under his empire
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:11.360]  then hitler managed to do much the same thing now we've seen the eu do you know do exactly the
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:21.040]  same thing all of these attempts to unify and create empire are many attempts to rebuild the
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:28.640]  tower of babel and so when you look at a Shapiro when you look at uh jordan peterson and you look
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:34.320]  at what their policies are meant to do they are always always always in line with that and what
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:40.160]  you see about the intellectual dark web what you see about the controlled opposition what you see
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:48.640]  about the these characters is that none of them are ever christians none of them are ever christians
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:56.480]  and that's because christianity is the one force that is totally opposed to the concept of a
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:12:03.520]  world government under anything but jesus christ by the way i've had these people reach out to me
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:06.960]  and they you know it's an offering of conversations i won't say who but they actually go there's a
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:11.520]  problem Alex there's a problem and they it basically comes down to my christianity that
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:17.440]  i won't accept all the other quote systems to run my life and it really is spiritual oh there's no
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:24.240]  question i mean i think one of the reasons why you know you mentioned that that that you thought
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:31.280]  that perhaps um part of why i was offered that that high prestige syndication by ups was because
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:39.040]  they wanted to corrupt me but honestly they didn't even try and i suspect that's because they understand
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:49.040]  that i care about my faith and i am much more concerned about what jesus christ happens to
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:54.240]  think about anything than i am about you know a nicer house or a better car i mean you're a good
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:57.840]  rider and i mean back at the time the country wasn't as much trouble as it is now but now
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:03.840]  it's clearly you're not nationalist you're not christian uh you and and and then you'll be left
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.760]  alone well yeah that's true but what's interesting is what a bunch of intellectual mediocrities they
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:16.720]  are you you noted correctly that the subtitle of geordnetics was a journey into the mind of humanity's
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:24.880]  greatest thinker it's actually astonishing the appalling for anyone who is even a moderately
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:35.040]  decent thinker to follow the incoherence and the the stream of citations and the nonsensical tangents
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:39.760]  that leap from one subject to the next without making any sense to what but he does it with that
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:48.240]  leftist superconfidence and and so he's a what he uses a fop oh yeah but what i call it preemptive
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:53.280]  mirroring i actually go into some detail uh in this in the book and what he's really good at doing
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:14:00.400]  is creating this fog of a word salad that reflects your own that allows you to reflect your own
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:06.400]  opinion back to yourself but your own opinion is now reinforced with the gravitas of his
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:12.960]  supposed authority yeah that's it he puts out a pantheistic statement of buzzwords so basically
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:17.440]  anyone listening thinks whatever they've been programmed with is right uh but really you're
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:23.200]  just learning to follow him so he can then slide in the whole unification theory yeah that's
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:29.600]  part of it but and what it's all based on is you feeling good about him confirming what you
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:34.800]  already believe yeah and the fact that the fact that you and i might believe different things
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:41.520]  and be sitting next to each other um we hear him say the same thing but we but he says the same
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:48.800]  thing but we hear it differently and we perceive it differently and then um it's really a conmans game
[2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:53.920]  and it every it's kind of funny because every now and then he screws up and then he desperately
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:15:01.600]  tries to um come up with some excuse but of course like Owen Benjamin says liars always lie
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:06.160]  and they have to lie some more so usually he digs himself in even deeper when he's trying to cover
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:10.480]  his ass for his last mistake no i totally agree we'll come back come back soon volks we're very
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:15.440]  excited about the great work you're doing uh and again obviously they're getting ready to make their
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:22.400]  move on trump they're really scared about the yellow vest uh 30 seconds on that uh the gilet
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:31.120]  genre movement is much bigger than people realize i have seen uh yellow vests in italy i've seen them
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:38.560]  in switzerland um they're all over the place i mean i'm talking about you go you drive by a school
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:46.640]  in italy and you'll see kids wearing the yellow vest you know it is it is now the european sign
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:52.240]  of resistance and uh don't be fooled by like the fake demands hold on you said you're we're gonna
[2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:55.120]  bring on here but you gotta finish up on the other side we can't leave you there we'll be right back

[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:39.600]  okay finishing up vox i appreciate your time we were getting into the announcement that the
[2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:44.000]  michael sabbitt show is going to be canceled and he's not allowed to tell you that but i can tell
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:48.400]  you that from other sources and uh i'm just gonna leave it that i've confirmed it he's going from
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:52.640]  three hours to one hour starting next month and then he will be cancelled uh three months after
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:57.760]  so they're just smothering him with a pillow for being number one and the the great one the new
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:04.080]  leader the furah ben shaperos gonna be here so finishing up with what with what you were saying
[2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:10.080]  about the state of the world as we hit the break vox day well the important thing to understand is
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:15.520]  that the reason that michael savage can be canceled is because he doesn't have his own platform
[2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:20.800]  you know if you didn't if you were working for cbs rather than for yourself at info wars
[2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:27.840]  you'd be done and so conservatives and people on the right and people who are nationalist and people
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:34.160]  who are who love america um and people who are christians need to understand that they need to stop
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:40.640]  playing on the turf of the people who want to destroy everything they love and so and they
[2:22:40.640 --> 2:22:47.760]  also need to stop supporting the organizations and corporations that hate them and you know i i
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:52.240]  realize i'm preaching i'm literally preaching to the choir here since uh people who are watching
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:56.800]  this are already supporting what you're doing and supporting we're on over 250 stations new
[2:22:56.800 --> 2:23:00.000]  listeners every minute i mean you're talking to they're talking a lot of new people too i mean
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:09.280]  they need to know this yeah so the thing is is that you are in a cultural war you're not in a
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:18.800]  uh international ideological struggle for the direction that we should all go you are in a
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:26.320]  existential cultural war with people who want to destroy christianity who want to destroy america
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:31.360]  and who want to destroy western civilization let's explain they don't want to just conquer
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:36.560]  you they want to overwrite you explain for those that new listeners what existential war means it
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:44.560]  means total real every level complete exactly and the only reason that the war has not really gotten
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:52.720]  into violence yet is because we outnumber them we can still completely defeat them without it getting
[2:23:52.720 --> 2:23:57.360]  to the level you're right they're the mouse taming the lion they're the mouse taming the lion
[2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:03.600]  right and that's why they're constantly raising up the ben Shapiro's and the jordan peterson's
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:10.560]  in order to try to neutralize the stronger force and so that's why we need to understand that we
[2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:17.120]  are the strong horse we merely need to stand up for what we believe in stop being afraid and start
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:23.760]  supporting the people who stand up for the stuff that you really believe in and not these fake
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:31.280]  conservatives these you know fake americans like jordan peterson and ben Shapiro and i've noticed the
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:37.200]  leftist greatest power is showing their method anti-fun their idiot purple hair people and all
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:41.040]  their prozac heads we think oh those are a bunch of idiots they're at the crazy universities no
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:46.240]  they're going into the cia and nsa they're teaching your kids they're spying on you they're doxing you
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:51.120]  they're becoming lawyers and they believe they are the ruling class and they have a right to hit you
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:55.760]  in the head with a bike lock okay and and they think they're smarter than you but if you just get
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:00.320]  aggressive and stop financially supporting globalist and start supporting independent real folks and
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:06.240]  start really just calling into c-span talk radio go to a hillary event go to a leftist event get in
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:10.720]  their face you're gonna find once you do it you're not scared anymore uh really impressed with the
[2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:15.200]  work you're doing vox i'm glad that you raised the alarm just people that just joined us we have
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.760]  new listers every 20 minutes spend 60 seconds on you didn't want to go after ben Shapiro you
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.080]  were a mentor to him at world net daily when he was just getting out of high school uh going to
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:28.160]  well before he went to harvard so just to spend a minute on why you've been warning the world for
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:35.360]  a decade about ben Shapiro well what bothered me about ben Shapiro was that he was of an age
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:40.320]  to join the military you wrote about him in 2005 let's be clear you've been warning about him for
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:48.960]  that long yeah i i knew what he was i i i named him the littlest chicken hawk back in 2005 because
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:55.280]  he was of an age to join the military and you know i have a lot of uh friends in the military my
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:00.240]  family was heavily military um i actually went to enlist with the marines at the beginning of
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:09.200]  desert shield and the the fact that he was advocating empire and and permanent war
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:15.440]  and saying that we should invade iran and saudi arabia and pakistan and all these countries
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:21.200]  and yet he was not willing to go to war himself told me everything i needed to know about his
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:27.680]  lack of integrity i mean you were right about it when he was a nobody saying danger danger will
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:35.120]  robinson yeah but you know at the time i didn't think that he would i i would have been shocked
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:42.720]  back then to find out that he has become as significant a cultural and media figure as he's
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:46.880]  become because i know that he's not that smart and imagine let me explain something you don't
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:52.320]  start a talk radio show in two months and then be given michael savages that'd be like you're in
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:56.720]  high school football and and and you're a you're a sophomore you're not even a starter
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:05.520]  and you're given the top draft pick for the nfl no it's it's absolutely absurd and what you see
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:12.800]  is like ben Shapiro runs twice he's like publicly proposed debates and i said sure ben i'll debate
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:20.880]  you and i mean he ran away like the roadrunner it was hilarious and you know this is supposed to be
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:28.240]  this feared uh whip smart debater and again his only claim is the left protest team but then the
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:32.160]  real left brings him on tv box day thanks for the time look forward to having you on again soon
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:37.680]  thanks alex thank you uh well we're gonna come back and go a little bit the next hour paul and
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:41.200]  you got a lot coming up in your show today but i don't like getting up here attacking other people
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:46.880]  like ben Shapiro but my god this guy is a neocon and ever trumper he's he's in league with glenn
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:52.880]  back and he is literally being given billionaire support and being given michael savages show
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.640]  and michael savages contractually can't defend himself well you know what i'm going to defend
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:01.440]  michael savages well and i think that what's really happening here is savages biggest audience
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:05.680]  well his two biggest audiences are ksfo and then i believe it's kabc in new york city and that's the
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:11.040]  one he's being squeezed out of uh as of right now the last i heard he's going to be able to maintain
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:14.240]  some of his stations they're only going to carry him for one hour but he's gonna have to go to a
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:18.800]  podcast format i got this is the they're they're they're this is how when they get rid of somebody
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:23.200]  say oh you have a weekend show i talked they've been trying to squeeze them out they're getting rid
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:26.640]  of him and giving Shapiro a show yeah they've been and i think they're doing this so Shapiro
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:30.560]  doesn't get to blame with the audience they're nice and savage and going get in here kid take
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:35.360]  his place really is it all right i mean they're gonna blame me no kid they won't notice what we're
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:41.120]  doing kill savage shut up quick i think it's good because i mean Shapiro's radio program is gonna fail
[2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:48.240]  so if we expose it and boy does he need to fail what a piece of un-american trash god this guy

[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:11.280]  just broke we should just throw out here the hill is reporting so you have no idea if it's true
[2:34:11.280 --> 2:34:15.760]  they lie so much but actually this is a ruling judge rules cop schools had no duty to shield
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:21.760]  students in parkland shooting lawsuit that's right and of course they've ruled that before
[2:34:21.760 --> 2:34:27.200]  because you have a duty to protect yourself that's why you should understand that when you
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:31.280]  send your children to a victim disarmament zone you're advertising it's a place for the left to
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:35.680]  prepare the shooter the brainwash person and protect them now i never said nobody died there i
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:40.720]  never said they were uh crisis actors i said they picked four anti gunners from the drama
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:45.920]  department to go be the anti-gun spokesperson fill the 3000 children so cnn and others said
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:51.520]  jones says nobody died jones is bullying the children none of it was true and youtube took us
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:55.120]  off we showed the proof they had to put us back but they later just got rid of me and
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:00.160]  didn't even give a reason uh or they said i beat up a kid which i didn't it was a video from abc news
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:03.920]  of a kid attacking somebody they pushed them down but it sounds good you know jones got taken
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:09.600]  on very beat children uh so now they're uh reporting that broward county also known as coward
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.240]  let's remove the br but i'll see the coward coward county
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:23.280]  where you have all this weird corrupt election fraud going on mass shootings you name it
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:27.920]  that they're good people standing down and doing nothing well what did we really report back then
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:31.760]  we had all the students on there was a stand down the police were all waiting outside during this
[2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:38.080]  happening and so there we are vindicated again and the judge says hey if somebody comes in the
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:42.960]  school to kill your kids that's been protected the leftist program uh said that mr cruz had
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:46.720]  committed all these burglaries and attacks and threats because his last name was cruz even though
[2:35:46.720 --> 2:35:51.440]  he wasn't hispanic well it's part of a leftist program to not put him in jail so they protected
[2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:56.320]  him every step of the way to kill your children and to stand down and that's the democrats for you
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:03.360]  alan well now kind of flashing back to that time alex i'm realizing now how much devastating
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:08.960]  information we put out to disrupt their narrative and if you look at this now okay look at all the
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:12.960]  facts that have come out we were right about the police standing down we were right about the fbi
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:19.360]  standing down on cruz and we were and then what happened is they had a vote on the school board
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:26.640]  they voted 13 to 1 to arm their teachers alex so the entire leftist media saying oh my gosh this is
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:31.280]  all the guns fault oh poor thing no as we said originally it was the cops fault for standing
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:36.080]  down it was the fbi's fault for standing down on the cruz background checks and then ultimately
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:40.800]  having guns on the campus while it doesn't sound good nobody wants to think that way
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:44.960]  was going to be the ultimate conclusion here and that's what they reached but you won't see any of
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:49.680]  that reported on all the news alex alex that they want to do a band band you're right on a
[2:36:49.680 --> 2:36:54.400]  firearm which by the way trump's administration is going to ban bump stocks alex that's an f to me
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:59.280]  i don't like yeah that's hurt trump really really bad but you know he asked the rn they said sir
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:04.640]  they're garbage they're not any use so he so trump sees his ass so what and that's a big big f for
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:10.560]  trump but but let's shift back ben Shapiro to go national as michael sabbage cuts back to one hour
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:15.440]  that's radio insights you read they think oh sabbage is retiring no sabbage can't talk as a
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:20.240]  contract he's been told his show's gone from three hours to one they're just going to get rid of it
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:23.920]  they just don't want to piss people off when here's your new person you tune into here michael
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:28.320]  sabbage instead you can't ben Shapiro the amazing always makes this face right here like
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:34.880]  i can't even do it he's no you can't even don't even try it you're too manly just like that
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:40.800]  yeah i mean he's imagine if you mixed a clone of him with brian stelter let me let me try to
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:42.880]  do a superior face i can do it go back to camera one place
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.600]  it's like a super villain you can't do it hold on hold on look at the satisfaction look look look
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:58.000]  no just just try to be try to be the most condescending arrogant punk yeah there it is
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.720]  that's not bad actually right there hey how you doing then you know i'm a trusty that you dumb
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:09.920]  americans i just that's the look like i just got all michael sabbage's stations even though i
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:15.120]  just got in talk radio two months ago and have no ratings i'm ben Shapiro i'm ben Shapiro
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:20.800]  it think about this alex fox news never allows you on air never's allow uh never allows michael
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.200]  sabbage on air you guys are bigger than ben Shapiro who gets boosted and amplified by fox news every
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:30.720]  day he's a good boy he's a good boy he's a nice neil con who who thinks we should invade every
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:36.960]  country in the middle east but it's beyond that it's the snivelingness of him but see when you when
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:40.720]  you meet some of these people alex doesn't it kind of stun you to realize how how many people
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:44.880]  are just in it because they want to be famous or make some money oh that's what you run into
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:49.040]  is the people like that are in like local tv or whatever they're literally narcissistic loons
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:53.600]  that are in love with getting in front of some camera yeah and talking to maybe 5000 people
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:58.000]  i mean we're in a total war they're coming after us this is exciting this is a fight
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:04.160]  it isn't about being on air i i don't think i've seen you spend uh one minute in makeup
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:07.840]  since i've been working here for three years these people that go on television and look
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:10.720]  i'm not insulting everybody on television i have friends who go on television the point is
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:16.160]  they spend an hour and a half before they go on tv just in makeup and that's most of the men
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.400]  out there too alex so how well oh and you know obviously i'm not gay but you're a quite handsome
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:24.720]  guy you don't need to me it might be a little easier on the eyes i just don't like it i just
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:28.000]  can't do it every once in a while they have like uh ear and grown hairs and i put a little
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:31.680]  dot or something on there but you know it's not about what i look like it's about the information
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:36.880]  well that's what i'm saying i i'm so busy just getting information right up to show time i don't
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:41.360]  even have time to think about what i look like half the time my hair is a mess i don't even care

[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:02.480]  i just work all the time you know it's kind of hard when they're just attacking constantly well
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:06.000]  plus you know i mean you take care of your kids the media wants to act like you don't care about
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:09.040]  your kids you really do i mean well you know the media says i don't have my children well that's

[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:27.360]  the same vein they do a Shapiro where they put out the story like oh you know savage must be gone
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:32.240]  you know he's getting he's quitting on us he's gone but Shapiro's here to save us like no savage

[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:42.560]  that's kind of the same developing news from last night uh there's going to be a continuance
[2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:48.080]  in the flin sentencing so they have not concluded that but what's happening there's a judge is like
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:53.040]  you didn't do anything say you're not it's weird to say it's a weird i am guilty it's the weirdest
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:58.640]  saying they're they're saying you were never guilty you didn't lie to the fbi but they're
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:02.800]  also saying at the same time you sold your country down the drain and you're an embarrassment that's
[2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:06.880]  right out of the judge's mouth so it's like wait a second you're saying that he was set up i mean

[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:02.800]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:07.280]  let's not just extend the sale free shipping store wide 50 to 75 percent off double patriot

[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:24.400]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:29.520]  t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:33.520]  of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:38.960]  next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever

[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:12.800]  take action right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:15.040]  because there's a war on for your mind
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:28.880]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:36.560]  good music right here california dreams
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:46.400]  i found a little church and we sit here and we're confident about this but we're seeing
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:53.840]  horrible censorship and now pewdiepie the number one video host in the world over 100 billion views
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:59.920]  77 million subscribers the list goes on and on they're calling him a nazi for having a short
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:04.400]  haircut and wearing round glasses and in one video game where he plays video games every day online
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:10.240]  some guy had a rabbi shekel's name and he laughs and oh look that guy shot somebody another person
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:16.240]  and that turns into he's a nazi the authoritarianism of the digital nazis is simply
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:21.520]  unprecedented and to see them making this move oh and you made the point or in the break
[2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:26.480]  michael sabbage is number one in all the big cities he's on his time slot
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:30.960]  number one on the big new york station and they're taking him for three hours to one hour not letting
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:35.680]  him tell the world he's really been canceled to give it to ben Shapiro who has terrible ratings
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:43.680]  and went into talk radio just a few months ago that's like that's like giving somebody you know
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:48.320]  who can't even who's not out of diapers yet let them drive a car and it just shows how
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:54.560]  this guy is a complete puppet will do whatever he's told well and to me i i think it sucks just
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:49:00.400]  for the radio industry in general alex because what you've just done on a lot of these syndicated
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:04.800]  stations that savages on is you you've probably now killed those radio stations they're not going
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:08.720]  to be able to sell advertising they're not going to be able to probably exist much longer or at
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:11.520]  least have big ratings like they did with something just be a bunch of hype and first oh my god
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:16.480]  ben Shapiro he's such a genius the liberals told me he's a genius and it'll it'll it'll die down
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:20.240]  after a month or two and the ratings will be kaput and and unfortunately i think this is probably
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:25.120]  going to kill a lot of radio stations alex i mean you know well they could just pick our show up
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:28.480]  of course they can and i mean radio stations pick our show up and they don't even tell us
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:33.600]  well what i like well that's we don't tell them we don't list a list of them because
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:38.240]  we don't want the right right a couple leftists to call up and it's all empty threats but oh and
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:41.680]  this shows to me what we already know they're making their move on trump they are going after
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:47.040]  everybody well let's see if you remove alex jones from the internet which is what they've
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:51.280]  effectively done removing it from social media which here's a perfect example like last night alex
[2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:57.200]  you see the narrative come out how they're gonna indict president trump so you're like okay look
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:01.840]  i'm competitive i mean info wars is competitive with fox news folks and we are we've already trumped
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.800]  cnn and msnbc we're we're on this we had way more subscribers than all of them combined so so what
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:11.520]  happens is alex you realize your role in the information war and you have to counter this
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:17.440]  narrative so so we go live last night but guess what you're not allowed to go on the main highway
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.600]  you're not allowed to go into the arena where all the eyes are because they don't want you
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:26.320]  counting the narrative they want you to they want to be able to say whatever it is totally unchecked
[2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:30.080]  and you're not able to access here's an example five six weeks ago when the yellow vest thing
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:34.240]  started they were nationalist anti-globalist anti open borders the media said no they're
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:38.960]  anti gas tax well that was part of it and then five weeks later they go okay now it's turned
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:43.680]  into a nationalist movement but it shows how they try to brand everything up front and they don't
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:48.160]  want us there to go no here's interviews with yellow vest we sent reporters there here's what
[2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:53.280]  they're all saying why are you here new world order open borders radical islam uh taxes are too high
[2:50:53.280 --> 2:50:58.960]  and the same cliche that we hear first impressions you know you only get one and they're the the most
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:03.440]  important that's what happens with these narratives so the first narrative you see on a topic on
[2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:09.680]  television or wherever that's the one you believe and so that's why they have to totally eradicate you
[2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:14.240]  from the airwaves and the same thing goes for michael savage now savage uh you know i don't
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:18.800]  necessarily think his role is is countering narratives he does that but his role is guess
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:23.760]  what he's a nationalist he's real he doesn't buy corporate media he's gonna call it as he's saying
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:28.720]  the country has an identity and it's okay and and he's written books about this and so and guess what
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:34.800]  he's proud to be a white male so they really hate that about so they're just going down the list
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:40.720]  and whoever is helping americana they're removing ahead of the big event taking president trump out
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:46.640]  which is why he's got to understand fox news is making their move on hanity and everybody right
[2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:50.880]  now and they're going to do it right before they get trump and you'll know right before they get
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:55.760]  trump whether it's assassination or whatever it's going to be shon hanity will be taken off the air
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:52:01.520]  yeah watch a hand and then shon hanity will like he'll get hit by a car by outside his house they're
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:04.880]  going to kill shon hanity they're going to kill him or yeah just tuck her cross and oh same thing
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:10.080]  with me if you hear alex jones is dead you better be it's on well and i don't know if you've talked
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:14.480]  to michael savage about this either and this is a little more inside baseball michael savage and
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:19.600]  laura ingram really good friends laura ingram got a program on fox news about uh six months ago
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:23.520]  promised michael savage she would have him on promised said don't worry michael i'm gonna beat
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:28.400]  your blacklist i'm having on nope nope and she still goes every night does her i'm not i'm not
[2:52:28.400 --> 2:52:32.240]  talking trash on laura ingram that's just how the point is it's it's how controlled it's not like
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:36.000]  we're trying to get on fox it's because savage wouldn't sell out the fox they tried to get
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.320]  tried to give me fox new shows with man cow and stuff and it was just stupid it was weekend shows
[2:52:40.320 --> 2:52:44.560]  and i wasn't going to do it the point is is that's what's going on this shows us the canary in the
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:50.000]  coal mine they're taking everybody off that's why they've got the southern property law center
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:55.440]  through local fake journalists sending out fake things we never said or did to stations
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:59.920]  and saying take them off and sending them to the corporate heads of it a lot of stations have said
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:05.680]  well this makes us mad we're going to take you from at night to during the day we're not going to
[2:53:05.680 --> 2:53:10.720]  be intimidated but but but one station said okay yo sacramento this is we're breaking the snooze
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:15.680]  we're going to take you off alex because well the owners they just don't want the trouble well
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:21.360]  see the trouble is the left is the trouble we're covering what's really happening and again i run
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:26.400]  my own show i'm not and i get savage follows his contract savage cannot tell the world through his
[2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:32.160]  lawyer his lawyer though came out and obliquely said well they took alex jones off and others and
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:36.640]  that's what this probably really is and you know they're not just really cutting a show he's not
[2:53:36.640 --> 2:53:41.120]  happy about this he's got the best ratings ever they're about to just take him fully off the air
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:46.400]  they just don't want it to be a big thing they want to just transfer the audience happily over
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:53.280]  to men's Shapiro steal it and then just send him off into the sunset uh but again it's not just the
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:59.280]  money of his contract they've got to pay out he doesn't care about the money michael savage obviously
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:06.000]  they'll sue him if he talks about the what's really going on it's the same thing with gab
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:11.520]  mcginnis you know gab mcginnis i get this from gab and i got from anyone else he has to go out and
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:17.600]  say glenbeck's wonderful person no the day after glenbeck took over crtv he was fired and so it's
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:21.760]  the same crap and then you know glenbeck has him on and pats him on the head and does all this
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:28.000]  these white shoe boy sobs have a formula well here's the deal there's one organization well

[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:59.440]  and then a hundred people get mad it's all crap it's the mouse that roared well it's these leftist
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:04.320]  email change that i'm i'm on a few of them and i i suggest info warriors out there do this i mean
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:09.280]  honestly you know sign up for sleeping giants and yeah you sign up for the for these leftist email
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:13.200]  chains in your local area and they'll send out all their directives and you can get ahead of them
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:17.760]  and kind of stop some of them actually i was able to do a couple of those here in austin texas
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.720]  you just go out and and like oh they're gonna they're gonna call on this day
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:26.080]  so you know you call you could actually call first be like hey i want to warn you're about to get
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:29.600]  a hundred calls from leftist complaining about this nativity scene it's all fake it's all been
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:33.920]  manufactured so then you kind of soften the blow when they hear it and they're like and again they
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:38.400]  just oh they don't care about some moss gonna care about the satanic temple thing they just crave
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:43.440]  controlling christians because we're the producers they see us as their food actually alex there is
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:48.320]  one thing i want to mention because i think it's indicative as to exactly where the democrats want
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:54.080]  to take america versus anyone who's not a democrat a story came out in the usa today yesterday the
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:59.120]  50 most expensive zip codes in the united states the 50 every one of them's liberal they're rent
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:06.000]  singers they were all in new york or california and i think it was i think it was 40 of them 40 of
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:11.760]  them were in california so think about this alex the state of california which has the highest
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:18.960]  debt of any other state which has the most poverty most drug use most homelessness most
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:24.560]  literally feces on the streets of any other state in the united states and yet they have all the
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:28.880]  richest people too isn't it amazing how that works in democrat california so you have the
[3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:33.360]  wealthiest people in california with the most money and the best land and then you have the
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:39.520]  poorest people that get their drugs and feces ridden streets to live on that's california
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:45.920]  that's the democrat america that socialism right there just like venezuela or anywhere else they
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.720]  do this on purpose it's in the wiki lakes keep them poor keep them desperate keep them dumb
[3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:55.600]  i'm just amazed that people don't see this alex i mean this is this is no this is not rhetoric
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:02.000]  this isn't hyperbole not suggesting anything this isn't bias it's a fact it's a fact these people

[3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:22.400]  whatever you do take action because the globalists are moving on everybody i mean i look i feel more
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:27.440]  hurt by michael savage what he's going through than i even feel for myself because when one of us
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:32.800]  is getting picked on and screwed over i feel it that's called empathy and the psychopaths think
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:36.880]  that's a weakness no that's our strength but i feel bad for him because he's under the control
[3:08:37.680 --> 3:08:41.920]  of that big cbs syndicator and they've made a deal to put ben Shapiro in his show even though
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:46.800]  his ratings are number one i mean this is outrageous and then his contract he can't tell you what
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:51.120]  they're doing to him well this is the layers of arrogance though alex it's just like they thought
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:54.640]  they could kind of ghost you on social media with the shadow bands you were still effective
[3:08:54.640 --> 3:08:58.320]  you were still number one so they just went ahead and just chopped you off same with savage they
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:01.680]  thought uh let's just keep them off fox news we'll keep them on these little radio stations he'll
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:05.840]  have no impact he won't be able to sell any books every book he writes becomes the number one best
[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:10.960]  seller you know on new york times or whatever so that's their problem is they can't stop us
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:14.720]  they can't stop us so they have to kill us that's right you're coming up at about 50 minutes paul
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:21.440]  watch him i mean like this announcement we may have to let paul go um potie pie lost his disney
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:26.640]  contract um because he wouldn't go out of their control and let youtube control him with his 77
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:32.720]  million subscribers and 100 billion or whatever his viewers well so many views uh the vox is
[3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:37.840]  reporting well street journals reporting potie pie what's the proof he wears wire glasses that
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:42.880]  are somewhat similar to hemler that's a fake photo of hemler and it's worse he's got a haircut like
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:47.360]  paul watson exhibit a uh can we get a shot of paul police on screen uh full screen for paul police
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:52.720]  paul gotta let you go dude you got a hitler haircut they even said the news it's a hitler
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:58.800]  haircut so uh it's it's it's it's over for you i mean wall street journal says it's the proof i mean
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:05.200]  you know it's it's and meanwhile they're they're editing a live video on france tv signs that say
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:10.160]  bad things about macron so they've now got running man-level editing where there's an article in
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:15.200]  fours dot com where they're covering up signs and images in live time paul so paul do you want to
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:22.320]  apologize uh for uh for for your hitler haircut i can only deeply apologize alex yeah i think
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:27.520]  there was an article about eric trump about 18 months ago he had a similar haircut it's not
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:32.080]  because it's generally a popular haircut across the western world alex obviously that has nothing
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:37.600]  to do with it it's all because we're secretly fascist that pewdiepie scandal by the way
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:43.040]  they had a buzzfeed reporter joe bernstein who claimed that and you talked about this earlier
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:48.000]  because he appeared in a game with a character called rabbi shekel that was the avatar of the
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:53.280]  person playing the game that that makes him an actually that's like saying alex anytime you go
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:11:00.000]  outside your door anybody who you come into the the near vicinity with you automatically adopt all
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.200]  their political beliefs and all their extremist political beliefs he was laughing at the fact
[3:11:05.200 --> 3:11:11.120]  that the guy was doing an effusive speech about how much he loved pewdiepie and then one of the
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:17.520]  other characters in the game killed him so his audio was cut off that's what was funny about it
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:23.360]  he claimed bernstein of buzzfeed news that it was some anti-semitic conspiracy theory just
[3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:27.440]  absolutely you're going to take over and do that but that's what all nazis say scroll back up for
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:34.080]  tv viewers there's an article on info wars dot com government-owned french tv is now in live videos
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:40.480]  able to edit uh signs that are anti-macron uh so this is an incredible new level and the reason
[3:11:40.480 --> 3:11:46.640]  i raised that poll document cam shot please fighting the reality of deep fakes and they're
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:52.080]  going to say you're a deep fake that the misleading video shared by info wars editor-at-large paul
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:57.200]  watson was asked about the clip sanders response is the question is did the reporter make contact
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:01.920]  or not the video is clear he did we stand by our statement all you did was zoom in we've already
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:10.160]  done this but they're accusing you at the uh the media lab of a deep fake a deep fake is running man
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:15.120]  where mad dog ben richards actually tries to stop them killing the food riot that's a good then they
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:20.640]  edit the video and and show him going i'm going to kill them you won't stop me we're in running man
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:28.000]  right now yeah so paul what do you make of this french tv is doing deep fakes you're not oh the
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.360]  french tv channel which is state owned it was just human error alex they said it was human
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:38.960]  error just a mistake that they deliberately doctored the protest placard to edit out the
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:44.720]  insult against macron no deep fake or a doctored video is when you deliberately edit something
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:50.160]  to mislead as i said a million times and trump backed me up on this that wasn't doctored because
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:55.840]  i didn't deliberately edit anything to mislead they use that to distract from the narrative
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:13:01.040]  that basically jim acosta put his hands on a woman when he swatted her away uh with his left arm
[3:13:01.040 --> 3:13:06.240]  they used it to distract from that so it's not doctored that's not a deep fake you can't claim
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:10.560]  that that's a deep fake when it wasn't deliberately done to mislead it was just a different edit a
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:15.520]  different upload different frame rate of a video which was paul i agree you're taking over right now
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:19.840]  as the original you're taking over right now but human error when french tv does it i agree they're
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:23.680]  you're gonna recap it all coming up what they're getting ready to take trump out though i mean the
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:27.920]  fact that don't you agree the fact they're taking everybody off the air right now michael sabbage
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:34.080]  gab mcginnis i mean this is total this means they're making their move paul i think the backlash is
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:39.040]  growing though alex the um the response to sagan evac had losing his patreon was
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.960]  vast it's unfortunate some of these people didn't respond in kind when you were de-platformed but
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:51.600]  sam harris who was quite a mainstream intellectual deleted his own patreon account in protest against
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:56.720]  patreon de-platforming sagan evac had who is a youtuber and they're losing money they're hemorrhaging
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:01.840]  money uh thousands of dollars from eating individual creator every day they're losing
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:06.480]  they had to put out a statement and kind of backpedal on it a little bit so they're in big
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:13.200]  trouble so when finally starting to see a backlash people leaving these platforms in protest against
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:18.800]  their mistreatment of their own users so i think the backlash has really started in earnest now alex
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:23.680]  all right you're taking over great job you'll also be hosting uh during the first hour on thursday
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:28.160]  when owen is going to be taking over the command base great job paul joseph watch you've got some
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:31.600]  great videos out today as well that you'll be playing and talking about paul watch and takes
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:36.480]  over war room is in 45 minutes at info wars dot com forward slash show and local stations please
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:44.160]  for the work okay thanks alex yep we're talking about today about two issues mainly i've talked
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:49.760]  about it before cultural relativism you always see this story is about you know female backpackers
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:53.920]  going on these holidays to these remote remote locations in africa in the middle east and what
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:15:00.800]  happens to them they wind up raped and killed and it's happened once again with two rock climbers
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:07.280]  two mountain climbers in morocco um a dain and a swede i believe it was who met a violent death
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:12.480]  after going to this remote location and were basically according to some reports beheaded
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:16.960]  this is not the first time we've seen this so i'm going to get into the psychology behind that
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:22.480]  the psychology of cultural relativism and this idea among leftists which we've seen before there
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:28.480]  was an american couple killed by isis recently in similar circumstances this idea that evil doesn't
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:34.080]  exist and that our view of other cultures being dangerous or being deadly is just because we
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:40.800]  misunderstand their cultures when no evil does exist the world has dangerous places it has dangerous
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:45.520]  people and you have to be cognizant of that you have to have discernment so we're going to get
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:50.080]  into that and more we're going to get into harvard saying that there needs to be 50 percent female
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:56.000]  firefighters coming next on the xjl live don't go hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over

[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:05.680]  and i've been beating them ever since i wrote the book on tax debt settlement and i've helped thousands

[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:23.040]  host paul joseph watson we are live it's the fourth hour of the alex jones show in the next
[3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:28.880]  segment we're gonna play my video which went up late last night on youtube the cultural significance
[3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:33.760]  of tick tock you don't really need to understand what tick tock is to understand what's going on
[3:20:33.760 --> 3:20:40.240]  with generation z they've basically created a trolling culture as a backlash to millennial
[3:20:40.240 --> 3:20:46.080]  outrage culture they're into edgy humor they're into edgy banter and it is a ray of light because
[3:20:46.080 --> 3:20:52.640]  they're not of the same breed they're not this this safe space permanently triggered mentally
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:57.920]  fragile generation that we saw with the millennials who are now basically running the social media
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:21:04.800]  companies that are deplatforming everyone so there is hope in generation z which of course is people
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:10.720]  born after 1995 so we're going to play that video in the next segment because it is very
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:16.560]  hopeful indeed but i want to talk about this in this segment headline out of sputnik
[3:21:17.680 --> 3:21:24.400]  norwegian danish female hikers reportedly meet violent death in morocco a criminal investigation
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:30.000]  has been launched after the bodies of two backpackers in their 20s were found with violent injuries
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:37.120]  reportedly caused by a sharp object now i read another report about this out of morocco news
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:44.640]  and it said that they were beheaded other reports say that they had their throat slit but obviously
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:50.080]  a violent murderous attack two women in norwegian and a dain have been found dead in the mountainous
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:57.680]  area in morocco the norwegian national broadcaster nrk reported the women were both in their 20s
[3:21:57.680 --> 3:22:05.440]  and were on a backpacking trip in the north african country now of course morocco is noted for
[3:22:05.440 --> 3:22:11.760]  being very misogynistic very hateful towards women many of the migrant rapists who have come into
[3:22:11.760 --> 3:22:16.880]  europe over the past few years including many who were involved in the mass molestation of women
[3:22:16.880 --> 3:22:24.000]  in cologne on new year's eve 2015 were moroccan and this goes back to something i've talked about
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  several times before which is both moral and cultural relativism remember the story from a few
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:39.200]  months ago about that couple he had a left-wing couple who bicycled around the world to prove
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:44.880]  that the world wasn't evil in fact there was a headline murdered by isis around the world
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:51.760]  cyclist couple who wrote of kind lovely people in travel blog that the london evening standard
[3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:59.920]  so basically this left-wing couple 29 years old vegan vegetarian gave up their job to travel the
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:07.120]  world by bike to prove that everybody was lovely and kind and forgiving in fact i'm going to read
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:13.200]  the quote from the guy of this couple who went on this bicycle trip around the world
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:18.960]  this is what he said in his own blog which i read at length and i'll get into that in a second he
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:23.760]  said you read the papers and you'll let to believe that the world is a big scary place people the
[3:23:23.760 --> 3:23:29.360]  narrative goes are not to be trusted people are bad people are evil i don't buy it evil is a make
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:33.680]  believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and
[3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:39.360]  beliefs and perspectives different than our own by and large humans are kind self-interested
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:45.680]  sometimes myopic but kind generous and wonderful no greater revelation has come from our journey
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:54.880]  than this that couple ended up being slaughtered by isis terrorists which is absolutely tragic
[3:23:54.880 --> 3:24:01.760]  but it's not as if it was a one-off thing okay so they made this trip on the basis that our
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:07.920]  view of evil in the west is just based on us misunderstanding other cultures and that really
[3:24:07.920 --> 3:24:14.960]  the vast majority of people are kind and evil doesn't really exist it's just a western misconception
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:20.560]  of other cultures but if you read their blog before they died which i did they did they did
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:28.560]  about 40 blog posts i read about 10 of them if not less and in every single one they're mistreated
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:34.800]  by the people in these different north african and middle eastern countries including morocco
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:40.560]  where this other couple this female mounting couple was just killed and beheaded potentially
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:45.120]  so you read their blog and in every single instance they're getting harassed they're getting
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:51.120]  stalked in morocco they talk about being stalked by a weird guy trying to sell them drugs they talk
[3:24:51.120 --> 3:24:56.880]  about a guy accusing them of being racist because they refuse to buy something off of him they talk
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:02.560]  about one instance in morocco where a guy literally tried to run them over with his car when they
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:09.760]  were on their bikes so in almost every blog in every country they go to another case where they
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:15.040]  refuse to take a photograph with somebody and the person tried to physically assault them
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:21.200]  in almost every country they talk about being mistreated being harassed being stalked in some
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:27.680]  cases run over attempted run over or violently attacked by people in all these different countries
[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:34.080]  having said oh no evil doesn't exist everybody's kind and wonderful and lovely they end up being
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:43.920]  killed by isis terrorists who then made an isis propaganda tape again goes to the point evil
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:50.000]  exists the world is not a utopia no matter how much you want it to be it does not fit into your
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:56.880]  left-wing idealist version of moral relativism what relativism of cultural relativism where
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:04.720]  all cultures are equal and we just misunderstand them no all cultures are not equal all countries
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:10.320]  are not as safe as each other there are some bad people in all countries i'm not saying there isn't
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:17.360]  but if you go to places like morocco like tejikistan you go into these wild mountainous areas chances
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:22.160]  are you're going to run into trouble and just believing that the world is good and evil doesn't
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:28.080]  exist is not going to get you out of that situation now does that mean that you should just never go
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:32.880]  anyway you should never travel the world never do anything no but go in there with discernment
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:37.440]  don't go in there thinking that you're never going to be attacked that everybody's going
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:43.200]  to be lovely and cuddly and fine no that's not how the world works in fact there was another
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:51.040]  example of this headline new york times performance artist killed on peace trip is mourned this was
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:56.240]  a performance artist an italian who hitched height from the Balkans through the middle east
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:02.880]  to send a message of peace and marriage between different peoples and nations 33 year old woman
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:09.760]  pipper backer again went on a trip to prove that the world is peaceful sending a message of peace
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:16.720]  islam is a religion of peace what happened she was raped and strangled to death you see it over
[3:27:16.720 --> 3:27:23.520]  and over again this is the tyranny of cultural relativism so you have to have discernment you
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:30.320]  have to understand that evil exists and no it's not just us bigoted myopic westerners
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:36.080]  misunderstanding other cultures are made the point many times some cultures are better than others
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:41.040]  some countries are better than others you have to prepare if you're going to these countries
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:47.680]  especially if you go into these outer wild regions where people are literally trying to run you over
[3:27:47.680 --> 3:27:53.840]  where they're literally stalking you where they're calling you racist as they harass you but then
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:59.360]  you go back to your blog which is quoted by the new york times in the case of this couple unfortunately
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:06.800]  killed by isis and they say no the world the the the notion that the world's an evil place the
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:12.960]  evil exists in the world is just a complete misconception that we've invented to deal with
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:19.520]  it psychologically and in every single case the people who believe that in these prominent cases
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  at least that get in the news end up being raped and killed and it's absolutely tragic but it goes
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:32.080]  to the heart of this ridiculous utopianism that leftists have embraced which is flies in the face
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:37.040]  of the reality of the world and the evil exists in the world and it looks like it might have unfortunately
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:44.160]  happened again with the deaths and potential beheadings of this norwegian and danish hiker
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:50.960]  in barocco absolutely tragic but not unexpected we'll be back this is the alex jonesha live

[3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:20.160]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[3:32:20.160 --> 3:32:26.240]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now due to
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:31.200]  the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:37.120]  crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining

[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:30.800]  enough but something else is going on in 2018 tiktok garnered more downloads than youtube facebook
[3:33:30.800 --> 3:33:36.800]  or instagram and as even its most ardent haters admit it has gained a foothold in the psyche
[3:33:36.800 --> 3:33:42.320]  of tomorrow's young adults what is tiktok it's basically a platform for users to create 15
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:48.160]  second videos which normally take the format of dancing lip syncing comedy or memes it's also
[3:33:48.160 --> 3:33:54.320]  the latest front line in the culture war between millenials and generation z why is the media slowly
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:59.760]  beginning to churn out hit pieces against tiktok why are lefty tech bloggers like taylor lorenz
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:05.200]  becoming increasingly more condescending towards tiktok users why is twitter littered with complaints
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:10.720]  from social justice warriors that tiktok is a platform for toxic masculinity and internalized
[3:34:10.720 --> 3:34:17.520]  misogyny why are millennial moral gatekeepers becoming so nervous about tiktok because any
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:22.960]  aspect of youth culture that they don't control which allows for anything other than anodyne
[3:34:22.960 --> 3:34:30.000]  sterile predictable obedience terrifies them they're constantly trying to tear down PewDiePie for the
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:34.240]  same reason tiktok you know what we're not so different you in that they're constantly trying
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:40.080]  to tear down meme culture in general for the same reason if they can't segregate it into echo chambers
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:45.840]  if they can't censor it if they can't ban it if in many cases they can't even understand it then
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:51.840]  it represents a threat to their colonization of society as joshua citarella writes for chantrol
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:58.160]  and culture and ironic conservatism has seeped deeply into the mainstream of gen z's online
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:03.440]  experience and tiktok is merely a reflection of that tendency when i'm here to tell you that uh
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:09.920]  there's actually only one gender and um that gender is male uh women are property easily the
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:18.240]  most famous and widely replicated tiktok the hit or miss song hit or miss i guess they never miss
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:25.600]  huh you got a boyfriend i bet he does he kiss ya he gon find another girl and he won't miss ya
[3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:30.640]  he got scared then hit the dead leg with khalifa yeah that one the lyrics to the original are
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:35.200]  somewhat socially conservative because they condemn ethos and porn stars this is a perfect
[3:35:35.200 --> 3:35:39.520]  example why i really enjoyed tiktok just making fun of these thirsty for attention girls probably
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:45.600]  the second most famous and widely replicated tiktok the i'm already tracer song hit me i'll be tracer
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:51.600]  i'm already tracer yeah that one that song began its life as a kind of droopy corporate feminism
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:56.800]  respect whammin virtue signal with the female singer refusing to play a support role in the
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:36:01.840]  video game overwatch before tiktok has took it and turned it into a deliberately over the top
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:08.000]  misogynistic demand for women to shut up and get back in the kitchen i'll be bastion you're bastion
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:12.960]  you're right so winston i will leave you winston i guess i'll be genji i'm already genji then i'll be
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:19.200]  the kree i already chose the kree i have an idea what's your idea you should go back to the kitchen
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:26.800]  which is precisely the point tiktok trolling culture is a backlash to millennial outrage
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:33.760]  culture generation z is overcompensating and being more edgy and offensive than the progressive
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:49.120]  zeitgeist allows it's a kind of self-correcting cultural realignment just as in a political
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:53.680]  sense the election of trump and the global populist wave was a kind of self-correcting
[3:36:53.680 --> 3:36:59.600]  evolutionary realignment listen kids are biologically driven to rebel they're innately
[3:36:59.600 --> 3:37:05.520]  predisposed to seek out the ultimate taboos the coolest and therefore the most censored
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:09.920]  behavior and material what could be more taboo than a good make me a sandwich meme
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:29.600]  i wasn't joking when i said conservatism is the new counterculture and although gen z
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:35.200]  is the most conservative generation since world war two maybe conservatism is the wrong word the
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:40.640]  new counterculture is just the opposite of the dominant culture and what could be more dominant
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:47.200]  and domineering than a political dogma intersectional identity politics and political correctness
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:54.560]  that exists to ruin fun to censor satire and to eliminate individual identity in favor of one
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:38:01.920]  boring homogenous amorphous blob while simultaneously promoting apathetic empty lifestyles that promise
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:08.640]  hedonistic bliss but deliver nothing but vicuity hopelessness and depression and to tiktok
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:15.920]  traditionalism oh you're with her now okay i guess i'll just have to show you what you're missing
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:27.520]  the imminent mainstream backlash against tiktok is also a continuation of gamergate it's about
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:34.080]  depriving young men predominantly young white men god forbid of a space in which to express
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:40.080]  themselves and have fun but tiktok is also a space for non-white people to engage in self
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:48.880]  deprecating humor hey i'm on vacation every single day because i love my occupation which
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:53.840]  is an absolute nightmare if you're a lefty who is continually trying to balkanize and divide
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:39:01.360]  people by race day one in mexico and so far i'm pretty normal pretty natural
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:08.560]  all right day two it's pretty good so far okay my señores it's now three days in mexico
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:13.120]  toy that bitches if you want to get really pretentious you can take it a step further yeah
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:18.080]  let's do that observing genzies digital culture of the past several years has meant moving from
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:22.800]  platform to platform with them as they change their usernames and preferred networks frequently
[3:39:22.800 --> 3:39:27.200]  it's as if they don't care about building a following or about being recognized in the way
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:33.600]  platform loyal millennials do they only want to join in the interpersonal fabric of memetic activity
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:39.680]  and savor the last bit of human connection left on our cold data collecting psychographic
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:46.000]  profiling platforms making tiktok videos is linking oneself to the cultural duet chain they
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:51.280]  build narratives of collective participation their memetic actions are mostly meaningless and in that
[3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:56.800]  way mirror the meaninglessness of most actions in today's society political action has failed mass
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:02.640]  protest has failed even capitalism has failed yet somehow we continue as zombie march to the tireless
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:08.480]  drumbeat of neoliberal austerity the younger generation now mimes the zombie forms of gaming
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:14.240]  avatars in order to laugh at a world in which they themselves have no autonomy and are controlled
[3:40:14.240 --> 3:40:19.920]  by outside forces young people face a future that was set in motion years ago they will soon inherit
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:25.280]  a worse economy than any recent american generation while millennials earnestly tweet about the stress
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:31.840]  of their student loans and freelance precarity gen z tiktoks in a joyous nihilism mocking a
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:38.720]  society in which self-determination and upward mobility have long since collapsed or in other
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:44.560]  words it's a revolt against the modern world but paul you're only talking about tiktok as part of a
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:51.440]  cynical ploy to attract a new audience to your political dogma yeah and but seriously the audience
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:58.960]  is already there i'm not responsible for creating a generation captivated by edgy offensive transgressive
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  humor you did that with your safe spaces with your trigger words with your insufferable mental
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:11.280]  fragility and your relentless g had against joy every action has an equal and opposite reaction
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:18.400]  generation z is a natural evolutionary self-correcting antibody to the millennial pathogen that has
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:24.480]  infected our culture and tiktok is merely the latest vehicle for that antibody to neutralize its
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:30.480]  target which is why the vehicle for the pathogen the mainstream media will now begin to relentlessly
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:43.360]  attack tiktok hey whoa that's cool check this out guys whoa how i'm so shut wow oh my goodness thanks
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:49.440]  for showing us that funny smoke so get ready the same thing they're doing to pewdiepie they'll do
[3:41:49.440 --> 3:41:55.200]  to tiktok tiktok is a platform for hate speech bullying misogyny racism a gateway drug to the
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:42:01.040]  alright you're gonna hear it all and once again no one will care because it's all sound and fury
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:07.600]  signifying nothing the legacy media in its final death row's lashing out clamoring for relevance
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:14.480]  clamoring for control clamoring to police thought speech and humor and as ever failing
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:24.880]  that video is available on youtube right now get it get it out if there is hope then it is with
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:29.920]  generation z again their trolling culture is a response to millennial outrage culture
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:36.080]  coming up after the broke gonna talk about the uh effort to make us fire departments more diverse
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:42.720]  and inclusive by making 50 percent of firefighters women good luck with that we'll be back this is
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:54.080]  the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com don't go away in the last few months
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:59.360]  info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:03.440]  and then i came up with the idea last week let's not just extend the sale free shipping store wide
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:11.120]  50 to 75 percent off double patriot points let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with

[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:22.080]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:26.560]  everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:31.040]  they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:36.640]  goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:41.600]  sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this this is our biggest

[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:16.800]  now harvard business review reports making us fire departments more diverse and inclusive
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:25.840]  see they found there's a problem not only a most firefighters white 82 percent 96 percent of firefighters
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:32.960]  in the united states of america are men and we have to change that because it's going to be a great
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:40.720]  idea to make 50 percent of them women isn't it yes picture a typical firefighter who comes to mind
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:46.880]  if you imagined a white man god forbid that's understandable 96 percent of us career firefighters
[3:49:46.880 --> 3:49:57.040]  are men and 82 percent are white how dare white men save lives sounds pretty racist to me sounds
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:50:03.680]  pretty sexist to me the homogeneity is striking especially when you compare it to the us military
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:10.080]  which is 85 percent men and 60 percent white again we need more women on front line combat roles
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:15.120]  don't we that's also an extremely good idea because they're well suited to it local police
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:21.200]  forces are 88 percent men and 73 percent white again being a police officer stopping crime
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:26.400]  catching criminals if you're white that's bad that's racist many fire departments recognize
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:30.880]  their lack of diversity as a problem and say they're committed to increasing racial and gender
[3:50:30.880 --> 3:50:37.840]  diversity so again once they if they get it to the levels at which the demographics you know when
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:43.680]  it's in line with the demographics of the country which is what 13 black people in the united states
[3:50:43.680 --> 3:50:48.000]  is that going to be enough it's like with the whole oscars so white thing they had a year where
[3:50:48.800 --> 3:50:54.960]  in fact they had every single year black people were represented in the oscars at the exact level
[3:50:54.960 --> 3:51:01.040]  of their population in the united states at the exact demographic level so it was it was on par
[3:51:01.040 --> 3:51:07.200]  there was no discrimination but no that's not diverse enough and how dare white people save
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:13.680]  lives how dare men save lives because it's going to be a great idea to get disabled transgender
[3:51:13.680 --> 3:51:20.160]  muslims in the firefighting forces isn't it as Rita pahani notes i think you just flashed up the
[3:51:20.160 --> 3:51:26.400]  tweet there yes firefighters must be representative of every minority group in the community can't
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:32.640]  wait to be rescued by an old fact transgender woman of color in a wheelchair now this reminds
[3:51:32.640 --> 3:51:39.360]  me of another article and another controversy which came out in 2015 new york post headline
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:46.640]  woman to become a new york firefighter despite failing crucial fitness test this actually happened
[3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:53.440]  the fdny for the first time in history this is 2015 will allow someone who failed its crucial
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:52:00.640]  fitness test to join the bravest rebecca wax 33 set to graduate from the fire academy without
[3:52:00.640 --> 3:52:06.560]  passing the functional skills training test a grueling obstacle course of job related tasks
[3:52:07.120 --> 3:52:10.640]  performed in full gear with a limited air supply and insider has revealed
[3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:18.960]  so they're allowing women to join firefighters even if they failed the physical tests which
[3:52:18.960 --> 3:52:25.440]  require them which are required of them to join in the first place okay men and women are different
[3:52:25.440 --> 3:52:32.480]  they're better they excel at different jobs at different tasks and that's okay men have more
[3:52:32.480 --> 3:52:38.800]  upper body strength they're better firefighters they're more inclined to apply to become firefighters
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:46.160]  because it's a masculine job okay and that's perfectly normal that's why 96 percent of u.s
[3:52:46.160 --> 3:52:53.520]  career firefighters are men because it's a man's job you don't need to diversify it if you do that
[3:52:53.520 --> 3:53:00.640]  you will literally cost lives again people say oh but diversification diversity political
[3:53:00.640 --> 3:53:07.520]  greatness it's just about being nice just about being polite no if you try to level that and make
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:15.280]  it 50 50 or even 80 20 people will literally die because women don't have the upper body strength
[3:53:15.280 --> 3:53:21.520]  in extreme situations to rescue people and to save lives how stupid do you need to be to not
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:28.560]  recognize that absolutely incredible so they could literally have women who have failed the physical
[3:53:28.560 --> 3:53:34.000]  test and here's another point it's not just physical in fact someone messaged me on twitter about
[3:53:34.000 --> 3:53:39.360]  this when i posted it about an hour ago they said that their friend was a firefighter let me find
[3:53:39.360 --> 3:53:44.640]  the exact tweet they said a personal friend of mine told the woman they're talking about the
[3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:48.480]  grenfeld tower when people were trapped in a high tower they weren't going to get out they were they
[3:53:48.480 --> 3:53:53.200]  were done they were they were going to perish they were going to die and his firefighter friend
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:54:00.080]  a man told the woman he was coming and to relax knowing she didn't have a hope so again he makes
[3:54:00.080 --> 3:54:06.480]  the point huge emotional and physical resilience is required huge emotional resilience is required
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:12.160]  on top of the physical tests so no you should not be allowed to become a firefighter if you fail
[3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:18.560]  the physical test and just on the basic common sense of it allowing people who are less proficient
[3:54:18.560 --> 3:54:24.960]  at firefighting at rescuing people at being physically strong allowing more people to do
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:30.960]  that is going to result in more lives being lost it's just a basic fact but but again underscores
[3:54:30.960 --> 3:54:37.200]  this whole thing about diversity we have to have diversity we have to be politically correct when
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:44.320]  it's not just about being polite or being fair this literally will cost lives but you've got
[3:54:44.320 --> 3:54:51.600]  harvard business review pushing for it because fire u.s. fire departments are not inclusive enough
[3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:58.320]  absolutely absurd pablum ridiculous it has to be fought at every available opportunity
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:04.480]  meanwhile talking about political correctness kentucky radio station place baby it's cold
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:10.720]  outside on repeat amid backlash there was no backlash it was like four people on twitter get
[3:55:10.720 --> 3:55:15.520]  over it we're not afraid to play it or a kentucky radio station certainly made its opinion on the
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:24.640]  controversial why is it contra is only controversial amongst permanently offended idiots 1940 song
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:30.800]  baby it's cold outside known this weekend by playing it on repeat during a two hour marathon on sunday
[3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:36.800]  day and in fact they had a poll i think i talked about this last week where it was like 73 percent
[3:55:36.800 --> 3:55:43.280]  or something said that it wasn't offensive so you've literally got 27 percent of americans
[3:55:43.840 --> 3:55:48.800]  who cannot tolerate so mentally fragile they cannot tolerate hearing hearing this song
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:54.640]  without being triggered and thinking it's rape culture this is the and people wonder why depression
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:56:01.200]  is exploding people are so mentally fragile they cannot even cope with hearing a classic song from
[3:56:01.200 --> 3:56:10.720]  the 40s at christmas it's a christmas song jesus christ moving on to world news iraqi afghan
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:16.800]  migrants vastly overrepresented in sex attack statistics this is out of finland statistics
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:22.720]  for the first 11 months of 2018 show iraqi asylum seekers and migrants being suspected in a total
[3:56:22.720 --> 3:56:28.800]  of 157 sexual offensives making them the most numerous of any foreign group in the statistics
[3:56:28.800 --> 3:56:33.440]  despite only being the third largest minority in the country behind russians and estonians
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:39.360]  so as in every single european country migrants from the middle east are overrepresented in sex
[3:56:39.360 --> 3:56:46.240]  attacks meanwhile sweden's moderate party leader olf christensen says that it's crucial for swedish

[3:57:11.760 --> 3:57:16.560]  the number of deaths coming across the ocean as well because he hasn't incentivized those migrants
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:21.760]  coming in the first place but no that's bad that's evil to actually save half the amount of lives
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:27.760]  of migrants that's racist that's terrible he's a bad person berlin school rejects son of nationalist

[3:57:48.800 --> 3:57:53.680]  our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it
[3:57:53.680 --> 3:57:57.920]  consisted of the things that we're willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:04.000]  the rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[3:58:04.000 --> 3:58:08.960]  and individuals taking those god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand
[3:58:08.960 --> 3:58:16.240]  that because they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it
