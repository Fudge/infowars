[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  MUSIC
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  Live from theInfoWars.com Studios,
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:17.000 --> 00:32.000]  MUSIC
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  I'm going to put the call out that you call the White House
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  and tell them, look, we've seen the news stories
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  that you've wanted to blow things up,
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  that you have blown things up,
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  and that you're saying that four million of us are going to die
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  and we need martial law and the Associated Press
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  and one of your little drills you had
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  and that we're aware of who the terrorists are if you pull this.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  This can stop this Hitlerian Reichstag event.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  The idea that when you're being attacked
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  for delivering an idea or an investigating something,
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  that might be a sign that you're on the right track.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  9-11 was real.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  Planes flew into the Pentagon
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  and flew into the World Trade Center's tower one and two.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  A large project I'll hit the Pentagon
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  and two planes at the towers.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  And I studied it and made five films.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  I wrote a book about it and interviewed NSA top people
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  and CIA and firefighters and police that were there
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  and it happened.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Out of this you will see a re-engineering
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  of American society.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  I believe in the next few years
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  we'll see even larger attacks,
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  perhaps even biological, chemical or nuclear.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Biological being the worst of the three, obviously.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  When we exposed the fact that there were anomalies
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  and cover-ups at stand-down, the media said,
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  Alex Jones says nobody died of 9-11
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  and that no planes hit it.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  That was a minority of people saying holograms
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  that were put out there we later learned
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  most of them by the CIA came out
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  to discredit the whole movement.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  And later there were even articles
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  of the National Post in Canada where they admitted
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  that leftist professors have gone out and done that
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  because they thought it would damage the view of government
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  and so they thought it was the best thing to do
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000]  was cover it up.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  So what do you do when I'm pointing out, hey,
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  the head of the labor or transportation department
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  said they were in the bunker
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  and saw Dick Cheney order the stand-down,
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  told Congress that.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  During the time then the airplane coming in
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  to the Pentagon, there was a young man
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  who would come in and say to the vice president,
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  And when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out,
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  the young man also said to the vice president,
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  do the orders still stand?
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  and said, of course the orders still stand.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  So why am I talking about coronavirus in 9-11?
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  9-11 was real.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  It killed 3,000 people.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  It was a new Pearl Harbor.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  Radical Islam is real.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  They do attack people.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  They were involved.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  Piggybacked on the Islamists planning it
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  were a bunch of shadowy agencies
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  and globalist operations that ordered a stand-down
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  and put bombs in the buildings
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  and put bombs in building 7
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  that was the second largest CIA headquarters
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  in the world after Lainley, Virginia.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  And I interviewed the deputy head of emergency management
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  and a week later he was dead.
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  He said, yeah, there were bombs.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  They told us they were on the news saying
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  we're going to blow up building 7
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  and then interviewed cops that said, yeah,
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  it was over the red-cost radios.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  Get back.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  They're going to blow up building 7.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  And then the media spotted that I said cops blew it up.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  Then about six years later, the globalists don't even think,
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  BBC and all of them start releasing on 9-11
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  the archives of the full day.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  And guess what?
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  CBS, CNN, BBC, ABC, MPR.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  I made a film about it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  I have it all in there.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  It's like 30 minutes of film.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  All announced that the government's going to blow up building 7.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  Jane, what more can you tell us
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Well, only really what you already know,
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  details are very, very sketchy.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  As you can see behind me,
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  the trade center appears to be still burning.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  COVID-19.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  9-11 on steroids.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  The report goes on.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  It's posted at Bandog Video and NewsWars.com.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  And you can see them blow up building 7
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  and admit they blew it up.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Then later says it's heresitary.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Stay with us for the biggest news ever.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  The best product.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  I'm not supposed to be biased,
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  but I'm going to tell you all now.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  If you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.000]  That was a crazy week.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  I don't remember sleeping.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  But as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  I'm going to wake up today.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  You know what?
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  I don't think that happens very often.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  It's never happened to me.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  And that was me.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  I want to take control of my health.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  Drink the Turbo Force.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[05:59.000 --> 06:17.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  We're calling the incredible era that we all live in.
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  The future destiny of humanity is charted.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  The 236 days out from the historic critical election.
[06:29.000 --> 06:38.000]  And just a few weeks out from total complete absolute coronavirus hysteria setting in.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  All perfectly plotted.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  All perfectly prepared by the Chicoms and the globalist.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  A man made by a weapon rolled out that does kill people is highly communicable.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  But the push and the propaganda and the precedent set by Chicoms.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Now globalists run Italy.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  The control corporate media.
[06:58.000 --> 07:06.000]  The big tech companies is to run in abject limning like fear off the edge of a cliff.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  If you were sitting in a coffee shop on a Monday morning at 8 a.m. about to go to work.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  You saw 20 people running down the street saying, they've got guns.
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  They're killing everyone.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  Ron, get out of here.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Help.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  You would get up and you would look down the street and you'd go for shelter.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Because it's the knowledge of the crowd.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  Just like if you've got a bunch of deer out of the watering hole and one's drinking and
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  the others are looking and one sees a mountain lion about 20 yards away in the tall grass.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  That deer runs.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  The others know it wouldn't be running if there wasn't some reason.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  So it bolts.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  All our instincts are like that.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  It bolts.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  That's why crows always lie in pairs because they're all ones eating and doing something or drinking.
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  The others watching and they find larger groups always in pairs because hawks and owls kill them.
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  And so you'll see a crow fly down a drink but always sitting on a tree.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  Another one lands and then he flies down and drinks.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  The other one flies back up.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  The other flies down and drinks.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  And if you get up while you're fishing from your chair, even 50 yards away, 100 yards away,
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  200 yards away to go get another beer or whatever out of your cooler, and the other one flies
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  and goes in a circle and they have a discussion.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  That's our instincts.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  That's how we're designed.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  And so when you see people being welded into their homes and women being shot in the head of checkpoints
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  and all of this craziness and the media six weeks ago was like, this is good to weld people in their homes.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  It's good to shoot women in the head of checkpoints.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  It's good that Russia and India and all these countries have said no flights from China.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  But then we do it and the media says Trump's evil.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  America's bad and China says so.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  And the UN does and I said, oh my God, they want it to come here.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  They want to incubate. They're going to blame Trump for a lack of response.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  They're going to tell you it's not a big deal.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  It's not communicable.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  But show you the hysteria so you get scared.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  You know the media is lying to you.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  So I've always told the media, if you ever wanted to hurt a candidate, endorse them.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Well, it's the same thing.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  Come out and say it's no big deal six weeks ago, but then show the juxtaposed hysteria by the government taking place.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  People are going to get very unsettled by the mixed messages.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  And then as the deaths begin to mount, the hysteria begins to mount.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And it started about two weeks ago.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's predicted Bill Maher, CNN, MSNBC all praising the virus saying, oh, I hope it hurts the economy.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  It's a good price to pay.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  It's worth it.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  These are quotes.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Incredible statements.
[09:47.000 --> 09:55.000]  And now it's just a steady, drumby, and the left has fully embraced it and says it's going to destroy America that they've always had.
[09:55.000 --> 10:05.000]  And they've got big Reuters polls out last Friday that coronavirus beliefs split along party lines.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  Republicans believe it's not a big deal.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  Democrats believe it's the end of America because it's what they want.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  It's their ethos.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  So whether again, the virus is super deadly or not, the hype is 100% real.
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  Just like you fire a firearm off by the feet of a cow.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  And it gets a big herd of cows to get scared and they start running.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  And once a herd of cows starts running, it'll run through fences.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  It'll run across roads.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  It'll run over people.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  And they'll just run right off the edge of a cliff.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Go to YouTube.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  There's even famous black and white footage of cattle stampede, real ones, where there's just cows just flying off the edge of a cliff.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  Walrus is a stampede.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  You name it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  A blaming stampede.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  Humans stampede.
[10:55.000 --> 11:02.000]  So whether there's a danger to the cows or not, they're scared.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  A backfire off a truck makes one cow get scared.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  It hits another cow with its horn.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  That cow bolts.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  And all the cows know is, hey, a bunch of other cows are scared and are bolting.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  And they know cows know a couple hundred cows running out of dangerous.
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  So they just turn and start running with the herd because they're not leaders.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  They're a prey animal.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  Now you don't see tigers and lions and bears or killer whales getting stampeded.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  You don't see advanced species that are the top of the food chain getting spooked.
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  You can have a pride of lions and there's a hundred hyenas and there's five or six lions and they've all got their quadrant and they're taking care of what they're doing.
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  And even if a bunch of hyenas come in at one, they're going to maintain the perimeter and soldiers all line up with their asses together.
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  And they're all in sync because they're a predator.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  They're not for dinner.
[12:10.000 --> 12:24.000]  And they hold the line like the 300 at Gallipoli against the 50,000 persons because they're not getting spooked and they're not backing down and they're not running and they're going to keep fighting until they die.
[12:24.000 --> 12:35.000]  Most wars are not one because the overwhelming 460 defeated the enemy.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  It's because you panic the enemy and make them drop their weapons and run and that's what the Greeks would say.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  The Spartans would say.
[12:41.000 --> 12:51.000]  The women would say when the men were leaving, come home with your shields are on them.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  And we go back to history books.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  If the men actually ever ran, when they got back, everyone would shun them.
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  No one would talk to them.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  They would just have to commit suicide or leave.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  But nobody turned and run because that was the culture.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  You didn't do it.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  They said come home.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  They say the women say their sons, especially when they're first going off the battle at like age 15, you come home with the shields are on them.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  Which means you don't drop your weapons and you don't back down and you don't get panicked.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  And that means you get prepared.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  It means you get ready.
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  There's a big Mother Jones article out of Tacking Us saying, Jones sells supplements that he claims protect you against coronavirus.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  They've got fake quotes every day they reported this to the government trying to get us in trouble.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  And they play on people's ignorance is going, these aren't FDA approved.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  No supplement is FDA approved.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  It's in a separate category.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  They know that they play this game like Jones is selling illegal weed or something or, you know, Jones is selling bathtub meth.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  They play on this garbage.
[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  But the truth is we showed you the documents from the Pentagon and from A&M saying nano silver of this type is known to kill viruses.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  That's a fact.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  You go to the hospitals now.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  They've got all this nano silver product, the same ones we sell.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Yeah, 25 years ago, they tried to ban nano silver and colloidal silver.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  That's a precursor of it.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  It's like a Model T versus a brand new high tech car, but still the same thing.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And so they're like, they're like, oh, look, he's selling silver.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  Yeah, Walmart just ordered 3 million fricking bottles of the same stuff.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  They went to the company we made it with and said we want it and got it.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  They won't have it for months.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  We've got it right now.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  The 18 wheeler arrives tomorrow from Colorado.
[14:34.000 --> 14:49.000]  But you lose left trying to act like it's weird and it's bad to say if there's not a vaccine for this and the vaccines are deadly anyways, most of the time, then why wouldn't you take vitamin D?
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  They're like, oh, he also sells fish.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  Oh, my God.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  I mean, any more on your medical doctor will tell you that you want to take fish or whether you're a child or an old man or a woman for everything.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's incredible.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  You want high end fish.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  I mean, it's just like Jen sells fish.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  I'm going to cook.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  Oh, yeah.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  And then, you know, he sells wound cream.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  You know, he claims that, you know, it's funny though, a lot of stuff we sell is not even in this whole class is actually FDA for over the counter.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  We just probably label it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  This is the strongest silver you can get over the counter.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  This isn't even a plug.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  I was talking about this.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  The strongest silver you get over the counter, American nano tech company puts it out.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  We probably label it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  Do not ingest this.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  It kills germs for a reason.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  It's nasty stuff.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  The point is, is that it's much weaker level and good at that level in the toothpaste and the skin cream, all the rest of it.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  But the idiot leftist are so anti human and so anti everything.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  They're not just, you know, it's creating new national holidays.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  The Democrats are for abortion.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  The White Block cover that.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  They literally don't want you to know about silver that God gave us.
[15:53.000 --> 16:18.000]  These people are sick, but no one listens to them anymore.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  I'm here with Scott.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  You see him founder of OMG tax.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  Some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Guess what?
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non collectible status with the government.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less,

[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  Hannah Meneve, I'm pronouncing that right. What do you think is really going on, and thanks for calling.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't using headphones.
[19:15.000 --> 19:22.000]  And this lady starts, she says, who are you listening to? Who's that talking? I said, this is Alex Jones. And she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says,
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  really, I thought he was off the air. And I said, no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations.
[19:45.000 --> 19:53.000]  We have our own streams at infowords.com and band.video and they go, really? They said you were off the air because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[19:53.000 --> 20:20.000]  No, we have our own platform. Info wars, info wars, info wars.
[20:20.000 --> 20:27.000]  It is completely transparent. There is no longer any doubt.
[20:27.000 --> 20:37.000]  The whole globalist corporate model with the EU, the UN, the Chai comms, the leftist in the United States and North America has been in total crisis.
[20:37.000 --> 20:50.000]  They're losing every major election and the global economy was coming back under real free trade and free market reforms.
[20:50.000 --> 21:12.000]  America was leading the way. The century of not America, but of American ideals expanding, 1776 worldwide was on track for absolute success.
[21:12.000 --> 21:38.000]  I woke up at 4am this morning and I spent hours just sitting in a chair in the kitchen, drinking a cup of coffee over an hour, not answering the phone, not reading news, but really deeply dwelling, cogitating as a cogiter on the poor tens and the information we know and the tea leaves.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  And I'm going to lay it out right now.
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  It is an engineered man made by a weapon. That's confirmed. They don't want that discussed because that's their Achilles heel.
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  It's been deployed. It has a low kill rate, 2% or so with the elderly. That's super bad.
[21:57.000 --> 22:15.000]  Maybe quarter percent, half percent general public still a big deal, still want to get prepared for that. People that are talking about the worst in scenarios like Mike Adams, very reasonable. You need somebody to look at it from that perspective to then form the dialectic and figure out the sentences of what's really going on.
[22:15.000 --> 22:24.000]  As a roadmap to understand the new data as we get it to look at it from all spectrums. That's multiple, multiple dimension, third dimensional, fourth dimension thinking.
[22:24.000 --> 22:34.000]  But it's clear they released it and they're studying it ahead of a more powerful weapon to come, perhaps in the same family.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  They'll claim it's a mutation in the next six months.
[22:39.000 --> 22:49.000]  This is a priming beta test to see if we'll lock down to see how we'll behave with a half a percent or a 2% death rate.
[22:49.000 --> 23:07.000]  And then if we prostrate ourselves and freak out and limping eyes off the edge of cliffs, they're going to release a bigger bio weapon months before the election.
[23:07.000 --> 23:17.000]  That will then be replicating into hysteric levels and killing 3, 4, 5, 10% of those that get hit with it.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  But the globalist aren't going to test their whole global system with something huge up front.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  They're going to beta test it. That's the way the corporates operate.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  So they've taken baby steps with the SARS and the Ebola and all of it that they've been souping up and releasing.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  And now they give you something that does spread really fast.
[23:35.000 --> 23:46.000]  They hold back how many people are infected so that when the testing kits finally come out and you find out, oh my God, most of us have it.
[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  It creates a giant hysteria, but then the system is there to save us and tell us what it is we've got to do to protect ourselves.
[23:54.000 --> 24:01.000]  This is a domestication indoctrination program and everybody already knows that.
[24:01.000 --> 24:15.000]  But if you quantify it, that it's manmade, that it's been released, that you've had concerted big tech and authoritarian countries and others all synergistically off the same sheet of music.
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  And who are they saying is bad, even when he agrees with them at some point early on, Trump was just trying to be a team player,
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  had no idea how bad this really was, how serious their treachery is.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  And they turn around and go, oh, you said, GZ, you've picked a great job.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  You said, but now you messed up. You did bad. What's coming is your fault.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  So I'll tell President Trump, I was already saying this about three weeks ago, that I thought there'd be other strains that they, this is a cover for something bigger.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  And now I'm sure of it. And now we see them saying that. So they're priming the pump.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  They always tell you what they're going to do before they do it. And let me just tell everybody, if you're not getting shells, you're crazy.
[24:51.000 --> 25:01.000]  Everybody doesn't need the media to scare them to want to go out and get food and get guns and get ready because this is, whoa, I just got the biggest shell I've ever had.
[25:01.000 --> 25:12.000]  I mean, like when I'm on target, man, the Holy Spirit is like, yeah, boy, we're on the, over the target. Beyond the veil, the spirit world, God saying, that's it.
[25:12.000 --> 25:22.000]  That's it. That's it. This is what the globalists are doing. We know what it is. This is an attack.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  But so you need to get not hysterical. You need to get right with God.
[25:26.000 --> 25:37.000]  You need to tell everybody that it's a staged event and you need to then take action by spreading the word to others so people understand that this is an attack on our markets.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  It's an attack on our confidence. It's an attack on the fact that the whole globalist system is falling apart.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  Now I'm going to come back into the details of the coronavirus and some other things.
[25:48.000 --> 25:56.000]  But I do just want to remind all of you that anything I promote is what I really believe is the best thing that needs to be done.
[25:56.000 --> 26:10.000]  So let me just show TV viewers, since Mother Jones is demonizing us in a very deceptive, formulaic piece where they show other people that the FDA has gotten mad at who have made claims and violated FDA regulations.
[26:10.000 --> 26:20.000]  The FDA says they don't regulate supplements, but then they'll come after you if you say you need water to live or sunshines are good for you or you've got to have vitamin C to live or you've got to have oxygen.
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  If you don't have oxygen in four minutes, you die. Seriously, they say you cannot say oxygen is good. Well, you don't want to have a first man. I'm going to do it.
[26:26.000 --> 26:37.000]  But I'm not joking, by the way, because Big Pharma does not want to compete with what Mother Nature has given us and what God's given us.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  Okay, babies don't need formula. They need Mother's milk. Well, FDA doesn't want you saying that. Well, piss up a rope.
[26:43.000 --> 26:51.000]  Because they want everything to be artificial and it's political, because big corporations control the FDA and they control the left.
[26:51.000 --> 27:01.000]  But more and more, they've lost. 25 years ago, FDA said, quote, silver's bad. Silver's horrible. All the hospitals, 10 years ago, they'd all adopted it because it works.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  So I want to show listeners and viewers a couple of things that we're going to break here.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  I just want to show you the type of research I do before I even talk about stuff on there.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[27:13.000 --> 27:22.000]  That's OB. It's just got back in stock today. 40% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now, what does nitrous oxide do in the immune response?
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  Here's a major study. You'll look it up yourself. There's the study. Look it up.
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.000]  About what it does boost in the entire system. It's incredible. There's a bunch of studies.
[27:38.000 --> 27:46.000]  It's rolling immunity, all these other big scientific studies. Nitrous oxide immune system, it's just all there.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  The role of nitrous oxide, the regulation of adaptive immune responses. It's a supercharger.
[27:52.000 --> 28:00.000]  We have a super concentrated VX tract. One of the strongest you're going to find out there at infowarstore.com.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  It's not just good for your heart and vascular systems. It's good for the cells. It's back in stock. 40% off.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  This is the type of thing I'm giving my children because you can give them a lot of it.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  Or just go to the store and boil some beets. You'll get a lot of the good stuff.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  It's not concentrated like this. And this is a cold process. Boiling will make some tasteier.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  I love beets, but it's not as good for you.
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  Also, we have the whole line of nanosilver.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  Oh, look. Here's the University of A&M Confidential with Homeland Security.
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.000]  Talking about this nanosilver, and Andrew von Eckenbach, MD, Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration, Department of the Army,
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  and their findings that the American Biotech Labs takes out the SARS-Corona family of viruses.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  Of course nanosilver does. It knocks it all out. Doesn't mean it might not still get into you and take you over,
[28:51.000 --> 29:17.000]  but when it makes contact with it, boom! And it's in our toothpaste. We'll be right back.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  This Vitality CBD saves you as much as 25 to 50% over our competition,

[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  And it absorbs into your gums. It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  or anything that I've ever done in my life, so I just want to get that out of the way.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove. Nobody knew about Epstein.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg. Nobody called 9-11 before it happened. In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste, because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people.
[31:12.000 --> 31:19.000]  So here I am telling people, Super Silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  And I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste, and it's fluoride free.
[31:24.000 --> 31:30.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium, because after I brush my teeth with this,
[31:30.000 --> 31:36.000]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[31:36.000 --> 31:42.000]  It feels so good. It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[31:42.000 --> 32:07.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now, because I like the way it feels.
[32:07.000 --> 32:33.000]  There's a new way to show your support for the Infowars Crew at InfowarsStore.com.

[33:01.000 --> 33:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:31.000 --> 33:40.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, hell has frozen over.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  And I'm sure they'll make amends for it by going back to lying as they're already doing in many other areas.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  CNN came out and told the truth about me, at least partially.
[33:49.000 --> 34:02.000]  So I'm going to hit that just because it's so interesting and it's a larger perspective, a keyhole into a larger world, and then I'm going to get into the giant developments, the ultramasset developments on the coronavirus front here in just a moment.
[34:02.000 --> 34:12.000]  But first, look at this CNN headline. Infowars Alex Jones accused of DWI.
[34:12.000 --> 34:21.000]  Thousands of newspapers, every TV channel that you randomly check, because the globalists hate me, they use the CIA Mockingbird program.
[34:21.000 --> 34:30.000]  I've had former high-level CIA operatives who ran propaganda for the State Department on Pachennik saying, no, they're using Mockingbird against you, and Obama is still in control of it.
[34:30.000 --> 34:40.000]  Everyone else is saying, I was arrested for DWI. I committed to DWI. Even other CNN headlines say, Alex Jones gets DWI.
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.000]  But this one CNN headline says, Alex Jones accused of DWI.
[34:47.000 --> 34:58.000]  And I didn't know they changed the Texas policy. I guess at the state level, it's not a law that if you admit that you've drank, they take you to jail.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  So you either don't ever drink again, like a one beer, two beers at a restaurant, or just lie to them.
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  I said, yeah, about two hours ago, I had a part of a small bottle of sake, not the little tiny bottle, not the big bottle, little medium-sized bottle, my wife.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  And they found out they went and checked and everything and found out it's true. I can't believe the investigation they did.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  But I guess I am well-known. That's why they did it. What's the name of that place? I'm like, well, it's this place.
[35:25.000 --> 35:35.000]  And they get me to the jail. They test me 30 minutes later and it's below the legal limit. That means I wasn't driving while intoxicated except the state law says,
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.000]  unless you couldn't walk the tightrope, stand on one leg with it extended with your toe down for 10 seconds.
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.000]  Almost no one can do that. Everybody knows it's a fraud. I passed one of the tests, failed two of the tests.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  I did a better job with adrenaline that night than trying to do it. One of my security guys that's a registered trained former police officer, you know, in DWI's.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  He knows them from what's backwards. He can do it like a crushing war horse, you know, they can cramp and everything just perfectly.
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  But most of the police can't do it. The police officer was showing me how to do the extend the foot in front of you, point the toe down.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  He couldn't do it for three seconds. He was like, oh, my belt wasn't. He was a real embarrassed about it. I'm like, come on, dude.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  He was like a young former military guy, nice guy, but it's designed so you can't do it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:26.000]  But now I've said I'm never drinking again and I can go a year, four months as long as, you know, I've gone as a year years ago.
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  I'm just done because they're not going to have that power over me in the system because now you tell the cops.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  Yeah, I had a half bottle of sake, a small bottle a couple hours ago.
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  I later learned from people at the jail, deputies off record and others, they said, dude, you say that you're going to jail.
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  And because the lawyers and the rest of it, they don't do the breathalysers in the field anymore.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  They do it at the jail. It was all this big scientific machine had me do it over and over again.
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.000]  And she looked at him and was like, and then they took me in still because once you're already arrested, you get booked.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  And of course, it's going to get dropped. I've already talked to my lawyers on the top.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Lawyers just so happens on DWIs in Austin.
[37:05.000 --> 37:15.000]  And but but that's not the issue here. That's not the issue here. The issue is that every other channel, including CNN,
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  and they've got other false headlines say that I've been convicted or I've been indicted or that it's been proven.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  A DWI is in Texas, 0.8. I wasn't zero point. I was below that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  But even that's crazy. It used to be 30 years ago, 1.5. That's like a six pack for average person in a couple hours.
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  And yeah, you probably should be driving done that. But how do you have bars and restaurants everywhere where you ought to brunch on a Sunday?
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.000]  Yeah, I have a mimosa or two. I don't even get a buzz off that kind of relaxes you a little bit. Maybe you feel it.
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.000]  You're a big guy like me. I mean, I don't even feel it. My wife drinks it. Yeah, she might give, you know, she.
[37:57.000 --> 38:13.000]  So it's the unified propaganda of the media that every major channel, every major newspaper is Jones had a DWI.
[38:13.000 --> 38:21.000]  But CNN actually in a report on those little slideshow reports got it right and said, I'm accused of a DWI because that's what that is.
[38:21.000 --> 38:29.000]  And they keep lowering the limit. Some states I heard have gone down to 0.6 for the average weight.
[38:29.000 --> 38:40.000]  I looked this up. That's a beer and a half or a tall beer. You can't drink a beer and leave a restaurant.
[38:40.000 --> 38:51.000]  So I think it's time. I'm serious to either change these laws and raise the level or you can't sell alcohol out of a restaurant and not trying to hurt restaurants.
[38:51.000 --> 39:02.000]  I'm just saying you can't sit there and let somebody drink a half a bottle of a small wine bottle and then you can't drive.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  And now they've got all these electronic testers coming out that know if you've had marijuana.
[39:06.000 --> 39:15.000]  Everything else, folks, it needs to be reckless driving. If someone's swerving, if someone's driving erratically and that's observed, you pass laws.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  And then if they're on something, it's reckless driving while impaired.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  But the idea that you're doing nothing wrong while you're five miles over in the speed limit, Jones, and we're gonna, did you drink anything?
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  Yeah, a couple hours ago. And because I told the truth now, I went to jail.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  And they breathalyzed me. They found out I wasn't lying to them.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  Do you think I'm going to go and get behind the wheel of a car and have a high alcohol level?
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  I can't say in my lifetime I haven't done that before, but certainly not these days.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  I mean, I went again four months just last year, not drinking a damn drop.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  And I can tell you, that's the case now.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  I was already taken next week off. I'll call on the show some, but I'm going to go exercise.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  I'm going to go hiking. I'm going to spend some time with the children.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  And then, and I just, I'm going to be so free of it that I'm never going to drink again.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  Because there's obviously a big target painted on my back. You know, I don't blame this deputy.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  I'm not sure, quite sure why he did it.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  Because, I mean, I did a good job on the sobriety test.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  I mean, he just kept going and going and going.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  He'd had the pen on it for like 30 seconds.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  He'd go, oh, well, it wasn't my eye fluttering.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  I'm not going to sit there and look at your stupid pen for 30 seconds at one position.
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  I've done all day work, took care of my kids. I've been gone out and eaten.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  And then that's what happens in America.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  But the borders wide open and the illegal aliens can run people over and shoot people and commit crimes.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  And the sanctuary cities won't even arrest them and won't even give them the ice.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  But because I'm a citizen and I work hard and all the rest of it.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  I have a legal level of alcohol in my body.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  And I still have been, quote, charged.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  Now, it's going to get dismissed, obviously, but that's how they leave this discretion in of, oh, well, you didn't walk the tightrope, right?
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  But again, CNN, let's roll this a minute and a half little piece.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Part of the slide show, I'll talk over it.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  It's telling the partial truth.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  Involver's founder, conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, arrested in Texas and charged with, grab him all and talk to the kid.
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.000]  Jones 46 spoke out on a show saying he was unfairly arrested.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  And then they got a clip of where I talk about it and I show the alcohol level.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  And of course, they went and got the file.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  That's exactly what I said.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  And again, who knows how they even calibrate these machines.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  They had me blow and blow and blow innocent.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  Alex Jones arrested for DWI and was below the legal limit.
[41:45.000 --> 41:54.000]  And it goes on to say I did do that and the fact that you can also fail the sobriety test, which again is a total fraud.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  And they're going to say, even if you don't have the alcohol in your blood, if I guess if you can't walk a tightrope, you're going to jail.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  I did walk the tightrope.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  Later I learned you're supposed to not pivot around if you do the 10 steps.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  You're supposed to do the little baby steps around.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  So that's the type of games the system plays and it's up to us to change the laws.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  I'm not going to blame the cops.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  I'm not going to blame the TSA that our borders are wide open, but they're groping little kids ding dongs.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  I'm going to blame the American people for not taking our government back and changing all this.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  And I want these laws changed.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  And I want real drunk drivers prosecuted.
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  I don't want innocent people that go out to a restaurant and have two beers or whatever throw in jail.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  I'm done talking about it.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  But it's why is it?
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  Why is it such a huge?
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  It's as big as the coronavirus.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  It's everywhere.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  It's on the front of the papers because it's about demonizing me.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  So you don't listen to what I had to say.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  Oh, that's that drunk guy.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  That's that guy that's got a DWI.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  That's that guy that doesn't have his kids.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  I have my kids full time.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  But it's all lies.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  But here's the good news.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  You know, they're a pack of liars.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  And that's the good news in full wars dot com.

[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  And it's just as important to have your immune system boosted during times like this.

[43:22.000 --> 43:27.000]  your mitochondrial output inside your cells, your telomeres and so much more.

[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  This is our flagship product.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  I'm so proud of it.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  I had run out of as well.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  So I got it last week when it came back in.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  I was so excited.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  It's now available at info or store dot com.

[43:59.000 --> 44:07.000]  We warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning Corona virus told us he was a major globalist operation.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not.
[44:09.000 --> 44:18.000]  The issue is it's being used by the globalist as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  and against info wars.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  And that means against you.
[44:21.000 --> 44:30.000]  So however you're going to do it now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system.

[44:59.000 --> 45:07.000]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[45:07.000 --> 45:14.000]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, they care of their health, they care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[45:14.000 --> 45:22.000]  And I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day.
[45:22.000 --> 45:31.000]  And that power pack that they have the a m p m power pack, well, I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[45:31.000 --> 45:40.000]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world.
[45:40.000 --> 45:53.000]  One of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose for our families and for our communities.
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  Everybody needs food. I'm proud we're selling high quality food. Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble. This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[46:06.000 --> 46:16.000]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food. And I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[46:16.000 --> 46:23.000]  Right now, the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have. But they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed.
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  But understand the last food company, the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[46:29.000 --> 46:36.000]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week. And at a certain point, just saying, we're done.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  Because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks. We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  Because we're honest, under promise, over-delivered. But technically, it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you.
[46:49.000 --> 46:56.000]  So you come back again. We want relationships with you. We're not Satanists. We're the opposite. We don't screw people over. We believe in Jesus Christ.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  And we've been blessed by you. We're all in this together.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  We are Back Live Broadcasting Worldwide. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're about to hit the latest on the coronavirus.
[47:32.000 --> 47:40.000]  The coronavirus and the response to it and the coordinated globalist hysteria is huge to bring down the economy to bring down President Trump.
[47:40.000 --> 47:47.000]  They're now announcing other more deadly strains of it after they beta test how much they can scare the public that I believe they've probably already released.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  And so you should get ready. I'm going to get into this news here in a moment.
[47:51.000 --> 48:03.000]  But first, we have a whole line of products that are known and documented through ancient custom and research and studies to be really good for your body and booster immune system.
[48:03.000 --> 48:15.000]  And we have the DNA Force Plus now back in stock. It is, again, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more that cleans out the mitochondria that just does so much for your entire body.
[48:15.000 --> 48:22.000]  It's amazing. Then we have body's ultimate turmeric formula that has the highest level curcuminoid of any other brand we know.
[48:22.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's curcuminoid extract with other natural ingredients that are known to boost this amazing antioxidant that also goes after inflammation and so much more.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  The benefits of turmeric are known. This is a critical thing for adults and children.
[48:35.000 --> 48:45.000]  Then we have the super silver hyaluronic acid skin cream with vitamins and minerals that helps your skin and creates that barrier against viruses and bacteria.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  And then, of course, we also have the super silver toothpaste with the nano patented silver.
[48:50.000 --> 48:59.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and go into a long discussion about the patented nano silver, but it has been approved over the counter in the super silver wound gel that is for topical.
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  The strongest silver you're going to find over the counter. This is what hospitals use for the American nanotech company.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  We are blessed to be able to private label it. It's available at infowarstore.com.
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  And Mother Jones got it wrong. They said we're raising prices during this crisis.
[49:13.000 --> 49:21.000]  We've actually lowered the prices or kept them the same. These products are 40 to 50% off right now, even though the toothpaste is very close to selling out.
[49:21.000 --> 49:33.000]  So take advantage of that today again at infowarstore.com. Recall toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine and vaso beats that also is so good for your immune system and boost your nitrous oxide.
[49:33.000 --> 49:40.000]  Look that up and immunity. That is back in stock 40% off at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war a total 360 wins.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  So thank you all for your support. Thank you for supporting your own health and immune system during this critical time.
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  Okay, let's get into it.
[49:51.000 --> 50:00.000]  Here's what's going on. A lot of you can tell we have a lot of things happening and and I got it for whatever you see in the news against info wars.
[50:00.000 --> 50:09.000]  Believe it that there's usually 10 times or more that going on below the surface. We are under siege and I love it.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  People like why are you so excited with all the bad stuff happening here on every channel saying you are the scum of the earth.
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  These are the pedophile protectors. The whole corporate media the New York Times ABC News they covered up Jeffrey Epstein.
[50:21.000 --> 50:32.000]  They covered up all the pedophile rings they covered up your evil. I am so blessed that the trash of the planet, the criminals of all time are attacking me.
[50:32.000 --> 50:39.000]  This is amazing. And I'm glad they're lying about us because that's who they are.
[50:39.000 --> 50:47.000]  And they're the ones that are saying Trump's had a horrible response. They're the ones saying the virus is super ultra deadly and everything should be shut down.
[50:47.000 --> 50:58.000]  Whether again the virus is as bad as they say or not because this is their response to the nation state and globalism being defeated and globalism being in so much trouble.
[50:58.000 --> 51:06.000]  And if the world wakes up to that we'll shrug off the deaths of 1%, 2%. It's been released. It's manmade.
[51:06.000 --> 51:18.000]  But the globalist wanted us off air by now because they wanted you shut up because they're never going to get away. Never.
[51:18.000 --> 51:25.000]  With the fact it's manmade and major universities confirmed it and it's obviously manmade and people couldn't believe they'd release it when it was manmade.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  They thought it must be an accident. No, they just think we're all dumb and just release a manmade virus so they know what it's going to do.
[51:31.000 --> 51:40.000]  It's already been tested in the laboratory. And now CNN, all of them are celebrating to bring down the president and bring down America.
[51:40.000 --> 51:54.000]  I mean, here's another clip. There's like 10 or 15 of these clips of that. I can't even play them all. Here's a clip of the Democrats openly saying how coronavirus can help Democrats.
[51:54.000 --> 51:59.000]  They can play that and then show you the hysteria now setting in in America. Here it is.
[51:59.000 --> 52:12.000]  We've also never seen a situation like this, certainly modern times, in terms of a potential pandemic influencing the next couple of months in a way that's kind of hard to even imagine.
[52:12.000 --> 52:23.000]  I mean, obviously there's the difference on health care between Sanders and Biden. But if hospitals are overwhelmed, if the military is called in,
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  you know, triaged in school gymnasiums on respirators or whatever, however bad it may get, let's hope it doesn't.
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  Nothing makes you appreciate a functional government like a global pandemic.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  I've always said that.
[52:40.000 --> 52:57.000]  Back it up 10 seconds, please. Andrew Yang, nothing makes you appreciate a functioning government. Oh, like Communist China and like Italy. And now when Trump doesn't just want to shut everything down and join hysteria, it's his fault. Let's continue.
[52:57.000 --> 53:09.000]  I've always said that. Yeah. No, that's, that's, you're right. I mean, none of us, there's very few people who have seen what happens when a society full, you know, has the potential to really burst at the seams.
[53:09.000 --> 53:18.000]  Yeah, Joe Biden's argument has been about sort of a return to moral normalcy, but it's also going to begin to look like a return to competence.
[53:18.000 --> 53:27.000]  Because Trump and the Republicans have been running the government in sort of an anti government frame, which is not what you want when you're dealing with a health crisis.
[53:27.000 --> 53:39.000]  And we all know when Joe becomes our president, he's going to bring back many of the Obama alums who are really, really competent and technocratic.
[53:39.000 --> 53:47.000]  And that there's going to be real hunger for that in the days to come among many, many Americans if the coronavirus crisis continues to grow.
[53:47.000 --> 54:02.000]  A hunger for technocratic rule. That's direct Bilderberg. I mean, I remember 20 years ago getting secret Bilderberg documents that people gave me out of National Archives of U.S. Senators and like getting death threats from the Pentagon over it.
[54:02.000 --> 54:12.000]  But now they just, well, Bloomberg's a technocrat. He'll computers will run your life that we program. So you just heard that they're going to use it. They are using it.
[54:12.000 --> 54:21.000]  He's got a sign on his chest. He's not even wearing American flag. It says math, but that's the math he programs. That's the math he controls. And oh, Trump is bad.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  Just like a month ago, he didn't want Chinese flights coming in. He was bad then too.
[54:25.000 --> 54:33.000]  So they're gearing this up to wreck America, activate their riot squads, activate their antifa and it's all clear.
[54:33.000 --> 54:40.000]  So the debate about how deadly it is, that isn't even an issue now. The issue is it's hyped to bring down the economy and to terrorize everybody.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  And they're going to use every institution they can. The Council on Farm Relations has canceled an event on coronavirus.
[54:46.000 --> 54:54.000]  Last time I checked the dows down a thousand points today. This is the globalist flexing their muscles, making their move, and they're not even hiding it.
[54:54.000 --> 55:06.000]  They're out in the open saying this will defeat Trump. So you wonder what they do when all the other frauds, the rushing gate and the rest of it failed, you wondered what they would do.
[55:06.000 --> 55:21.000]  Well, now you know what they do. The dows down 1176 points. They would praise authoritarian states that launched the attack and then say the country that's been at war with China politically and economically is the bad guy.
[55:21.000 --> 55:30.000]  Unbelievable. That article is at info wars.com about the Council on Farm Relations. And remember, this is not a spectator sport. You don't spread the links. The dog don't hunt.
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  But I don't think this is going to work as well. We're going to get the word out. We're going to expose it. We're going to get ready for the virus.
[55:36.000 --> 55:44.000]  We're going to really get ready for the civil unrest. They're trying to trigger into the election year. You want election meddling by chai comms and the leftist and the CFR and the CIA.
[55:44.000 --> 55:52.000]  And don't worry. Once Biden's in the Obama people will be back. You know, we got presidency of Obama his third term. That's what this is.
[55:52.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's why he's a placeholder that came and talk because they'll just he'll step down to point who they want. That's it.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  Now, let's go to this next clip. This is Tennessee. Very shameful behavior by the great folks in Tennessee. But Texas act just as hysterical.
[56:07.000 --> 56:16.000]  Now, very, very sad. And this is parents were garbage bags spray students disinfected after coronavirus care. This is what hysteria looks like.
[56:16.000 --> 56:27.000]  But the borders wide open. Don't worry about that. Don't block that. That's bad. And the airplanes are still flying in. But let's just run around. You know, it's like leaving your doors open at night, but holding a gun on your kids to make sure they don't rob you.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  Here it is.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  And don't know about it. Want things out to be sick and don't know about it. Want to take that virus to their house.
[56:32.000 --> 56:42.000]  Parents with children at Treadwell Middle and elementary schools are not playing around. Many wipe their kids down and some even sprayed them with disinfectant spray as they took them home Monday.
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  And I wipe my shoes and backpack down when I got them out of school. Sure. You gave them gloves. Sure.
[56:47.000 --> 56:56.000]  Parents are doing this after they found out an employee who works at Treadwell Middle and elementary came in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus in Memphis.
[56:56.000 --> 57:08.000]  The scriptings back up 10 seconds. The scriptings all the same. The scriptings all the same. If you just come in contact. And the Republicans go along with this too. Let's continue.
[57:08.000 --> 57:20.000]  Some took more extreme measures. Two garbage bags. My shoes are coming loose. Two sacks. No sacks.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Leaders with the Shelby County Health Department say this is not necessary because it's a very low risk situation for students.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  Still, family members tell me they don't want their kids in school.
[57:31.000 --> 57:37.000]  It's messed up. The flu kid in the mall folks are daily. So let's go. We're gonna die anyway.
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  So this is the hysteria and we can laugh at it all day. It's gonna get a lot worse, folks. So get ready. But no.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  Spread the word it's manmade. Spread the word the Chai comms launched. Spread the word the left loves it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:57.000]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really?
[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, swirable foods. We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it. They got the food.
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  But I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water. That's a prey.
[58:11.000 --> 58:19.000]  That's get focused. That's not be stressed out because you're prepared and that's get DNA force plus the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans up the mitochondria and the cells
[58:19.000 --> 58:28.000]  and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in. The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything. The Ultra 12 back in stock are nano silver, super silver and super blue toothpaste.
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  It's still 50% off. Tumeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.000]  We have the strongest tumor you're going to find out there. 95% of humanoid from bodies hold the tumor forming with that back in stock.
[58:40.000 --> 58:47.000]  And purchases at m4store.com are the highest quality supplements, swirable food, and you actually get them delivered in stock at m4store.com. So get those today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  Rich in Alabama. Rich, thanks for calling.
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  Hey, Mr. Jones. Appreciate it. First thing, I love the turbo force. I drive truck for a living and it's amazing.
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[59:05.000 --> 59:18.000]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours. I don't fill the jitters like I do, drink and coffee, and it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  I'll, you know, knock out them, I'm out cold.
[59:22.000 --> 59:29.000]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10 hour energy be?
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  Is that possible? That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time released.
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.000]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[59:40.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect. And so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  All our times have come.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Here but now they're gone.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Seasons don't feel the river.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Not due to when the sun and the rain.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  We could be like they are.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Come on, baby, don't feel the river.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Baby, take my hand.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  I have a surprise guest in studio.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Gary Haven just met with the governor about an hour ago.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  And so he's got information from Greg Abbott on coronavirus.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  I wanted to make sure he got here before I did this.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  He'll be joining us.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  That's the stuff going on behind the scenes.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  But before we go to break and come back with Gary Haven here in studio.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  The coronavirus is a man made by a weapon launched by the chai comms the deep state and now the left's openly saying bring down America using it bring down Trump.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  We predicted this six weeks ago.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  It's now completely clear it's outrageous the crimes they're committing.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  The evidence shows the virus kills infirm and sick people at about 2%.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  So it's really bad if you're old or sick.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  The evidence shows, though, that we don't know how many healthy people have been contracting because they're not getting sick from it.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  And that's coming out.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  But regardless, you always need to boost your immune system.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And just as important as having durable food to firearm to protect yourself is taking natural concentrates of what's already amazing that God gave us through mother nature for your body.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Now, let me just give you a real quick example of this.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  You have a solution here.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Vaso beats is concentrated one of the strongest concentrates of beat extract out there.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Everybody knows what beats do for vascular or the heart.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  It's not debate.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Even medical doctors will tell you that.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  But here it is nitrous oxide.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  It's rolling immunity.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Look at all these big studies.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I've got a type of nitrous oxide and immunity and you'll get just hundreds of studies.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Now, just some of the natural chemical compounds that are in vaso beats breaks down in the blood and creates nitrous oxide.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  And it's just incredible for your body.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  So whatever you do, get some beats or get the concentrate vaso beats now back in stock, 40% off.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  And then it just goes on from there.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  When I talk about nano silver and now we have the top nano silver company that has over the counter confirmed stuff in major stores.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And is sold in hospitals.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  We private label it and get even better deal on it.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  They only authorized us even though they've had this for 13 years to put this out a few months ago.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Look at this right here.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Texas A&M University Health Center.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Office of Homeland Security.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  What they found with this nano silver.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  It's been approved over the counter.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  We have in our silver cream and our toothpaste.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Now the wound gel is super strong.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  You don't ingest that.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Department of the Army headquarters, what they found in their test.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And then our authorization to put this out to you.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Because that's the reality folks and the idea that all these publications and things don't want you to know that no silver is not a panacea.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  But nano silver and silver has been known for thousands of years.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  The Egyptians talked about everybody and now we know why because it goes in and just fries viruses fries bacteria.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  That doesn't mean you still can't get something and die from it.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  No drug, no supplement, no anything is perfect except oxygen and water.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  You don't have that.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  You're dead.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And I'm sure the FDL came out and say, no, you don't need oxygen.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  You don't need water.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  But being serious here, folks, these are the products we've been selling for years.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  We didn't just come up here and start selling vitamin D3 of a super high quality type saying you need it in the winter because when you don't get sun, you don't produce it.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  So you take it out of the tongue.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  That's a great product.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  My kids take it.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  I take it.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And it makes us healthier, more vibrant.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  All the studies on high quality pure iodine, just type in iodine immunity, iodine coronavirus, look it up for yourself.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  We have the highest quality iodine X2 and X3.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And contrary to what the Democrats and George Soros, you know, run media matters and all of them say, we have lowered prices during this crisis, not raised them.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  So get all your nano silver products, get your X2, get your X3.

[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I'm going to call the crew right now.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I'm going to say free shipping store wide is implemented again right now.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Stay with us.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Gary Haven is coming in high.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  infowars.com.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  I don't want to interrupt, but I'm leaving.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's and of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour calls.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  We're going to do it. So we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  So the live coverage continues. Everybody spread those links.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  The globalists are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Don't let them win. No BS.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Everything's straight shooting here.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  See, I don't have some Mackie Valley manipulative view.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  That's the real power.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Join Band-Aught Video and I will complete your training.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Together, we can overthrow the emperor and restore the republic.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  A biological attack has been launched by the Chai comms with a man-made weapon transferred to them by Obama on record five years ago.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  The media is now saying it's all Trump's fault.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  For the civil unrest, they plan to begin.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Now, Gary Haven is a billionaire, smart guy, great pilot, has a lot of courage, flies our cruise into places like Haiti right after hurricanes.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And I've been begging him to come on for the year and he wouldn't do it.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  But then we got a call about two hours ago and he said I'm about to meet with the governor.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  I know how much the governor loves you and you guys meet a lot on coronavirus.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  And I want to come in after I talk to him and give you a report on what's going on.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  So I've got to go deal with some stuff coming up.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Owen Schroyer is going to take over.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Mike Adams is coming up.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  So you're going to be here until about 15 after next hour and you've got a lot to say.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  But Gary, you're looking good. Good to see you.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  I'm going to go over your whole bio.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  Folks, you know you?
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  That's right with hands.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  That's right elbow bump.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  The corona shake.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  The corona shake.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  So you've got the floor here.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  But tell us what the governor had to say.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  You just met with him a little while ago.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Okay, you know, actually a lot of it is going to be a confidence.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  I can't reveal everything you had to say.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  But I do have a lot to say around that conversation.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  This coronavirus thing is coming.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And we have a really good picture of what America is going to look like in three weeks in Italy.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  And we have a chance to proactively take those experiences,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  whether it's from Italy or South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong,
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  and do some things proactively to get ahead of this.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  The advice I gave the governor today was that,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  and this is a quote from the governor of Washington state.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  We have a chance to look at what's coming as opposed to what we have right now.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  And we've not done a very good job of that.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  In fact, you know what?
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  I love the president.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  In fact, I was supposed to meet with him on Friday,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  and I canceled my time at Merrill Lago on Friday
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  because there was going to be a gathering of 500 people.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And I thought I was going to have a chance to talk to the president
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  about his very, very poor advice that he's been giving and getting from the CDC.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  But you don't want to watch him on television Friday at the CDC.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And he said that, eventually, this is going to go away.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  I realized that he wouldn't listen to me in a three-minute elevator speech.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  So what can we do?
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  What can we learn from our experiences with what's going on out there in the world?
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Well, first of all, we have to come to terms with reality.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  This is coming.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  It is not stoppable.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  An epidemiologist from Harvard came out last week, and he said,
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  look, because of this being contagious asymptometrically,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  40% to 70% of Americans are going to get this thing.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  Now, the good news is that 85% of the cases are mild.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  The problem is 15% of half the American population having complications
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  and even deaths from this thing are very, very serious.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  And we have a chance right now to do something to prevent deaths
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  and the disaster that's going to happen to our healthcare system.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  By the way, I have a little background.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  You don't have a degree in health and nutrition.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  I've written two New York Times bestsellers.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  I'm working with Baylor College of Medicine,
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  a new breakthrough on immunotherapy for cancer.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  So I've been spending a lot of time with PhDs in microbiology.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  One of my best friends is in charge of employee health at the Cleveland Clinic organization.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  His job as a physician is to oversee the healthcare of 65,000 employees.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  I was in a meeting with him a week and a half ago and then on my phone with him Saturday.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  We have three vulnerable populations.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  We have the elderly.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Death rate for people that are 80 or older is 15%.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  70 to 80 is 7.5%.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  60 to 70 is about 4%.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  People with preconditions, heart disease, COPD, these sorts of things
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  are the second vulnerable population.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  And the third vulnerable population are our first responders in the medical community.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  We're getting advice from the CDC that this N95 mask should be worn by all the physicians,
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  and by the way, not by people, but by the physicians.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And that mask has a filtration system of only four microns,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  where the virus is one micron.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  So the CDC is actually giving terrible advice to the medical community.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  And Harry, that's because they're setting the president up.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And we said this six weeks ago.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And now we see it.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  CNN's like cheering, oh, we're going to destroy America.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  It's all going to go to hell.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Trump's mismanagement will drive him from office.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  The talking point's there.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  And I think Trump's finally figuring that out, but it's so obvious.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Man-made virus from China.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Everybody praises China.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Everybody attacks America.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  He needs to get on the offense and stop kissing Xi Jinping's ass.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  No, I don't disagree with that, Alex.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  You know where I disagree with you is this is a real event that's coming.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  You made a statement yesterday that 10,000 people might die from it.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Yes, they're setting the president up for failure.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  In fact, I spent a half hour on a phone with the co-chairman of the Republican National Committee yesterday,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  pleading with him to get the president to reel us what's really happening.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  And I told, I told, this is the vice, the co-chair of the Republican Party.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  And I said, if you can't get to the president and immediately get him to come to terms with the reality,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  the presidency is lost.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And of course, worse than that, 10s of thousands of Americans.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I only throw out devils advocates.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  And I always do wide spectrum analysis.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  I say it could be not a problem.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  It could be a problem.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And then everybody like always gets mad at me.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  That's what I do.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  I try to look at every scenario.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Obviously, this is the perfect storm.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  This is the weapon that has taken out Trump.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  We saw that.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  They're saying it.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  They're salivating.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  He has to now overreact to cut them off at the pass.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And I think that's the case.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  I just, with the listeners, I can only tell them, I've looked at the numbers.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  If people show up in Italy and 5% die, that's already the super sick.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  I don't think it's 5%.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  1% is huge.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  I agree.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  The virus is deadly.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  I'm saying it's the globalist attack.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  We need to make that the main news item.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  You're going to have the floor here.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  My own chore is going to take over.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  I've got all these assaults going on.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I've got to take care of it.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  I really appreciate the crew and all the audience for the great job.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  But listeners, please understand, it is critical.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It is mission number one, that however you can, via word of mouth, Twitter, Facebook,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  email, text message, that we're on air giving real analysis months ahead of what's happening.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  We've proven that.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And we're still not sure at the end of what's happening, but this is the big one.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  The ICOMS are salivating.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  The globalists are salivating.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  They are saying, we just played the clip last hour, this will bring down Trump.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  So the president absolutely has to get ahead of this now judiciously.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  And the stock market is down 1300 points right now.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  Every day it's dropping 1000 points.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  This is the attack.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  This is their weapon.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Everything else failed.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And all the globalists like Merkel and the rest of them are hyping as much as possible.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  So Gary Haven, I totally agree with you.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And I was just hearing you meet with the governor and you want to come in.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  You'll never come on the show.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  So I knew you had some big stuff.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  They didn't tell me don't say or meet with the governor.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Was that a secret?
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Um, no, no, really.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Okay.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Well, I told him, is that secret?
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  No, he's coming on with the governor.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  So I wanted to hear that stuff.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  I don't think with Abbott personally.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  So Abbott think this is a big deal, right?
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Yes.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Okay.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  So you're going to take over with Owen Troyer on the other side.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  I'm going to go deal with all the assaults they've got going on right now.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  But I really appreciate you coming in.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Good to see you, man.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  That's right.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  We don't shake hands anymore.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I went to, uh, I went to CPAC and now that they're talking about quarantine the president.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  That's crazy.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  You feeling okay?
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  I'm feeling damn good.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Are you kidding?
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  The worst stuff gets the better.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  I feel like a pig.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  And you know what?
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  All right.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Great job.

[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  I was Troyer taking over.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And if you want to alarmist views, you got Mike Adams hosting coming up for an hour and
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  45 minutes.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  He comes in the 15 minutes of the next hour.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And I think Mike's a good guy.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  I respect Mike.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  You want Mike Adams?
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  You got it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.760]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:03.760]  by you.

[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  I mean, it's just what we're meant to do.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  It feels good when we do it.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  But we do sell high-quality swarble food.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  I said, I think this is going to be really big.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  I'm not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food,
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  even though the prices are going up for you.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  So those are the type of discussions we have.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  Now, I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  This is 100 times regular volume plus.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  It was 100 times a few days ago.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Now, it's about 200 times.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  OK, at infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  I mean, this is just insane.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  But that's how big this is.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  That's good.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there,
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  that you only go to in emergencies.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  And things like DNA Force Plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells,
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.

[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Gary Haven is in studio and I'm telling you,
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  the reason why I love Gary is because he cares about people.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  So in the break, he's like, oh, and I gotta tell people about what they can do right now with this coronavirus outbreak.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  So he's chomping at the bit to get that out.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  But before we do that, Alex just took off and he's telling me, he's like,
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  hey, we got the vaso beats back in stock.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Make sure you tell everybody about nitric oxide, its role in immunity.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And I'm just kind of sitting here like, wow, you know, look at all this documentation we have on vaso beats
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  or at least the elements inside of it, the nitric oxide and other things and its role in immunity.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  I'm thinking, I don't even need this. I found out about this years ago.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  I found out about the nitric oxide. I found out about the power of beats.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  It's become a major top selling supplement for almost five years now.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And so there's no doubt to me, I don't need these documents here
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  telling me how important nitric oxide is to your immune system and to your basic functions of your body.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  It's good for your heart. It's good for your blood vessels.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  As somebody that eats a lot of red meat, probably something I need.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And so there's all different ways that you can look at the benefits of nitric oxide, which is one of the main elements inside of vaso beats complete at infowarstore.com.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  40% off. Back in stock, 40% off. I take it every day.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  I've been taking other soup beat supplements and then we released vaso beat complete and it's by far the best, the easiest to ingest, tastes the best,
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  totally pure. You're going to love it. You will see the benefits. Good for your heart health.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  But don't take my word for it. You can go read all the documents for yourself.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  It's at infowarstore.com. Vaso beat complete.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Now, Gary, we're talking about supplements.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  You know, I was thinking about this because I take probably like, I don't know, 20 pills a day.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  And that's just a supplement I feel like I need to help me be at peak operating, you know, abilities.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  You look at somebody like Ray Kurzweil, who wants to live forever, wants to bring his dad back from the dead.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  This is a guy who worked at Google, may still in the AI department.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  I think the last time I saw he takes like 90 pills a day.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  So these are the guys who want to live forever and they're taking 90 supplements a day because it's like the secret science almost.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  It's like it's so obvious and with our diets that are so malnourished and everything.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  But you're talking about specifically dealing with coronavirus or disease outbreak like this,
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  what people can do, what they need to have in their shelves,
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  and what they need to start taking as part of a supplement routine or a diet
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  to make sure they can be as healthy and strong in the immune system as possible.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  That's right. You know, I have a degree in nutrition.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  I've written two New York Times bestsellers on women's health.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  There's a supplementation regimen that you can take that's antiviral.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  It's also anti-inflammatory.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  So you guys may want to get a pencil and write this down.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  It's simply four things and they can all be purchased here at Infowars.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  The first thing is we need to be on a dose of vitamin C of at least 4,000 milligrams a day.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  You want to split that up because it's a water-soluble vitamin.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Number two, we need to be on 4,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Number three, we need to be on about 400 milligrams of magnesium.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  And then the final one is about 50 milligrams of zinc.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Those four supplements, if you get your body saturated with them,
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  is a protective barrier against viral infection.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  And if you do get any kind of infection, it's a protective barrier against inflammation.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  So that'd be my recommendation to the listeners.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  You know, what can you do yourself to prepare your body to be antiviral?
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  And I believe it is to be very effective.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  I and all of my family members, and there's as many people as I can tell,
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  you know, in my meeting with the governor today,
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  I meant to bring him a supply of it.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  But I did remember to bring you guys cigars.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Well, so you prioritized what you're saying.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  The cigars made it, the supplement routine did it.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Well, we do have our priorities, right?
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Let me get this straight, though, because I did take notes.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  4,000 milligrams a day of vitamin C.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Yes.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  4,000 IUs of vitamin D3 a day.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Yes.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Which can also come from the sun, correct?
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Yeah, but we just don't get enough sun.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  Especially coming out of the winter.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  We're in winter right now.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Yeah, by the way, that's one of the reasons the flu season happens,
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  because we don't have enough vitamin D in our body,
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  because we lack sunlight, but go ahead.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  4,000 milligrams a day magnesium.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  No, 400.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  400.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  See, this is why, folks, you take notes and then you go back and check, okay?
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  And then 50 milligrams a day of zinc.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Correct.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Now, I double check for brevity here,
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  but I'm pretty sure just from the supplements that I take from InfoRestore alone,
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  which probably makes up about 70% of the supplements I take,
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  I would guess I'm getting all these a day.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Probably more.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  In fact, the only one that I would...
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  I think I go outside of InfoRestore supplements is magnesium.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I know I'm getting at least 400 milligrams a day.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  It's good for recovering after workouts so I don't get cramps and stuff.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  That's another thing people don't know.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  But you know, Gary, people don't realize how lacking they are in basic vitamins and minerals
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  that are just saturated from the diet, the new industrial farming,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  everything they do with pesticides, all the preservatives.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  So you may be eating three meals a day,
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  but you might not be getting all the vitamins and minerals,
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  so you're getting sick, you don't know what's going on.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  This is commonplace in society.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Nobody talks about it.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Yet, you know, I'm a farmer and rancher,
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  and we put three nutrients back into the soils called MPK fertilization,
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  The soil has long ago been depleted from trace minerals and even major minerals,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  so it ain't there.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  So you're going to suffer the consequences of not having any of your diet,
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  or you can supplement.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Supplement is pretty easy.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  So I would suggest that you guys put together an in-menu pack with these four nutrients in it
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  so that people know exactly what to order when they call it.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Let's do it right now live, because I bet I could guess where they can get all these things.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  I would guess we have 4,000 milligrams.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Guys, pull up vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  We'll see if we can do this in 60 seconds.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  We're testing the crew right now.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  The crew is on, you know, we're on the ship in the ocean.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  The hurricane winds are coming in.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  The tide is strong.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  All right, there's vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Let's see if you're getting 4,000 milligrams a day from this, guys.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  You should be able to scroll down.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  We have the, yes, there it is.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  We have all the facts about this.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  I would actually just go, guys, go up to the, oh, there is zinc in there, too, and magnesium.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Guys, go up to, no, keep going up.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Go to the picture of the, there we go.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Here we go.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  Let's see if we can zoom in on this.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Vitamin C, you're getting a thousand there.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  So you need a little bit more.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  You can get a little bit more in your diet.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  How many servings a day do you take of this?
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  One.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Okay.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  This is one serving.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Thousand IU vitamin D.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  So you're at least, you're at least chipping away magnesium.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  Where's magnesium on there?
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  I know it's in there somewhere.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Magnesium is the top right.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  25 milligrams.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  Okay.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  So you're, so you're, you're chipping away and then zinc is in there too.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Five milligrams.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  So it's just a good way to start your day.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  This is just one supplement, by the way.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  The powder that I start my day with every day.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  So you're getting a good start with vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  So we'll, I bet we can complete this list.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  I mean, we have the winner son vitamin D. I know that.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  All right, we're going to break.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Gary Haven on the other side.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  I can help you too.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  You actually get them delivered in stock at infowarstore.com, so get those today.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  Now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  They're all at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  High-quality, storeable food when nobody else has got it.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Super powerful formulas like DNA Force Plus, X2, X3, Body's Ultimate Turmeric formula,
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  and our nano silver line of products, a bunch of which has been sold out,
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  So check it all out at infowarstore.com and get prepared.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Really, I thought he was off the air.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And I said, no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowarstore.com and just said she's still on.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go,
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  oh, Alex, I used to love you. I wish you were still on air.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  We have our own streams at infowarstore.com and band on video and they go,
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  really, they said you were off the air because they took the platforming as off the air.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  No, we have our own platform info wars, info wars, info wars.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  Owen Schreuer, Gary Haven with you.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  And we're talking about how you can prepare yourself for any virus.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  But with the coronavirus outbreak, obviously this is one way to build your immune system.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  We covered that last segment, but we're having very serious discussions now about the coronavirus,
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  where it comes from, what it is, what its purpose was.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  And I'll just kind of lay out my basic where I'm at right now, Gary.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  And then we can get into everything we were talking about.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And I was saying this in the break is I think we need to be focused more because I'm not as necessarily as worried about the viral outbreak as maybe you or others for reasons that you'll get into here that I agree with.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  I'm more worried about figuring out how it started and why because it's right.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  This thing comes out of nowhere. We have the Indian doctor examine it says, oh, look, this has been designed.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  It's been spliced with HIV and other things.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Then we have all the cover up coming out of China.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  We have all the cover up on social media of that exact story.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And so that always raises red flags to me has me asking questions.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  We're not focusing on that.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  Now we're looking at, hey, do we need to be freaked out about this?
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  How should we be stopping this, which is all fair and good.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  But if we don't really get down to the bottom of it, how can we properly, you know, analyze or project how we need to prepare what we need to prepare for.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  So you were getting into the what you think is going on, which I won't agree or disagree.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  I'm kind of still like open minded like anything can happen.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  But I think we both agree this was a bio weapon.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  Yes.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  You're leaning more towards this was something aimed at the Chinese people.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Yes, with Americans as collateral damage.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  And where do you think this originated or what do you think spurred this to happen?
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  Well, we know that China is a threat to American hegemony.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And, you know, the popular idea is that this virus escaped from a level four bio weapons lab in Wuhan.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  But I believe it's something I hate to admit this.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  I believe it's something much more nefarious.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  I think the deep status, the powers that be in our country.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  And I think I know how they did it.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  A lot of people have been reading this, even though it's not very common yet.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  The the world military exercises were held in Wuhan in October, 14 days after they left.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And by the way, there were 300 American soldiers participating two weeks after they left,
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  which happens to be the average incubation period.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  This virus turned up in Wuhan.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  You know, and we know that it's a weaponized virus because we see the RNA strands that were put into this virus from HIV,
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  from MERS, and from the SARS virus.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  There's no way this could have happened in nature.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  So somebody built it.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  There's no question about that.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  The question is, who did and who unleashed this on the world?
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  I'm afraid the powers that be in this country who want to destroy Trump's presidency,
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  they want to eliminate China's threat to our hegemony.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And by the way, there's a byproduct of this, which is a depopulation effort.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  You know, we're going to end up, you know, providing some solution to our to our Social Security elderly problem.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And this sounds terrible, but this collateral damage to the American people,
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I believe, was a desirable byproduct for the people that are in power.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  And so the question is, for all of us, I think once we embrace that it's a bio weapon and not for nature,
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  which by the way is contradicting what the CDC is telling us.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Well, it's just tough for people to accept that.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  I mean, let's be honest, most people are living in La La Land.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  They're trying to figure out what Tom Brady is going to have for breakfast or where he's going to, you know, throw a football.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  So when you talk about bio weapon, you know, they can barely even comprehend it.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  They just immediately throw you out as some conspiracy.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  No, this is very real stuff.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  You know, and I have nothing to gain by being here and putting putting myself out there.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  You know, I've got a pretty good life, right?
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  But I think truth is a powerful thing.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  We certainly aren't getting it from the mainstream media and we aren't getting it from alternative media except for you guys and a few other sources.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  And what is getting out there is being censored, which by the way is an indicator that we may be pretty close to the truth.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  So we got to embrace the idea that we know this, the laboratory in India who ended up being censored, you know, they did the RNA analysis of this thing.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  It's a bio weapon.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  You can't get around that.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  And it's important to acknowledge that because it's very, very difficult to develop a vaccine for a bio weapon.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  So we got to come to terms with the reality whether we're comfortable with it or not.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  And then what do you do with the information?
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Well, I'm trying to get to Trump to make him aware that this is not a non-event.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  This is a very nefarious act against him.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  He's following the lead of the CDC.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  You know, yesterday the president said, I'm a fan of his, right?
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  I was supposed to see him on Friday night.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  He said that this will go away.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  That's a quote because he believes that the CDC is what they're telling him, which is that very few people are going to get this.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  85% have very mild symptoms.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  And by the way, the reason none of the president believes him is he is still out shaking hands and putting himself in a public situation and exposing himself to this.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  And by the way, what is the role of the lady that was Rosenstein's sister at the CDC?
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Well, I'm sure it's just one that we were able to identify easily because there was a relation there.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Yeah.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  Well, the crew can find it, but go look how Trump is going along with what the CDC is saying.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  And again, that's why I'm sitting here just kind of like, I don't want to, it's not even a hedging my bet.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  I'm just not even ready to throw chips in the pot here because as we already know, this virus, it infects Asian people or people with a certain DNA, you know, more than, didn't say white people or other people that would live in America.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  So there's that aspect to it, which again is kind of like, well, maybe I don't want to panic either because if this is specifically designed to go after DNA that's common in China and every person, then that's like a major indicator
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  of what we're dealing with.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Yeah, let me explain that to the audience.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  So, you know, we know that Harvard got into a lot of trouble with the Chinese government because they were over there sampling the DNA of thousands of Chinese people.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  The receptor site and human body is primarily in the lungs.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  The receptor site, where this virus connects and infects people, with Asians has a 4.0 level in their body, the H2 receptor sites.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  There we go.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  With European people like us, it's 0.47 and with Africans, it's 0.40.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  There's a very mild outbreak in Africa and I believe it's partly because this virus was designed to kill primarily Asian people.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  Now, the problem is, it's going to kill a lot of Europeans and non-Asian people because it's still lethal.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  But that's one more evidence that it was designed as a bio weapon to attack China.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  And you know, now I'm thinking about something that I thought I'd remember because it's breaking out in Italy.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  And if I remember correctly, actually, this could be something else that I'm remembering in my mind, but I think there's similar DNA with Italians and Asians.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  Like there's some connection there in the genealogy history.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Am I sure about that?
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Let's talk about Italy for a moment.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Italy is...
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  Maybe I'll just think about Italians invading a different country.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  I think that's what I'm thinking of now.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Well, Italy is America in three weeks.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  And in my meeting with the governor, I shared this with him.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  We can look at Italy today and that's our future in three weeks.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  And yesterday, the infected rate in Italy was 10,100 some odd cases.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And the death rate was 463.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  That's a 5% death rate.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  The hospital system in Italy is absolutely overrun.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  There is rapidly as they can converting regular hospital rooms into ICU.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Hold that thought because we got to go to a break and let's just close off with this segment because based on the knowledge that we've talked about here today,
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  if the outbreak in China on the time scale with what we've seen it go like this and then we've seen it in Italy go like this, you're saying America is basically the two weeks, three weeks away from what happened in China,
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  then what happened in Italy is going to be here.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  All right, we'll be right back with Gary Haven.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  Yeah, just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  I love women.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  I'm a girlfriend.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  You may have problems with her.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  You may get a divorce.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  You may whatever.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful when I left.

[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  spiritual operations against the globalist.

[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  Men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  That's the thought police.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  This is tyranny.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Resist it, speak out against it.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post human world.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  The giant clowered and pivot program.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  So spread the word about band.video and infullwars.com forward slash show. That is so important.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  You are at the center of the resistance. You are our only hope.

[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  And now your host Owen Troyer.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  And I'll be back today hosting the war room at 3 p.m. central at band.video.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  Unfortunately, my guest slate is still booked. I don't even have time for Gary Haven.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  How can I not preempt a guest for Gary Haven? He's going to beat me up in the break guys.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  My feelings are hurt.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  We did the corona elbow when we came in for a greeting.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  But he may just, he may go, just no holds bar. He may just pummel me in the break.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  So I might not even be able to host at 3. Gary may pummel me and maybe out.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  It's always fun to talk with Gary Haven. Very serious sobering subject today though.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  And we're just talking in the break and it just goes down perfectly with the questions I wanted to ask you.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  I wanted to get into what do we do next when it comes to this?
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Because this is something I think anybody who's seriously thinking about this is considering.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Lockdowns, travel restrictions, self-quarantines. These are things we're already seeing worldwide and not happening in America.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  So I want to get your thoughts what you think about a lockdown, which I kind of already know.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  So I'm going to kind of give you a couple other leaning questions.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  What you think we need to do with travel.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  And basically what we were saying is, or what you were saying is you think we need to do what Italy is doing now.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  But now, before it reaches that point, so you can get into that.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  But my question is, because I think that this is really where I think the discussion needs to be had.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  How do you do that? How do you do that to the American people?
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  How do you successfully pull that off without causing panic?
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  How do you do that without having it labeled martial law, saying Trump brought in martial law?
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  And do you have any fears that this could lead to some new kind of like 9-11 change the world?
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  Some new internet era where people are so afraid to even leave their front doors.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  You don't even have human-to-human contact anymore. You stay inside. You're connecting on the internet.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  The real world is basically done because of this coronavirus outbreak causing so much fear and panic.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  Gary Haven, try to just address all that.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Okay. That was a nice, easy question, Owen.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  I know. You should be able to just think freely and note, you know.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  Okay, good. I appreciate that.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  You know what we know from the experiences in Italy or South Korea is that there's two things that have reduced both the death rate and the contagion rate of the coronavirus.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Number one is testing. As I was talking to the governor today, I said we have got to start testing not hundreds of people, but thousands of people immediately.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  The CDC controlled all testing until late last week.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  And as a result, we had only tested 1,753 people through Sunday in all of America, which is nuts.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  In Korea, South Korea, they're testing thousands and thousands a day, even through drive-through.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  So if we don't know who's got it, we can't separate them from the people that are prone to be infected.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  Then the second thing that we've got to do is quarantine.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  You know, I quoted the governor of Washington a minute ago, and he said, look, we've got to be looking at what's coming, not where we're at today.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Quarantining can be done. In fact, I'll tell you what I told the governor.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  I said, look, on Monday, you need to ask people voluntarily to stop gathering.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Church services shouldn't be going on. The Houston rodeo shouldn't be on. You guys canceled the South by Southwest.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  None of this should be happening right now. Nobody should be getting together in groups of people in close quarters.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  I said he should recommend the schools to close.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  The University of Texas is closed today. That's a great start.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  But a leader needs to be standing in front of the population making these recommendations.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  They shouldn't be coming up with them on their own as good ideas.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  And by the way, I told the governor that make it voluntary now that people are taking these precautions to get them ready for what you're going to have to do in about three weeks,
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  make it mandatory.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  I hate to cut you off. It's just I have to because this is the issue that we run into philosophically and even just physically.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  How do you do that without causing a panic? How do you do that without having the backdrop of saying, look, this is why we have to do this?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  This was a bio weapon, folks. This is a serious deal. We don't know what's going on. We got to get to the bottom of it.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  This is going to cause panic. It's going to lead to martial law. How do you, I mean, how do you weigh?
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  How do you weigh? Which is the right move to make?
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  Yeah, you know, I actually had that discussion with the governor is, you know, he's trying to find the right spot.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  First of all, the way the federal government is doing it right now is wrong. And I'll tell you why.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  They believe that information and panic is one point on a spectrum. And it's not.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  You can begin to give people information so they can make informed decisions before you get to the point on the spectrum where there's a where they panic.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  And we're not, we're not on that point. In fact, the CDC is actually lying by omission.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  You know, they were telling people, you know, last week when we had 10 infections or 12 or 50 or 62, and then it got to 323.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  When they make that announcement, they fail to give the disclaimer. The disclaimer is, oh, but we haven't tested anybody.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  You know, they tested 1500 people by Sunday.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  Without giving you that disclaimer, they are lying by omission. That is a terrible way to approach this.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  And it's going to kill a lot of people. So my point is, let's get on that spectrum somewhere between information and panic.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  And not a lot of the people nor not tell them things because we're afraid of panic.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  What do you think? Let's make this personal, not to make it about me because other people are facing the same thing.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  Should I get on a plane this weekend?
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  No.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  I was afraid you would say that.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Absolutely. You know, I'm an airline-rated transport pilot. The filtration system on an airplane does absolutely no good.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  And you guys got to remember, this is an airborne virus.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  And even the CDC has been holding back on that. It's airborne. I'll give you proof.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  That cruise ship that was anchored off of Yokohama, when it was quarantined, it had 10 cases.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  14 days later, there were 700 cases. And these were people that were isolated in their cabins and not allowed to leave.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  But guess what? They were all breathing the same circulated air.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  If you get on an airplane, not just with one person happens to have it and you're breathing this airborne virus,
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  even when that person gets off the plane, it has infected the filtration system.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  And everybody that gets on that plane for the rest of the day, they only clean these planes one time a day.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  But even that doesn't matter because they don't clean the filtration system.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Do not get on a commercial airliner. And don't get on a cruise ship.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Do we have access to this data yet? Do you know, Gary, do we have access?
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Have they actually said, okay, here's somebody that was on this plane. Let's test everybody on this plane.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  Okay, here's how it went down. Here's everybody who was on.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I mean, I'm kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  I'm like 50-50, but just on the side of I don't want lockdown. I still want to fly, whatever. I still want to take a vacation.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  You're on the no total lockdown.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  But even I see them docking a ship in California and releasing everyone on the ship.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  And I'm sitting here like, hey, whoa, I'm the last guy that wants to panic over this.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  But that's ridiculous. How do you not make that like a floating hospital situation
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  and test every single person and don't let them off until they've been tested?
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  I mean, what is that?
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Well, the first problem is the CDC.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  So is that the CDC?
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Yes, they have not produced the test kits.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Now, they allegedly came out with 75,000 test kits on Monday.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Yeah, Trump said he's about to release a million.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And perhaps they're going to do a million, but they're not out there yet.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Doctors, I'm talking to my physician friends who are not able to get it.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  Part of the strategy of the CDC practice is this.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Don't test, don't tell.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  And guess what?
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  The communist Chinese, they ran out of test kits.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  And so they started claiming victims of pneumonia rather than coronavirus.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  That's why you can't believe in the numbers in China.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  So our government is practiced, don't test, don't tell.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  That's why we don't know how many people on airplanes or anything else.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Criminal negligence.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  Yes, it is.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  And that's the kind of stuff that I'm sitting here thinking,
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  and this is when you get real conspiratorial.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  And it's almost like you can't even believe your own conspiracy theory
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  that there would be that many people involved.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  But I mean, it's like, are they intentionally letting people off that boat
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  so they can spread it?
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  I mean, that's like, I just can't even believe that they would let that happen.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Well, the other argument to that is that any government agency,
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  any bureaucrat, bureaucracy, is going to be absolutely incompetent and inept.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  You know, in a bureaucratic...
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  No, no, I completely agree.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  It's just funny because it is like matter of fact.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  It's just like, yeah, like a government bureaucracy, yeah, it sucks.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Yeah, you know, any bureaucracy, culture, any member of it is not going to put their job at risk.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  It's all about job preservation.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  So no one's going to stand up and say, hey, look, this is coming
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  because they put not only themselves at risk for being wrong,
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  but they also expose all the other people who are not willing to speak up.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  So they get ostracized by the members of their own bureaucracy
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  not to mention they're afraid to something.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  So it's just the byproduct, the nature of the bureaucracy.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  So even if it, you know, hopefully that's all it is,
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  but I'm with you on this when I think it's more nefarious.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  I mean, that is, again, I'm the last guy saying panic.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  I'm not worried about the virus.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Like that's where I stand right now.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  And I'm sitting here like, wait, you're docking the ship and releasing them
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  and you're not even going to test this as like a perfect test case.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  It's literally formulaic. We'll be right back.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing,
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  Powerful, quiet and effective,

[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars,
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  but the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system

[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.

[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  But you need these products.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  Mike Adams is about to be joining us.
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Gary Haven is going to stick around.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  It's going to be an incredible hour of radio the next hour.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  But let me finish up with Gary here before Mike takes over.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  What do you think we need to do?
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Again, what do you think we need to do as a society to avoid a horrible breakout?
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  And then what do you think individuals need to do?
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  Like, I'm about to fight Gary now.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  At the beginning, he was going to fight me.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  Now I'm going to be fighting him because he's basically like,
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  no, and you can't travel.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  You've got to cancel these trips.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  And I'm probably not going to have to do it, which sucks.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  But what do you think individuals?
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  What do you think we all need to do?
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  Yeah, I think Mike, Mike in a minute here, Mike Adams is going to agree with me.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  We'll get Mike in a minute.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  He can hold me too.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  You're not going to be traveling anywhere.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  So, Kirk, both of your heads together.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  Yeah, so the quick answer on what we should do,
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  and I shared this with the governor today,
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  we need to start doing massive testing so we know who's got it.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  And number two, we need to quarantine.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  And so those are the two big factors.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Now, what do we do personally?
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  You know, I and I were talking about how the American people
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  are likely collateral damage from a bio weapons attack.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  How do you not be collateral damage?
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  Well, first of all, you need to figure out how to quarantine yourself.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  You need to stay out of the way of groups of people.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Second, you need to supplement.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  You know, I mentioned earlier this immune therapy supplementation,
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  and I'm going to repeat it again.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  It's 2,000, excuse me, 4,000 IUs, vitamin D3,
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  4,000 milligrams of vitamin C,
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  400 milligrams of magnesium, and 50 is zinc.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  You need to get yourself on that, your family members, immediately.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  The other things you can do is do not get into public transportation.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Don't get on an airplane.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  You're literally getting into a capsule where you're trapped with
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  the very likelihood of this virus, this airborne virus floating around
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  and going to be breathing it.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  We would know right now how dangerous that is if the CDC had done their testing.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  So, don't test, don't tell.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  They're putting all of us at risk for those kinds of environments.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  No public transportation.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  If you can work from home, you want to do it.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  We should be closing the schools down, the colleges down.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  That quarantine should be happening immediately, at least voluntarily,
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  led by the governor, but it's going to be mandatory in about three weeks.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  So, why don't you get ahead of this?
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  Why don't you get out of the way of that train?
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  Then the final thing I want to mention on this, and it's very, very important,
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  the medical community and the first responders,
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  these guys do not have the right equipment.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  They're being advised by the CDC to wear N95 masks and goggles.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  That is not what it takes to protect yourself from an airborne virus.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  So, we've got to get smart.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  We've got to set up triage so that nobody with these symptoms
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  can go into a hospital or into a clinic.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  The triage has to be equipped by people with the right equipment
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  in a negative air environment.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  We need to make sure that nobody goes to see their doctor with upper respiratory infections.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  It all should be done, tell them.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Communatively, we've got to examine people over the telephone,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  and we've got to be prepared because our hospitals are going to be overrun,
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  and they're literally in Italy today.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  They don't have enough ventilators, so they're having to choose who lives or dies.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Which is what comes with socialist healthcare.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  It's called a death panel.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  But guess what? We're going to have a death panel here in America in five or six weeks.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  That's why I'm such a preemptive person with the whole health thing in your immune system.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Get out ahead of this.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  The only reason, let's say, I did have the coronavirus.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  Again, I was really sick. I'm not claiming I did.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  I really don't know. Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. I hadn't been that sick in years.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  I could see a lesser person thinking they were going to die.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  Probably have to go to the hospital.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  Getting out of bed to go to the bathroom was like torture.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  But my point is, I was never worried about it because I know I had a strong immune system.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  And that's part of my problem, too. I was saying, too.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  Like, oh, you can get on an airplane, Shroyer. You can go to court. No problem.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  That's just always my mentality, no matter what.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  It's like a ball player with a busted ankle.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  It's like, no, you can get through it. You know, the adrenaline.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  I got to stick around here, at least for one segment.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  This is going to be way too powerful with Mike Adams coming up.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Because I want to ask Mike, too, how do we properly manage this glass menagerie
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  without causing total panic in society and martial law?
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  If you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  I put TurboForce in my coffee. That was a crazy week.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what?
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  I don't think that happens very often.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Kool-Aid's bad, and the Turbo Force is good.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  No time for a liner. This information is too powerful.
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  You know, Gary told me last night, he's like, oh, and you can't travel.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  And I was slamming my hands on the desk like,
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  this is like the fourth vacation in a row I've had to cancel.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  I can't get a trip, but leave it to Gary.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  He says, hey, I got a house you can use, and there's a beach next to it.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  So Gary saves the day.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  But getting serious here, because I'm probably going to have to cancel these trips.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  I really am. I can't believe it. It sucks.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  It's just like my fourth vacation I've had to cancel in a row.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  I can't get away from this.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  But that's where this has gotten now.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  That's how serious this has gotten.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  And Gary, to me, laid out the perfect point, which is,
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  when you get on these airplanes, the ventilation system isn't good enough.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  But I'll confirm it. Let's see what Mike Adams thinks.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Just briefly, Mike, before I get into the topics,
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  I want to have you two discuss here.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  Should I travel?
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  And it's not just me. Is anybody listening that has a trip plan?
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  I'm just using myself as an example here.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Mike, should I get on an airplane and take a trip,
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  or should I cancel it all right now?
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  Oh, and you should cancel immediately, and Gary Haven is 100% correct.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  No question about it.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  Well, I was afraid you were going to say that,
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  but I'm going to unfortunately have to trust your guys' opinions
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  and not leave this to risk.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  Well, look, a couple of things.
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  Two things I really like about Gary.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  Number one, Gary is highly intelligent.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  You don't get to be very successful in the business world
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  unless you can anticipate future events.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  So when Gary does a business deal, he might earn, I don't know,
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  $200 million on a business deal.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  How do you do that? Not by being stupid.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  You have to anticipate. He's very good at that.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Secondly, Gary is not afraid to tell you when you're wrong.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  And he does that to me, and you, and Alex, and everybody.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  Gary will just tell you exactly what he's calculated,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  and he's telling you information that I absolutely agree with.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  You should not fly. No one should fly.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  No one in the country should be flying right now, today.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  All right. Well, let me do this then.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  Let me, I want to hear both of you guys discuss this,
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  because like I said, I've been on the 50-50 side,
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  but if I'm falling off the fence, I'm falling on the less precautionary side.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  I trust my immune system,
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  but you guys are kind of convincing me to go on to the other side.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  So how do you do this, though?
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  How do you properly address this to the nation?
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  How do you properly lay out a lockdown type, quarantine type,
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  I'll even say martial law type situation,
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  without causing societal panic,
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  without causing the collapse of civilization,
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  and then without bringing in on the back end
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  a new era of human civilization
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  where you don't even go outside, you don't leave your front door,
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  it's the true internet digital age, everyone's too afraid to go outside.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  How do you do this? Let's go to Mike Adams and then Gary Haven.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  Mike, Mike, how do you properly do that?
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  Okay, first answer is we have to stop thinking that fear is bad.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  First of all, fear is a survival mechanism,
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  and the bigger risk right now is not being fearful early enough.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  People in Italy said, don't be afraid,
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  now their hospitals are completely overrun,
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  it's an apocalypse there in their medical system,
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  they locked down the entire country.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Italy is America's future.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  Gary was exactly right about that.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  We say that Italy is a time machine for America,
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  and the coronavirus is a truth machine.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  The truth will come out, you can't cover it up.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  You use your fear now to take action,
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  strategic action so that we don't become the next Italy.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  That's my answer, Owen.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  That's great.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Mike, I've been telling everybody I know to go to nationalnews.com,
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  because you have been the most effective leader
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  in getting the truth to American people,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  and I want you to know that in my visit with the governor today,
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  I am so grateful that I had your information to share with the governor,
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  and I pointed out to him that not only can he proactively begin to protect people in the state,
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  but his leadership will be seen by the governors all over the country,
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  and hopefully by the president.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  You are an instrumental part of that conversation.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  But let me bring up something we all want to also protect, guys, and that's freedom.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  I mean, what do you think about the notion, because I'm genuinely afraid of this.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  This has been my biggest fear from this coronavirus more than the virus,
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  and I will still stand firm on this.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  I'm afraid that this will be used, like 9-11 was used,
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  to change the face of the world, to change the face of human interaction.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  How do we avoid that?
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Well, you're not wrong about that, Owen.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  That's one of my big concerns as well.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  I've got Stuart Rhodes coming on at the bottom of the hour
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  to talk about the constitutional implications of this for civil liberties and much more.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  This is a very difficult, you know, threading the needle type of exercise here
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  at the state level with the governor of Texas as well as with President Trump.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  Personally, I think if Trump doesn't start to take immediate correct actions
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  in the next two to three weeks, I think the Trump administration is over.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  And I'll get into more details about that later today.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  So the Trump could be ended by this.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  The Republic could be ended if we don't take very urgent actions right now.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  Yeah, Mike, I agree with you.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Only, I would be a little more urgent about it.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  I was on the phone yesterday for 30 minutes with the co-chairman of the Republican Party,
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  who sees Trump almost every day.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And I was able to wake him up and convince him that this is real.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  And he told me, he says, you know, he's almost been the rest of the afternoon studying.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  I'm going to sleep on it.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  And I said, Tommy, tomorrow morning, you're going to have to make a decision.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  You know, what do I do with this information?
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  I said, if you are fearless about going to the president, convincing him that this is imminent
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  and to quit listening to his horribly incompetent CDC,
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  not only will you save his presidency, because I think he's got about a week,
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  and you'll save the lives of possibly millions of Americans.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  And I said, buddy, I'm sorry to put that on your plate,
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  but that's where you're going to be tomorrow morning.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  Mike, let me ask you the question that I talked to Gary about earlier.
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  How is it that we have the perfect, it's like a gift given to us with this cruise liner out in the ocean.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  It's the perfect opportunity.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  It's totally formulaic.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  It's totally scientific.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  The perfect place for testing grounds.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  You test everybody.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  You see who's got it.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  You see who's don't.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  You see how many people got infected.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  You see the age.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  You see all the stuff.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  Then you can dock and release them.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  No, they did none of that.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  They brought it right up to the dock and they released them except for like two or three people that they knew had it.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  I mean, how is, is that not criminal negligence?
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  Is that not like, hey, we've got a perfect lab just given to us in an unfortunate situation,
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  but now fortunately we've got this floating hospital.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  We can test it, keep it safe.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  And they just like walking like a bull in a china shop.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  You smash the whole thing up.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  I mean, is that not criminal negligence from the CDC?
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  It is criminal negligence, but it's beyond that.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  I believe this is a deliberate plot to destroy Trump since impeachment failed and the Russia collusion hoax failed.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Gary spoke to this in the last hour that he believes this was released by the deep state to harm China,
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  but also to have blowback onto Trump while the CDC deliberately withheld testing kits from the entire country.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  So if you delay this three to four weeks, what happens if you do the exponential math on this?
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  If it doubles about every 3.5 days, then two people infected at the beginning of the month becomes about 1,024 infected people.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  So the CDC was able to multiply this by a factor of roughly about 500 by delaying the testing.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  And I believe that was deliberate, Owen.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  But, but see now, see now we've entered a new realm.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  What do you do if you're the president to address this?
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  Because this is something that has, it's like a separate issue, but the same issue.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  The president needs to come out and I almost think this would be my political way of attacking this issue.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  The president needs to come out and say, ever since I started running, there have been a corrupt criminal international football out to get me.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  The latest attempt is releasing this weapon.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  And he then needs to use that.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  You just mentioned as the example to say, look, they're not giving out the testing kits and then you say, look, they fake hate crimes.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  Look, they're fake news. Look, they fake investigations.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  Look at what they did in Puerto Rico when they withheld disaster relief aid.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  I mean, does it get worse than that? People dying?
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  And then they withhold it to make Trump look bad. They're doing the same thing.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  Trump can come out and say, look, this is why we needed to close the borders three years ago to illegals.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  This is why globalism doesn't work.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Well, he missed that boat. That ship sails. He should have done that two weeks ago.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  But this proves that Trump's philosophies on globalism versus nationalism are actually correct.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  We need more industries here in America. We need more redundant supply lines in America.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  And we need to protect our borders.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Trump could be hammering that and he should be firing ahead of the CDC right now today and laying blame where it belongs.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  They set a trap for Trump and he's caught in it right now.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  And so far, he hasn't been able to get out of it.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Well, not to be dystopic utopian, but in a weird way.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Like if we survive this, that's ultimately the answer.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Independence again. Independence again. We're not independent.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Independence again. Final words, Gary.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Yeah, Owen, as a practical matter, there's no way the president can come out and say this is a deep state plot.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  As you know, the media is just tearing him alive over that thing.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  But what he can do and what he should do is focus on the spread of this illness and get in front of it, way in front of it.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  And immediately, and I agree with Mike, fire the head of the CDC, quit listening to the horrible advice and begin to protect the American people from what's coming.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  Gary Haven, thank you so much. Always a pleasure. Mike Adams takes over.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Look, folks, we've been right ahead of this the whole time.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  I just wish we had a lot more political pull because we'd probably avoid a lot of these messes, man.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  It's just it's time and time again. It's true.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  I wish you were still on air.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  We have our own streams at infowarstore.com and they go, really, they said you were off the air because they took the platforming as off the air.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  No, we have our own platform.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  Info wars, info wars, info wars.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  All right, we continue now for the rest of this hour.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  I'll be hosting.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  We've got Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers joining us at the bottom of this hour to talk about, well, martial law, the quarantine shutdown of entire cities in the United States.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  What is the constitutionality of those actions?
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  Are there things that the president can do that are constitutional that don't violate our civil rights?
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  Stuart Rhodes will be answering those questions.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  I just want to comment before we even get there that on Gary Haven being a guest today was fantastic.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  Gary, I listened intently to what Gary had to say, a very interesting banter between Gary Haven and Owen Shroyer there.
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  And then I was able to join that last segment.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  Gary is 100% right on.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  And Gary absolutely gets it.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  He's a very sharp individual.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  He can follow the math more than just follow the math.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  I mean, he understands projections.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  You don't get to be hugely successful in the business world like he is and to be a pilot of your own fleet of private jets by being a stupid person.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  He is incredibly sharp.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  He gets it.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  And he has issued a warning today to, in effect, all info wars staff, it's time to stop traveling by air.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  And I want to add to that, as of today, I told Alex Jones this morning.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  He called me about coming on today and hosting.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  I told Alex, I'm no longer coming into the info wars studio.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  So I am from now on, whenever I'm invited, I'll be broadcasting from my studio where I am right now.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  We've improved the bandwidth.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  We have good audio thanks to some of the hardware upgrades.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  And I want to thank the info wars staff for helping to make that happen.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  But I will not be coming into the info wars studio any longer until this pandemic is over and done with.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  I am self quarantining in a sense.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  I'm no longer going out to eat at restaurants.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  And this is not a plot to destroy Trump.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  This is common sense.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  This is smart tactical behavior.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  I'm a Trump supporter.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  I want Trump to survive this.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  I want him to stay in office.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  I want him to destroy the deep state.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  But the deep state, as Gary Haven described, is using this engineered global 9 11 type of event to try to destroy Trump.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  And they may succeed.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  This is the warning that I'm sharing with you here today.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  They may succeed.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  And I think Gary gets this.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  I certainly get this as well.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  If Trump does not take decisive action and we'll talk about what some of that might be decisive action.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  Gary thinks he's got only a week left.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  I think Trump maybe might have two weeks that might be overly optimistic.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  I've been actually, if you go back to my projections on this, I've been overly optimistic the entire time.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  For example, I predicted that this week we would have dozens of cases confirmed in the United States.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  But as of last night, we have over a thousand.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  So as much as if you want to say I'm spreading fear, I mean, even this morning, Alex Jones said I'm kind of an alarmist.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  So I mean, not that many people have ever been called an alarmist by Alex Jones.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  So but I have been overly optimistic.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  In other words, I haven't been alarming enough.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  To keep up with the numbers.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  You understand?
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  So everything that I've told you has been actually better than the best case scenario.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  It's way worse than anything I've said.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  It's way worse.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  That's what the numbers are proving right now.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  And yeah, there's been a little bit of a little bit of a divergence here on info wars where Alex is maybe kind of downplaying some of the mortality rate a little bit, or at least asking those questions.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  Alex likes to explore all the scenarios and that's great.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  That's what's great about info wars.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  It's not some rigged scripted news.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  You're going to have guests like myself who believe this is going to be far, far worse than anything.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  You might have other guests who say, ah, it's no big deal.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  It's just the flu.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  Well, that's because info wars is real media and we don't all agree all the time.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  But we do tell you the truth as we see it.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  No one controls us.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  We are not puppets.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  We don't have teleprompters.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  I'm not reading a teleprompter.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  I'm giving it to you straight every single day from my point of view.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  And by the way, I really want to thank the callers.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  And in fact, for the fourth hour today, I want to open up the phones to take calls from people to do two things.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  You can call and ask a question of me if you want, or you can call and offer your own comment or a suggestion about what Trump should do in your opinion.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  So for the fourth hour today, I want to take a lot of calls.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  I've been listening to the calls over the last several days and you callers have been amazing.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Your information is outstanding.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  In fact, this phrase, a global 9-11 event, that came from a caller.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  I regret I don't know that caller's name, but that was a call that came in and it's absolutely right.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  This is a global 9-11 style event taking place right now.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  And where Alex is absolutely correct is that this is engineered.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  This is a human weapon or a weapon against humanity.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  This was released on purpose.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Now there's debate about who released it and why, but it was in a Chinese lab.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  That much is clear.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  At least that's what we currently believe.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  But it was engineered using technology that was funded by Obama and allowed to be transferred to China by Obama-connected individuals and universities that were taking money from China and things like that.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  So Alex is absolutely right, in my opinion, that this is an engineered global event.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  However, where I think a lot of Trump supporters are currently wrong is in thinking that it's a hoax because the left-wing media is talking about it.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  So yes, the left-wing media lies all the time.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  They lied about Trump, you know, for the last three years.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  They lied about Russia.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  They lied about impeachment.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  They lie about Alex.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  They lie about everybody.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  They lie about me.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  But it doesn't mean that they're lying about this.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  In fact, occasionally even the lying left-wing media will collide with something that's true.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  They are using it to try to bring down Trump.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  But that doesn't mean there isn't a virus.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  It doesn't mean that PCR genetic testing isn't real.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  I've even heard that argument from some people across the independent media who are calling me and telling me,
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  hey, viruses don't exist and PCR testing doesn't work.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  Like, come on, give me a break.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  I run a science lab, okay?
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  I've run PCR equipment.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  You can use it to test for bacteria in food.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  I can take a food sample, I can put it in the machine,
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  and in 30 hours it tells me whether there's horse protein in there, okay?
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  How does that work?
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  Because horse DNA is replicated by the PCR technology,
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  and then it's analyzed and sequenced in the software,
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  and it can tell me, hey, there's horse protein in there.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  The technology's real, folks.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  Don't be flat earthers on this, okay?
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  Don't be like the flat earth version of virology to say there's no viruses.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  Okay, viruses are real.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  PCR technology works, and as I've stated before, the earth is a sphere.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  So we have to start with some really basic things
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  in order to tackle the reality that's hitting us right now.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  And whether Owen Schroyer has a slightly different view,
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  or Alex Jones has a different view, or myself, Mike Adams has a different view,
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  and what we all care about is saving America,
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  helping Trump win and conquer this and beat this thing,
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  restoring the Republic, conserving civil liberties,
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  and defeating the deep state criminals, the traitors,
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  the child pedophiles on the left,
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  the corrupt criminal cartels of the Clintons and the Bidens and the Obamas,
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  we have to defeat that.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  But they have laid a vicious trap for Trump right now with this virus,
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  a vicious trap.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  And if Trump doesn't navigate this very, very carefully and decisively and quickly,
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  Trump will be destroyed by this.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  And Gary Haven agrees with my assessment on that and thinks Trump has only a week
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  to take decisive action.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  Now, what will that action be?
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  We're going to talk to Stuart Rhodes on the other side of this break
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  about maybe what Trump could do right now that doesn't violate our constitutional rights,
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  because if we beat the virus but we end up enslaved under tyranny,
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  that's no solution either.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  How do we beat the virus and save our Republic and save Trump
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  and still have a second amendment?
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  We'll find out after this break with Stuart Rhodes.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Stay with us. This is Mike Adams here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  This is Mike Adams here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  This should really be easier than it is.
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  and will help us, and it's symbiotic.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  And people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen,
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  like eight years ago sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine.

[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  taken sublingually.

[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  and the heart of the Resistance.
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  It's Mike Adams.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  Alright, we're gonna have Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  joining us here in just a second,
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  but I want to point out something.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  You know, I don't believe in numerology
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  in a superstitious kind of way,
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  but the globalists do.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  And people like David Ike have spoken about this before.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  The globalists use certain number, patterns, and dates
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  to spring events on humanity.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  And let me point out something to you
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  that's gonna blow your mind.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  Today, the WHO declared a global pandemic.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  They waited to do it today.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  What is today?
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  March 11th.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  And March 11th is six months away from 9-11.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  March 11th is also nine years to the day
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  after the Fukushima disaster,
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  which was March 11, 2011.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  So we have nine years after a March 11 disaster
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  of Fukushima.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  That's 9-11 for the WHO pandemic
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  that is today, March 11, 2020.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  So the globalists are obsessed with numbers.
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  And even though I tend to approach things
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  from a very scientific point of view,
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  and again, like I said, I don't follow numerology
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  from a mystical point of view,
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  but the globalists do.
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  This tells us something that they believe
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  this is their kill switch for humanity.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  That globalists have planned this and engineered it
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and launched it on the right day.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  And they think, you know, the stars are aligned
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  and everything on this right day.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  I don't know what the planets and stars are doing today.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  That's not my venue, but this is six months from 9-11.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  Okay?
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  And this is nine years after Fukushima, March 11.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  So keep that in mind as you look at where this is going.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  Now, moving to constitutional rights
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  or liberties and the constitutionality
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  of possible martial law actions.
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  Stuart Rhodes joins us now to help us understand
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  what's about to happen.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  The context of this is, of course,
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  that New York has already deployed the National Guard there
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  to create a containment zone around a town called New Rochelle.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  And the state of Washington, through Governor Inslee there,
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  has just banned all public events involving 250 or more people.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  And that governor's talking about,
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  he's about to maybe quarantine the entire state
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  or maybe the city of Seattle, I'm not sure exactly.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  But he's talking like something big is coming.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Will we survive this with our liberties intact?
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  Oathkeeper's founder, Stuart Rhodes joins us now
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  by video and audio.
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  Thank you for joining me, Stuart.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  It's great to have you on.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  Yeah, likewise. Thank you.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  So, Stuart, I know that you're very concerned,
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  as I am, about where this is headed.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  We did an interview the other day and you said
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  that Trump needs to take decisive action,
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  but you're also very concerned about, you know,
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  martial law and how easily the American people
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  might just accept it blindly and give up all their liberties.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  What's your overview of where we are now
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  and what needs to happen?
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  Well, first of all, martial law is unconstitutional.
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  It's nowhere in the Constitution.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  And frankly, you should stop using that term.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  I think it's a mistake to do that.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  But where we are right now is that, as you have said,
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  and I agree, that Trump must take decisive action,
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  he must do that within the bounds of the Constitution.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  I don't think the American people
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  are going to accept anything else.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  I don't think they're going to accept him
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  sitting aside the Constitution or trying to.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  They've lost all confidence in the federal government
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  and the state governments on both sides of the political spectrum.
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  But there are things he can do that are perfectly constitutional.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  He can still stop all incoming flights
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  from foreign countries, and he should.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  He can also still lock down domestic airlines and travel.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  I think that is perfectly constitutional.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  I think he can and should do these things.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  And he could use his position of leadership
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  to call for the closure of all the public schools
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  in all the states.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  And I do think it's constitutional for the governors of the states
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  to take these actions and close all the schools.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  He can also activate calling the Federal Service, the National Guard,
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  and employ the Army and Navy Reserve units
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  to go and deploy medical hospitals throughout the entire country
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  and prepare for the overload that we know is going to happen.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  They should be setting up field hospitals right now
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  to handle the influx that we're going to see us like Iligas saw.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  Now, okay, and what about the borders,
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  specifically the Mexico border?
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  What should he do there?
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  He should put the US military on the border,
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  and that's also a perfectly constitutional
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  within his rights to do that,
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  within his rights as president, his powers as president,
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  and also his duty as a president.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  And I've been preaching this for years.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  I know you've been saying the same thing
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  and we've both been right about that.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  So there's many things he could do.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  He's locked down the country and defended from external threats.
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  You don't let it come in and then turn around
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  and use draconian martial law on American people.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  It's unconstitutional.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  Okay, so what about then the argument,
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  I'll play devil's advocate with you here a bit on this,
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  and your video is breaking up just a little bit,
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  but it's still mostly good.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  What about in places like Seattle
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  where if you don't lock down a city
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  where it's spreading,
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  then it's just going to continue to replicate.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  It's already in the country.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  So yeah, we blocked the borders.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  We blocked the international flights,
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  but it's already endemic in the Seattle area right now
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  and it's exploding in areas of New York and Boston and so on.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  What do you do with those areas?
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Well, we just published a recommendation,
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  open letter to the governors of the United States.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  So if you want to bring that up, I'll show that to you.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  But the first thing we tell them is that
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  they should take this seriously.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  They should declare an emergency,
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  but they should immediately do what Korea has done,
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  what South Korea has done, which is do massive testing.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  And they should do a drive-through testing
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  or sending teams out to people's homes.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  What they should not do is have people going into
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  already crowded emergency rooms
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  and bringing this virus in there,
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  or go in there because they're afraid they might be ill
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  and then catch it from somebody else.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  So they must be tested in their homes
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  or in their cars as they drive through.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  And they should also set up outdoor testing
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  because we know this is airborne.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  So you don't want to be in confined space.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  So have a screening area outdoors
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  because some people will just insist on going to the hospital anyway.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  So in other words, you prepare for this and treat it seriously.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  But they have to accept the reality this is airborne.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  That's what this is. It's been confirmed.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  Well, when it comes to accepting reality,
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  let's talk right now about,
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  I still see a lot of Trump supporters out there
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  in the message boards and the comment sections
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  are saying that this whole thing in their minds is a hoax.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  They think that it's liberal governors declaring emergencies
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  to try to embarrass Trump.
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  They think that South by Southwest was canceled
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  to try to embarrass Trump.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  They think that the whole thing is a hoax.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  What do you say to those people right now
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  who aren't yet getting this?
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  What's driving that?
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  I think Trump himself is driving it.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  And also people like Rush Limbaugh saying this.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  And frankly, I don't think Alex is helping with the situation.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  It's one thing to say this is a real problem.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  Okay, Stuart's signal is breaking up a little bit there.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  Stuart, let's try to reconnect with Stuart there
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  and maybe send Stuart a blank screen
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  instead of video to save on his bandwidth.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  But I think what Stuart was saying is that
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  the president himself is not helping this situation
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  and neither is Rush Limbaugh.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  I've been very critical of Rush Limbaugh as well.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  Rush is still saying it's just a flu.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  And that's certainly not accurate.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  And the thing to understand, folks,
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  is that when those of us who voted for Trump
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  and we support Trump and we want to take down the deep state,
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  we want to restore the American constitutional republic
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  and protect civil liberties,
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  protect the Second Amendment and the First Amendment,
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  when we criticize Trump about this,
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  it is legitimate criticism in the hopes that Trump succeeds.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  When the left-wing media criticizes Trump,
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  it's because they hope he fails.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  And I wouldn't be surprised.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  And Alex even mentioned this.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if there were Democrats running around America right now
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  literally spreading this pandemic on purpose
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  to try to make the situation worse.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  We've already heard of some Democrats saying
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  that they want to get the infection
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  and then go to a Trump rally
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  and spread it among Trump supporters.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  That's what radical left-wing people are wanting to do right now.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  They want this disease to spread.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  They want to take down America.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  You've heard Bill Maher talk about an economic collapse.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  They want that to happen.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  The difference is that Stuart Rhodes doesn't want America to collapse.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Mike Adams doesn't want America to collapse.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Gary Haven doesn't want America to collapse.
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  And Alex Joseph doesn't either.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  We want America to succeed.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  But we have to take some action right now to stop this infection.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  And folks, let me know when we've got Stuart back.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Maybe it's going to be for the next segment.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  But we have to take decisive action right now.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Otherwise, it's going to be catastrophic.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  The hospitals in Italy are being overrun
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  and doctors there are now saying
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  that it's near the state of collapse
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  in northern Italy right now today.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  And that's about three weeks away
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  for some cities in America
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  if we don't start to take action
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  to stop the flights, like Stuart just said,
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  stop the flights, block the borders,
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  stop international flights, but also domestic flights as well.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Trump has got to get on top of this or he will not survive this.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  His presidency may be over
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  if he doesn't take action now.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  This is Mike Adams. We'll be back here
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  with Alex Jones' show. Stay with us.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  Save the Second Amendment. Defend the First Amendment.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  Infowars.com. And it looks like duct tape.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  It's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  You go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  without even disrupting tension.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening?
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  When you go, well, we're being censored.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  And Dr. Pachennik, let me just ask you what you think
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  because I've not launched this yet.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  that they try to repress you with, that silence,
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  and made it into a weapon.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  Silence.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  It's really smart to get high quality
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  storedable food at infowars.com.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  It's also smart to drink filtered water
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  with an Alexa Pure system.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  It's one of the highest rated out there
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  and extremely affordable.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  And it's just as important to have your immune system
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:10.000]  boosted during times like this.
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  And DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  and many other amazing ingredients,
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  is the base foundation for your entire body.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  Your mitochondrial output inside your cells,
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  your telomeres, and so much more.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  DNA Force is now, after four months of being sold out,
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  back in stock, 40% off.
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  This is our flagship product.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  I'm so proud of it.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  And I had run out of it as well.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in,
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  I was so excited.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  It's now available at infowarsstore.com.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  It's a wonderful formula.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  And it funds the information war
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  with the important fight that we're carrying out
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  for not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  So please get your DNA Force Plus today
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  at infowarsstore.com.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  It's now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  And they were having discussions with me
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  And at a certain point, just saying, we're done.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  Because people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  And then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  Because we're honest, under promise, over-delivered.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  But technically, it's going to be six to eight weeks.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  And we want you to get a great deal
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  and feel like we took care of you.
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  So you come back again. We want relationships with you.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  We're not Satanists. We're the opposite.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  We believe in Jesus Christ.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  And we've been blessed by you. We're all in this together.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  Six weeks ago, we warned you
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  that the choreographed nature
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  of the global media and governments
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  concerning coronavirus told us
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  it was a major globalist operation.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not,
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  the issue is it's being used
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  by the globalists as a weapon
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  against the world economy and against nation states
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  and against the populist movement
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  here in America and against infowars.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  And that means against you.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  So however you're going to do it,
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  now is the time to get ready
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  and to get prepared with emergency supplies
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  and items that are known to boost your immune system.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  They're all
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  High-quality, storable food when nobody else has got it.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  Super powerful formulas
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  like DNA Force Plus, X2,
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  X3,
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  and our nano-silver line of products.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  A bunch of which has been sold out,
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  but a bunch of which is coming back in
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  later this week.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  So check it all out at infowarstore.com
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  and get prepared.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  All right, we're continuing with
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  Stuart Rhodes here from Oathkeepers
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  and let me just give out the phone number.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  We're going to start taking calls at 6 after
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  in the next hour.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  That's 877-789-2539
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  and you can call with questions for me,
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  suggestions for Trump
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  or general comments,
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  but we're going to keep the calls really, really short
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  because we have a lot of calls in.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  Now, I've got a challenge here for Stuart Rhodes
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  whose connection is back on for us,
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  so we'll continue with Stuart.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  Here's the challenge, Stuart.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  I've run the mathematical modeling of this on the pandemic.
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  I've even released the public spreadsheet.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  I think you've seen it as well.
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  And if you look at an R0 value
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  of the virus of around 6.0,
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  which is that may be high,
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  maybe low, we're not sure,
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  but with an R0 value of 6.0,
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  you have to have about 83%
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  of stopping new infections
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  in order for
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  you to avoid an exponential
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  trajectory of the spread of this virus.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  So how do we
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  achieve an 83% containment
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  without having
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  some kind of nationwide shelter
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  in place lockdown order?
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  How do we even achieve that?
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  Or do we just say forget it?
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  We're just going to lose 10 million people
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  and we just forget about it.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  How do we do that?
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  By closing the schools,
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  by stopping the mass transit
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  which the president has the authority to do,
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  and you do it by
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  then making it, you know, it's very obvious then
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  that it's serious.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  And you got one half of the country who then listen to him
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  when they know it's serious.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  We were not right.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  At this point, we're not listening.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  Most of you conservatives are not listening at all.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  So the best way to do that is to have him stand up
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  with leadership and say,
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  as you said earlier,
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  I'm not going to fire pence.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  You should fire pence and bring in a new vice president
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  and he should just clean house
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  and then stand up and say, I was misled
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  but now I'm going to do what's necessary
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  and lead by his own example, shut down his own mass rallies
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  and do those over the internet.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  And then people will listen.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  Whether Democrats listen or not after that
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  is who knows.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  But for now, at least the conservatives will listen.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  And that's what you do.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  Then you encourage the governors to do the same thing
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  in their states.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  And that's what they can do.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  They can shut down mass gatherings.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  You know, the health inspector for the county
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  can deny permits for concerts, etc.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  etc.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  More leeway at the local level.
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  Yes, yes. Well, I can see if Trump comes out
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  and says, yes, this thing is real.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  Yes, we have to start taking these precautions.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  I can see the left wing media the very next day
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  saying, ah, no, we decided it's not real anymore
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  because we're going to say the opposite
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  of President Trump, you know, that could happen.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  What about the situation in New York?
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  Do you have any intel from your members
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  on the ground there in New York?
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  What role exactly is the National Guard
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  playing there with the, quote,
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  containment zone around New Rochelle?
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  Well, it does an unfortunate
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  term they use.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  They're not actually quarantining that entire area.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  They're just, they're just using it as
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  or shutting down the schools inside of it.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  And they're, they're, they're taking heightened precautions
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  and no big public events, things like that.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  And they're, and I would hope
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  they're doing aggressive testing.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  Why do you need National Guard troops there
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  to just shut down schools?
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  To assist with the testing.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  That's what I would use them for.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  We'll see what Governor Cuomo does.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  But that's what the National Guard is for.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  National Guard, I mean, it's not like
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  National Guard does nothing or there's
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  martial law and military rule.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  There's an entire spectrum in between
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  the National Guard is there to do
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  and they've done that throughout their entire history
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  because they are part of the militia.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  The rest of us supposed to be the rest of the militia,
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  but they're, but they are useful
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  and properly useful for
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  emergencies like this, but they should be setting up
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  testing centers, outdoor testing centers,
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  drive-by testing centers
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  like South Korea has done.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  That's why the South Koreans are getting a handle
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  on it because they are aggressively
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  testing 10,000 people
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  every day from what I've heard.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  I agree with you. Yeah, South Korea
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  is getting
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  a handle on this by having lots and lots
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  of testing and Italy
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  has done a nationwide, you know,
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  shelter-in-place type of scenario.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  However, it seems to me that
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  we're kind of just chasing these scenarios.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  So Governor Inslee from Washington,
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  he's so far ordered the shutdown
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  of any events over 250 people.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  But it seems like a week from now,
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  that's going to have to get escalated and then
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  two weeks from now, it's going to have to be
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  a shelter-in-place type of thing.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  You know, it's almost like
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  if they were to bite the bullet
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  early, then you could really
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  take these tracks. Otherwise, you're just chasing
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  the curve that's
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  exponential and you're always behind it.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  That's what it seems like.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  Well, yeah, you need to take whatever action you can.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  But they have to be within the bounds of the Constitution.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  I don't think the Constitution is
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  a suicide pact. I think not following it
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  is suicidal. And frankly,
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  there are just too many Americans in this country
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  who are not going to put up with
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  any level of government setting it aside.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  This is not going to happen. If they try it,
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  they'll be fighting.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  There are resistance, armed resistance to it.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  So I think we need to set that aside.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  I don't even talk about it anymore.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  Just focus on what can be done within the bounds
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  of the Constitution and get it done.
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  But I think the American people will also
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  self-shelter.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  You're already seeing it. You're already seeing a reduction
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  in people attending theaters and restaurants.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  And that's why Trump's leadership
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  or the governor's leadership
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  can make the difference. People will,
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  they have their own self-interest in mind. They'll stay home.
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  And I think that's going to happen.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  We've already seen people stopping
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  air flights voluntarily
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  and very few people on cruise ships right now.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  A lot of people are sheltering in place.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  I announced today I'm no longer going into the Info War
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  Studios, so I'm kind of
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  prepared to shelter in place,
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  so to speak. I don't even like that phrase, by the way.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I think, I don't like it when
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  governors use that phrase
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  when they really mean martial law, by the way.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  And by the way, so you said
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  maybe I should stop using the term martial law.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  That's a better phrase
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  to describe what may be happening.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  What I mean is, is don't use that
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  meaning that
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  anything that's done
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  to handle this is martial law.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  Martial law is a specific meaning.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  It means military rule
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  of the commander on the battlefield.
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  It means military dictatorship.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  That's what it is. Like we impose
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  on Occupied Japan, when MacArthur
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  ruled Japan
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  as a sole almost
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  limited power dictator.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  Or we're imposed on Occupied Germany
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  after World War II. That's what martial law is.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  It's setting aside, you know,
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  the rule of your elected government,
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  setting aside the courts, everything.
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  It's not the same thing. It's putting the National Guard
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  in the street and at MREs
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  or to assist with,
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  you know, with
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  enforcing a quarantine.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  If you're a person who has an infection,
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  you can quarantine them. That is legal.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  When they took people out
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  to the Diamond Princess
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  and put them at an airport space here in Texas
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  where I'm at right now, you know,
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  that was legal and lawful and then they can find them
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  in that space. That's also legal and lawful.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  That's not martial law.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  That's just putting those people who are infected
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  into quarantine. If they don't want to be in quarantine,
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  they can stay overseas.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  So I hear what you're saying. I think
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  what you're describing is that we need to understand
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  the full spectrum of responses
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  and use accurate language
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  to describe what's happening. For example,
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  helping with infrastructure, food deliveries
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  or, you know,
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  maintaining the health care infrastructure.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  That's not martial law just because
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  they're carrying rifles. That's what you're saying.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Or testing. Right.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Or testing. Right. But you also said
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  earlier that you think maybe the U.S.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  military should right now
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  be operating in the U.S.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  to help set up medical facilities,
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  perhaps, you know,
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  triage units that might be necessary.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  Is that, is that constitutional?
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  I mean, that's what the Army Reserve
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and the Navy Reserve does all the time.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  When we were down in Puerto Rico
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  for the disaster relief after the hurricane
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  there, we worked directly with Army
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  Reserve units that had set up a field hospital
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  outside of a dysfunctional
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  Puerto Rican hospital. So yeah,
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  it's absolutely constitutional. It's part of their mission.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  You know, so there,
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  once again, they're not running around
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  trying Americans by military tribunal.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  They're running around setting up, you know,
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  field hospitals to help people.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  I think that's probably constitutional.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  Okay, but there's a very slippery slope
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  in this we saw in China.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  I'm not saying that we're China, but just as
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  an extreme example, China would then
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  have armed squads show up
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  at your house, take your temperature, and
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  then arrest you and take you away
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  and throw you into basically a coronavirus
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  death camp. So we don't
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  want to see anything go in that direction
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  in the United States, but isn't there some
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  risk that troops
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  on the streets or in the communities
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  could then just suddenly be told,
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  okay, start, start going door
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  to door, take their guns and arrest
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  people who have a temperature? Could that happen?
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  I mean, I suppose
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  it could happen. I mean, you get some idiot
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  like Cuomo who knows what's going to happen.
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  So sure, it's a potential danger,
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  but the thing is,
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  like you said before, you got to get ahead of the curve.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  So they should use the resources they
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  have available to them, like right here in Texas,
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  Texas governor Abbott should
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  activate his National Guard,
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  his Texas National Guard, and
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Texas State Defense Force, and get them
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  busy assisting with testing.
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  That's the most important thing you can do right now
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  is test, test, test.
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  I mean, you know, Gary, David said it.
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  You've said it. I've said it. It's
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  a common sense thing to do. The South Koreans
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  are doing that. So let's just go ahead and do
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  what we know we can do and get it done.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  And, you know, and then
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  you have to worry so much about, you know,
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  worst case scenarios when you've got dead
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  bodies stacked up in the streets.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  Go ahead and test people right now.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  If someone's identified as being ill,
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  they have to be quarantined. Whether you do that
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  in their home with some kind of mechanism
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  enforcement, with like a maybe
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  an ankle brace, but I don't know.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  Whether you do it by having to go to a hospital,
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  you know, I think most people who are sick
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  would be
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  really fine with this.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  We're going to go to break here. Stay with us.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  We've just got a short break. Stay with us for five more minutes
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  on the other side, please. I want to ask you a couple
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  more questions. Fascinating discussion
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  about civil liberties and the constitutionality
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  of what may be about to happen
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  across America. This is Mike Adams. Alex

[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  You and your family's immune system.
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  Thanks to our president,
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  Trump, who has so far resisted
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  every effort of removal by
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  the treacherous treasonous deep state
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  that despises America, despises
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  the Constitution, hates
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  Trump, hates InfoWars and all
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  of us that want to take our guns,
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  take our speech, take our rights, take our lives.
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  How are we going to stop them? That's
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  what we're exploring today. We've got
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  just a few more minutes here with
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Stuart Rhodes from Oathkeepers.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  Oathkeepers.org is the website and
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:44.160]  explanations and thoughts on this today. Do you agree that we have a very narrow path
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:47.840]  to navigate here? We've got to beat this virus, but we've somehow got to defend the
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:53.480]  Constitution and keep the Republic intact. Have we ever faced something like this since,
[3:00:53.480 --> 3:00:55.480]  I don't know, World War II?
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:00:57.480]  Well, sure. It was about 9-11.
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:00:58.480]  Well, yeah, okay, sure.
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:03.040]  In the national security, we set aside a lot of our rights and, you know, they crossed
[3:01:03.040 --> 3:01:07.320]  the Rupacan. They did things that they never should have done, detaining two American citizens
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:13.160]  by military tribunals and military attention. And so you had conservatives backed in supporting
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:17.480]  that because Bush was doing it. So this is a dangerous territory. It's very dangerous
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:22.160]  and it could be, this is going to be used to destroy our Constitution. So we can't
[3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:26.240]  do that. We can't run around with a hair on fire and throw the Constitution in the trash
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:30.840]  can. At the same time, though, we can't be just complacent and say, this is no big deal.
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:36.000]  It's just the flu. There's a middle ground there where you do what you can inside the
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:40.440]  bounds of the Constitution. You don't step outside of it. I've got no option. I swore
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:44.520]  I know it's important for the Constitution. I take that seriously. And I'm under duty
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:49.080]  obligation to enforce it. And the same goes for the President of the United States. He
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:56.520]  has no right, no power to step outside the Constitution. None of us do. And so, you know,
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:00.400]  we have to take a hard stand on that. You must be within the bounds. But within the
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:05.960]  bounds is a lot of things you can do to mitigate and take care of this. You're going to have
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:10.240]  lost your life because they failed to do what they should have done to lock our borders
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:15.480]  down and exclude the outside world. They failed to do that. We're not going to pay the price.
[3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:19.680]  Yeah, that's true. So much of our federal government right now is already outside the
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:23.200]  bounds of what's constitutional. As you well know, I'm not telling you anything new, but
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:29.960]  even the very existence of the CDC or even FEMA is arguably unconstitutional right now.
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:36.360]  The fiefdoms of these federal regulators from FTC to DEA to FDA, they're all unconstitutional.
[3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:42.160]  They're all run by unelected bureaucrats. And yet, Trump is limited by the Constitution,
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:46.080]  but the rest of the government seems to be limited by nothing, especially the deep state
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:51.520]  traders, the Obama holdovers and so on. They're not limited by law. They can do anything.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:55.880]  And they never get held to account. How can Trump navigate that situation? I mean, they're
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:01.720]  trying to destroy him and the country at the same time. And he's got very few powers, relatively
[3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:06.000]  speaking. No, he's got, he can lock down the border.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:10.360]  He could exclude the, he should still do it, exclude all the, exclude the outside world
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:15.560]  for now. Quarantine us. Quarantine the rest of the world, basically. Lock it down like
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:19.160]  the Saudis just did or like Israel's doing. You don't get into Israel now, like going
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:24.120]  through a quarantine. He can do that right now. By that leadership, you will make sure
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:28.360]  the people of the United States understand this is real and really serious. And then
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:32.640]  he can lock down the border of Mexico, all that we've been talking about, and he can
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:38.160]  pressure the governors to close the school, which they should, and close down mass gatherings,
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:42.440]  which they all still do. What should he do then if a judge in Hawaii,
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:47.040]  appointed by Obama says, oh, you're the, you can't do that, just like has happened many
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.120]  times before. What should Trump do now under these circumstances if these liberal judges
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:55.520]  try to block them? You should do what Andrew Jackson did. He said, you said the courts
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:03:59.840]  made this decision, now it can enforce it. And you should just go and do what's necessary
[3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:03.800]  to defend American lives, period. So it's going to be our core.
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:09.080]  Oh, I agree. But does he have enough support at the Pentagon to carry out those orders,
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:12.800]  even if judges, liberal judges in Hawaii are telling him not to do it?
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:16.680]  We'll find out, won't we? But he has to do it to find out.
[3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:20.960]  That's not the answer I wanted to hear. That's the problem. He's got a man up and
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:26.080]  at. And he man's up and act. I think those of us who took that oath will take it seriously
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:29.720]  and support him as long as he's within the bounds of the Constitution.
[3:04:29.720 --> 3:04:34.320]  All right. So Stuart Rhodes, thank you so much for joining us today. Very valuable insight
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:39.600]  and analysis. We're going to continue now through the fourth hour with your phone calls coming
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:44.120]  up, your questions, your comments, and your advice for President Trump. This is Mike Adams
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:52.840]  here on infowars.com. We'll be right back.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:56.520]  You want to break some globalist ribs? You want to crush some skulls politically? You
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:05:01.840]  want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually? There's nowhere you can spend
[3:05:01.840 --> 3:05:07.680]  money. There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more
[3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:13.840]  power per dollar. Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices
[3:05:13.840 --> 3:05:19.440]  that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:24.280]  enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the
[3:05:24.280 --> 3:05:29.520]  fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, we have to make the effort 110% God
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:34.680]  will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[3:05:34.680 --> 3:05:38.760]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist. And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:41.840]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures
[3:05:41.840 --> 3:05:45.840]  together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:49.640]  everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in
[3:05:49.640 --> 3:06:10.600]  this together in four store.com. All right, we are continuing now for the fourth hour.
[3:06:10.600 --> 3:06:14.880]  This is Mike Adams from natural news. We're going to take your calls with questions and
[3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:18.680]  suggestions for President Trump. We've had a fascinating discussion over the last hour
[3:06:18.680 --> 3:06:22.720]  with Gary Haven, as well as Stuart Rhodes. I've got my own analysis that you've heard
[3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:28.000]  over the last few days as well. First, just want to mention infowarstore.com. Of course,
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:33.080]  you know that's what keeps us running. But I have a little different take on this. If
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:36.600]  you're not boosting your immune function and protecting yourself with the nutrients that
[3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:42.880]  Gary Haven mentioned about an hour ago, then you're crazy. Look, I think that right now
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:53.400]  we have, let's say a 2% mortality rate. The WHO says it's 3.4%. The new numbers from worldometer.info
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:07:01.680]  now say it's a 6% death rate across the board. Maybe it's only 1%. But look, you're a lot
[3:07:01.680 --> 3:07:08.520]  less likely to die if you keep your immune function healthy and strong to begin with.
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:14.200]  And even though we don't know anything about what's proven against this particular coronavirus,
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:19.040]  we can, of course, have general principles of boosting our immune health. I take vitamin
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:24.560]  C every day. Massive amounts of it. I take vitamin D every day. I take magnesium and
[3:07:24.560 --> 3:07:29.360]  zinc. Those are the four nutrients that Gary Haven mentioned. But I take a lot more, too.
[3:07:29.360 --> 3:07:34.240]  I take turmeric. I take acesanthin. I take spirulina. I take licorice root and all kinds
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:40.960]  of other things. Alpha lipoic acid, for example, ginger root is very helpful. Infowarsstore.com
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:46.560]  has a lot of things that are generally supportive of your normal immune function. And I think
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:51.400]  you'd be crazy not to support this network and also boost your health in this time. Even
[3:07:51.400 --> 3:07:56.080]  though, again, we don't know, nothing has been scientifically proven against this virus,
[3:07:56.080 --> 3:08:01.360]  not any drug, not any pharmaceutical, not any herb or vaccine or anything because it's
[3:08:01.360 --> 3:08:07.240]  still so early in this race, this race to find what works. But boosting immune function
[3:08:07.240 --> 3:08:14.120]  makes perfect sense. So let's go to calls here. Now, I don't have the callers' names
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:19.080]  in front of me, so I apologize in advance to the callers, but we're going to go kind
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:24.080]  of rapid pace here shortly. But one other thing to mention before we go to calls, bring
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:31.320]  up the worldometer.info or some people say worldometer.info. Go to the coronavirus page
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:37.360]  show that chart because it shows the rise in cases around the world and it shows the
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:45.560]  current 6% death rate that is calculated from cases that are closed. So 94% of the people
[3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:54.480]  are discharged as survivors and 6% are dying. Now, out of that 100%, maybe 4 out of 5 people
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:00.640]  are roughly 80%, maybe it's 85% are having very mild cases. But after you get beyond
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:05.760]  a mile, then you get into serious or critical status than the death rate skyrockets, especially
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:10.960]  if you're an older individual. If you're older than 60%, your death rate on average is about
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:17.000]  4%. If you're older than 70%, it's about 8%. If you're older than 80%, it's about 15%
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:23.640]  or 16%. Across the board, it's about 6% fatality according to the current numbers. And as more
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:28.760]  numbers rolled in from Italy and Korea and the United States, we're going to have even
[3:09:28.760 --> 3:09:33.640]  better accuracy on all those numbers. Here's what we know for sure. The more testing you
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:38.320]  do, the lower your death rate gets because you get early treatment for people, you get
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:43.960]  good hospital care. So the United States needs to be testing like mad right now and it still
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:49.440]  isn't happening at the pace that we need. South Korea has been leading the way on testing
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:54.280]  around for the whole world. South Korea is an outstanding model for testing. They've
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:59.120]  got drive-thru testing. They've done hundreds of thousands of tests while America has only
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:04.920]  achieved a few thousand tests. That is unacceptable. We can't say that America is ready for a
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:10.000]  pandemic if we can't test for it. So, you know, all this talk out there is, oh, America
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:14.520]  is great. It's the best healthcare system in the world. We were ready for the pandemic.
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:19.040]  Not at all true. Hospitals did not have masks. That's why they're scrambling to buy them.
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:23.560]  They did not have gear. Fire departments and police departments, first responders across
[3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:28.280]  the country did not have masks. I know this is a fact because I've spoken to many of the
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:33.680]  logistics people that order supplies. They did not have supplies. Hospitals weren't ready.
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:38.240]  Firefighters, their departments weren't ready. Counties weren't ready. Cities weren't ready.
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:43.720]  Hospitals weren't ready. And the CDC was the most of all not ready for this. And the
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:49.200]  FDA wasn't ready. The Big Pharma wasn't ready. The NIH wasn't ready. So, no, no, we're way
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:54.480]  behind the curve on this. We should have been testing thousands of people a month ago. And
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:59.840]  we didn't. And as a result, this has slipped out of control right now. It's broken containment
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:03.840]  in areas like Seattle and Washington. And this is not going to get under control until
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:08.280]  we take new steps. Another important point here, big tech wants
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:14.240]  you to die. So, big tech wants the population. They are censoring all the good information
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:19.560]  sources like us and Infowars and Natural News and others, even Zero Hedge, you know, got
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:23.280]  shut down by Twitter. Why? Why are these sources being censored? Because
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:27.240]  big tech wants you to die. They don't want you to understand that there are things you
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:30.720]  can do to defend yourself, to protect yourself. They don't want you to know the truth about
[3:11:30.720 --> 3:11:35.760]  how serious this is. And they certainly don't want you buying masks. Facebook has banned
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:42.600]  ads for masks, which is insane. And the U.S. Surgeon General has said, stop buying masks.
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:46.640]  They don't work, says the Surgeon General, and then followed by, oh, we need them in
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:50.240]  the hospitals because they do work in the hospitals. Wow, those are some really magical
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:54.840]  masks. It's like the magical passport from 9-11, you know, that was found on the sidewalk.
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:59.880]  Somehow survived the massive explosion that brought down ultimately three buildings, but
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:05.080]  you know, one tower at a time. And this passport was found on the sidewalk. And they said,
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:10.080]  oh, this is the identity of one of the hijackers. Wow, that's a magical passport. Well, now
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:14.240]  we have magical masks that don't work when you wear them, but they do work when government
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:21.600]  bureaucrats wear them. So this level of insanity and disinformation is not going to help anybody.
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:27.640]  We need good, honest information, full transparency from the president, from Dr. Fauci, from the
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:31.800]  FDA, from the CDC right now. And if we don't get good, honest information, Trump should
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:37.400]  fire everybody who is lying to America, starting with the head of the CDC. Now, I got to say,
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:43.600]  Dr. Fauci has been saying some very transparent things lately. Just this morning, I believe
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:48.240]  Dr. Fauci said, we've only just begun to see this. This is only the beginning, I think,
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:53.200]  where his words. So that's accurate. Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for saying that. He knows
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:57.480]  where this is going. But the CDC has been lying to people, or at least some people in
[3:12:57.480 --> 3:13:02.920]  the CDC. There's still Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who from time to time says something that's
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:07.960]  incredibly accurate and true. But then she gets accused of being a fearmonger when she
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:11.600]  says, hey, this is coming. You better get the schools ready. You better get the hospitals
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:18.200]  ready. This is coming. She's not wrong about that. So we've got to be able to sort out
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:22.720]  truth from non-truth. But we've got a couple of minutes left. Let's go to a caller right
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.800]  now. I'm sorry I don't know your name, but you're live here with Mike Adams. Go ahead
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:31.080]  with your question or comment. Victor in Europe, I believe. Go ahead, Victor.
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:37.760]  I just want to mention how the vaccines, there won't be a vaccine that will actually work
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:43.040]  because there's too many mutations, just like the common cold. And some of the studies
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:50.280]  that I've read about say that if you get a vaccine for a particular, you know, they
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:54.920]  have to predict what type of the mutation will be occurring in the future. And by the
[3:13:54.920 --> 3:14:00.680]  time that future comes around, it's usually not valid. And then the mutations that aren't
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:06.520]  included in the vaccine will actually be more, make the person more susceptible. That's
[3:14:06.520 --> 3:14:13.000]  number one. And then number two, I've read that some of these test kits actually give
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:19.520]  some false positives and false negatives. And I can't hear you.
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:24.400]  No, you're absolutely right. Everything you've said is right on. The vaccine will probably
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:28.920]  not work. We can't rely on the vaccine. You're correct in saying that the test kits that
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:34.560]  were originally sent out by the CDC on February 5th, they gave false positives and false negatives.
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:40.480]  But the CDC told everybody stop using those kits. So those kits have since been replaced.
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:44.200]  It was a problem with the chemical reagents that were in those kits. So the new kits that
[3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:49.120]  have gone out are now accurate. That's my understanding. And they're being, see what's
[3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:53.520]  happening is that the test kits in the local cities are being done and then samples are
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:58.720]  being sent to the CDC for genetic confirmation of the testing. So you have two stages of
[3:14:58.720 --> 3:15:05.320]  testing. Local hospital does an instant test, which is maybe, I'm guessing 98, 99% accurate.
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:10.280]  And then the CDC confirms it with their gene sequencing analyzers. And then that's a confirmed
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:16.480]  case. So my belief right now, and that's a great point, caller. Thank you, Victor. Thank
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:21.680]  you for asking those questions. My assessment right now is that the tests are accurate now,
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:28.160]  but they were delayed on purpose to allow the virus to spread across America. So now
[3:15:28.160 --> 3:15:34.240]  we're going to see thousands of cases confirmed in America over the next two to three weeks.
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:39.160]  That's what's coming. More of your calls straight ahead. This is Mike Adams here on infowars.com,
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:43.040]  the Alex Jones show. We've got callers lined up with questions and comments. We'll be back
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:51.760]  with all that and much more.

[3:17:53.280 --> 3:18:00.680]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without

[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:08.840]  you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for
[3:18:08.840 --> 3:18:12.880]  the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres. But something I should spend
[3:18:12.880 --> 3:18:19.400]  more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've got that
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:22.840]  pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration,
[3:18:22.840 --> 3:18:27.240]  the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out
[3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:33.840]  there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.

[3:18:51.240 --> 3:18:55.960]  Hannah Meneve, I'm pronouncing that right. What do you think is really going on and thanks
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:18:59.480]  for calling? So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to
[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:04.320]  buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit. And I had my phone,
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:08.920]  I had my show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't using headphones.
[3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:12.840]  This lady starts, she says, who are you listening to? Who's that talking? I said, this is Alex
[3:19:12.840 --> 3:19:17.400]  Jones. And she just got her eyes wide open and she says, really? I thought he was off
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:22.240]  the air. And I said, no. And I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:26.520]  and told her where to go. She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowars.com
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:30.240]  and just said she's still on. I run into people at the grocery store at
[3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:33.960]  the mall on the Hike and Bike Trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you. I wish
[3:19:33.960 --> 3:19:36.560]  you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on
[3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:40.040]  hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations. We have our own streams
[3:19:40.040 --> 3:19:44.120]  at infowars.com and band.video and they go, really? They said you were off the air because
[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:50.840]  they took the platforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform. InfoWars, InfoWars,
[3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:52.600]  InfoWars.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:20:19.600]  Okay, this is Mike Adams here. We're going to continue with calls in just a minute, but
[3:20:19.600 --> 3:20:24.200]  we've got some breaking news. Reportedly, President Trump is now considering making
[3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:30.720]  a national emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which would free up new money
[3:20:30.720 --> 3:20:35.760]  for FEMA. So we would start to see funding for FEMA nationwide. Perhaps FEMA would be
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:42.160]  setting up, well, happy camps, happy fun camps that Hillary Clinton used to describe them.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:47.140]  Look, I suppose, you know, FEMA is going to end up running quarantine centers across
[3:20:47.140 --> 3:20:53.480]  America. Just imagine that. Do you have to turn in your AR-15 to go to a FEMA camp? I
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:58.480]  have no idea. We'll have to see where that goes. But look, on another note, I want to
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:07.640]  say as a Trump supporter, as a patriot, we want a strong response that respects the Constitution
[3:21:07.640 --> 3:21:13.400]  but that stops this virus. We, the people, at least I think most patriots would agree
[3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:20.240]  with me, we're not going to be causing trouble out there if Trump announces a national declaration,
[3:21:20.240 --> 3:21:25.760]  emergency declaration. We support stopping this virus quickly. We would support National
[3:21:25.760 --> 3:21:30.200]  Guard troops if they're helping with testing. We would, like Stuart Rhodes was talking about,
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:36.720]  we would support these troops in a healthcare or emergency medicine type of context. What
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:41.560]  we absolutely will resist is gun confiscation, just so you know. That's not going to fly
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:48.120]  anywhere, anywhere that I can think of. So yeah, we support a national response. We support
[3:21:48.120 --> 3:21:52.960]  the emergency declaration. We support healthcare. We support testing. We support the quarantining
[3:21:52.960 --> 3:21:57.800]  of individuals who are infected. If it's done in a way that respects their civil liberties
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:22:02.720]  and human rights, we absolutely do not support the censorship that's taking place right now
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:10.120]  and any assaults on our Second Amendment, forget it. We will fight to defend the Second
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:17.720]  Amendment, no matter what. And let me be just totally clear, no ambiguity about that. We
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:23.400]  will never give up our Second Amendment rights, not under any emergency, not under any circumstances.
[3:22:23.400 --> 3:22:27.440]  So the governor of Texas, I know, will hear that message loud and clear and he supports
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:31.160]  the Second Amendment and Trump needs to hear that message loud and clear. Don't come for
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:36.680]  our guns or you're going to have a pandemic and other problems on your hands. I'll just
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:41.040]  put it that way. So respect the Second Amendment, respect the Constitution, but let's beat
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:47.480]  this virus. Okay, let's go to Chris in Washington. Chris, yeah, I think Chris is on the line.
[3:22:47.480 --> 3:22:50.760]  I think I've got the name right. Chris, welcome to the show.
[3:22:50.760 --> 3:22:56.920]  Yeah, thanks, Mike. Appreciate. It's great to talk to somebody with your expertise. You
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:23:03.400]  know, I just have a quick question. I wonder why the suppression all the way up to I support
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:09.240]  Trump and I've been a Trump supporter since the minute he started. I don't understand
[3:23:09.240 --> 3:23:15.040]  why he I mean, I understand panic. I get that point. But from your perspective, why is he
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:21.440]  letting the CDC suppress the amount of tests that have actually been done? Like you've
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:28.720]  said, there's a huge suppression being done. Well, I think they did it behind his back
[3:23:28.720 --> 3:23:32.400]  and they did it to try to hurt Trump. And he did not get ahead of it quickly enough
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:39.960]  because I believe Trump wants to protect the stock market because he's tied his reelection
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:45.640]  to the stock market very, very strongly. Does that does that make sense to you?
[3:23:45.640 --> 3:23:50.080]  It does make sense. It makes sense a lot. I just don't see how they could do it. I mean,
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:55.240]  I'm not even a smart guy. I know you're smart. I know he's smart. I don't claim to be smart,
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:24:00.960]  but I'm smart enough to see that there's a huge suppression by the CDC. I mean, you can
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:05.720]  go to their website and see they've only done what, 20-some hundred tests in the whole
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:09.920]  country? Well, you're smart enough to question the
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:13.400]  lies of the establishment. That makes you smarter than about 90% of the country, by the
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:17.480]  way. So consider yourself in the top 10% right there. Look, the stupid people are the ones
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:21.800]  who just believe the system and they're just waiting around for a vaccine that may never
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:26.200]  come and may never work. But you're exactly on point. Thank you there for your call, Chris.
[3:24:26.200 --> 3:24:30.200]  Let's go to Jason in Texas. Jason, you're on the air with Mike Adams. Go ahead with
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:35.680]  your comment or question, please. Hello, Mike. Thank you for taking my call.
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:40.720]  Just wanted to see if you had also heard about the Houston rodeo being canceled, which is
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:48.520]  unprecedented in the city because one of the people that were possibly infected in Montgomery
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:53.280]  County, which is about 40 miles outside of Houston, attended the barbecue festival.
[3:24:53.280 --> 3:24:58.720]  Oh, wow. Do you want to make that comment? No, I had not heard that that was confirmed,
[3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:01.760]  but I'm certainly not surprised to hear that. So you're saying you've got confirmation that
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:05.120]  it's been canceled? Yes, what they're doing is actually shutting
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:10.760]  things down at 4pm on today. They let everybody finish their event. So this is equivalent
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:15.680]  to the South by Southwest being canceled. Wow. Houston by the end of the day will be
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:22.160]  declaring a state of emergency for the city for seven days. They're also getting ready
[3:25:22.160 --> 3:25:28.680]  to cancel the tour to Houston, which is coming up next week as well. I didn't want to make
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:37.160]  one more comment if I can. Yes, go ahead, Jason. Yes, I appreciate you and Stuart Rose
[3:25:37.160 --> 3:25:42.600]  coming out and saying what the people need to hear. I did want to say to the listeners
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:47.400]  and I've been a listener for 10 years that we need to get our mind off of Trump right
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:54.280]  now and get our mind on Jesus Christ to protecting our families because us talking about Trump
[3:25:54.280 --> 3:26:00.640]  and how they're trying to attack him is not going to stop what's already inevitable. Trump
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:05.920]  at this point could be a distraction on us preparing ourselves for something that is
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:11.920]  not could be coming but can. I also want to say to the listeners, look at Exodus 12 and
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:16.320]  I know this is not a religious program, but it comes a time when we have to get our mind
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:23.200]  off of people and start looking at survival. And there is a survival mechanism in us that
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:28.000]  causes us to reach out after something higher than us that is God. So I don't want to tell
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:33.880]  you listeners if they can look at Exodus 12 and look at the similarities of what we need
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:39.560]  to be doing in our own homes and I appreciate you taking my call. Well, Jason, blessings
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:43.400]  to you and the reason I didn't interrupt you is because I think your message is absolutely
[3:26:43.400 --> 3:26:50.640]  critical for this time and I agree with you. You better get right with Jesus Christ and
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:58.320]  you better learn from history that has been described sometimes in advance in the Bible.
[3:26:58.320 --> 3:27:03.440]  We are looking at times that perhaps have already been described in the Bible. I mean,
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:07.600]  I know a lot of different interpretations are out there. I'm not a Bible scholar, but
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:10.920]  you're absolutely right to point that out, Jason. Thank you so much for that important
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:15.560]  message for our time. I'm not even sure Trump will survive this as president, by the way.
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:20.840]  I'm not sure America will survive it, but you know what? Your spirit will survive and
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:25.840]  what you do with your spirit and with your creator, that absolutely matters regardless
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:30.400]  of what happens with our material world or our geopolitical world. Let's go to Vincent
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:34.480]  in Illinois. Vincent, we've got about a minute left. Sorry to keep it short for you, but
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:39.080]  go ahead with your comment or question, please. How much time left? We've got about a minute,
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:44.280]  so go ahead. First of all, thank you so much for all you have done for humanity. Okay.
[3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:48.840]  You're probably the most brilliant persons I've ever come across. That's number one.
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:55.360]  Number two, I'm out of Chicago here, or close to Chicago. WGN Badmouther website called
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:00.120]  them up and scolded them pretty bad. Number three, I want some information about my children.
[3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:06.360]  One of my sons lives in Atlanta, Georgia, thinking about flying. My daughter works at
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:10.560]  a restaurant in Chicago, many restaurants, and I'm worried that she should quit that
[3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:15.840]  job. But anyway, give me some advice. All right. I sure will. And thank you for your
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:20.040]  call, Vincent, and for your question. So I'm going to answer your question on the other
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:24.160]  side of this break that's coming right up here in a few seconds. As I understand it,
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:29.200]  your question is about, you've got family members working in the food industry, restaurant
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:33.560]  industry, and you're wondering what advice should they be hearing right now? The short
[3:28:33.560 --> 3:28:41.160]  answer is there will probably be lockdowns coming from local and state governments very
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:44.760]  soon. So we'll get into that more on the other side of this break. This is Mike Adams, the
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:51.760]  health ranger here. Stay with us much more straight ahead.
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:56.640]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless

[3:29:52.000 --> 3:30:02.080]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:05.480]  to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout-out for your product. So that's SuperBlue
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:09.560]  fluoride free toothpaste, and that SuperBlue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[3:30:09.560 --> 3:30:14.080]  I use the SuperBlue in the morning and then the whitening at night, and it absorbs into
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:18.400]  your gum. It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life. I literally just took
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:22.200]  a turbo course on my way to the gym right now. I've had four shoulder surgeries and
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:26.840]  a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy
[3:30:26.840 --> 3:30:30.200]  or anything that I've ever done in my life, so I just want to get that out of the way.
[3:30:30.200 --> 3:30:33.960]  Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about the Himean Grove. Nobody
[3:30:33.960 --> 3:30:38.760]  knew about Epstein. Nobody knew about Bilderberg. Nobody called 9-11 before it happened. In July
[3:30:38.760 --> 3:30:40.560]  2001, go look it up yourself.
[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:43.960]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here,
[3:30:43.960 --> 3:30:52.400]  but yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:56.640]  I wanted to talk about SuperSilver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[3:30:56.640 --> 3:31:01.160]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[3:31:01.160 --> 3:31:04.200]  I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:09.600]  You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people, SuperSilver whitening
[3:31:09.600 --> 3:31:14.920]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've
[3:31:14.920 --> 3:31:19.640]  tried a lot of different toothpaste, and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference,
[3:31:19.640 --> 3:31:24.040]  the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[3:31:24.040 --> 3:31:28.640]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after
[3:31:28.640 --> 3:31:34.120]  I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are
[3:31:34.120 --> 3:31:39.720]  happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[3:31:39.720 --> 3:31:43.000]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:57.320]  Rich in Alabama, Rich, thanks for calling. Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it. First thing,
[3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:03.600]  I love the turbo force. I drive truck for a living and it's amazing. Coffee kind of
[3:32:03.600 --> 3:32:08.160]  gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing. How is turbo
[3:32:08.160 --> 3:32:14.960]  force different than coffee? I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours.
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:19.960]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee, and it's just, you know, at the end
[3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:25.280]  of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed. I'll, you know, knock out them, I'm
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:29.440]  out cold. Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it,
[3:32:29.440 --> 3:32:34.800]  and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10 hour energy be? Is that possible?
[3:32:34.800 --> 3:32:38.440]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are
[3:32:38.440 --> 3:32:42.600]  healthy and natural that are time released. And there's more money in it than anybody
[3:32:42.600 --> 3:32:47.640]  else puts in our product. So that's why turbo force has such a great effect. And so I really
[3:32:47.640 --> 3:32:55.600]  appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[3:32:55.600 --> 3:33:06.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:06.600 --> 3:33:14.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams. You're listening to the
[3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:22.760]  Alex Jones show. So we have a lot of great colors lined up for you. We're going to go
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:27.400]  to more calls in a second. I just want to finish answering the question from Vincent
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:31.480]  in the last segment. He was asking about, he's got family members who work in the restaurant
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:38.360]  industry. Should they be self quarantining at this time? Honestly, it depends on a lot
[3:33:38.360 --> 3:33:43.360]  of your personal situation. If you have an elderly person at home who has preexisting
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:49.200]  medical conditions, then there is a very high risk of their fatality if you were to bring
[3:33:49.200 --> 3:33:54.000]  an infection home. Even if you yourself as maybe a younger person working in the restaurant
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:58.840]  or I think this caller said his daughter was working in the restaurant, maybe that person
[3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:05.180]  wouldn't have any problem with this virus. Most people do survive. Currently 94% survive
[3:34:05.180 --> 3:34:11.160]  globally according to the world meter.info website. But if you've got an elderly person
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:18.440]  around or someone who's compromised with respiratory dysfunction or high blood pressure or cardiovascular
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:25.440]  disease is also another co factor for mortality risk. So think about that. And also remember
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:31.080]  that you can use antivirals to boost your immune function. You can use, like Gary Haven
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:37.320]  mentioned an hour ago, vitamin C, vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc. He mentioned as things
[3:34:37.320 --> 3:34:41.400]  for just general immune boosting. So let's go to more calls. We've got a lot of great
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:46.520]  colors lined up. John in Virginia, John, you're on the air with Mike Adams. Go ahead, sir,
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:51.160]  with your question or comment. Hey, Mike, actually a first time listener
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:56.960]  of Alex Jones show, I actually was listening to the war room. Oh, I started listening as
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:35:01.080]  early as this week. So it's good to hear some different perspectives.
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:08.080]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, that's because in four is real, you know, people do different
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:12.360]  guests have different perspectives for sure. But yeah, go ahead with your question. Yeah.
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:18.640]  So currently I'm undecided for 2020. But looking ahead to 2024, I think a lot of this
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:25.440]  with the coronavirus has people like AOC who could very well run for president 2024 say,
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:29.640]  this is a reason why we need like Medicare for all. So I just wanted to know what you
[3:35:29.640 --> 3:35:35.080]  would say to someone like someone like that. And then also, should we be concerned about
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:40.040]  a potential AOC running for president in four years, potentially?
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:45.400]  Okay, that's a legit question. I would say first, we have to survive as a nation the
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:50.720]  next year and this coming election. I think we're facing a very dire situation. I'm not
[3:35:50.720 --> 3:35:58.040]  even sure elections will take place on schedule this November. So looking ahead to 2024 is
[3:35:58.040 --> 3:36:03.760]  is pretty, pretty far away right now, given the crisis of what we have right now. AOC,
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:10.480]  I think is not a viable candidate in once she gets the level of scrutiny that would
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:16.040]  be applied to her, you know, in the same way that Joe Biden is not a viable candidate either,
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:20.920]  even though he may be the nominee. Once people start looking at Joe Biden, they just see
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:27.160]  a senile old fool. And with AOC, you know, that level of scrutiny, she's not going to
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:30.360]  be able to to deal with it very well. Not saying she won't run, you're probably right
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:35.560]  about that. She could definitely run maybe another round for Pete Buttigieg as well.
[3:36:35.560 --> 3:36:42.120]  But that assumes we have a functioning United States of America by the time 2024 rolls around.
[3:36:42.120 --> 3:36:44.440]  I'm not even sure we're going to get there. But thank you for your call. Thank you for
[3:36:44.440 --> 3:36:49.400]  being a new listener and for your comments there, John. Let's go to Johnny in Denmark,
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:53.120]  get an international caller in here. Johnny, you're on the air with Mike Adams. Welcome
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:57.920]  to the show. Go ahead with your comments. Hi, Mike. I don't know if you remember from
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:01.920]  last time, congratulations for being part of the top team. I'm going to, in the interest
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.520]  of time, I'm going to just kind of read some notes that if you want to focus on them, I'll
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:10.920]  be happy to elaborate on them. But basically by conscientiously and critically listening
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:17.040]  to our reading and watching for about 12 hours a day now for about the last two months of
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:22.560]  quantitative sources, including but not limited to the X-22 report, which isn't as strong
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:29.720]  as Info Wars, but then again, who is? You, especially Dr. Francis, Professor Dr. Francis
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:36.800]  A. Boyle, Professor Dr. Richard E. Gordon, whom you might not know, but he's a now decades
[3:37:36.800 --> 3:37:47.800]  distinguished, Hippocratic, distinguished and integrative Dr. GP and Professor in Ohio,
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:50.560]  a really good guy in the spirit of Hippocrates and Gallim.
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:53.600]  What are your conclusions then? You've been listening to all these people. What's your
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:59.560]  uptake? You're the upshot, so to speak. Right. The upshot right now. I mean, I've gone back
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:06.720]  and forth on this, but the answer is, I have two things to say about that. It's obviously
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:12.840]  scientifically irreputable that it's a genetically engineered bio weapon. Yes, in conjunction
[3:38:12.840 --> 3:38:17.680]  with some corrupt American scientists. There's no doubt about that. However, I've gone the
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:25.520]  other way as you in terms of intentionality, because I think it was prematurely released.
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:35.920]  And the reason is because they have gone to such extremes in trying to make it spread.
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:40.520]  And still it's not spreading that much. I think you'll find when the dust settles, it's
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:48.360]  going to have basically identical morbidity and mortality characteristics as ordinary
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:55.040]  flow with two major exceptions. One is the incubation period, which ranges from zero
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:03.360]  to minimum to 27 days at a maximum with immediate in a just released paper yesterday of five
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:08.400]  days. So for example, one way in which they spread it is by telling people, oh, you're
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:13.160]  OK if you're quarantined for 14 days. And it's true 97 and a half percent of the cases
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:19.560]  are it is incubated within 14 days. But we know it's at least 27 days. And who knows
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:23.880]  what it is at the outer end? So, you know, do you think Johnny that it's going to you
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:28.400]  think it's going to mutate to a less lethal form? Because right now at 6 percent, that's
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:35.080]  about 60 times more mortality than the seasonal flu. You think it's going to mutate to become
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:39.000]  less lethal? I think that 6 percent figure is the statistical
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:46.040]  artifact based upon a denominator problem. Basically, everyone who's died from it or
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:51.240]  almost everyone who's died from it has been identified as dying from it, but especially
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:56.960]  given the shocking statistic that you cited and I verified that as of Friday, there were
[3:39:56.960 --> 3:40:01.960]  only about 2000 tests in the US. There are a lot more people, especially since it's often
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:09.360]  asymptomatic, that actually happened at where it's included. If there's widespread testing,
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:15.360]  my prediction is and market here, it's going to go down to 0.1 to 0.2 percent. But here's
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:20.080]  why it doesn't matter, because it's 0.1 to 0. Let's just say, argument, though, that
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:28.000]  is 0.1 percent, one per mil. It's 0.1 percent of maybe about 150 million people in the US.
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:32.760]  That's a pretty large number. That's why I said it almost doesn't matter.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:41.760]  I also have a list that I compiled of 13 NWO goals. They've largely been things I compiled
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:47.840]  from Infowars. First of all, I want to say thank you for
[3:40:47.840 --> 3:40:51.560]  your point, and I appreciate the fact that you're approaching this from a mathematical
[3:40:51.560 --> 3:40:57.520]  argument and that it's a rational point that you're making right now. You may end up being
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:02.200]  correct about this. I want to go to more callers, so I don't have time to get into all your
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:06.480]  13 points, but I do appreciate the fact that you're thinking for yourself, you're doing
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:10.120]  your own numbers, you're reaching your own conclusions, and I hope you're right. I hope
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:17.520]  that this ends up being a lot less lethal than even 2 percent. But so far, maybe it's
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:20.640]  too early to tell. When more testing gets done in America, we'll know more.
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:24.400]  So, Johnny, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I do want to give other callers a chance to
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:27.680]  ask their questions and give their comments. They might agree with you, they might disagree.
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:32.680]  Let's go to Ed in Utah and see what Ed's take is on this. Ed, you're live with Mike Adams.
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:33.680]  Go ahead.
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:36.920]  Hey, thanks a lot. Mike, I appreciate you, and all you've done for all of us out here
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:42.960]  in the world. I am wondering about grapeseed oil extract. I've heard that that's a real
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:48.080]  powerful virus killer, or maybe it's grapeseed extract, not the oil.
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:54.120]  Yeah, you're right. GSE is how it's typically known, and it is used in cosmetics, for example,
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:59.360]  in some dietary supplements for its antibacterial properties. But I don't know that that translates
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:09.680]  into antiviral properties. GSE is potent. It tastes very, very tart if you taste it.
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:12.920]  I would put that on the candidates list of something that might work, but probably too
[3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:13.920]  early to tell.
[3:42:13.920 --> 3:42:17.600]  Okay. All right, that's my question. I appreciate your show.
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:22.480]  Okay, awesome. Thank you, Ed. Now, we're going to go to break, and in the segment after this,
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:27.560]  we're going to go to other callers, Jordan, Heath, Chris, Greg, Monica, Debbie, perhaps
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:32.800]  others. A lot of great calls today, a lot of different views and analyses taking place.
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:37.680]  That's what's awesome about this show. This is Mike Adams here for the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:41.680]  Fourth hour today, one more segment ahead. Your calls straight ahead. Stay with us. We'll
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:51.560]  be back with more.
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:57.400]  The evidence is overwhelming. Coronavirus is a manmade bio weapon designed to destroy
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:43:03.440]  nation states, economies and free peoples and usher in a planetary government. This
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:08.600]  is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline today. Fears of global
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:15.400]  coronavirus can take in rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home. And that's just
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:22.520]  in one nation. Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China. The reporting
[3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:31.080]  it could cut their sales in half this year. That's how major this is. Everyone needs to
[3:43:31.080 --> 3:43:38.240]  be prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games. Info wars will continue to report the latest
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:42.680]  information as it comes out, regardless of the fact of the establishment will try to
[3:43:42.680 --> 3:43:47.240]  punish us for telling the truth. We need you to step into the plate and help spread the
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:54.400]  word about band.video and info wars.com today. Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreograph
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:59.520]  nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us he was a major
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:05.080]  globalist operation. Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:09.560]  by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:14.520]  against the populist movement here in America and against info wars. And that means against
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:19.200]  you. So however you're going to do it now is the time to get ready and to get prepared
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:24.480]  with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system. They're
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:29.640]  all at info wars store.com. High quality, horrible food when nobody else has got it.
[3:44:29.640 --> 3:44:36.320]  Super powerful formulas like DNA force plus X two X three bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[3:44:36.320 --> 3:44:41.240]  and our nano silver line of products, a bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of
[3:44:41.240 --> 3:44:46.400]  which is coming back in later this week. So check it all out at info wars store.com and
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:56.680]  get prepared. I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise
[3:44:56.680 --> 3:45:02.040]  that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving
[3:45:02.040 --> 3:45:06.480]  in to sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:10.600]  contributes to greater vitality. And I say that from personal experience because I know
[3:45:10.600 --> 3:45:14.880]  that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:19.240]  day and that power pack that they have the A M P M power pack. Well, I wouldn't be so
[3:45:19.240 --> 3:45:24.680]  energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[3:45:24.680 --> 3:45:28.280]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:32.400]  that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[3:45:32.400 --> 3:45:37.360]  about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:43.920]  yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for
[3:45:43.920 --> 3:45:48.640]  good purpose for our families and for our communities. And right now, folks who are willing
[3:45:48.640 --> 3:46:17.640]  to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[3:46:17.640 --> 3:46:44.680]  That's it.
[3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:51.880]  Trouble food and you actually get them delivered in stock at info or store.com. So get those today
[3:46:55.080 --> 3:46:57.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:20.320]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones and now your host Mike Adams
[3:47:20.320 --> 3:47:28.880]  All right coming to you from Central Texas in my quarantine studio now I am self-quarantined and
[3:47:28.880 --> 3:47:35.200]  that's not a joke and it's not an attack on Trump it's actual it's just common sense now I do
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:41.440]  understand that the Democrats want to use this to hurt Trump they want it to be bad they want to
[3:47:41.440 --> 3:47:48.640]  crash the US economy they want Trump to fail but all of those facts of what the Democrats want that
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:54.640]  does not mean that this virus isn't real it's like I I shared with Alex in studio I don't know
[3:47:54.640 --> 3:48:01.280]  Saturday or Sunday whatever it was I said look you look at 9 11 the first two towers were really
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:07.360]  hit by airplanes those were real planes not holograms the two towers came down and then the
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:13.600]  globalists they used demolition to bring down the third building WTC 7 because they had pre-planned
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:18.160]  it it was an engineered event and then they rolled out expanded surveillance and Patriot Act
[3:48:18.160 --> 3:48:24.560]  powers to spy on well in the future Trump you know and Trump Trump officials and then they ran the
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:31.200]  entire spy gate scam on Trump using the powers that they they gained in the aftermath of 9 11
[3:48:31.840 --> 3:48:36.960]  the same thing is happening right now the virus is real but the globalists are trying to use it
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:43.120]  to create global scale events of depopulation the destruction of Trump and the destruction
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:48.720]  of America so don't think this isn't real it's real but the globalists will use it to try to
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:55.840]  destroy the rising patriotism and nationalism of pro-trump America that's my take on it
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:01.040]  let's continue with collars let's go to Jordan in Oregon Jordan you're live with Mike Adams
[3:49:01.040 --> 3:49:07.280]  go ahead with your comment or question hey Mike a longtime follower of you really appreciate your
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:13.200]  work thank you touch on some before I get into my point Johnny the collars says that if we would
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:17.840]  have tested more people the kill rate would be much lower I disagree because they didn't test
[3:49:17.840 --> 3:49:22.000]  a lot of people that probably died of the coronavirus that pneumonia or whatever in the
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:28.640]  hospital correct yeah I'm glad you pointed that out a lot of people have died across America
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:32.320]  right now and they're labeled pneumonia not coronavirus so you're correct about that point
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:38.080]  exactly that nullifies that point now we need to throw a wrench in the gears of the globalist
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:43.360]  I'm in agreement in 99% of you Gary and Stuart and I'm also in agreement with Alex and Owen
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:48.800]  one of the points that Alex and Owen would have would well we they've already harvested this
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:54.720]  bio weapon so if we allow them to shut down America without there being justice and going
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:49:59.200]  after the people that caused this problem then all they have to do is release a bio weapon
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:05.280]  every year and shut down America now to add to that the deep states are already three steps ahead
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.080]  of us while we spend all this time exposing what they've done they've already got the next 911
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:14.960]  they're going to throw Trump launch bio weapon drop a nuke we can't absorb their attacks we've
[3:50:14.960 --> 3:50:19.920]  got to get ahead of them Mike now the way Trump can do this and he can come out with the proof in
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:27.040]  the documents that Obama released the virus to China China released it intentionally or accidentally
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:34.800]  it takes the blame off Trump it puts the focus on the guilty now a way to cure the virus and the
[3:50:34.800 --> 3:50:39.200]  deep state is to quarantine America like you're saying but at the same time if we're going to
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:43.600]  give up our rights we need to quarantine the deep state the people that are guilty we need to have
[3:50:43.600 --> 3:50:48.880]  extreme risk people high risk people medium risk people the military needs to round them up if
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:52.800]  we're all going to give up our rights and let them crash our economy then we need to stop them
[3:50:52.800 --> 3:50:57.200]  from doing it again they're going to release another bio weapon we have to realize that and come
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:02.480]  to that point Jordan it's like you're reading my mind what a great caller and by the way I'm
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:06.240]  going to let you speak some more here Jordan but just some quick comments I actually had notes here
[3:51:06.240 --> 3:51:13.040]  that said I meant to cover this that this is just a softening up operation this is just wave one man
[3:51:13.040 --> 3:51:17.200]  they've got more things coming this is just to make America weak so they can launch the the major
[3:51:17.200 --> 3:51:22.800]  attack on America which could be an EMP weapon another bio weapon another economic attack
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:27.360]  assassinations who knows and I agree with you Jordan maybe Trump could use this as an opportunity
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:32.240]  to go arrest the deep state traders who should have been arrested six months ago continue Jordan
[3:51:32.240 --> 3:51:37.680]  you've got great points you've got the floor yes so if we're going to sit at home for a month in
[3:51:37.680 --> 3:51:42.560]  America and wonder about our kids future we'd like to see people that have their fingerprints on this
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:48.160]  held accountable round them up investigate them before you you know give them their rights but
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:53.600]  investigate see if they have their fingerprints on this now we can kill five birds with one film we
[3:51:53.600 --> 3:51:58.800]  can stop the virus we can stop future viruses we can drain the swamp we can hold the guilty
[3:51:58.800 --> 3:52:05.200]  accountable and we can ship the blame on who needs to blame which is China and the deep state along
[3:52:05.200 --> 3:52:11.280]  with Obama yes now Trump needs to quit playing politics and speak clear and simple I'm a huge
[3:52:11.280 --> 3:52:16.480]  Trump supporter but I'm a huge critic I don't like being talked to like I'm stupid you need to come
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:22.560]  out and quit playing politics it's way too serious to play politics if people can't grow up and too
[3:52:22.560 --> 3:52:28.880]  bad it's something that we face and we have to we have to step up to our kids and this country
[3:52:28.880 --> 3:52:33.520]  in the world has a future well I think you just nailed it Jordan Trump needs to get ahead of this
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:39.200]  and he needs to now announce what are the origins who's behind this it's another deep state attack
[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:43.840]  it's an engineered weapon against America and he needs to make the arrests of those who are
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:47.760]  responsible at least start the investigations and then maybe have indictments when the evidence
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:53.600]  supports it I agree with you Jordan great call let's go to Heath in Louisiana Heath you've you've
[3:52:53.600 --> 3:52:57.520]  been listening to these calls maybe you have comments on those previous callers or you have
[3:52:57.520 --> 3:53:03.360]  your own comments but you're live now Heath let's hear from you yeah I've been listening to everybody
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:07.840]  you know their intakes on everything you know when it comes to the coronavirus you know since the
[3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:13.440]  beginning of time you know our bodies are meant to be vessels for God and we're made in his image
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:18.560]  and the devil knows that so from generation to generation the truth has been passed down but
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:23.840]  also amongst that lies have been passed down and one of the devices that the devil likes to use
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:29.920]  is repetition and throughout times he has been using repetition through music movies and media
[3:53:29.920 --> 3:53:34.320]  and in the media they keep constantly talking about the same thing over and over using circular
[3:53:34.320 --> 3:53:39.760]  reasoning to explain nothing to waste our time our value and our money and with all the things
[3:53:39.760 --> 3:53:43.760]  that they are being pushing and using all this propaganda and stuff like that they have the
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:48.240]  weight and the ability to manipulate people's minds on how they can approach the coronavirus
[3:53:48.240 --> 3:53:52.480]  you see with how do you think they're using that power right now what's what's their message right
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:53:57.440]  now or right now you know like earlier when you were talking about how you know we need to
[3:53:57.440 --> 3:54:03.040]  lockdown and keep safe and be you know controlled you know the whole situation and all that
[3:54:03.040 --> 3:54:08.240]  they already know that and they want it to break out to where everyone can get infected
[3:54:08.240 --> 3:54:13.040]  so they can control them even more and make them accept you know whatever agenda that
[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:19.280]  they're trying to push that's what I believe out of that and besides that I do have a question for
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:25.520]  you a few months ago um Alex and y'all y'all were all talking about how um they were doing naval
[3:54:25.520 --> 3:54:31.600]  training Russia China and Iran in the in the season stuff to try to uh practice and all that kind of
[3:54:31.600 --> 3:54:37.200]  stuff whenever the general Solomoni got killed and then literally a few weeks later the virus started
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:42.560]  to accumulate more and more and it just so happened that Russia was able to stop their borders at a
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:47.520]  certain time and stuff like that and the way Iran's invading Greece and stuff like that it's just
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:52.880]  really speculative to me and I was going to ask you if you think that they're able to use suicide
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:58.880]  bombers wouldn't they be able to just send anybody in with the virus as well well yeah absolutely in
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:06.000]  fact I I described that here on info wars weeks ago and I believe that's happened I believe that
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:11.040]  the reason this is spreading so aggressively across american cities is not just by chance I think
[3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:18.240]  it's deliberate I think that probably China maybe Iran harvested it had quote suicide bombers you
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:23.520]  know biological suicide people infected deliberately and before they started to show symptoms they were
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:28.640]  able to get past airport security they flew them into us cities to spread this all across the
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:34.640]  united states I think that's already happened uh so you're right on the money this is this is
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:38.640]  happening look let's go to some more callers we've got a lot of great callers today chris in
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:43.440]  florida you're on the air with mike Adams chris uh go ahead nice to have you on the show oh chris
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:48.880]  dropped off let's go to greg and montana uh greg if you're on if you're on the phone you're live
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:53.920]  yep hi mike thank you very much for taking my call i've got several points if i can
[3:55:53.920 --> 3:56:02.880]  rush through them the first is march 11th 2004 uh mcdrid train station bombing 200 killed
[3:56:02.880 --> 3:56:10.000]  2000 wounded i think that they've self revealed by using this date again yep yep the date again
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:13.520]  the globalists believe in the dates they they like the numbers to line up they keep doing it
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:18.400]  and what are the other points i think the main thing i'd like to say is
[3:56:18.400 --> 3:56:25.040]  is trump will be reelected if he uses this as a come to god moment for the nation
[3:56:26.080 --> 3:56:33.200]  and tries to lead the country back to god well i agree with you
[3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:41.200]  his only culprit he's in the position to do it yes if we pray for him i think he will
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:47.120]  all right let's pray for trump to to really get on top of this take a leadership role
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:52.160]  and let's no longer hear mike penn's telling us this is just the flu or something like that i mean
[3:56:52.160 --> 3:56:56.960]  give me a break come on this is way worse than the flu good good points greg uh from montana

[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:25.760]  than anything i predicted and probably some lockdowns are coming to certain states and
