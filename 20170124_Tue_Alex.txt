[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  It's not a real one, Chevy.
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000]  Wow.
[00:10.000 --> 00:20.000]  24 days in.
[00:20.000 --> 00:29.000]  From the Infowars.com News Center.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  Deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:46.000 --> 01:03.000]  You want it, baby. You're about to get it.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Will these dreams still fire on me?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  I don't want the truth.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Day 24 of 2017 and day four of the Trump era.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  Will it succeed wildly or crash and burn in disaster?
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  And World War.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  That will be determined by us.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  But we hold our destinies in our hands.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  This gift from God.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  The gift of free will.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  Hard to believe the first month of 2017 is already long in the tooth.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I am burning inside for freedom
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  and burning inside to crush the tyrants.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  Our spirit is infinitely stronger than theirs.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  We have to have the will to turn our strength loose against the enemy.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  It is Tuesday as I said the 24th of day of January 2017.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  I do want to open the phones up a lot today.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  We have several guests as well, but there's so much info
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  that I tend to perseverate on one topic or the other
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  and not get to the body of the news and not get to your calls.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  But I really want to get your view on four days in.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  Trump is spectacularly delivering.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  Unless you read disinformation mainstream news
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  that is misrepresenting what's going on.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  Day four, he has done more for this country than Obama did in eight years.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  But of course Obama was working against us.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  He has done more for this country than Bush did in just a few days.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  And they are absolutely supercharging the revolution against the establishment
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  and a new renaissance.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  Poll Americans are more hopeful than negative after inauguration.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Remember Gallup and others have been using skewed results
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  so they're even having trouble holding down the fact that optimism is exploding.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  The polls are fake, it's much higher.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  Also not satire, politician keeps his campaign promise, a Kit Daniels article.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  Trump targets three agencies with ambitious budget cuts,
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  announces federal hiring freeze,
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  globalist cringe at TPP torpedoing, he signed an executive order with drawing
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  He signs an executive order blocking the forced individual mandate,
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  basically killing Obamacare.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  It goes on and on and on and we're into day four.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  It's been roughly four days, you could say day five.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  Counting the weekend he worked over.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  So day four, day five, only part of Friday.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  Fox News had a countdown that was one day added counting election day as one more day.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  Everybody else like Google had one last day.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  I think we should probably establish ourselves what day of the presidency this really is.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  I think you can count Friday as the first day.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  You got a lot done that day, Saturday, Sunday.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  So Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  That's four days, but now we're into day five.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  So you have to say in five days he's done this much.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  It's all apples and oranges, but this is big.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  The panicking social engineers, as we saw in the WikiLeaks,
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  have decided to go all in on the race baiting,
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  and they're now going to do it publicly.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  And I noticed the minions of this system take their marching orders very, very directly
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  and very, very dutifully, doggedly.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  That's why I was screamed at.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  You're an effing white male hundreds of times by mainly white women.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  But now, white candidate for DNC chair says her job will be to shut down other white people.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  There's actual video of this.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  You name it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  When we come back, we're going to play this and a lot more.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  I mean, this is wild.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  This is wild.
[04:59.000 --> 05:28.000]  This is Owen Shroyer for infowars.com, and I met so many amazing people at the inauguration and on this journey to make America great again and get Donald Trump in the White House.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  It's so palpable that it makes you the ugliest person in the room.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  And if you don't come off your self-made soapbox now, you will soon be the most lonely, desperate, desolate people on Earth.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  Donald Trump is your president.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  The reality is Donald Trump is the president, America elected him, and we're here to make America great again.
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  Make planet Earth great again, expose the fake news media, and change the world.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  You can either join us or be a humorous footnote in world history.
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  Thanks to everyone so much for the love shown over the course of this journey.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Donald Trump is our president.
[05:59.000 --> 06:28.000]  Now let's get to work.
[06:29.000 --> 06:57.000]  Let's get to work.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:28.000 --> 07:36.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research that puts together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike Turex herbal processing technique.
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[07:50.000 --> 07:58.000]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com.
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[08:05.000 --> 08:20.000]  It's not true. That's impossible.
[08:20.000 --> 08:37.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  The raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, the 24th day of January 2017.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  We're now in the day number five, but it's still got a lot of time left in it.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  And Trump is delivering on, I would say already, about 10% of his promises.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  That's unbelievable. If he got 10% of the agenda done in one year,
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  if it took him a year to get rid of Obamacare, or a year to begin to secure the border,
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  or a year to bring back Ford and Carrier and Chrysler and Foxcom,
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  I mean, I would be blown away at saying this is positive.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  This just shows how controlled the federal government was by multinationals,
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  by Communist China, by the IMF, the World Bank. And that's why China's announcing
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  that the United States is pulling out of the world government project,
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  that they're going to be taking it over. Good luck.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  The whole thing's parasitic, the whole thing's criminal.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  The whole world is turning against multinational corporations using Chinese slave muscle
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  to leverage out the planet. And Trump knows that.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  And Trump also knows that it's a sure thing to expose globalism as unelected and unaccountable.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  You do that, it's over. And to expose replacing humans with robots
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  and building a world where humans are obsolete is horrific.
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  Trump wants to build a world for people, for the people, by the people, of the people.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  And that's revolutionary because that's the opposite of the globalist plan
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  that we've been breaking down for so many years.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  And why does the military listen? Why do the intelligence operatives listen?
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  Why is the president listen? Because they tune into the show,
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  they're hearing information that they already have researched, they already know.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  And that they have already been resisting for a long time.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's just the public wasn't ready or informed enough yet to do it.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  But info wars and drudge and many others have now informed the public.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  And the public has experienced global turning for themselves.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  And so now the ground is ready and fertile.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  For the second American revolution that will be worldwide,
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  America will alter the destiny of the world for good
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  if we go down this path as Trump said in his speech.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  1776 worldwide, not the United States dominating via conquest
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  and then handing the spoils over to multinationals.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  We pay for it, do the fighting, the bleeding and then give it to them. No.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  But exporting ideas worldwide and forming new alliances and trade.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  Everything Ron Paul has called for and wanted as well.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  That's why when Ron Paul, who's coming on tomorrow, gets into, you know,
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  Trump's really good about not wanting war with Russia and all this
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  and not being a globalist, but what's he doing with Mattis bombing Al Qaeda and ISIS?
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Well, we have to. It's what's causing the war.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  It's expanding. It's growing. It's truly a cancerous, oppressive threat.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  So again, like the Bible is taken out of context, mistranslated, they admit that.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  They'll shall not kill. But then a few passages later says defend yourself and your family.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  Means do not murder, do not kill an innocent person.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  Obviously to be anti-war means you're against starting wars, being for war for no reason.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  But standing up against ISIS or standing up against King George III,
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  that wasn't warmongering by towards Washington, Benjamin Franklin,
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, that was being liberated against a tyranny
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  and launching a system that we enjoy the fruits of and the freedoms of today.
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  So I love America. I hated the globalist criminal overlay that was on our country.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  And I'm trying to remove that face sucker that was attached to our nation.
[13:10.000 --> 13:19.000]  Now, we're going to break down how Trump is delivering in a royal flush, again, just four and a half days in.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  We're also going to look at the newest globalist brainwashing term.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  They call it alternative facts or challenging them.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  So first it's conspiracy theorists, then they call you a racist, then they call you a Russian spy,
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  then they call you fake news. And now, oh, Spicer has alternative facts.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  And Leon last night was really upset. Just like she said, she was on air and she was just shaking her head.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  I saw her in the wardrobe area, kind of talking to herself and I walked through talking to her.
[13:50.000 --> 13:59.000]  She said, I'm really freaked out. I mean, I saw CNN put out the fake photo that nobody was at the Trump inauguration.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  And then I saw their own digital megapixel photo showing it was completely full.
[14:07.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then I saw them have to admit it wasn't true. And then I was at the gym Sunday and saw them again live say that nobody was there again.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  And she said, that upsets me. Everybody saw it on national TV full of people. Everybody knows that's a liar.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  It should be. But I was arguing with people and they were saying I was wrong and she was so upset for them.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  And you know what? That's a normal response to be freaked out by lies of this magnitude.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  So what's CNN doing now? I saw them yesterday again.
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  They're saying Trump and Spicer and everybody are a bunch of sore losers and that we're all just obsessed with things when they're the sore losers.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  And that we're making it up that it was a smaller crowd.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  The issue is the Metro shows record numbers. You have people outside all the gates trying to stop people getting in.
[14:52.000 --> 15:03.000]  You show at 8.30 in the morning photo and people were just being allowed in before they filled up because there were lines three miles long to get in.
[15:03.000 --> 15:12.000]  And Obama who ran the Capitol Police had a plan to not let people in and then to let the protesters beat people up.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  So what do they do?
[15:13.000 --> 15:23.000]  I have footage live hours of women being beaten up and attacked and them blocking us from trying to get into three different entrances.
[15:23.000 --> 15:31.000]  So I had to travel miles around Pennsylvania Avenue to find one entrance to get in and because you're only allowed to go into certain entrances with your tickets.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  And guess what was happening there again? People trying to block the entrance.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  Now what did the media do with this? What did they do?
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  I need to do a whole report on this.
[15:45.000 --> 16:01.000]  They had everything from MSNBC to ABC to CBS running with stories that that day I was thrown out and they show video.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  In fact, if we can actually go to this article, it shows a photo from Cleveland saying that I basically got arrested.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  Look, look, January 22, 2017. No, that happened in July of 2016.
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  They were escorting me for my protection when a bunch of communists attacked me saying I had no free speech.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  But not in the disinformation land.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  I got calls. I had my lawyer call me.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  He heard on the radio that I had been thrown out of the Trump inauguration and caused a disturbance.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  I can't even keep track of all this.
[16:31.000 --> 16:42.000]  I'm trying to get in. I'm attacked as I'm walking towards it. There's bleeding women walking by on our Facebook mentions live.
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  And they're telling me I'm bleeding. They attacked me. They won't let you through. The police do nothing.
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  I'm like, really? We get there and they attack us.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  The police come and grab us again and say you're not allowed. We've closed this entrance.
[16:55.000 --> 17:02.000]  And then it turns into I'm arrested again. But wait, it's better. I'm also drunk, they say.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  Had that a drink.
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  And they make a big joke out of it. This is called praying on the public.
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  Here's one from the Inquisitor.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  Informer's house Alex Jones caught doing his job while being drunk.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  And they just show some image of me supposed to be arrested.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  Alex Jones is having a bad inauguration day.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  And it just goes into how I wasn't allowed in and how great that is.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  And then it turns into this. That's from the New Republic.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Then there's this.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  Alex Jones gets kicked out of Donald Trump's inauguration video.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  And you go watch the video.
[17:39.000 --> 17:46.000]  And it's communist and black lives matter and black block groups attacking me.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  This is the fake news.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  It's totally insane.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  And here's the deal.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  I know what really happened.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  You can go watch the live feeds and see what happened.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  They don't care.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  They've gone on TV and radio and everywhere and said that I got thrown out.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  I was drunk.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  And that it's all cute and funny.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  And then it gets worse.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  They just say, oh, Martin Luther King's bus has been removed.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  There's media still reporting that.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  Not true.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  They say, oh, yeah, that was very small crowd.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Just a few thousand people there for Trump.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  Here's a photo of Trump during the inauguration.
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  And it shows, again, images of right when they first opened the gates and start
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  letting people go through the metal detectors.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  This is how they deceive you on MSNBC, BBC.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  They all did it.
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  They all do it.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  And then let's show you from CNN's real megapixel photo.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  They debunked themselves from on top of the Capitol.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Let's show you what was really there.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  Let's zoom miles, miles down to that.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  And then there's photos from above.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  The crowds continued on from there, even though you couldn't get through the makeshift entrances
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  they put up with metal detectors.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  By the way, it's admitted, but I was there when I came out after the inauguration.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  There were still huge lines of people upset.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  They didn't get to get in.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Now, why am I going back to this?
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, we're dealing with people that are consciously defrauding
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  the public and criminally colluding together to lie to everyone.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  And then Spicer, who's getting more hardcore, so I'm commending that, gets up there and
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  they say he's a liar and that it's true.
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  And then CNN doubles down and shows the same 8.30 in the morning photo and says,
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  see, it's true.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  And then shows Obama's next to it.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  He put that on screen where they wipe it and show and lie to everybody.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  I've got all this news to cover, but I've got to go back to this because it's so important.
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.000]  I have to field calls from family and my lawyer and others who hear that I was thrown out by
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  Trump when it's totally a lie.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  This is what they do.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[20:06.000 --> 20:12.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.000]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  Polistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.

[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand in case of an emergency.

[23:56.000 --> 24:18.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here live.
[24:18.000 --> 24:29.000]  If you're a radio listener, I know this is kind of torturous as you hear me describing photos and images to a radio audience,
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  but everybody's pretty much already seen this for days online.
[24:32.000 --> 24:42.000]  We're going to produce another HD video today, a special report because more huge, huge megapixel photos have been released.
[24:42.000 --> 24:51.000]  There's also overhead photos just showing how the crowds were trying to get in even during the swearing out of the president and couldn't get in
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  because horrible Soros-funded communists were attacking people outside, but it doesn't matter.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  What do you do when they attack people?
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  What do you do?
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  Well, I'll tell you what you do.
[25:05.000 --> 25:15.000]  You simply claim, oh, Alex Jones was thrown out of the inauguration for being bad, and then you show video of people shoving and attacking me.
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.000]  When I was trying to get through to, oh, they lie and say, oh, Jones failed to.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  No, once we broke through, the police had closed the entrance, so we went to another entrance and broke through.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  The police wouldn't help anybody.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  And guess what?
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  That was closed.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  We went to another entrance, broke through.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  That was closed.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  We watched it live on Facebook mentions.
[25:36.000 --> 25:45.000]  People hitting, punching, grabbing you, getting in your face, doing all of this as you try to simply get in.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  And this is just footage of me just trying to walk down the street.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  This isn't even the footage of me that the crews found.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  There's hours of this when I was actually trying to break through.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  This is just walking down the street.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  People, men, women, children, just anywhere basically in DC trying to get in to the lines to get in.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  But they just say we're out there assaulting them.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  Just like they say, there was no one there to see Trump.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  There was nobody there.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  He grabbed the Martin Luther King statue and threw it out the window.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  Just the minute he got there, he just ran over and grabbed it and ran off with it and threw it in the garbage can.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  You know, I had seats so close to the podium that I couldn't really see Trump.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  So I got up and walked back about 60 yards.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  I described this a few days ago.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  I didn't know they could actually find me in the crowd.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  And I got there and I could get a good view of him standing up behind the production equipment.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  But they wouldn't let you stand in areas except behind the production equipment.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  So they show brown spots where, oh look, there aren't people.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Well, that's because just like at a rock concert, they wouldn't let you stand there.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  So see, they used this deception looking, look, there's openings in the crowd.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  It wasn't even full.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  Yeah, because they had security guards every 10 feet and wouldn't let you.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  And only because the security guard knew who I was, did they even let me stand there where I could see the president.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  Because again, the Capitol wasn't built so you could, you know, sit there with this bigger crowd and be able to watch somebody get a speech.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  I mean, if you're 100 yards away, you can barely see the president.
[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  Again, I was like 30 yards and I couldn't see because I was up against the podium where you're just looking up.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  But this is the deception, folks.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  CNN, Associated Press, BBC, they all show the same garbage, all planned.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  Oh, look, they put it out that day.
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  Oh, look, here's Obama, 19, 2008.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  Here, let's show that first.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  Here's 2008, totally, completely jam-packed overflow.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Yeah, because they didn't put fences up.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  People were just allowed to come in and they weren't physically attacked.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  But now look at the crowd.
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  It's all in a box.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  It's all in a rectangle.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  And it's not as big.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  Yeah, because you just opened the gates.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  It's in the morning.
[27:57.000 --> 28:09.000]  And again, I keep hammering this, but this is catching them just like with the fake polls or just like with all the other lies or PP gate or just the hundreds of other lies that we caught them red-handed in the WikiLeaks.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  And then you actually are there and you're being attacked by communists and they're screaming at you.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Thousands of women, mainly.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  You're an effing white male and then attacking you, kissing, screaming, cussing.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  We can't even play it because it's just F, F, F, F, F, F, F.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  You've got 200 people around you just asking, you hate you, white man, I'll kill you.
[28:33.000 --> 28:44.000]  And meanwhile, it's on the street now, white candidate for DNC chair says her job will be to quote, shut other white people down.
[28:44.000 --> 28:52.000]  The essence of racketeering, the essence of race crime, the essence of racially targeting people.
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  This is 110% KKK talk from the 1920s.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  We're going to shut down the black people and not let them, you know, have a voice.
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  And just like the weird green party people and Merkel's party and others over in Germany, when they get up and go,
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  it is good we bring in adverbs, white people are bad, women give themselves to them, wear the hot jib, let them rape you.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  I'm not kidding, this is in the news. This is in the news just yesterday.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  It's the same thing here.
[29:18.000 --> 29:25.000]  I am white, but you need to elect me on a racially based, not that I'll do the best job for you or represent you.
[29:25.000 --> 29:33.000]  No, I'm white. The reason you need to vote for me over the other black lady is I'm going to really suppress white people.
[29:33.000 --> 29:44.000]  Okay. Okay. I mean, I promise this is 100% certified blue ribbon panel racism by the people that claim they're fighting racism.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  They are just a despicable criminal group.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  There's not words to describe these people.
[29:50.000 --> 30:01.000]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:08.000]  Well, it's no secret that Hillary Clinton is the one that coined the term deplorables and that we stole it ran with it and now owned it.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  But let's recap some of the behavior we saw over the past election and at the inauguration.
[30:13.000 --> 30:23.000]  People protesting Trump were assaulting reporters, burning limos, smashing buildings, throwing stink bombs, disrupting the inauguration and other events that were happening,
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  blocking streets, cursing at reporters.
[30:26.000 --> 30:36.000]  At the women's march, you had people on the stage cursing repeatedly, talking about fallatio on air, saying Trump can fallatio himself, threatening to bomb the White House,
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  wearing pussy hats, spitting on people.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  How about all the assassination threats we've seen on Twitter?
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  I'm not seeing any of that from Trump supporters, so after all, who are the real deplorables?
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  When they go low, they go really, really low.
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[30:56.000 --> 31:23.000]  Real news, fake deplorable.

[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.

[32:59.000 --> 33:07.000]  It's amazing.
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  We've now entered day five.
[33:09.000 --> 33:11.000]  Already globalism is collapsing.
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  It's been said many a time.
[33:23.000 --> 33:31.000]  And in my experience, that statement, the truth is stranger than fiction is one of the truest ever said.
[33:31.000 --> 33:39.000]  Now the crew was making a point to me and I always asked them to make a point, you know, they think I'm off track.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  And it's not that I'm off track because it's more of like a nigma within a riddle.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  We've got to cover lying and saying he took out the Martin Luther King bust.
[33:49.000 --> 33:57.000]  We've got to counter them saying there was a tiny crowd and then being caught lying about it and still coming back again and saying no, Trump's wrong.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  These photos are from during his inauguration.
[34:00.000 --> 34:10.000]  Just incredible disdain and the linked up corporate media CNN with the BBC, ABC News, MSNBC.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  But the crew is pretty much unanimously making the point. This is a distraction and they keep it going.
[34:16.000 --> 34:25.000]  Even though they're losing the argument because they want to divert from the legendary developments of pulling out of the TPP because it's unelected.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  It's secret.
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  It transfers our power.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  Don't even argue and say it's good or bad.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  It's unelected.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  It's a transfer of our sovereignty.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  This globalism stinks and it's unconstitutional.
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  Trump abandons trans specific partnership.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  Obama's signature trade deal.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  It's not a trade deal.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  New York Times fake news.
[34:48.000 --> 34:58.000]  So I think I'm right to cover and harp on their fake news to fully discredit them so people know their tricks, but it's only worth it.
[34:58.000 --> 35:08.000]  If I explain as they just did, it's still a diversion from the larger issue of them distracting us.
[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  That's why I will only cover attack pieces against myself when it's educational and people can learn how they operate.
[35:16.000 --> 35:25.000]  I mean, how do you go out and claim you're democratic and liberal and loving and then scream you're an effing white male and attack women in Hispanic, Asian and black women?
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  By the way, they didn't care.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  You're trying to go into the Trump inauguration.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  Maybe you just wanted to go see it.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  Maybe you're a Democrat, but you wanted to go see history.
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  It didn't matter.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  They were attacking people.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  Again, I wasn't looking for trouble.
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  I'm out there trying to get my credentials at 10 in the morning knowing there's big lines.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  I've got to get in Friday.
[35:46.000 --> 35:55.000]  I'm standing there because they have a cabbie, you know, delivering the documents to us.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  And I'm out there and all of a sudden I see people attacking folks trying to come down the street.
[36:00.000 --> 36:07.000]  People with black masks on and I'm like, what's going on cops do something, then women start coming down the road this way from 200 yards down where there's an entrance.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  Not to see a big crowd here screaming.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  I can't really tell what's going on.
[36:12.000 --> 36:22.000]  And these women walk up bleeding and some almost unable to walk.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  And what's crazy is there's one TMZ clip that just shows an altercation where two women are attacking a guy and also two anarchists.
[36:32.000 --> 36:39.000]  So he fights back when we just have endless footage of live streams of stuff 10 times worse from the live event.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  None of it on info wars.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  None of it promoted.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  None of it anywhere.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  And I'm not bitching at the crew.
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  It's just that I'm just there witnessing all of this craziness that was so over the top.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  I mean, they would attack women, you name it.
[36:56.000 --> 37:13.000]  And then the media spins it into I was thrown out of the inauguration and that I was drunk and that I was attacking people.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  This is the type of garbage that we deal with.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  And it really tells you the mindset of these people, they will do anything.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  You know, Democrats, if they were able to take over and said, let's arrest Alex Jones, let's arrest Ron Paul, let's arrest Donald Trump.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  Let's go crazy.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  They would love it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  They would love to see me publicly hanged from my views.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  Hell, they call for our death.
[37:36.000 --> 37:43.000]  That's how deranged and authoritarian these people are.
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.000]  And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times, women would come over and scream, you're an effing white male like the N word.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  Like you're such and such and you're not valued.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  You don't get to speak because you're an effing white male.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  And now this is up on info wars.com.
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  White candidate for DNC chair says her job will be to shut down other white people.
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.000]  My job is to shut down other white people when they want to say, oh, no, I'm not prejudiced.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  I'm a Democrat.
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  I'm accepting because you're not ever allowed to say I'm not racist.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  I'm accepting because it never ends.
[38:20.000 --> 38:30.000]  You've got to submit to whatever you're told and whatever you do by people that are in a race cult and who are using racial classic race based politics, tribal based politics to take over.
[38:30.000 --> 38:45.000]  And it's a bunch of freaky, weird, old, creepy criminal white people that are actually leading the war against the West and white people and trying to make sure that the whole world doesn't ever adopt the values of freedom.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  They're inoculating them psychologically so that they can never have the birthright.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  Excuse me, Matt.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  Yes, we're going to go to that clip.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  Here it is.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  Black lives matter.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  And it makes me sad that we're even having that conversation.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  And that tells me that white leaders in our party have failed.
[39:07.000 --> 39:17.000]  We have to accept that there is prejudice that exists within our own party and we have to be able to have that.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  We cannot sweep that under the rug.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  We cannot continue to hide it.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  We cannot smash voices down when they are trying to scream, listen to me.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  You don't get it.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'm a white woman.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  I don't get it.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  It paused.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  Back in a minute, there's another part of the clip.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  Bernie Sanders, what the hell are you talking about?
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  I'm white.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  I'm sorry.
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  I'm inherently bad.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  I can never get it.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  I can never be good.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  I need to accept whatever George Soros' policies are or I'm a racist.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  I need to accept Obamacare or I'm a racist.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  I need to accept open borders or I'm a racist.
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.000]  We've got a clip on Fox News where they say American white people are bad, the liberal guest.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  That's why we have to have open borders.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Really, I thought we'd have people coming to the country who want to work and be part of the nation.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  No, no, no.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  You only come to prove white people bad.
[40:09.000 --> 40:18.000]  See, it's a whole religion of conquest, but it's the bankers that are conquering you and people like Zuckerberg of Facebook
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  building a 700-acre mansion compound in Hawaii while he uses race politics to leave us here in the rear
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  all fighting with each other like idiots.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  Let's go back to her.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  I'm sorry.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  I'm white.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  I don't know.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  I don't know.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  You need me here.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  Let's go back to her.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  It's an honor to be here today to have the conversation.
[40:38.000 --> 40:47.000]  I am so excited that we're here and I am listening because that's my job is to listen to the issues.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  My job is to listen and be a voice.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  And my job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  My job is to shut other white people down when they want to say, oh, no, I'm not prejudiced.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  I'm a Democrat.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  I'm accepting.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  My job is to make sure that they get, that they have privilege.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  We're not going to break through this.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  This is not just rhetoric.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  This is life or death.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  This moment in our country, the Democratic Party has the opportunity to do something different.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  We have the opportunity.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Now, you notice I've used the term death battle.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  No one else uses that term, but I've told you they're in a death battle with us.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  Their psychology is they must bring down the West.
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.000]  They don't care if that means you're a wealthy, successful black person, Hispanic, white, all the same race mixed.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Almost everybody's just intermarrying.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  It doesn't even matter.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  And they're desperate to suppress and keep racial politics in control.
[41:52.000 --> 41:58.000]  They're the party of the KKK and they're now indoctrinating the minorities into total racism.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  But a lot of the minorities out on the street felt weird about it and weren't the really aggressive ones.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  It was the white people because they've got to prove that they know whites are bad.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  They have seminars on this and they've got to go out and attack the devil that's the other white people.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  You understand this is total cult brainwashing and you just heard her.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  This is a life or death battle right now and it's against white people.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  Wow.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  I mean, that is beyond the hardcore Aryan nations.
[42:26.000 --> 42:36.000]  That is beyond the hardcore white supremacist and this will cause massive recruitment into those groups.
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.000]  Which again then puts us all into divided groups just like in a prison where everybody's segregated and that's how you have a prison planet.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  And that's why I've been fighting the creation of the prison planet.
[42:46.000 --> 42:55.000]  But that's what they're constructing and they all know full well what they're doing.
[42:55.000 --> 43:08.000]  And no one again can prove that they're anti-white enough as the other members who are running for the DNC chair look down on her.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  Let's go back to it.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  To really confront the fact that we have not been in alignment with our values.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  We've been talking a lot of smack.
[43:17.000 --> 43:25.000]  We need to make sure that our actions and our words and our values all match and around the issue of race.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  We are so far out of alignment.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  I don't even know the way back, but I am.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  And again, those are some rough clips off the internet.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  It tends to get downloaded a little bit jittery, but that is basically unedited.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  That's that's what they're saying is what they're doing.
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  You can go read the transcript.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  You can watch the unedited C-Span club up on info wars.com.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  But that is some seriously disgusting garbage.
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  My job is to shut down other white people to shut them down when they want to interrupt.
[43:50.000 --> 43:57.000]  See, it's her job, just like they were doing out there to stop people from going to the inauguration.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  Because they're the high and mighty ones.
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  They have all the answers.
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.000]  They know what to do.
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  And you can watch the full C-Span clip at info wars.com right now.
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  It's very important to get that out to everybody.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  I've got a bunch of other clips I want to get to that are all monumentally important.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  That was a Sally Boyden.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  But I want to play a clip from Paul Joseph Watson that we've bleeped.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  That's on info wars.com.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  That's got millions of views on Facebook and YouTube that needs to get 50 million views.
[44:32.000 --> 44:42.000]  But I've been told by folks high up in the Trump operation that again, they are very, very thankful to Paul Watson and the great work he's done and wanted me to relay that message to Paul.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  Paul is quite the rock star.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  They're not just in the Trump presidential organization, but also with the Trump family.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  But I'm just going to leave it at that.
[44:53.000 --> 45:03.000]  But these are really funny, fun videos that aren't hateful, but just shows what a bunch of mentally ill babies the followers are and what evil controllers people on top are.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  So here's the video.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  It's the truth about the anti-Trump riots.
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  Here's Paul Watson.
[45:08.000 --> 45:14.000]  Oh, so you thought the butthurt, the mass hysteria and the temper tantrums were finally over?
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.000]  Nah.
[45:15.000 --> 45:28.000]  Better to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  This is the anti-capitalist block of this rock, J-20.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  Yeah, I'd like more capitalism, please.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  With a slight serving of capitalism.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  If only they put as much energy into having an actual argument as they did smashing Starbucks windows.
[45:53.000 --> 46:06.800]  7, 8, 9, fuck the barge with E, 10, 11, 12, fuck the barge with E, 13, 14, oh geez, get
[46:06.800 --> 46:08.300]  any line already.
[46:08.300 --> 46:13.460]  These are the anti-fascists who physically attack people with whom they disagree.
[46:13.460 --> 46:16.520]  In other words, they're the actual fascists.
[46:16.520 --> 46:17.620]  Love Trumps hate.
[46:17.620 --> 46:21.300]  They scream maniacally as they punch you in the face.
[46:21.300 --> 46:25.640]  Their goal was to block entrances and stop people from attending the inauguration.
[46:25.640 --> 46:27.760]  Yeah, how did that work out for you?
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.760]  But this trash can really got shown.
[46:29.760 --> 46:30.760]  Who was boss.
[46:30.760 --> 46:34.040]  Oh yeah, and I thought building walls was racist.
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.560]  Unless you're building human walls to stop other people exercising their first amendment
[46:38.560 --> 46:40.560]  right to peaceably assembled.
[46:40.560 --> 46:41.880]  That's just fine.
[46:41.880 --> 46:49.280]  And unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate
[46:49.280 --> 46:52.080]  completely from the face of the earth.
[46:52.080 --> 46:53.560]  This is a terrifying speech.
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.440]  The biggest cheer of all came when Trump promised to wipe out Islamic terrorism.
[46:57.440 --> 47:00.280]  Yeah, Trump actually vowed to stop Islamic terrorism.
[47:00.280 --> 47:02.320]  I mean, how dare he?
[47:02.320 --> 47:06.280]  That might offend Islamic terrorists.
[47:06.280 --> 47:07.280]  Terrifying.
[47:07.280 --> 47:13.880]  If you thought you'd never see anything on TV as frightening as 9-11, this was it.
[47:13.880 --> 47:18.720]  But the consequences of this are far more damaging.
[47:18.720 --> 47:24.480]  So a Trump presidency is more damaging than America's deadliest terror attack.
[47:24.480 --> 47:29.480]  Thousands of dead Americans and two wars that cost over five trillion dollars.
[47:29.480 --> 47:32.840]  Yeah, that's mass hysteria in tweet form.
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.840]  This New York Post writer compared Trump's inauguration to Pearl Harbor at 9-11.
[47:37.840 --> 47:43.160]  Right, so thousands have lost lives is equal to your hurt feelings.
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.840]  Yeah, I don't think so more on.
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.600]  I'm no longer quite so convinced by this democracy thing.
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.080]  Yeah, the thing about democracy is that you can't just cancel it when you don't get the
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.600]  result you like.
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.080]  Maybe you'd be more at home in North Korea where they don't have to worry about bothersome
[48:00.080 --> 48:01.600]  things like free elections.
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.080]  If somebody can successfully assassinate Trump and his BP today, that'll be lovely.
[48:06.080 --> 48:07.080]  Love.
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.120]  Well, that's strange because, and yeah, call me crazy, but I don't associate live televised
[48:12.120 --> 48:15.920]  blood curdling assassinations with the word lovely.
[48:15.920 --> 48:18.920]  Only way I'll watch Trump's inauguration tonight is if someone promises to assassinate him
[48:18.920 --> 48:19.920]  on television.
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.440]  Yeah, but come on, what about Melania's dress?
[48:22.440 --> 48:25.880]  If anybody does assassinate Trump, I hope they take out Pence first.
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.240]  I think he's worse.
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.320]  That speaks the voice of reason.
[48:29.320 --> 48:33.840]  Death to the fascist insect who preys upon the blood of the people.
[48:33.840 --> 48:48.400]  Yeah, you seem to have confused Trump with a monster from a 1950s B movie.
[48:48.400 --> 48:52.000]  Today my doctor told me I was pregnant at first I was so happy, but then I realized what
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  it means.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.160]  I don't really want to do it, but I'm considering making an appointment to get an abortion because
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.480]  I don't want to associate the day I find out about my child with the day that fascist
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.400]  big Donald Trump became president of my wonderful country, I'm just so emotional right now.
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.720]  Can anyone give me any advice?
[49:06.720 --> 49:07.720]  Here's some advice.
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.200]  Make an appointment with a shrink and for the god of humanity, stop having unprotected
[49:13.200 --> 49:14.200]  sex.
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.320]  Last November I called Trump a fascist in this speech with his inauguration tomorrow.
[49:20.320 --> 49:22.720]  I feel it more than ever.
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.720]  Yeah, you don't know what a fascist is, do you?
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.400]  That's when 24 hours until a dangerously insane fascist liar becomes president of the United
[49:30.400 --> 49:31.880]  States.
[49:31.880 --> 49:37.400]  So you think a dangerous fascist is about to become president of the most powerful country
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.480]  in the world and all you can do is tweet about it.
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.960]  Hey, at least go smash a Starbucks window, at least dress up in denim hot pants and tights
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.000]  for a queer dance party outside Mike Pence's house.
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.240]  So when are we going to have a gay dance off outside the embassy of gay stoning to death
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.160]  Saudi Arabia that funded a fifth of Hillary Clinton's campaign?
[50:02.160 --> 50:03.160]  No?
[50:03.160 --> 50:07.320]  If someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to
[50:07.320 --> 50:08.320]  assassinate Trump.
[50:08.320 --> 50:11.600]  Hashtag be kind, hashtag love Trump's hate.
[50:11.600 --> 50:17.240]  But at least Bill and Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama enjoyed Trump's speech.
[50:17.240 --> 50:28.680]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[50:28.680 --> 50:40.360]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[50:40.360 --> 50:41.600]  And triggered.
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.280]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[50:44.280 --> 50:45.280]  You gotta be the president.
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.880]  When you throw the wife out, it just gets better and better.
[50:48.880 --> 50:51.880]  I think people have been praying to God for an answer.
[50:51.880 --> 50:52.880]  That doesn't mean he'll do everything.
[50:52.880 --> 50:55.880]  That doesn't mean if we don't really get right with God and really work hard and really
[50:55.880 --> 50:59.400]  take action, that things won't turn sour on us.
[50:59.400 --> 51:05.680]  That doesn't mean there's not going to be probably big wars or financial global crises
[51:05.680 --> 51:09.480]  because the New World Order is organizing for a counteroffensive so we can just run
[51:09.480 --> 51:12.320]  the white flag up and give up or we can continue fighting.
[51:12.320 --> 51:17.240]  But look how far we've come by fighting.
[51:17.240 --> 51:18.560]  Look at how the world is changing.
[51:18.560 --> 51:23.280]  Now he was reading tweets there and showing clips, Paul was, and they'll say, let's kill
[51:23.280 --> 51:30.120]  Trump and let's kill the VP and let's go after his kids and let's, you know, all these
[51:30.120 --> 51:38.400]  horrible things and then they'll say, love Trump's hate and be kind, hashtag.
[51:38.400 --> 51:47.320]  I mean, it's, it's like they're trying to publicly act out 1984 double think and upside
[51:47.320 --> 51:52.480]  down world and make it an art form because they'll run over and scream and hit you and
[51:52.480 --> 51:57.880]  say racist, fascist, white male when saying someone is bad because of what color they
[51:57.880 --> 52:06.760]  are is the essence of racial fascism or we're going to kill you, hater.
[52:06.760 --> 52:11.120]  Why are you so hateful?
[52:11.120 --> 52:17.000]  And so I'd say, okay, give me a hug at the women's march and go ask you.
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.760]  This is mass mental illness and what's happening is they're getting worse and worse and crazier
[52:21.760 --> 52:27.840]  and the most radical of them become dominant in these groups and I'm talking a million
[52:27.840 --> 52:30.360]  women probably were in DC.
[52:30.360 --> 52:31.760]  It was close to Trump inauguration.
[52:31.760 --> 52:34.920]  I just look at the real photos and remembers I don't like all they didn't have anybody
[52:34.920 --> 52:38.400]  like they do us and then I know you're a scary cancer.
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.040]  You're growing and then all over Austin, hundreds of thousands.
[52:42.040 --> 52:45.880]  It was basically you're a woman, you come out and you just screaming yell have no facts
[52:45.880 --> 52:50.520]  and they don't even know that Soros funded over 50 groups, billions of dollars the last
[52:50.520 --> 52:54.840]  year to create this movement that was going to be the defense brigade for Hillary.
[52:54.840 --> 52:56.240]  They already had this all lined up.
[52:56.240 --> 52:59.960]  The databases, the women, the purple movement, the pink movement, you know, you know, the
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.160]  stupid hats they wear.
[53:01.160 --> 53:09.600]  The DC police were openly wearing the pink hats, the same DC police that would let people
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.880]  attack us and I mean, attack families with little kids trying to go into the inauguration.
[53:15.880 --> 53:22.160]  We're being attacked and a bunch of fat, stupid, lazy cops who by the way, Trump ought to fire
[53:22.160 --> 53:27.000]  every one of them that doesn't openly have a loyalty pledge the First Amendment and disassociate
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.280]  anybody caught wearing those hats on duty when there are a bunch of anti free speech
[53:32.280 --> 53:35.760]  people should not be police officers.
[53:35.760 --> 53:39.880]  Nobody tried to stop the women from going in.
[53:39.880 --> 53:42.720]  There weren't even fences needed for their big rally that was planned.
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.000]  Well, it was planned as a victory thing months ago.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.520]  I think we're sure they were going to win.
[53:47.520 --> 53:51.800]  No fences needed because see, they don't have to keep us out from hurting you because we're
[53:51.800 --> 53:59.440]  not animals like you, you scum and I should have gone and wanted to know how they were
[53:59.440 --> 54:01.400]  going to act and then run around and just filmed it all.
[54:01.400 --> 54:10.720]  I'm sitting outside waiting to get my tickets and women start coming by bleeding and I'm
[54:10.720 --> 54:14.600]  like the first one was like, I'm bleeding, they attacked me.
[54:14.600 --> 54:16.440]  I'm like, I'm like, this person is a drama queen.
[54:16.440 --> 54:17.920]  No way they attacked an old woman.
[54:17.920 --> 54:23.680]  Then another woman comes by bleeding and another and another and then oh my God, you mean they're
[54:23.680 --> 54:24.680]  doing it down the street.
[54:24.680 --> 54:25.680]  So I go down there.
[54:25.680 --> 54:28.880]  I thought that was where we're going to enter and they go, oh yeah, you're not getting through
[54:28.880 --> 54:29.880]  here.
[54:29.880 --> 54:30.880]  It was all F.U.
[54:30.880 --> 54:36.200]  Alex and weird word little guys, a little black mask all dancing around him, Satan demons
[54:36.200 --> 54:39.640]  and all of a sudden boom, boom, it's like, hey, you fascist white male.
[54:39.640 --> 54:46.120]  Just like if it's KKK, but actual modern giant KKK because people are just people and the
[54:46.120 --> 54:51.400]  media legitimized racism against whites and it's now created an army of self-hating mental
[54:51.400 --> 54:58.120]  patient white people running around leading disheveled, really stupid looking minorities.
[54:58.120 --> 54:59.400]  And I say that because that's what you see.
[54:59.400 --> 55:03.600]  You look really dumb, ignorant, but they all are going to college.
[55:03.600 --> 55:08.320]  They're all getting free government goodies and you see what college pays for trillion
[55:08.320 --> 55:13.400]  spent since the 1960s on the great society and it has created just but her chip on the
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.520]  shoulder people whose whole identity is hating prosperity.
[55:17.520 --> 55:20.520]  Well, you better hate it because you're not going to get any money with those worthless
[55:20.520 --> 55:21.720]  degrees.
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.160]  So they have really psychologically screwed you over by design.
[55:25.160 --> 55:26.880]  This is how you sabotage America.
[55:26.880 --> 55:30.520]  But what was left of America, every race, color, and creed came together to try to resurrect
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.360]  the Republic, to try to defeat globalism that's a huge unelected oppressive tyranny and you
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.440]  run around as we desperately try to write the ship running over icebergs in the freezing
[55:40.440 --> 55:44.760]  water of tyranny and you're screaming and yelling trying to stop us from writing the
[55:44.760 --> 55:49.320]  ship break your conditioning morons.
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.800]  I mean, it's not right to say he took out the bust of Martin Luther King and you know
[55:52.800 --> 56:00.240]  it's a lie or to say nobody was there and to attack free speech and to do it for global
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.680]  corporations that we're taking over and Trump is getting rid of the TPP, rid of Obamacare.
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.040]  All of it written to screw you over and you even know that's true, but you don't care
[56:10.040 --> 56:17.120]  because you're in such a cult, you can't admit you were wrong.
[56:17.120 --> 56:21.120]  Now I got to put out the midair refueling here and fund this operation.
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.600]  I didn't know we only got 2,000 of this famous print.
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.480]  We've already sold 500 as of this morning and I don't know why because they're 1995
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.400]  on parchment paper and I think we're probably selling them for too low and quite frankly
[56:32.400 --> 56:33.400]  I need to raise money.
[56:33.400 --> 56:38.360]  So I'm raising these to $50 a piece tomorrow and I don't sell out because I need money.
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.320]  I mean, we're doing good, but I want to grow, put in a Washington bureau and not be, you
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.720]  know, worried about expanding.
[56:45.720 --> 56:48.680]  And it was already given to us months ago and the guy said, hey, you like it.
[56:48.680 --> 56:51.600]  He's the famous official portrait of the Republican Party.
[56:51.600 --> 56:53.520]  He did that super famous Ronald Reagan one.
[56:53.520 --> 56:57.440]  That's the most iconic image of Ronald Reagan.
[56:57.440 --> 57:00.800]  And in fact, I went and shot some video during the break of that as well, so I'm the production
[57:00.800 --> 57:04.000]  guy around here and we can maybe back up that video.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.960]  We were just playing and actually show TV viewers that.
[57:05.960 --> 57:11.720]  We'll also post this video up on infowars.com and infowarstore.com so that you can actually
[57:11.720 --> 57:14.040]  see them for yourself.
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.400]  But they're going to sell it very quickly, created by the same artist that sketched
[57:17.400 --> 57:20.280]  the Reagan lithograph, hang in the Reagan library.
[57:20.280 --> 57:26.160]  It's very, very powerful and we are wonderful, you know, supporters of free speech and art
[57:26.160 --> 57:27.160]  in this country.
[57:27.160 --> 57:29.720]  And I'm telling you, these types of things sell in art galleries for hundreds of dollars
[57:29.720 --> 57:33.040]  a piece, framed sometimes thousands of dollars.
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.280]  It's available right now at infowarstore.com and it funds our operation.
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.360]  And I'll tell you what we bought them for it, it didn't go to fund us very much.
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.320]  We also have tactical nanotechnology body armor previously only available to military
[57:45.320 --> 57:48.320]  and law enforcement exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[57:48.320 --> 57:51.320]  But I don't know how long I think under Trump, they won't try to ban it.
[57:51.320 --> 57:53.680]  The Democrats are already moving that direction.
[57:53.680 --> 57:59.160]  We also have these great Tennessee arms lowers their full selection discounted for your M4s
[57:59.160 --> 58:04.760]  and infowarstore.com to the famous folks with the patented brass inlays.
[58:04.760 --> 58:07.120]  Some of these go 6,000 rounds and average is about 3,000.
[58:07.120 --> 58:14.440]  It's just unprecedented quality Tennessee arms, 80% lower AR receivers infowarstore.com.
[58:14.440 --> 58:18.440]  The new Psyticles, they're all up there infowarslife.com.
[58:18.440 --> 58:20.640]  Trump is by president T shirts are almost sold out.
[58:20.640 --> 58:21.840]  Saw a lot of those in DC.
[58:21.840 --> 58:22.840]  That was great.
[58:22.840 --> 58:23.840]  We're going to have a new version coming out soon.
[58:23.840 --> 58:24.840]  I'm Alex Jones.
[58:24.840 --> 58:27.520]  This is the info war infowars.com.
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.800]  Again, it is the main site.
[58:29.800 --> 58:30.800]  They're always trying to block it.
[58:30.800 --> 58:34.800]  So please continue to spread that in your emails, in your links and to others.
[58:34.800 --> 58:37.440]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[58:37.440 --> 58:38.440]  Stay with us.
[58:38.440 --> 58:50.880]  You are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
[58:50.880 --> 58:57.240]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[58:57.240 --> 58:58.240]  about a group.
[58:58.240 --> 59:00.560]  You took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.200]  it's very, very important.
[59:06.200 --> 59:12.840]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[59:12.840 --> 59:15.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.200]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[59:17.200 --> 59:21.520]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[59:21.520 --> 59:24.400]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[59:24.400 --> 59:26.080]  It works like an antioxidant.
[59:26.080 --> 59:29.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.160]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[59:32.160 --> 59:33.200]  It's in powder form.
[59:33.200 --> 59:35.920]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[59:35.920 --> 59:36.920]  I take this.
[59:36.920 --> 59:41.400]  This is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the profit we make.
[59:41.400 --> 59:42.400]  We fight the global.
[59:42.400 --> 59:43.400]  We fight the new world order.
[59:43.400 --> 59:53.000]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:18.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:36.960]  All right, I almost got to airing this yesterday, but I was so busy with all the news that we
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  didn't play it.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:40.880]  So I'm going to play it right now and also give some commentary on it.
[1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:45.320]  I was leaving Saturday in D.C. and I came out of the condo that we rented and I was
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.720]  waiting for Buckley and others to come out of their condo.
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:53.600]  And I looked into the hallway where I'd just come out and the room right next to where
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.360]  I was staying, I guess Ted Cruz lives there or had rented it out.
[1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:01.800]  It's Ted Cruz coming out of the dark hallway because the lights were off down there for
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:02.800]  some reason.
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:06.720]  And they always make the joke that he's like a vampire and looks like a vampire.
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.440]  But he could star as Count Dracula in a major TV show.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:11.800]  And I don't mean that as mean.
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.080]  I admire Ted Cruz.
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:14.680]  I supported him early on for president.
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:18.200]  He's done a lot of great things and I mentioned that in the short interview.
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:22.800]  It's just that the fact is trying to steal the votes in Colorado and other places and
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:26.600]  claiming that you just won in a landslide when you got the delegates, that just doesn't
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:27.600]  float.
[1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:30.600]  It's the same way they robbed Sanders, but Trump stood up against it.
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:34.920]  But I'd like to see him get behind the rebirth of America and he says he believes Trump is
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:36.440]  part of the new era.
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:37.440]  So this is exciting.
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.920]  Here's the interview with Ted Cruz.
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:45.160]  Look at this, a secret meeting with Alex Jones and Ted Cruz, they caught us here.
[1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:47.680]  They did.
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:49.280]  So what did you think about yesterday, Ted?
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:51.720]  Well, I think it's the start of a new era.
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:55.520]  And what we've been giving is giving us something rare and it's something historic.
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:59.040]  How much political capital do you think we can gather to make action happen?
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:01.680]  Well, the question really is, do we stand up and deliver?
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:04.240]  Do we do what we said we would do?
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:07.840]  The week after the election, I traveled to New York, sat down in Trump Tower with President
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:12.080]  Trump and I told him I want to do everything I can to help lead the fight to actually do
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:13.080]  what we promised.
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:18.960]  Senator Cruz, I want to thank you for making it on your promise to a back Trump once you
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  was the nominee.
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  Absolutely.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  And I campaigned for him and the victory on election night was a mandate for change.
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:27.960]  We just had one more question about speech.
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:32.040]  I thought it was a true return of America in invoking the birthright that George Washington
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:36.120]  talked about and bringing God back in and Jesus in the name of the words of Jesus Christ
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:39.720]  as he energized America, your comments on it.
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:44.800]  Look, I think it signals the beginning of the era and we've had a president for eight
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:48.720]  years who ignores the working men and women of this country and that's what the speech
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:49.720]  was all about.
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:51.640]  It's the people who have been left behind.
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.840]  This race was all decided by the truck drivers, the electricians, the plumbers.
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:02.720]  He was decided by the school teachers and he was decided by the men and women with calluses
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:08.960]  on their hands who had been screwed the last eight years by Washington and on election
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:12.080]  day they said enough is enough and I am excited.
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:17.920]  I think we are poised to have the most productive Congress in decades actually listening to the
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:22.080]  American people and getting the federal government off the backs of small businesses, bringing
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:25.520]  back jobs and saying for once wage is going up rather than going down.
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:26.520]  Sure.
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:29.440]  What are the chances in closing that we have condos right next to each other the last three
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:31.560]  days and not note?
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:36.880]  Well, it is a small world and I will say an awful lot of folks came to Washington to celebrate
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.280]  and I was proud to be up there yesterday.
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:40.840]  Are you headed back to Texas right now?
[1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:41.840]  I'm headed back tomorrow morning.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.840]  Well, let me ask you this about the whole situation.
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:49.800]  I just want to say I really admired most what you've done when you came out and just battled
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:53.440]  Obamacare and everybody was saying that you would never be repealed and you really built
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:55.880]  momentum and broke the idea that it was invincible.
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:59.120]  So I think you have a lot of credit there and that's why I was supporting you early on
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:04.400]  for president and then secondarily when you exposed that we can't be al-Qaida's air force
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:09.400]  and really exposed and gave the generals the moral courage to come to Obama and say we're
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:12.360]  not going to back ISIS and al-Qaida in Syria.
[1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:17.480]  I think that began the really the collapse of Hillary and Kerry and all of them really
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:20.680]  set America back on the right path so I said some mean things.
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:25.360]  You know, obviously the campaign, I just realized that they almost say I think you've shown
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:31.000]  when it comes to actual brains and information the best grasp of this republic and so that's
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.160]  why I'm really glad to see more of Trump telling you he needs you, Senator Cruz.
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:40.160]  Well, thank you, Alex, and it is an exciting new day and my God, every day can be fun.
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:41.160]  I'll be safe.
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:42.160]  I hope it's on the radio show.
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:43.160]  All right.
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:44.160]  Because it's the world up here in the back.
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:45.160]  All right.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:48.160]  Our numbers are about the global reach of about a billion a month now.
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:49.160]  All right.
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:50.160]  Love you.
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:51.160]  I've seen this stuff in the state.
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:52.160]  Very good.
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:53.160]  Thank you.
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:54.160]  All right.
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:55.160]  Take care.
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:57.160]  I'll be back.
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:05.520]  The Associated Press is reporting this week that former President Barack Obama was releasing
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:10.520]  money right and left hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office on Friday.
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:15.400]  On Friday morning, he released $221 million in U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:18.600]  on the morning just hours before he was set to leave office.
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:23.280]  Now, one state department official and several congressional aides say that the Obama administration
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:27.120]  formally notified Congress it's going to be spending that money on Friday morning just
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.400]  hours before Donald Trump became president.
[1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:34.720]  Now, also, more than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at the same time,
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.400]  including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.2 million for UN organizations.
[1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:45.600]  Now, GOP lawmakers have placed holds on the Palestinian funds, but not on everything else.
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:49.080]  Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch, but they're not legally
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:50.080]  binding.
[1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:54.440]  It looks like Obama's funding spree, all of it is going to be going through, and he did
[1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:57.960]  this literally hours before Donald Trump had taken the office.
[1:05:57.960 --> 1:06:00.360]  Well, I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:05.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement.
[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:09.760]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:12.880]  at preorder at infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.520]  It's the making of a president, and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:20.680]  The inside baseball, the current battles, and a blueprint for the future of what Trump
[1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:23.880]  and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:27.680]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:31.080]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians, and so much more, and it supports
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:34.040]  him, and it supports Infowars, our whole operation.
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:37.440]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:38.840]  not to the very top of the charts.
[1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:41.320]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:43.600]  They are in full crisis mode.
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:49.200]  Those movements are exploding, everybody needs to go preorder, so you get it first at infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:52.920]  The making of a president by Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones, jumping on airplane to go
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:56.880]  to the inaugural event with Trump, pray for us, and please continue to support the operation
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:01.160]  and get his book now, sir, the first to have a trip to you.
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:05.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:10.480]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:15.480]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:17.080]  at infowarsstore.com.
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:20.920]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:25.000]  auto ship, because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:34.320]  Listeners have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:36.120]  the products that you need each month.
[1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:39.760]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:43.840]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:49.140]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[1:07:49.140 --> 1:07:50.640]  this is a sure win.
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:56.520]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:23.640]  So all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.040]  You know, I figured that Ted Cruz, who was on the show when he was running for Senate
[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:30.360]  many years ago, would not want to be interviewed.
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:34.240]  So I was trying to be nice and just get it over with and try to mend fences, because he's
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:35.240]  not perfect.
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:39.400]  He's a lot better than the Democrats, and he's really been good on free speech issues.
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:43.000]  He's been great on the Second Amendment, great on sovereignty, great on borders, great on
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  so many fronts.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.360]  I'm glad to see him working with Trump more.
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:49.880]  So I see him at the same condo place that I'm staying at Saturday.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.960]  Once we go outside, I was waiting for people to bring stuff down.
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:56.320]  He was waiting with our two black SUVs parked there.
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:01.360]  We talked quite a bit, and we talked about Trump, and we talked about where he's going,
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:05.600]  and he's all excited about the relaunch of America and the fact that globalism is falling
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:10.160]  apart because it was always designed to transfer our wealth overseas and pick the winners.
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:15.200]  And he said, just as long as Trump stays conservative values, that he's going to work with him.
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.560]  So that is exciting, because I really like Ted Cruz, as everybody knows, until some of
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:23.400]  the stuff he started doing in the campaign, I got pretty vicious with him, but, you know,
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:29.000]  when you're saying, we had another landslide, and in this state of Colorado, another landslide
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  here, when you took over the process and had the delegates give you all the votes and
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.800]  ignored the popular vote, basically canceled it, that's not good.
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:43.320]  I don't care of the Republican establishment at the time, you know, said that it was okay
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:44.320]  to do that.
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:49.840]  What, right, the Democrats did it, but we are seeing a whole new level of deception.
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:56.000]  You know, Lee and McAdoo was upset by CNN, BBC, and others showing the mall on Friday
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:02.280]  morning right when they opened it up to allow people in for the inauguration, and then showing
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:07.320]  the inaugural grounds when they were full in 2008 and claiming Obama had more people.
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:12.000]  And even though they got caught with CNN's own megapixel photos at the time, that it
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.080]  was a crowd as bigger, bigger, even though they had fences up, they still double down
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:21.280]  and show the same old photo and say, no, no one was there.
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.280]  That is upsetting when you see people lying to you, they know you know they're lying,
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.280]  they know the world knows they're lying, but they just keep throwing out this info, hoping
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:33.480]  to catch people that are ignorant, low information voters.
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:37.160]  The Democratic Party always says they're the party of smart people.
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:40.920]  Yeah, a bunch of intellectual controllers over dumb people.
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:43.760]  They are now a completely race-based criminal organization.
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:48.480]  I mean, you have the white candidate for DNC chair says her job will be to shut down white
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:52.960]  people and to shut them down and not let them speak.
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:55.960]  By the way, the big news just got announced a few minutes ago.
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:57.720]  It's up on infowars.com.
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:02.760]  Trump keeps coming as FBI director, and they say this is a smart move because it would
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:07.480]  have a big battle for a new FBI director, and he hasn't served out his 10-year normal
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:11.000]  term, so he has confidence in the director.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.880]  Renz Preba says, I'm going to reserve judgment on whether this is a good idea or not.
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:17.680]  I need to really think about it, but I'll say this.
[1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:25.600]  We're seeing total delivery on his promises to pull aside a NAFTA, GATT, TPP, renegotiate,
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:30.840]  expose all these one-sided deals, signal that we're going to cut the corporate taxes to
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.680]  bring jobs back here, because that's a tariff on us and so much more.
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:40.920]  I mean, he is delivering on so many fronts, but we set this up weeks ago, and he's a perfect
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:49.520]  guest to have on right now to decipher the latest individual, and I'm trouble pronouncing
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:53.080]  this name, but we've covered him a lot here on air.
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:58.200]  He's one of the dissenting Republican members of the Federal Communications Commission.
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:03.600]  I guess you say, adjit pi, probably pronounced that wrong, we'll all get to be good at saying
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.240]  it now.
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:12.280]  So adjit pi, I think I'm saying it correctly, they tell me am I here I am.
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:17.000]  The media, it appears he's tried to spin when he stands for, they go, oh, he's not for internet
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:23.200]  freedom, he's against net neutrality, no, he's against the Democrats FCC proposal to take
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:28.640]  over all communications and claim jurisdiction over it and then have a quote fairness doctrine
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:29.640]  over it.
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:35.160]  And he says, under their plans, they would shut down sites like Drudge Report and put
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:37.400]  it under Federal Elections Commission control.
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:41.440]  And Obama, two weeks before he left office, signed legislation that Trump's got to repeal
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:48.160]  or block saying that they were going to federalize the media and put intelligence agencies over
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:51.560]  it, that they were going to start censoring the press and basically ending free speech.
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:58.280]  And the last time we had Bruce Fein on three weeks ago, we were discussing that legislation
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:00.120]  that Obama did sign.
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:03.240]  So I haven't talked to him before this interview.
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.760]  I want him to correct me if I'm wrong because he is the former head counsel for the Federal
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:08.760]  Communications Commission.
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:13.400]  He is the man that brought it to Ronald Reagan's attention in Congress and got him to point
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:17.360]  out that it was never even applicable, that it was fraudulently being enforced saying
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:21.680]  talk radio and TV broadcast TV could not have political views and news.
[1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:25.720]  It was already all Democrat propaganda, but they just wouldn't let conservatives or libertarians
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:26.720]  be on air.
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.240]  It was like the only one that could barely squeak through every once a week.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:37.960]  So correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce Fein, constitutional lawyer, bestselling author, one of his latest
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:42.320]  books, Constitutional Peril, The Life and Death Struggle for a Constitution and Democracy
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.200]  in American Empire Before the Fall.
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:52.320]  I mean, was that a accurate approximation of the new FCC chair in the situation?
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:54.760]  Let me say this just to amplify, Alex.
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:14:03.160]  The statute basically has the federal government involved in monitoring all of cyberspace, including
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:08.480]  broadcasts, just to determine whether they're so-called fake news, whatever.
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.440]  The government decides it's fake news.
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:16.280]  And then to generate what they think is an adequate response to try to overcome the
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:17.280]  fake news.
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:20.800]  And so it's frightening because of its ambiguity.
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:24.880]  The fake news is in the eyes of somebody who doesn't like what they're hearing.
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:26.920]  So it's like Obamacare and open-ended power grab.
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:27.920]  Yeah.
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:33.560]  And it's, you know, really, it's a variation, if you will, of the problem that I confronted
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.040]  with a fairness doctrine.
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:39.920]  The government can decide what elements of a conversation are fair and what is not.
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:43.800]  You know, as though the government doesn't always have ulterior motives.
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:48.360]  It's going to decide with whatever gives them more power and tries to suppress, you know,
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:51.440]  the power that can jeopardize either their positions in office.
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:54.200]  So, and the whole thing is superfluous anyway.
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:58.680]  I mean, there's never any showing that the American people aren't, if you give them the
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:02.640]  open access to information, some of it's going to be right, some wrong.
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:04.920]  Sure, Bruce, because you're the expert, though, I'm-
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:06.800]  They're the experts themselves, what to believe, you know.
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:10.800]  Sure, I'm trying to decipher this new FCC head.
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.760]  So just break, you heard my breakdown of what I've read from his position and the fact
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:19.480]  that it looks like he is trying to keep a free internet, they're spinning it, that he's
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:23.680]  trying to take over a free internet and wants to shut down Drudge, I believe he's saying
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:24.680]  the opposite.
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:30.840]  You know, I believe that's certainly true and he's already, I think that the large amount
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:38.440]  of, you know, political momentum against them will be those who want so-called net neutrality,
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:47.760]  that is, to enable the super huge people like Google to be able to not pay their way in
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:50.920]  the internet or in the cyberspace.
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:56.840]  It would be, the net neutrality is like this, Alex, it would be like saying the airlines
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:02.560]  couldn't offer first class tickets, that they had to treat all passengers the same, even
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:06.320]  though some would be willing to pay more for superior service.
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:12.160]  I mean, which is satisfactory to everyone, though, if you don't want to pay more, then
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:15.840]  you would have a different kind of service, I mean, and that would be absurd.
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:20.360]  It would be like saying, you know, you can't have FedEx anymore because, you know, you're
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:24.600]  paying to get your packages delivered faster than the post office.
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:25.600]  Really?
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:31.840]  You know, if we had to live, we can't even survive today without FedEx as an alternative
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:34.200]  to the post office.
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:39.520]  And this is simply having the Federal Communications Commission out of the business of choosing
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:42.960]  or favoring, you know, one particular aspect of the industry over and over.
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:43.960]  Sure, sure.
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.520]  I mean, we were concerned, we were concerned that there would be a move with net throttling
[1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.560]  as they call it, but the 50 times greater evil is having the federal government declare
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:58.560]  360 total galactic universal control and oversight over all communications.
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:02.480]  We know that's bad, so that big evil is being shot down.
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:07.840]  And so now we have to decide at looking at future services, what can be done, but nobody
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:11.760]  in the public or we know President Trump is going to put up with anything that really
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.760]  does censor.
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:13.760]  Is that what you're getting at?
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:19.960]  Well, I think that's absolutely accurate that the idea of the government in the business
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:27.080]  of censoring is outlandish, it's antithetical to our whole political dispensation, which
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:32.440]  is based upon the trust that if you let the American people have access and they can make
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:36.960]  up their minds based upon the information that they have, which includes the right,
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.840]  you can disbelieve anything you have to.
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:46.360]  I think what has infuriated the mainstream media is that they became more and more distrusted.
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:50.960]  More people believed in Alex Jones than MSNBC.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:56.400]  And that just was so shocking to them because they're very insular, they talk only to themselves
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:01.840]  as like an incestuous conversation, that they now leap out and say, well, maybe there was
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:06.720]  some kind of alt-tier mode, you know, the Russians brainwashed the American people into
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:11.000]  voting against Hillary Clinton, so it needed me to be brainwashed by them.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.960]  Bruce, as you see the Democrats just last week, a bunch of them, Maxine Waters, all
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:21.000]  the usual suspects, Michael Moore, they're now saying Putin actually commands Trump
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:26.360]  and tells him terms to use like crooked Hillary or drain the swamp, as if we haven't always
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:27.760]  called Hillary crooked.
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:36.120]  No, I remember, it goes back, I worked, Alex, intensely with Bob Bar, then on drafting
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:41.280]  the article's impeachment against Bill Clinton, and I had to laugh when Hillary, oh, this
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:47.000]  is a right wing conspiracy, you know, and all this invented stuff to deny what the
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  truth was.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:49.840]  You know, there are always some alt-tier motives.
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:50.840]  I didn't get beta-penny.
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:54.760]  This is something I did as a citizen of the United States that I thought was important
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:55.760]  to me.
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:00.920]  The vast right-wing conspiracy is we have a will to be free and we're taking action.
[1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:06.720]  Yeah, exercising your constitutional rights to seek redress of grievances now becomes
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:07.920]  a right-wing conspiracy.
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:08.920]  Oh, really?
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:13.120]  You know, it used to be heroized and they used to build monuments to people for doing
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  that.
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:17.320]  You know, they were called Thomas Bain and George Washington, and now we're right-wing
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.320]  conspirators.
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:23.720]  So that's what's gotten, I think, the mainstream media really quite frightened because they
[1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:26.520]  see they're losing grip on the ability.
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:31.600]  And everybody knows nobody's given Trump orders and Russians given him certainly last.
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:32.600]  That is ridiculous.
[1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:33.600]  Yeah.
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:38.880]  Well, people will believe things irrespective of the facts, you know, and so if they want
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:39.880]  to believe that.
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:46.000]  But this is what we can take some solids from this, Alex, and that is if this is what they're
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  spending their time thinking about, I can guarantee you they will lose the next election
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.720]  because they're focusing on their relevancy and a myth.
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:55.720]  Absolutely.
[1:19:55.720 --> 1:19:56.720]  So I want to get your predictions.

[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:35.680]  Well, when I was a young teen, Bruce Fine was securing my future First Amendment.
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:42.480]  And that's why he said, in the old days, we built statues to people that fought and delivered
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:43.480]  freedoms.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:46.080]  In many cases, died for them like our forebears.
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:49.880]  Bruce Fine went and fought in Congress as a lawyer, but it's all still the same thing
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:52.920]  because it delivers freedom into the future.
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:56.480]  And so he doesn't want to be credited or even given credit, but it is a fact that it's admitted
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:03.920]  that he's the main progenitor of reversing decades of free speech being shut down in
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:05.840]  this country.
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:07.600]  So where are the other men doing this?
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:12.560]  Well, people like Trump are fighting to crush the establishment media just by simply allowing
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:13.560]  competition.
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:18.000]  And this time, it isn't even about the broadcast spectrum, it's about mainstream media discrediting
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  themselves.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.880]  I mean, I was there, I don't know, Bruce wasn't asking now, this is a short segment, he's
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:23.440]  still about 50 after.
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:29.360]  I was there, it took me three hours to get in because of Soros funded groups beating
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:31.120]  up women and children.
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:32.240]  The police wouldn't help us.
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:34.960]  Some police were wearing protestor hats and pins.
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:39.440]  It was horrible because the president, that was Obama at the time, appoints the DC police
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:40.440]  chief.
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:46.200]  So there's so many issues of tyranny here, and then we get in and there's giant record
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:50.880]  crowd and CNN shows a photo as they first opened the gates, making it look tiny from
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:52.080]  8.30 in the morning.
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:56.480]  I mean, at this point, I'm glad there's not, quote, regulation over the press as we move
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:25:58.240]  into the Trump era.
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.800]  But now just because the public are leaving them with free market, they're calling for
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:04.720]  censorship of the press.
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:09.520]  They were hoping for it with the Hillary era, but it seems like that now that's all being
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  derailed.
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:16.040]  So what are you most concerned about, what I'm trying to say is, it's surreal to watch
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:21.280]  how truly authoritarian these people are, but they're having their victory jerked away
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:24.480]  from them at the last moment, so they're going into conniption fits.
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:30.240]  Well, I mean, the great worry is you can get companies like Facebook, and they've already
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:36.120]  in a given some indication that they'll yank what they decide is so-called fake news, that
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:42.680]  you'll have private censorship, and maybe Twitter would do the same thing, because they are
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:49.960]  clearly in what we would call the liberal camp, and they're the ones who were close
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:57.280]  to Obama and Hillary, and so they have very dominant space on the internet, and you can
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:04.080]  imagine something as huge as Facebook, then they turn into the equivalent of the Communist
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.720]  Party in China and decides, all right, this is fake news, we'll scrub it.
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:14.240]  They have sort of dress rehearsals for that, because they do in a better way, attempt to
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:22.560]  try to eliminate the use of Facebook to promote terrorism and criminal activity or human trafficking,
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:30.840]  but that's far cry from going to fake news, which has no articulable boundaries to it,
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:34.000]  it basically turns you into an arm of censorship.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.840]  Well, Trump's not called for any censorship of the press, but they're already saying
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:41.440]  that Spicer and Trump are copying Beijing on censorship, simply because they're calling
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:46.520]  out fake media lies, but it was a month ago that the Communist Chinese were all in our
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:51.760]  newspaper saying, you need to ban fake news, so the truth is the Democrats, even at Devo's
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:57.440]  say they hope China will help enforce the New World Order on America, but then they double
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:02.480]  back and claim that Trump's the authoritarian, I mean, this looks like an attempted overthrow
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:03.480]  of reality.
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:09.240]  Well, it's a rather odd statement for the press to make whether they agree or not agree
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:13.880]  with the president, and your president has free speech rights like anyone else.
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:19.360]  You'd expect the press to be echoing, you know, Voltaire, the great liberal humanist
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:23.880]  in France, the time of the French Revolution, you know, I may disagree with what you say,
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.320]  but I'll defend it to the death, you're right to say it.
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:32.360]  So why should the press be offended if the president says something that may disagree
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  with?
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:34.360]  Well, you have free speech.
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:39.360]  The reason why you have free speech, Alex, is not to protect the speech that you loved,
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:43.040]  just protect the speech that you might disagree with and even hate.
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:48.960]  So no one's preventing the press from reporting on whatever the president does, and they comment
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  on it.
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:50.960]  Well, that's it.
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:55.280]  The liberal press says shut down conservatives, shut down anybody we disagree with, and then
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:00.000]  Trump says that's wrong, and they say he's censoring them by having his own speech.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:06.040]  Exactly, no, which they report instantly by Twitter or a Facebook feed or something
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:07.040]  like that.
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:11.520]  I mean, the reason why we know what the press is saying this is because they're not censored,
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:12.920]  and you can read it.
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:16.480]  They may not believe it, but you surely have access to their viewpoint.
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.560]  Well, I want to come back because I've been asking some of the questions here, but the
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:23.560]  next segment, I want to let you get into other areas you're focused on, things you see that
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:27.440]  are positive, things you see that are negative, but we've got the real king of free speech
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:28.440]  here.
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:33.280]  So if you would not have this movement today, you've got to see how pebbles in the pebbles
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:35.920]  in the pond really do send out giant ripples.
[1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:41.240]  And if you want to track back so much of our current success, he's on the phone right now.
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:44.120]  You want to get his books, they're powerful.
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:47.520]  Bruce finds our guests, we'll tell you about his books coming up as well.
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:50.560]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:51.840]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:54.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.280 --> 1:30:00.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:05.520]  Well, just in case you missed it, Info Wars was on the ground live, covering every piece
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:10.400]  of action imaginable on the Washington D.C. grounds as the inauguration was taking place,
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:14.320]  and we caught, not surprisingly, a number of protesters behaving badly.
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:19.000]  One video shows a man frustrated with anti-fascist blocking a street in Washington, D.C. and
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:22.840]  one of these fascist punches the man in the face before being attacked, the incident taking
[1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:24.200]  place on Friday.
[1:30:24.200 --> 1:30:27.720]  During Trump's inaugural speech, the video starts with an unnamed man, let's call him
[1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:31.880]  Thor, asking the anti-fata Stooges if they're going to prevent him from going to work because
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:36.080]  they're crying, you know what, then they seem to have lost it with the word war.
[1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:39.920]  Yes, pretty much a masked female responds, come on, babe, let the ladies through at which
[1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:41.680]  point some of the women pass.
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:46.280]  Now this guy rushes behind the women and turns around and says, F you, your roadblocks are
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:49.480]  expletive, and then she responds by attacking him.
[1:30:49.480 --> 1:30:51.600]  Yes, she punches him right in the face.
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:55.280]  Just like these protesters that are part of the women's march after the inauguration,
[1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:58.200]  we're just as bad, catch us here for all of the action.
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:00.920]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:04.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:07.680]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:13.720]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:18.680]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:23.640]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:28.760]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:30.480]  you can to purify your air.
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:35.520]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:40.680]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:44.640]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:48.280]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:51.840]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:55.040]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:55.040 --> 1:32:01.040]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:05.560]  We have the new product at InfowarsLife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:10.360]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able
[1:32:10.360 --> 1:32:16.360]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[1:32:16.360 --> 1:32:21.120]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:22.120]  body.
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:26.320]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:28.800]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:32.800]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:33.800]  all over the body.
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:39.840]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium,
[1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:45.160]  so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:46.920]  I'm taking it now every day.
[1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:47.920]  This is soaking.
[1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:52.200]  Biotru Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:54.440]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:33:00.440]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:08.760]  I've got a tiger in my tail that's swaying the sea.
[1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:12.720]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:15.320]  He never gives up.
[1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:20.720]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb, just to kind of fit my dreams
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:33.720]  and plans.
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:37.720]  Now, the pace we're living takes them when from the sales.
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:43.800]  We're going back to Bruce Fine to really get into his main focus, as I know, is studying
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:45.800]  empires and systems.
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.360]  I imagine he'll want to get into that and some other issues, but I'd love to get really
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:53.440]  smart guests on and then just say, hey, what do you want to talk about?
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:59.600]  But it's perfect that they've named the new FCC chair today, who from my research and
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:05.960]  from constitutional law and communications expert and former main counsel for the FCC,
[1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:07.360]  Bruce Fine's view.
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:09.280]  He is a very, very good choice.
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:15.000]  The left is trying to spend this and he wants to end web freedom because they labeled their
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:18.720]  net neutrality legislation net neutrality.
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:25.680]  When it was a total takeover of all communications delivered digitally or by broadcast.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:26.680]  It's amazing.
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:30.480]  And so he concurs with my breakdown and others that this is a good guy.
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:35.200]  Doesn't mean there can't be abuses in any new regulatory scheme.
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:40.400]  That's the problem with anything that's regulatory, but this guy is a quote, take a weed eater
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.760]  to regulations view.
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:48.640]  And if the guy that literally saved us from the destruction of free speech in this country's
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:53.480]  you know, certification, then I have gotten more than a wait and see position.
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:54.480]  I think this is very positive.
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:57.840]  But Bruce, let me just ask this brief question and get into your agenda.
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:00.960]  And I imagine this is probably your agenda as well.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.480]  Looking at Trump, I've had a wait and see.
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:05.880]  I mean, I know he's a good guy overall a lot better than the other candidates, but I'm
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:12.880]  being really pleasantly invigorated and surprised here with hundreds of phone calls a day to
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  major corporations saying come here saying we've got regulations designed to cripple
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:17.880]  us.
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:23.560]  We're slashing them saying we're going to, you know, cut the taxes and with this optimism
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:27.880]  Chrysler Ford carrier, a soft bank.
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:32.440]  I mean, the list is so huge now, Foxcom is saying, okay, we're going to have human
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:35.640]  factories in the United States, Apple's coming back.
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.200]  It's an avalanche, a trillion plus in the stock market before he was even president,
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:43.880]  just in the exuberance, because in my view, he's quote, not out to get us, but then that
[1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:50.360]  inaugural speech, some of the continuation of George Washington's vision and the relaunch
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:54.520]  of the Renaissance project that our republic has been and Francis Bacon and the whole
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:55.520]  nine yards.
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:57.240]  I mean, this is like so good.
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:01.400]  I'm pinching myself, hoping I don't wake up and this is a dream.
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:04.840]  It doesn't mean I'm in a cult and think Trump can do no wrong.
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:09.320]  In fact, I'm looking for things for him to do wrong because I want to, you know, always
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:14.640]  stick to my guns and be a purist, but I am really blown away right now.
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:20.640]  Alex, I think we just need to take it, you know, day by day, you know, words are words
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:21.640]  and it's great.
[1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:26.960]  The words that sound good are really good, but they're just words until they're translated
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:33.520]  into actual regulations and then statutes and of course, it's encouraging that the words
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:38.680]  are producing this enthusiasm about bringing jobs into the United States, but you know,
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:41.480]  you can reverse that in five seconds as well.
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:45.160]  And I think, you know, the critical feature, and this is, you know, I've been here, Alex,
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:51.080]  50 years, you know, we still have a bureaucracy and the bureaucracy is basically it's liberal
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:54.720]  and it's regulatory oriented and it's huge.
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:37:01.360]  And we have a $4.3 trillion federal government debt, millions of employees and they have
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:07.520]  their own vested interests and it takes a long time to undo some of these regulatory
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:13.200]  networks that have been built up over literally decades and just to prove your point, I didn't
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:17.440]  know this correction, the Chinese threatened Foxcom and now they're backpedaling.
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:18.440]  Yeah.
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:22.560]  So those are, and it's not that you're, you're, you're wrong.
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.840]  It's just that we, it's, it's like Reagan, trust but verify, we got to wait and see what
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:28.840]  really happens.
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:34.560]  And, and in many of these cases where you're going to need new statutes, we need to remember
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:40.840]  that the, the Democrats still on legislation have a filibuster role that they could utilize
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:44.400]  to scuttle some of the, the more enlightened efforts to roll back.
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:48.840]  So bottom line, they're dug in and you've been up there monitoring this for, as you
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:51.240]  said, 50 years in your career.
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:52.680]  What would you advise Trump to do then?
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:54.320]  I know you were Ron Paul's chief advisor.
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:57.160]  Well, this is what I've actually written there.
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:01.000]  This is the way in which you, I think you can dismantle the regulatory state without
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.840]  having to depend upon Congress.
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:10.760]  You simply have the regulators issue rules that say, and including existing rules that
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:18.800]  in less Congress, both houses of Congress affirmatively vote to approve the rule within
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:20.880]  60 days that lapses.
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:27.520]  So you force the Congress to decide they want to continue the regulation.
[1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:31.560]  And of course, if they vote for it, it still is a statute and the president could veto
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:32.560]  it.
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:37.600]  But this is a way in which you require, and one of the reasons why Alex, the regulatory
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:45.520]  state has grown faster than bamboo is because it's a way in which the congressional branch
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:51.280]  can give the responsibility to the executive for doing things people don't like and then
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:56.040]  hold up their hands and say, like Pontius Pilate, not me, but it really is them.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:00.320]  And then they complain about the handiwork that they've given to the executive branch
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:01.680]  after they've given it away.
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:02.680]  Sure.
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:04.760]  And they can all pretend like it's not their fault.
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:08.800]  That's why it's so incredible that Trump's stepping into this trifecta, stepping into
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:12.240]  the executive that does have all this power, and I think that's why we're starting to see
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:13.480]  such a fast reversal.
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.280]  I mean, just look at Obamacare.
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:18.160]  Look at his withdrawal from the TPP on day four.
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:19.160]  Yeah.
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:20.160]  No, exact.
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:25.800]  But he needs to institutionalize this, because remember, whatever Trump can do, he'll be there
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:28.080]  four years or eight years.
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:32.720]  And we need to institutionalize the changes so the successor just doesn't walk in and
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:34.840]  then undo everything.
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:38.480]  That's very important because the country's going to live a lot longer than Bruce Fine
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:40.240]  or Alex Jones and anyone else.
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:43.440]  We have to be concerned with our posterity as well.
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:47.560]  Not just, okay, we had this white shining moment for four years and went away.
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:48.560]  Well, fine.
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:52.040]  It's like the Aurora Borealis shines once and then goes away.
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:56.560]  We've got to understand that the reason why Alex Jones and Bruce Fine enjoying freedoms
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:59.240]  because hundreds of years ago, people sacrificed.
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:00.320]  They fought hard.
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:02.600]  We need to institutionalize liberty.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:07.240]  We can't trust that George Washington will occupy the presidency forever or that James
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:09.520]  Madison will be writing the Bill of Rights.
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.160]  We have to plan that government will be largely populated by NAVES, and therefore, let's build
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:15.660]  these institutions.
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.120]  That's why we have freedom today.
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  They had that foresight.
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:19.480]  They made the sacrifices.
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:25.200]  We have to do the same now to make sure that the progress we make is put in institutionalized
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:26.200]  forms.
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:27.200]  This really is America's...
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:28.200] ...by the personality.
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:34.440]  This really could be America's reboot 2.0 relaunch if we do it and really will steer the course
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:39.040]  of human destiny in our most critical time as we unlock the secrets of science, life-extension
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:40.440]  technologies, all of it.
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:44.720]  I know talking to some people in Washington, the word is there's a lot of suppressed technology
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:49.000]  that's seen as disruptive that the regulators have also blocked because it was done through
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.120]  university research.
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:52.800]  The government claims it owns it and has shelved it.
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:57.360]  The word is Trump is also getting ready to just start dumping massive technology out
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  on the market.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.640]  Well, listen, that would be great.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:06.880]  I think that because if you look at the history of economic prosperity and innovation, Alex,
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.960]  it comes not by at the increment saving a few pennies.
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:16.080]  It comes from what Schumpeter called the acts of creative destruction.
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:21.120]  This innovation and genius makes whole new ways of doing business and new products, so
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:22.120]  they destroy.
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:25.280]  I mean, that's what's happening, I think, in the news business right now.
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:31.760]  The internet and social media is making newspapers in some sense obsolete, and it's much...
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:34.520]  People have much greater access to it.
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:36.760]  We need to get the government out of the way.
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:40.400]  One of the things I'm worried about is the government's going to get into the regulations
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:43.400]  under the name of cyberspace or cybersecurity.
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:47.120]  Then they're going to be telling everybody, well, this is what you can do to encrypt XYZ
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  and...
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:49.120]  That's right.
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:52.240]  That's another angle we've got to watch with Trump because he's got good advisors, but
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:54.520]  I don't think he's very tech savvy.
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:58.960]  We could lose our free speech by way of quote, as you said, cybersecurity.
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:00.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:01.720]  We could use that.
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.640]  I mean, we already had an instance where the FBI was telling Apple, you know, you need
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:09.080]  to develop software in order to help us break into your system.
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:13.520]  I mean, you're forcing a company to become an agent of the federal government, and having
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:18.840]  worked in the government, Alex, I tell you, the technology is like five generations behind
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:22.800]  time because the government does not attract the best and the brightest, the people who
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:30.000]  are uncomfortable with suffocating regulations that fit for a five-year-old.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:33.720]  So the people who are really gifted, and because you can't pay them anything either, everyone's
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:37.960]  got to get paid the same, even the geniuses get paid the same as the drones.
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:42.160]  They lose the really, really good people, so they're always way, way behind.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:46.480]  I remember when I was at Justice Department, the immigration service at the time of our
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:52.800]  hostage takeover in Tehran with Iran in 1980, they still had the records of immigrants in
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:59.960]  the United States on postcards with pencils being used to write down the information.
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:06.040]  I said, really, our immigration, we have postcards with pencils, now it's like a hundred years
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:11.640]  out of date, and all the computers were way, way behind what the modern technology was,
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:16.560]  and so if we had the government in the fiber space, we are going to be third-rate.
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:21.760]  It always will be way, way behind the scene, and that's why when you describe, well, the
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.840]  government doesn't want to permit the private sector to do X, Y, Z because it can destroy
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:28.240]  or upset some government program.
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:31.560]  You've got to get the government out of that, and you're right, even if he himself isn't
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:37.200]  peck-sappy, I think he understands even being in real estate, what marvelous advantages
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.480]  that come because he's got all sorts of gadgets he can put in his real estate building that
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:46.240]  turn the temperature on time, they put the Starbucks coffees on time, and they regulate
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:51.080]  everything and the security is better because you've got many, many ways to prevent any
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:53.840]  kind of trespassing and all those sorts of things.
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:58.840]  And then again, government wants backdoors and all of it to spy, which is unconstitutional,
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:03.960]  plus street hackers are better than the government every time on average and end up using that
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:08.120]  to make these entire systems that would make us safer, make us completely penetrated.
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:11.560]  That's what we have to build in a backdoor.
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:15.640]  I can guarantee you that backdoor will be known to every hacker in the world far faster
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:19.880]  than the government will be able to use the darn thing, but all I'm saying is that these
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:25.360]  are the kinds of things to say we need to institutionalize and that's what, and I urge
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.400]  Mr. Trump to think about ways that's more than just his unilateral decision.
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:35.280]  We need the executive branch as a bureaucracy to embrace these things, so when he's gone.
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:40.520]  Well, he said it, he said we're going to devolve this back to the people and back to the states
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:44.120]  and we're going to have 50 states that compete with each other now and we're not going to
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:46.640]  have one-sided trade deals, which it's so true.
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:51.240]  These trade deals are not free trade deals, they're all done with a bureaucratic class
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:52.800]  to pick the winners and losers.
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.320]  I'm all for real free trade, but I've got to tell you, it's not free trade.
[1:44:57.320 --> 1:45:02.600]  As you know, when China has a lower corporate tax than ours, do you support obviously equalizing
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:04.360]  the global corporate tax?
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:10.800]  Well, the fact is, Alex, there's never going to be perfect equality across the state line.
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.440]  There's not going to be, because every country has different welfare, they get different
[1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:20.960]  educational systems, environmental standards, infrastructure, so it's kind of a, but we
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:28.120]  do know this about how the process works in negotiating the trade deals.
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:34.080]  It's the crony capitalism, the people who end up writing the fine print, who gets the
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:38.680]  benefits and who doesn't, other ones who got, you know, who write out the big checks.
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:43.600]  And all Trump's saying is, we're going to write this in America and in Congress and
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.840]  in the States, we're not going to hand it to some secret TPP.
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:48.480]  Let's say it was the best thing since sliced bread.
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:52.040]  It was done in secret and you're going to dictate to us, that sounds worse than King
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:53.040]  George.
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:54.040]  It is.
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:58.380]  And more, not only that, Alex, the way in which the statutes operated that once the
[1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:02.760]  president submitted it, it's got, it has the so-called fast track, which is another
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:06.320]  euphemism for Mussolini type of tactics in the Italian parliament.
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:07.320]  Wow.
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:12.800]  I mean, they take a thousand page documents and say, okay, you have a maximum, a maximum,
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:16.960]  you know, of 10 hours to debate it, 10 hours, and it automatically comes out of committee
[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:19.320]  and you can't amend it at all.
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:20.320]  I mean, really?
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:24.440]  So the executive then dictates the parliamentary procedures for Congress.
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:27.040]  I wrote in that I was saying this is unconstitutional.
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:30.880]  The executive can't tell the Congress how it's supposed to address something that's
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.520]  submitted as a statute.
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:36.440]  Each house has its own plenary authority over its own rules.
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:41.080]  And to take these very complicated thousand plus page statutes and say, all right, you
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:43.880]  have, you know, 10 hours to debate it is ridiculous.
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:44.880]  Exactly.
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:45.880]  Let me throw something out here.
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:46.880]  Yeah.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:49.120]  You made me just think of something I hadn't thought of.
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:52.680]  Ron Paul had said on the show a month ago, he said, one of the big tests of Trump will
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:57.440]  be will he start devolving this executive power back to the States, back to the Congress,
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:46:59.720]  you know, back where it's supposed to be.
[1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:07.120]  Trump just handed over a bunch of his ill-gotten authority that Obama had swindled and horn-swoggled.
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:10.720]  He didn't just shoot down TPP because it was unconstitutional and secret.
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:15.680]  He could have gotten behind it and had a bigger stick over corporations and people.
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.440]  He just passed a huge test.
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:21.240]  Yes, I certainly agree with that.
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:26.480]  The TPP, and this is also the World Trade Organization, it gets almost open-ended authority
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:29.160]  to the president to decide how he responds.
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:34.240]  If he wants to violate a regulation, then he can impose burdens on particular segments
[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:37.120]  of the American economy without any restrictions whatsoever.
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:43.480]  He can pick and choose his friends and his enemies and give them wealth or make them
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:46.800]  impoverished, and these trade deals are exactly that.
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.400]  That's limitless executive power on steroids.
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:50.400]  Wow.
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:52.160]  Well, sir, I want to thank you for your time.
[1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:56.960]  I'd like to get you on soon just to talk about history and how it repeats, how it rhymes.
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.240]  Let's talk about some of your latest books.
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:01.800]  Let's talk about Constitution and Peril, the Life and Death Struggle of our Constitution.
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:05.800]  But, I mean, let's get more into the American Empire before the fall.
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:10.960]  I think this is God giving us a last gasp, a chance to get back on the rails before we
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:12.680]  go over the cliff.
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:14.360]  Give me your view on that and talk about your book.
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:17.520]  Well, I think that's exactly right, Alex.
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:22.560]  Empires, they become arrogant and believe that their greatness is in ruling the world
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.240]  rather than setting an example that sends tremors throughout the globe because you're
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.760]  establishing a standard of liberty that excites all people everywhere.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:36.160]  You don't need to have a bayonet to excite liberty in the breast of anybody no matter
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:38.080]  where they're living.
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.040]  We are falling in as other empires and this idea that our greatness is telling other people
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:46.360]  how to live their lives and accepting all borders of the world.
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:53.920]  Right now, as we speak, we have special forces, 80,000 troops in 130 countries, 130 training
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:59.520]  them to do X, Y, Z or whatever, not making us safe, purporting them to enable Kabul to
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:03.320]  be safe, or Beijing to be safe, or Manila to be safe, or Seoul.
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:07.920]  Wait a minute, I don't have any objection to them being safe, but if it's our soldiers,
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:13.280]  our money and our lives on the line, they should be making only one country safe, the
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:17.360]  United States of America, and have invincible self-defense.
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:22.240]  We should never have to rely, ever, Alex, on the alliance, the friendship of any other
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:23.240]  nation.
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:26.120]  Well, of course, and now look at how NATO and Europe and China and everybody are in
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:31.080]  our business and the Democrats are cheerleading going, please, Chinese president at Davos,
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.680]  make Trump behave, don't they get how inherently idiotic that is?
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:37.760]  And then, of course, if you build a global army and global system, it's going to end
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:40.200]  up swallowing you up and you're going to pay for it.
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:45.040]  I mean, this is a, we've been colonized by our own corporate colonization.
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:52.000]  Globalism to me is an unelected global corporate colonization and basically strip mining of
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.440]  the wealthy nations and exploitation of the third world.
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.280]  Everything they do is the most dirty, twisted, oppressive thing I can imagine because there's
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:02.600]  no competition or transparency involved.
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:07.000]  Well, that's true, and the other element that comes into play here, and it means symbolic
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:11.360]  but very important, Alex, and that is, you know, the issue of, well, President Trump
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:15.840]  doesn't read the president's daily brief, he doesn't have the intelligence committee
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.400]  come over every day and try to instruct him like he's going to pass a test in a high school
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:22.400]  history test.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:26.760]  Well, the fact is, out in presidential daily briefs, you know what they consist of?
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:30.360]  He, the president gets up and the first thing he starts worrying about, well, what happened
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:35.280]  in Ho Chi Minh City, what happened in New York, what happened in Ho Chi Minh City, and there's
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:39.320]  no mention of what happened in the United States.
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:43.960]  He should trash the president's daily brief and actually get up and read what's happening
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:48.960]  in Detroit, in Chicago, in Washington, in New York, in Boston, and how to make the United
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:49.960]  States better.
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:54.280]  This idea that his mind is preoccupied with what's happening all over the globe and in
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:56.520]  Mars and Neptune is utterly ridiculous.
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:51:01.120]  It's an example of how we've been taken over by the military-industrial counterterrorism
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:06.800]  complex, multi-trillion dollars to basically make people angry at us, squander money on
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:08.560]  weapons that will never be used.
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:13.440]  We got 19 aircraft carriers looking for places to house, and meanwhile, impoverishing the
[1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:17.320]  American people, we don't have the infrastructure, we don't have the airports we ought to have,
[1:51:17.320 --> 1:51:21.240]  the roads we ought to have, all those sorts of things that we'd have ample money to do
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:28.440]  if we weren't squandering as much as 10 trillion dollars since 9-11 on these utterly ridiculous
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:29.440]  escapades.
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:30.440]  Well Bruce, fine.
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.440]  You're on...
[1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:36.440]  You're on fire right now, and I totally agree with you, and former Congressman Dr. Ron
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:40.840]  Paul is on tomorrow, he put out a piece saying, look, I like the fact that Trump didn't want
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:44.120]  war with Russia, but he's being inconsistent here, bombing ISIS.
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:48.840]  Well, I am anti-war if it's offensive and we start it.
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:54.440]  But I mean, sure, you know, the foreign power attacks, we have to, and if Obama and Hillary
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:51:59.760]  and the neocons created this jihad army to take over the Middle East, that's been declassified.
[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:00.760]  Don't we have a responsibility?
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:03.600]  I mean, I love how Trump says, let the Russians do it.
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:06.120]  That's a really libertarian thing to do.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:09.840]  It's in their backyard, it's in their sphere, so it seems like he's doing the perfect thing.
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:14.880]  I'm not disagreeing with Congressman Paul, and of course he, former Congressman, he put
[1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:20.640]  a question mark on that as well for the focus of debate, so I think it's a complex issue
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:21.640]  and a complex question.
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:26.480]  Well, I've written about this right now because I'm trying to get Congress to step up, and
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:30.680]  we need to have wars, as you just pointed out, Alex, self-defense.
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:34.480]  Everybody, every human being, every nation has a right to fight in self-defense.
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:39.000]  If you're attacked or you're imminently about to be attacked, you can go kill, and that's
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  totally legitimate.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.360]  That's the rule of nature.
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:45.440]  But the problem, we are provoking other people.
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:51.480]  Alex, we had not any Muslim countries attacking us when we stayed out of their backyard.
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:56.400]  We were out of all the, we didn't want to control all the oil lanes, and going into Saudi Arabia
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:53:01.160]  and all these countries, and having the military industrial complex, get all the oil and the
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.840]  riches and all those sorts of things.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:08.040]  If you, these people are crazy, and if you leave them alone, they kill themselves in
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:13.360]  international warfare, as bad as ISIS is in al-Qaeda, they kill Muslims far more frequently
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:16.600]  than Jews and Christians and Americans.
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:21.400]  And our stupidity is not staying back, like Fabian, you know, Fabian defeated Hannibal
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:24.400]  by just, hey, listen, we've got self-defense up.
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:27.040]  Don't interrupt someone while they're destroying themselves.
[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:28.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:31.760]  Don't interrupt them while they're kill and shoot themselves.
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:36.080]  The only thing that gives them unity was the same kind of deal with Castro and Cuba.
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:39.920]  Well, Castro had was, okay, hey, we don't want the United States telling us what to do since
[1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:41.920]  the Platte Amendment in 1903.
[1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:45.600]  We had just said, I'm convinced he'd have been overthrown, said, you know what, you're
[1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:48.120]  a wretch, and your people are going to overthrow you.
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:52.280]  We're not going to give you an excuse, you know, to blame us on all of your follies,
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:57.080]  which of course, we're totally fallacious justifications Fidel gave, and that is what
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:53:58.080]  we fail to recognize.
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:02.840]  It's not that these are angelic people, they're not, they're devils, but if you leave devils
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:04.680]  alone, they'll kill themselves.
[1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:06.120]  Right now, right now,
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:09.560]  I mean, it's killed room itself, making Rome.
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  Sure.
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:15.280]  I mean, I agree with you, but my point to Dr. Poltomar is just that if we did help stir
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:19.280]  this up, Trump's not even trying to grab the oil, he's just trying to kick them out of
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:24.520]  Syria and then let Russia handle that and then pull back so he can put a plug in where
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:27.120]  they're all coming into Europe.
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:30.960]  Well the fact is, if we, one of the reasons why they're going into Europe is because we
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:33.920]  destroyed Libya, you know, we totally agree.
[1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:38.800]  You know, you got two million, so we're in this very awkward situation now, right?
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:43.400]  In some sense, we created the mess and it's kind of cowardly to walk away and put all
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:49.160]  these people we put in jeopardy and say, sorry, it's your problem, but that's the least
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:51.320]  bad solution.
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:54.040]  The cures can be worse than the disease.
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:58.840]  So you're saying cut it loose and let Russia get out of there, you know, it's like how
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:00.160]  we had to end up.
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:04.920]  We left Vietnam in a very miserable way, you know, skids and the boat people, whatever,
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:09.840]  but what, what, what was going to be gained by sticking around, nothing, nothing.
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:11.560]  And we survived hell right now.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:13.800]  We use, excuse my vulgarity here.
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:18.320]  We're supporting Vietnam, you know, they are a great ally against China, if you talk
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:19.320]  about it.
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:20.320]  Sure.
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:21.320]  Totally Machiavellian.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:24.040]  Well, powerful, Bruce Fine, always great to get a history lesson from because it integrates
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.840]  into what's happening today.
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:26.840]  Thank you so much for the time.
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:27.840]  All right.
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:28.840]  Have a wonderful show.
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:29.840]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:30.840]  All right.
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:34.280]  And you want to know where Ron Paul gets a lot of his reasoning.
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:39.120]  That's his main confidant, really smart guy, obviously, and he's absolutely right, but
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.400]  Bruce doesn't want to go there.
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:41.880]  I'll go there.
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:44.600]  The globalist had a plan and I don't blame our military.
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:46.360]  They always say, Oh, you hate the military.
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:47.360]  No, I don't.
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:54.040]  They sent them in to take out the non radical Islam folks like Saddam and Gaddafi and the
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:58.960]  leader Assad there in Syria and then put Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is one of the main
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:00.920]  funders of our government.
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:01.920]  That's well known.
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.920]  They want this.
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:04.120]  And it's a long term plan.
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:07.840]  They stage down 11 with the deep state.
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:08.840]  And this plan is all coming out.
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:12.920]  General Flynn is telling Trump this, by the way, Trump knows this to the 28 pages.
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:17.640]  And then the plan, basically from there goes, once they collapse up to the borders of Europe,
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:18.640]  Europe then opens up.
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:19.640]  This is a UN plan.
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:24.440]  It's admitted run by Peter Sutherland and others and then flood Europe and say, Oh,
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:25.640]  the Muslims are here now.
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:27.880]  We can't have free speech because that makes them kill us.
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:32.140]  So we have to submit to them, basically, so the socialist, the communist and the deep
[1:56:32.140 --> 1:56:40.600]  state that uses the Islamist as their new armor, as their new weapon.
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:45.200]  And breaking senior secret service agents suggest she wouldn't take a bullet for Trump.
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:49.840]  See, they've got political operatives inserted in the secret services of the Washington examiner.
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.400]  That's why I say secret services, a lot of great people in them.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:55.640]  I know they gave us key intel on Hillary.
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:57:00.960]  The problem is it's infiltrated with operatives of the Democrats.
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:04.520]  And so we've got a big, big, big, big problem here.
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:06.720]  We'll tell you more about this when we start the next hour.
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:10.200]  I'm going to open the phones up, take your calls and cover a ton of clips.
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:15.160]  Briefly, if you want to support this broadcast and have a piece of history, the famous artist,
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:19.480]  you can read all about him at infowarstore.com, that is the official artist for the Republican
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:25.800]  Party that did the big famous portrait of Reagan that hangs in the Reagan Library.
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:28.160]  We've got some b-roll of this.
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:35.200]  He has given us the exclusive on 2,000 of these lithograph prints.
[1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:39.440]  And this is a one-of-a-kind portrait done in person with Donald Trump.
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:43.640]  When the 2,000 are gone, they're gone, they'll have to sit down again and do a new portrait
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:44.640]  of Trump.
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:45.640]  But this is the big one.
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:51.600]  The iconic Ronald Reagan one we've had hanging here in the hallway, and it goes with it right
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:52.600]  beside it.
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:54.240]  We're not selling that yet, but I think we should bring that back.
[1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:55.480]  But again, it's a limited edition.
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:59.880]  And when I saw the price we've got on it, again, this would be hundreds and hundreds
[1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:07.760]  of dollars at many different art places, different art galleries and framed.
[1:58:07.760 --> 1:58:09.600]  People could buy this for thousands.
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  But it's $19.95.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:14.480]  I mean, I've got to tell you, I want to fund a Washington bureau with a few reporters in
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:17.040]  there, and I want to expand this year in the face of the globalists.
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  You can see they're expanding.
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:19.040]  The fight is on.
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:20.720]  So I want to bring in some major capitals.
[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:22.320]  Everybody should get one of these.
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:26.040]  Everybody should check out the new risotticals, infowarslife.com, infostore.com, or cultural
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:28.680]  free, 888-253-33139.
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:33.760]  Check out the new 21st century one-of-a-kind exclusive nanotech body armor that weighs
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:38.360]  five times less and costs less than the big steel plates and works just as good.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:39.360]  Check it out.
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:40.360]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:41.360]  History's happening.
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:46.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:51.560]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:52.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:57.280]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:01.400]  products of 2017, and seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:05.040]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:07.320]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:11.520]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:16.360]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:20.760]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.000]  even airplanes.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:26.040]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:29.000]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:33.840]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:37.240]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:39.320]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[1:59:39.320 --> 1:59:45.080]  Even better, use coupon code private at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[1:59:45.080 --> 1:59:47.480]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:53.480]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[1:59:53.480 --> 2:00:22.480]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:24.640]  You are receiving this transmission.
[2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:26.440]  You are the Resistance.
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:30.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:32.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:37.680]  So the Communist Chinese government, it's on infowars.com, has officially come out and
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:41.840]  said, we'll prop up world government, we'll keep America in line.
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:45.280]  So our money, our tax money, built this big corporate world government.
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.200]  The corporations are giving the power, and now they're saying, okay, the Chinese will
[2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:56.000]  keep America in line, and oh no, our power's falling, oh no, they're going to bully us.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:00.480]  Just like the EU says, they're going to bully the UK because they want to leave the EU that's
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:02.720]  unelected.
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:03.720]  They are the bullies.
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:09.480]  And if you go out on the street, at any of these anti-Trump, anti-America demonstrations,
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:13.040]  that doesn't mean Trump or the American first crowd is perfect, but let me tell you, we're
[2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:14.440]  not out to get you.
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:15.440]  We're trying to be good.
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:16.440]  We're trying to be strong.
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:17.440]  We're trying to be honorable.
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:21.240]  We're trying to follow our better angels.
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:26.040]  If you go out among these people, you're an FNY male, I hate you, I'm going to get you,
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:29.960]  you're a scum, you're a trash, you're a filth, you're probably the worst person in the world,
[2:01:29.960 --> 2:01:31.720]  I hate you.
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:40.840]  And just attacking people, they'll attack you and go, love not hate, love Trumps, hate.
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:48.320]  And you're like, that's an oxymoron, ask you.
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:51.560]  And they're a cult and they're scared.
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:53.440]  They believe they exist because of the globalists.
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:55.960]  They have been so brainwashed, so coddled.
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:57.320]  It's a nightmare situation.
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:02.000]  I asked Darren McBreen and Rob Jacobson together to put together a compilation of just the
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:06.560]  madness of day one of what they did, how they demonized, how they've lied about Trump, the
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:08.400]  way they act, the way they behave.
[2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:09.400]  They've done it.
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:14.640]  We're going to come back in the next segment, we're going to play it, and then we are going
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:17.160]  to go to break and come back and take your phone calls.
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:19.240]  I went to Troyer, he's going to host the fourth hour.
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:22.520]  I suggest he takes a lot of calls, he can obviously, always has a lot of new breaking
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:29.520]  news and information to cover, but the toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99-231-800-2599-231.
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:36.280]  You know, I was just thinking earlier about, oh, by the way, first-time callers, or if
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:38.400]  you were down there in the inauguration.
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:40.000]  Hey, maybe you disagree with me.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:41.840]  I'm not going to try to censor your speech.
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:45.280]  If you disagree with me, I'll also put you on air.
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:50.640]  800-25-99-231.
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:56.600]  But I really think about the fact that I always thought people were good like I was, and it
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.520]  doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:05.520]  I'm a very worldly person when it comes to eating and drinking, and let's just say I'm
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:07.560]  certainly not gay.
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:11.320]  But the point is, nothing against gay people, you know what I mean, the point is, is that
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:18.760]  I'm not out to get anybody, ladies and gentlemen, and I think I'm saying I'm just saying I like
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:21.560]  God's creation on the feminine side.
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:29.240]  But these people are crazy, ladies and gentlemen, absolutely out of their minds, and they believe
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:34.400]  they're unhappy because of us, and it is classic projection, and you're looking into their
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:41.000]  souls and seeing how absolutely desperate and freaked out and crazy they are.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:44.840]  And so many times I'd be looking in their eyes, men and women, but mainly women, there
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:49.840]  was a quote, women's march, and they would look at me and like kind of freak out and
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:54.880]  kind of not know what to do, and then they just go, ah, you're evil, you're hateful.
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:56.960]  And I never played this yesterday.
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:01.000]  I asked them to cue it up like five times, but maybe when we come in, come in, fade down
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:06.160]  music and play the most bizarre thing you'll ever see, but I saw a lot of this, just total
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:07.480]  mental illness.
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:12.400]  This wasn't really good street art because this was so desperate and mentally ill and
[2:04:12.400 --> 2:04:19.520]  fallen and disjointed and programmed to fail that this is the spirit.
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:23.880]  When I was about 10 or 11, I kind of for a little while listened to some darker heavy
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:29.960]  metal, thought the devil might be cool, and my dad one time was like, you think the devil's
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:30.960]  cool?
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:31.960]  Let me draw you a picture of the devil.
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:36.600]  And he drew this picture of this little drooling, weak zombie that was all pathetic and had
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  no power.
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:40.360]  He said, that's the devil, fallen and weak.
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:47.960]  And it was so true, I'll never forget that picture that my dad drew, and now I'm seeing
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:48.960]  it.
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:51.080]  I mean, it is just, it's very sad actually.
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:56.000]  This is what the devil does to people, because the devil hates how beautiful we are because
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:00.720]  we're made in the image of God with a capital G.
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:05.400]  The Associated Press is reporting this week that former President Barack Obama was releasing
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:10.360]  money right and left hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office on Friday.
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:15.280]  On Friday morning, he released $221 million in U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:18.400]  on the morning just hours before he was set to leave office.
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:23.120]  Now, one State Department official and several congressional aides say that the Obama Administration
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:27.000]  formally notified Congress it's going to be spending that money on Friday morning just
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.240]  hours before Donald Trump became president.
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:34.400]  Now, also, more than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at the same time,
[2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:39.360]  including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.2 million for UN organizations.
[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:45.480]  Now, GOP lawmakers have placed holds on the Palestinian funds, but not on everything else.
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:48.920]  Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch, but they're not legally
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:49.920]  binding.
[2:05:49.920 --> 2:05:54.040]  Now, it looks like Obama's funding spree, all of it is going to be going through and
[2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:57.720]  he did this literally hours before Donald Trump had taken the office.
[2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:27.680]  Well, I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.

[2:08:20.980 --> 2:08:27.540]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones
[2:08:29.780 --> 2:08:36.180]  Your phones calls coming up phones are open and the start of the next segment 800 259
[2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:40.260]  9231 800 259 9231 I
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.020]  Was just thinking during the break
[2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:50.020]  About how truly amazing and historical and massive
[2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:56.060]  The events are happening in this world right now all over the planet a human awakening to the globalist
[2:08:56.300 --> 2:08:58.580]  Technocracy to the tyrannical world government
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:07.420]  It's exciting they admit their whole plan is collapsing their different criminal enterprises their monopoly systems that are designed to make us poor
[2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:12.300]  And I've always said this and the reason I repeat it is not because I'm going oh look
[2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:19.740]  I've been proven right. It's because the battle has just begun, but we have the weapons that are unstoppable in this fight
[2:09:20.580 --> 2:09:24.540]  history and justice and honor and prosperity and the truth
[2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:31.220]  The globalists are selling lies and bondage and division and servitude
[2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:34.060]  Why would anybody want to go along with that?
[2:09:37.620 --> 2:09:40.660]  There's a private corporate world government
[2:09:40.660 --> 2:09:42.660]  Waging war against humanity
[2:09:46.660 --> 2:09:49.660]  And if we simply keep calling it out, it's done
[2:09:52.660 --> 2:10:01.660]  They tried to deny it for 50 years as they built it and as it got more control and suck more off the people and then got so arrogant and announced a total takeover of everything
[2:10:02.660 --> 2:10:07.660]  And the entire world including intelligence agencies and militaries said we're not going along with this
[2:10:07.660 --> 2:10:14.660]  Mainly because it's anti-prosperity what type of planetary tyranny are we going to live under when it kills prosperity?
[2:10:14.660 --> 2:10:19.660]  They were smart. They would have totally delivered prosperity then pulled the rug out
[2:10:19.660 --> 2:10:24.660]  That's why you don't want a global government because you can always get something bad that gets control of it Bruce finally talking about that earlier
[2:10:24.660 --> 2:10:26.660]  You always want firewalls
[2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:33.660]  It's like in a ship or in a building so that if tyranny gets going in one country or one state it can be contained
[2:10:33.660 --> 2:10:37.660]  You want choices. You want a place to run to like 50 states
[2:10:39.660 --> 2:10:42.660]  The American system is incredible. I want to get to this report, but but if you're a radio listener
[2:10:43.660 --> 2:10:46.660]  This video was posted over the weekend at info horse.com. I just never got to it
[2:10:46.660 --> 2:10:49.660]  It's one of the most saddening appalling things you'll ever see
[2:10:50.660 --> 2:10:54.660]  It's one of the more mentally ill protesters, but this was this was in the extreme
[2:10:54.660 --> 2:11:01.660]  This was in the you know 90th percentile of insanity, but the 50th percentile the average rate of death is
[2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:08.660]  The 50th percentile the average was just howling you're an effing white male that I'm gonna die kill Trump
[2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:14.660]  Nazis are killing us. Oh, I love Islam. Oh, I have a clip info wars.com
[2:11:15.660 --> 2:11:22.660]  Anti-Trump feminist shant Allah Akbar during protests in Germany the operating system they've got because they've been turned into such slaves
[2:11:23.660 --> 2:11:29.660]  They still need a human operating system and even though Islam in its orthodox form is very radical very primitive very stone age
[2:11:29.660 --> 2:11:34.660]  They worship a patriarchal total control system. That's their man
[2:11:35.660 --> 2:11:41.660]  But he's only letting them off the leash to feel big and they look back to their pimp Islam even they're not Islamic and say
[2:11:42.660 --> 2:11:45.660]  Look, I'm with the Islamist system. They go. Oh, you bet you are sweetheart
[2:11:46.660 --> 2:11:49.660]  And the Islamist is Saudi Arabia and others got caught as well as Hamas
[2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:56.660]  Funding this event the so-called women's march. I mean who could make that up radical feminists that hate males of any type
[2:11:56.660 --> 2:12:04.660]  And think that if you have a weenie or evil and that Trump is oppressing women for locker room talk that was edited
[2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:09.660]  But putting women into slavery they're fine. I would talk to them. They were okay with it
[2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:15.660]  So I'm gonna play the Allah bar in a minute, but first let's play the deranged
[2:12:16.660 --> 2:12:17.660]  very very sad
[2:12:20.660 --> 2:12:23.660]  Person that was out on inauguration night Friday
[2:12:23.660 --> 2:12:30.660]  Friday for hours reportedly just just running around flopping around the street in total mental illness. Here it is
[2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:45.660]  I got in there right there. She just she's blowing on a on a flute a homemade flute and just flopping around and again
[2:12:45.660 --> 2:12:48.660]  You see this this this desperate mental illness this disjointedness
[2:12:48.660 --> 2:12:55.660]  Not even in reality total psychotic break and this person is only one step below her other cohorts
[2:13:00.660 --> 2:13:05.660]  But this mentally ill person like like in a lunatic sound they tend to feed off each other
[2:13:05.660 --> 2:13:07.660]  She's in the midst of all these other lunatics
[2:13:08.660 --> 2:13:13.660]  Who are just all jahiri throughout the bus. Yeah, no one there was no crowds here. Ha ha you didn't have a crowd
[2:13:13.660 --> 2:13:19.660]  You know, they were there knowing it was a giant crowd. I was in the airport and so is my crew just cheering women everywhere celebrating
[2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:23.660]  Did you see did you see no crowd? I'm flying out Saturday. I'm like, what is that?
[2:13:23.660 --> 2:13:26.660]  And I'm like, I'll get to the bottom of this when I get off the plane in Austin
[2:13:26.660 --> 2:13:31.660]  I get off and walk in and go to info wars. There's articles exposing how they did it, but I mean
[2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:37.660]  Again, they think it's like a game like look we lie better than you do and we're like we want to be credible
[2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:40.660]  That's why people listen to us. It's not who can tell the best lie
[2:13:40.660 --> 2:13:43.660]  We don't even like to make mistakes on accident
[2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:49.660]  Like I shout out fake news and then they're like putting stuff out that I was
[2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:55.660]  Arrested and thrown out that's been on NPR. It's been on TV. It's been in a bunch of newspapers
[2:13:56.660 --> 2:14:02.660]  And they show a photo of the police protecting me in July of 2006 2016
[2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.660]  I mean, it's next level. I can't even keep track of it. I have family calling
[2:14:07.660 --> 2:14:11.660]  Going, wow, does Trump still like you after you got arrested doing a disturbance?
[2:14:11.660 --> 2:14:14.660]  Alex, why'd you do a disturbance at the inauguration?
[2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:21.660]  And at a certain point, you know, you got some cousin on the phone or whatever you just go, that's fake news
[2:14:21.660 --> 2:14:23.660]  Well, wait, I saw the police arresting you
[2:14:24.660 --> 2:14:28.660]  And I just said, listen, I got to go and then my lawyer calls last night
[2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:33.660]  Says how did how the inauguration go? Did you really get arrested?
[2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:38.660]  I said, where'd you see it? He goes, I didn't see it hurt on the radio and I got calls from people
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:49.660]  It does make you feel insane. No, I mean, they show a photo of me and the police from last year
[2:14:49.660 --> 2:14:51.660]  And I was they said I was arrested there
[2:14:56.660 --> 2:14:59.660]  Then they added I was drunk. The police got me because I was drunk
[2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:03.660]  Then they feedback their own lives and run up and go, aha, you're drinking
[2:15:04.660 --> 2:15:09.660]  It's like it's like little kids imagining that they're superheroes or imagining they've defeated you
[2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:13.660]  Like when you're three years old, imagining you can jump off the porch and defeat Superman or whatever
[2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:19.660]  Because you're Lex Luthor. I mean, it's just total fantasy land of a bunch of arrested development loons
[2:15:19.660 --> 2:15:21.660]  Living in another world
[2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:26.660]  I was trying like all the women and children you beat up to get into the inauguration
[2:15:26.660 --> 2:15:32.660]  And you were there admittedly putting out flyers saying we're gonna block people and block Trump getting in
[2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:35.660]  I mean Trump supporters and that's indeed what you did
[2:15:36.660 --> 2:15:43.660]  And then you turned that around to the opposite that we were attacking women or that we got arrested
[2:15:44.660 --> 2:15:47.660]  And they just live in a total fantasy land where they tell the lies
[2:15:47.660 --> 2:15:51.660]  But like 1984 as soon as they've issued them from their mouth
[2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:57.660]  They then defend them and believe them. Let me tell you it is very bizarre to see CNN still saying
[2:15:57.660 --> 2:15:59.660]  Sean Spicer is wrong
[2:15:59.660 --> 2:16:03.660]  Trump is wrong and that those are real photos of the inauguration
[2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:07.660]  I was there the crowd went all the way back to the monument where it was blocked off
[2:16:07.660 --> 2:16:12.660]  And it was spilling out and hundreds of thousands couldn't get in because they were blocking the damn entrances
[2:16:12.660 --> 2:16:17.660]  Excuse me Lord. I mean I cannot take this anymore. I was there
[2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:22.660]  You are liars 2 plus 2 equals 4 2 plus 2 equals 4
[2:16:22.660 --> 2:16:26.660]  And I know that's the truth you people are mentally ill
[2:16:30.660 --> 2:16:34.660]  And I don't even hate these people that's I don't hate that weird crazy person flopping around the street
[2:16:34.660 --> 2:16:37.660]  That is a victim. What has happened to our people?
[2:16:39.660 --> 2:16:42.660]  It's like that HBO special I saw like eight nine years ago. I forget the name of it
[2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:46.660]  And this guy's put cigarettes out on her beating her making her have sex with 20 guys a day
[2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:50.660]  And he's been hit but run for my car and the pimps in there going you better get up hurry on the street
[2:16:50.660 --> 2:16:54.660]  She's a baby. I'm sorry, baby. I'm gonna get back on that street. I'm gonna do it for you
[2:16:54.660 --> 2:16:59.660]  He's like you better get back on the street and her mother's there nice church lady nice black church lady
[2:16:59.660 --> 2:17:02.660]  And she's like what have you done to my baby?
[2:17:02.660 --> 2:17:06.660]  You a brainwaster. She's like get out of here mama. He's a good man
[2:17:06.660 --> 2:17:12.660]  You took care of me. I mean it's like these people are pimped and broken and they've got weird Islamists
[2:17:12.660 --> 2:17:17.660]  Laughing at me with women putting hot jibs on going you're evil you hurt women
[2:17:17.660 --> 2:17:22.660]  You're a white male. We hate America. This is where you got the freedom you dumbasses
[2:17:22.660 --> 2:17:24.660]  God Almighty
[2:17:24.660 --> 2:17:26.660]  I mean whoa
[2:17:26.660 --> 2:17:28.660]  Whoa
[2:17:30.660 --> 2:17:32.660]  Let's play the oddbars
[2:17:32.660 --> 2:17:38.660]  This is women at the women's march German women hell they got public service announcements by the UN in Germany
[2:17:38.660 --> 2:17:41.660]  Telling women wear the hijab and give yourself to Islam
[2:17:41.660 --> 2:17:44.660]  Who could make that cultural suicide up?
[2:17:44.660 --> 2:17:47.660]  I mean this is wild
[2:17:47.660 --> 2:17:53.660]  Our enemy is so twisted so evil and there's not even any discussing it
[2:17:53.660 --> 2:17:55.660]  I mean this is wild
[2:17:55.660 --> 2:18:03.660]  There's not even any discussing it
[2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:08.660]  I mean they knew
[2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:15.660]  I just can't believe we're facing this level of people
[2:18:15.660 --> 2:18:20.660]  The Bible talks about evil people having a spirit wanting to be destroyed
[2:18:20.660 --> 2:18:26.660]  Wanting to be lied to wanting to see righteousness fall and that's it they're people like tune into like this mental illness
[2:18:26.660 --> 2:18:35.660]  Brainwave of just flopping around and foaming and being idiots with all these weird creepy people with with like dog style haircuts
[2:18:35.660 --> 2:18:43.660]  You know that like like clown haircuts like David Brock who just puts out idiotic nonsense and then these minions take it and just repeat it
[2:18:43.660 --> 2:18:49.660]  David Brock could go out on the street in front of these women and you know
[2:18:49.660 --> 2:18:56.660]  Pull a cork out of his rear end and put 50 pounds of feces on the ground and tell those women that it was pumpkin pie
[2:18:56.660 --> 2:18:58.660]  They'd get down their knees and eat it
[2:18:58.660 --> 2:19:02.660]  I don't mean that to be gross man sometimes you got to have gross analogies because it is gross
[2:19:02.660 --> 2:19:04.660]  The lies they're putting out are gross
[2:19:04.660 --> 2:19:09.660]  They're disgusting and it's weird and I don't know how we've had little scumbags like this
[2:19:09.660 --> 2:19:12.660]  Dictating to us for so long
[2:19:12.660 --> 2:19:18.660]  I mean thank God there's a global overthrow of the sycophant demons
[2:19:18.660 --> 2:19:20.660]  And I want everyone to redouble their efforts
[2:19:20.660 --> 2:19:23.660]  He thinks he's gonna overthrow Trump and America and the rebirth of this
[2:19:23.660 --> 2:19:32.660]  Buddy we're gonna overthrow you and you think you and your minions and all your people and and and and and and has been like Madonna
[2:19:32.660 --> 2:19:34.660]  Skip this break
[2:19:34.660 --> 2:19:36.660]  You think you
[2:19:36.660 --> 2:19:39.660]  You think you
[2:19:39.660 --> 2:19:42.660]  Can talk about doing violence to us and get away with it
[2:19:42.660 --> 2:19:44.660]  You got another thing coming
[2:19:44.660 --> 2:19:46.660]  And
[2:19:46.660 --> 2:19:49.660]  I just know how the ether works
[2:19:49.660 --> 2:19:53.660]  There's a spiritual spider webs throughout the universe and
[2:19:53.660 --> 2:19:55.660]  Tripwires and I
[2:19:55.660 --> 2:19:58.660]  I think you hit some big wires
[2:19:58.660 --> 2:20:05.660]  I think the left hits some big wires and some big spiritual things you haven't messed with or ever imagined are coming up
[2:20:05.660 --> 2:20:10.660]  Because that's what God does God goes oh you want to be evil you want to act like you're big powerful and evil
[2:20:10.660 --> 2:20:13.660]  Here just release that door over there
[2:20:13.660 --> 2:20:15.660]  Release the Kraken
[2:20:15.660 --> 2:20:17.660]  And the door
[2:20:17.660 --> 2:20:20.660]  And out comes
[2:20:20.660 --> 2:20:24.660]  What you're looking for what you I put peace out there
[2:20:24.660 --> 2:20:32.660]  I wish health and longevity to Obama and Michelle and I wish long life for you my friend and Madonna
[2:20:32.660 --> 2:20:40.660]  In fact we should pray for David Brock and Hillary and Obama and all of them just pray that if there's any life in them in any humanity left in them
[2:20:40.660 --> 2:20:48.660]  Sincerely before Jesus Christ and the father that they awaken and repent of their evil ways and realize that they're fighting good
[2:20:48.660 --> 2:20:53.660]  And so they keep doubling down on evil thinking they'll defeat us and they're destroying themselves in front of us
[2:20:53.660 --> 2:20:55.660]  And so
[2:20:55.660 --> 2:21:01.660]  Heavenly Father we know they continue down this path will defeat them even easier but I can't help but feel sorry for them
[2:21:01.660 --> 2:21:08.660]  And I apologize and repent that I say nasty things sometimes but it's just such a spectacle and I see their sin is so nasty
[2:21:08.660 --> 2:21:10.660]  That I
[2:21:10.660 --> 2:21:14.660]  I say bad things and I repent of that Lord knows I'm bad as well. So please please forgive me
[2:21:14.660 --> 2:21:16.660]  But I just don't know what to do anymore
[2:21:18.660 --> 2:21:20.660]  We should really just pray for him. I'm serious
[2:21:20.660 --> 2:21:25.660]  We should pray for them and we should pray for their slaves. We should pray for their minions because they're their slaves too
[2:21:25.660 --> 2:21:30.660]  I mean you read you read the WikiLeaks. It's like is this a joke. They admit these are real
[2:21:30.660 --> 2:21:35.660]  It's like worse than villains in a movie like I hate the public. I want to keep them in the dark and rip them off
[2:21:35.660 --> 2:21:39.660]  And let's scan everybody and commit crimes. Yeah, yeah, let's be criminals
[2:21:39.660 --> 2:21:42.660]  You just picture a bunch of gremlins hopping around like yeah
[2:21:43.660 --> 2:21:46.660]  People ask why all over the world leftist throw crap at people
[2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:49.660]  Because they want to collect that's what I said earlier
[2:21:49.660 --> 2:21:56.660]  They collect their crap they collect their piss and they go out bags of it because that's what they do and because they like playing with it
[2:21:56.660 --> 2:22:00.660]  Like crazy people in a lunatic asylum. Why don't lunatics all over the world?
[2:22:00.660 --> 2:22:04.660]  Don't care if you're in Africa or Russia or the US or you know, it doesn't matter what continent or country
[2:22:04.660 --> 2:22:10.660]  Lunatics like to eat their crap and throw it at people and these people are like that. They are fricking mentally ill
[2:22:10.660 --> 2:22:14.660]  And there's giant masses of them made mentally ill by MSM
[2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:17.660]  It's declassified the CIA and others did it to them
[2:22:18.660 --> 2:22:22.660]  And I want to say the whole CIA the people running it and Trump wants to stop all that
[2:22:24.660 --> 2:22:29.660]  Good God, this is cancer because the elites say this is not a world for humans anymore
[2:22:29.660 --> 2:22:32.660]  It's a world for the new transcendent elite will merge with machines of the new creation
[2:22:32.660 --> 2:22:38.660]  Yeah, well, how about you don't speak for me whether you can do that or not whether it's fantasy or a real project
[2:22:38.660 --> 2:22:44.660]  We've seen where your projects leading and it ain't good and we aren't with your anti-human world government project
[2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:47.660]  Comprende understand that you get it
[2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:54.660]  And people in all the agencies are going yeah, we actually do listen to Alex Jones. We get it. He's right. We're here seeing it
[2:22:54.660 --> 2:22:59.660]  How does this guy know so much? So we've had the massage and the CIA visit everybody else visit over the years
[2:22:59.660 --> 2:23:03.660]  And ask who are you working for? Where are you getting this information? I'm jacked in man
[2:23:03.660 --> 2:23:07.660]  You can see it everywhere. I see what you've done and they declassified a lot of it
[2:23:09.660 --> 2:23:14.660]  It's so empowering to be above the mind control and it's so painful to see others caught up in it
[2:23:16.660 --> 2:23:20.660]  I appreciate Anthony back there always doing his work listen to stuff I say and put those quotes
[2:23:20.660 --> 2:23:24.660]  This is important information a lot of it's completely simple. I mean it's prima facie
[2:23:24.660 --> 2:23:30.660]  Here's the difference. I don't feel good about myself when I look at you and your brainwashed and twisted and spiritually ugly
[2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:35.660]  I want to empower you doesn't mean I'm on some high horse. It makes me feel low
[2:23:36.660 --> 2:23:38.660]  It blows back on me
[2:23:39.660 --> 2:23:43.660]  The elite are out to get you Trump wants a world for people and for the innocence
[2:23:44.660 --> 2:23:48.660]  Trump wants a beautiful happy world the New World Order listen to Obama
[2:23:48.660 --> 2:23:52.660]  You can't have cars you can't have air conditioning give your black
[2:23:52.660 --> 2:23:58.660]  What the hell that's why they hired a black got to go say that in Africa and yes, that's a quote
[2:23:59.660 --> 2:24:03.660]  Oh, I'm I'm black. That's what it means. He's an average if you're an average you can't have anything nice
[2:24:04.660 --> 2:24:10.660]  That's the most colonialistic racist crap. I would see what I'm an ethnic white male. So don't listen to me
[2:24:12.660 --> 2:24:15.660]  It was effing white males that ended slavery all over the world
[2:24:15.660 --> 2:24:21.660]  Oh, there were effing white males involved in it because they were tyrants just like there's tyrants of every quote color
[2:24:22.660 --> 2:24:25.660]  Get past the melon in my skin and realize the character of my deeds
[2:24:25.660 --> 2:24:31.660]  I'm not guilty of anything along those lines because I believe in humanity and I don't say I believe in humanity
[2:24:31.660 --> 2:24:33.660]  And I'm not racist because I want to prove something to you
[2:24:34.660 --> 2:24:41.660]  I say it because it's what I am and it's you people pushing that crap that are the racist using division as a tool of control
[2:24:41.660 --> 2:24:45.660]  And I'm not talking to the people that know what they're doing. I'm talking to those that don't know what they're doing
[2:24:46.660 --> 2:24:48.660]  We come back from break. I'm gonna get to all these clips
[2:24:49.660 --> 2:24:55.660]  When Trump says we're giving the power back to the people that means you women men everybody
[2:24:55.660 --> 2:24:57.660]  So sick of talking about it
[2:24:59.660 --> 2:25:01.660]  Trump is ridiculously real
[2:25:01.660 --> 2:25:03.660]  Ridiculously good
[2:25:04.660 --> 2:25:08.660]  My spirit from the moment he started running was like this guy's good. This guy's good. I'm like no now
[2:25:08.660 --> 2:25:15.660]  Listen to the neocon propaganda and my guts like no go with Trump go Trump then all of a sudden oh Trump wants to come on
[2:25:17.660 --> 2:25:19.660]  And it's just crazy
[2:25:19.660 --> 2:25:22.660]  If Trump isn't real he's the greatest deception to ever hit the planet
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:25.660]  No, he's real folks
[2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:30.660]  Now this video is gonna be posted to YouTube and in fours the next 30 minutes, but I'm gonna premiere part of it now
[2:25:31.660 --> 2:25:35.660]  It's called day one put together by Rob Jacobson and Darren McBreen. Here it is
[2:25:35.660 --> 2:25:42.660]  We're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taking companies out of our country
[2:25:42.660 --> 2:25:48.660]  It's inconceivable to me that this was allowed to happen in the first place
[2:25:48.660 --> 2:25:53.660]  I'm blaming many many years long beyond Obama to live me
[2:25:53.660 --> 2:25:56.660]  This has been going on for decades
[2:25:56.660 --> 2:26:06.660]  Decades and it's a trend that we're gonna stop cold
[2:26:10.660 --> 2:26:16.660]  I almost can't believe it because things have been so bad under Bush and then Obama
[2:26:16.660 --> 2:26:24.660]  The Republican Party establishment, the Democratic Party establishment had been selling this country off to the lowest bidder internationally
[2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:26.660]  We have been completely betrayed
[2:26:26.660 --> 2:26:30.660]  And then Trump comes along and says I will not let you down Alex
[2:26:30.660 --> 2:26:32.660]  I'm gonna break the back of globalism
[2:26:32.660 --> 2:26:36.660]  I'm gonna return the jobs to America just in an even playing field
[2:26:36.660 --> 2:26:40.660]  We're gonna take back our jobs, we're gonna take back our manufacture, we take back our base
[2:26:40.660 --> 2:26:44.660]  I will not let you down, you will be very very impressed
[2:26:44.660 --> 2:26:46.660]  And I'm gonna have peace with Russia
[2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:49.660]  And I'm gonna bring back all these factories
[2:26:49.660 --> 2:26:51.660]  And I'm gonna repeal Obamacare
[2:26:51.660 --> 2:26:54.660]  And I'm gonna repeal gun control laws
[2:26:54.660 --> 2:26:57.660]  All the bills are either introduced or have already passed
[2:26:57.660 --> 2:27:00.660]  And he's been president for days
[2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:02.660]  For days
[2:27:02.660 --> 2:27:07.660]  Now on the radio today I covered it that he was saying he would repeal TPP
[2:27:07.660 --> 2:27:10.660]  That took a decade to negotiate in secret
[2:27:10.660 --> 2:27:16.660]  It hands over basically all remaining U.S. sovereign to the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization
[2:27:16.660 --> 2:27:21.660]  And Trump just declared it's all evaporated
[2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:27.660]  It's inconceivable to me that this was allowed to happen in the first place
[2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:29.660]  And I'm not blaming President Obama for this
[2:27:29.660 --> 2:27:33.660]  I'm blaming many many years long beyond Obama
[2:27:33.660 --> 2:27:37.660]  This has been going on for decades
[2:27:37.660 --> 2:27:41.660]  And it's a trend that we're gonna stop called
[2:27:41.660 --> 2:27:45.660]  Incredible, that was open world government according to Davos
[2:27:45.660 --> 2:27:50.660]  The PR meeting of the private corporations that have hijacked the world
[2:27:50.660 --> 2:27:52.660]  They call it they've done free market
[2:27:52.660 --> 2:27:56.660]  They've done it all in secret and it's all one-sided to transfer power to them
[2:27:56.660 --> 2:28:01.660]  Selling off the wealth of the West to authoritarian regimes in the third world
[2:28:01.660 --> 2:28:04.660]  And those regimes don't even empower their people
[2:28:04.660 --> 2:28:10.660]  My dad was in plan two as a junior in high school back in 1966
[2:28:10.660 --> 2:28:14.660]  He was brought in as one of the top six smartest people in Texas
[2:28:14.660 --> 2:28:18.660]  And they admitted to him the whole world government program
[2:28:18.660 --> 2:28:22.660]  And how they were to transfer American wealth to the third world to empower it
[2:28:22.660 --> 2:28:27.660]  And my dad ended up going to UT but he ended up turning against it and fighting against it
[2:28:27.660 --> 2:28:29.660]  And educating me about it
[2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:32.660]  But back then it was secret, it's public
[2:28:32.660 --> 2:28:36.660]  And they admit Donald Trump is killing corporate, unelected world government
[2:28:36.660 --> 2:28:38.660]  And I say it's beautiful
[2:28:38.660 --> 2:28:41.660]  They say, oh it's gonna kill the new American Century
[2:28:41.660 --> 2:28:44.660]  They said that the American Century was over
[2:28:44.660 --> 2:28:45.660]  It was about China
[2:28:45.660 --> 2:28:50.660]  Now Trump in his speech says it's the new American millennium
[2:28:50.660 --> 2:28:53.660]  But not enforcing our will militarily
[2:28:53.660 --> 2:28:57.660]  Doing it through culture and ideas
[2:28:57.660 --> 2:29:02.660]  Everything from carrier to Chrysler to Ford to major Japanese companies
[2:29:02.660 --> 2:29:05.660]  Are announcing hundreds of billions of dollars in investment
[2:29:05.660 --> 2:29:08.660]  I have just today
[2:29:08.660 --> 2:29:13.660]  Spoke into several high level corporate chiefs that said we were just waiting for America to wake up
[2:29:13.660 --> 2:29:17.660]  We were ordered to do this or we'd be audited, we'd be shut down
[2:29:17.660 --> 2:29:19.660]  We do what the president says
[2:29:19.660 --> 2:29:23.660]  And now we've got a real president, we're gonna do it with gusto
[2:29:23.660 --> 2:29:26.660]  I will be able to announce to you very very soon that
[2:29:26.660 --> 2:29:31.660]  Major technology companies are returning to the US big time
[2:29:31.660 --> 2:29:36.660]  And also major firearms manufacturers
[2:29:36.660 --> 2:29:39.660]  They're returning from places like Brazil to Miami, Florida
[2:29:39.660 --> 2:29:41.660]  Alright, we'll be right back
[2:29:41.660 --> 2:29:44.660]  Stay with us, this is one break, there's another video that's all the craziness
[2:29:44.660 --> 2:30:07.660]  We got that one too, stay with us
[2:30:14.660 --> 2:30:18.660]  This guy shows a man frustrated with anti-fascist blocking a street in Washington DC
[2:30:18.660 --> 2:30:21.660]  And one of these fascist punches the man in the face before being attacked
[2:30:21.660 --> 2:30:23.660]  The incident taking place on Friday
[2:30:23.660 --> 2:30:26.660]  During Trump's inaugural speech, the video starts with an unnamed man
[2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:29.660]  Let's call him Thor, asking the anti-fata stooges
[2:30:29.660 --> 2:30:32.660]  If they're going to prevent him from going to work because they're crying, you know what
[2:30:32.660 --> 2:30:35.660]  Then they seem to have lost it with the word war
[2:30:35.660 --> 2:30:37.660]  Yes, pretty much a masked female responds
[2:30:37.660 --> 2:30:39.660]  Come on babe, let the ladies through at which point
[2:30:39.660 --> 2:30:41.660]  Some of the women pass
[2:30:41.660 --> 2:30:44.660]  Now this guy rushes behind the women and turns around and says
[2:30:44.660 --> 2:30:46.660]  F you, your roadblocks are expletive
[2:30:46.660 --> 2:30:48.660]  And then she responds by attacking him
[2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:50.660]  Yes, she punches him right in the face
[2:30:50.660 --> 2:30:54.660]  Looks like these protesters that are part of the women's march after the inauguration
[2:30:54.660 --> 2:30:57.660]  We're just as bad, catch us here for all of the action
[2:30:57.660 --> 2:31:12.660]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com
[2:31:27.660 --> 2:31:33.660]  More than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine
[2:31:33.660 --> 2:31:37.660]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling
[2:31:37.660 --> 2:31:40.660]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there
[2:31:40.660 --> 2:31:44.660]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, nascent iodine
[2:31:44.660 --> 2:31:49.660]  That major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[2:31:49.660 --> 2:31:53.660]  And that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have
[2:31:53.660 --> 2:32:00.660]  Exclusive to InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsLife family of incredible products
[2:32:00.660 --> 2:32:04.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was shown here on the road with a very important announcement
[2:32:04.660 --> 2:32:07.660]  Roger Stone's new book is coming out in a couple of weeks
[2:32:07.660 --> 2:32:12.660]  It's exclusively available at pre-order at InfowarsStore.com
[2:32:12.660 --> 2:32:15.660]  It's the making of a president and it breaks down how Trump really got elected
[2:32:15.660 --> 2:32:19.660]  The inside baseball, the current battles, and a blueprint for the future
[2:32:19.660 --> 2:32:23.660]  And what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republic of Prosperity
[2:32:23.660 --> 2:32:27.660]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium
[2:32:27.660 --> 2:32:30.660]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more
[2:32:30.660 --> 2:32:33.660]  And it supports him and it supports Infowars in our whole operation
[2:32:33.660 --> 2:32:36.660]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area
[2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:38.660]  If not to the very top of the charts
[2:32:38.660 --> 2:32:41.660]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing
[2:32:41.660 --> 2:32:44.660]  They are in full crisis mode, nationals movements are exploding
[2:32:44.660 --> 2:32:48.660]  Everybody needs to go pre-order so you get it first at InfowarsStore.com
[2:32:48.660 --> 2:32:50.660]  The making of a president by Roger Stone
[2:32:50.660 --> 2:32:53.660]  I'm Alex Jones, I'm going airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump
[2:32:53.660 --> 2:32:57.660]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now
[2:32:57.660 --> 2:33:19.660]  Sir, the first to have it shipped to you
[2:33:27.660 --> 2:33:49.660]  They do have another piece that isn't quite done yet
[2:33:49.660 --> 2:33:52.660]  I was told this last piece was a compilation of people going insane
[2:33:52.660 --> 2:33:55.660]  We got that, this is something even more powerful
[2:33:55.660 --> 2:34:00.660]  A piece I shot last night that was the nightly news I guess
[2:34:00.660 --> 2:34:01.660]  Didn't get there
[2:34:01.660 --> 2:34:04.660]  There's a lot of regulation that the country deals with
[2:34:04.660 --> 2:34:06.660]  There's a lot of bureaucracy I deal with trying to organize things
[2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:09.660]  And get things done here to run a major news operation
[2:34:09.660 --> 2:34:11.660]  Would be done by a lot of people if it was easy
[2:34:11.660 --> 2:34:15.660]  But finishing up this piece that is Donald Trump day one
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:19.660]  That will upload to YouTube that deals with just how hard he's working
[2:34:19.660 --> 2:34:20.660]  And what he's doing
[2:34:20.660 --> 2:34:22.660]  I don't want to say it's too good to be true
[2:34:22.660 --> 2:34:26.660]  But the proof is in the pudding, he's already delivered on the TPP shooting it down
[2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.660]  Announcing they're going to renegotiate napton GAC
[2:34:28.660 --> 2:34:31.660]  Because that was passed by Congress so he can't just shoot that down
[2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:33.660]  TPP was done by executive powers, he can shoot that down
[2:34:33.660 --> 2:34:36.660]  Bringing back massive automakers, jobs, factories
[2:34:36.660 --> 2:34:40.660]  Announcing that they're not going to just let people walk across the border
[2:34:40.660 --> 2:34:43.660]  Just hundreds of things have already happened in just four days
[2:34:43.660 --> 2:34:46.660]  It is simply amazing
[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:53.660]  Now Gary Guffrey is the amazing artist that has done the famous official
[2:34:53.660 --> 2:34:56.660]  Ronald Reagan portrait that's hand drawn
[2:34:56.660 --> 2:34:59.660]  You see all over the world and at the Reagan Library
[2:34:59.660 --> 2:35:02.660]  He's the top official artist of the GOP
[2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:07.660]  He did an original 2000 print lithograph
[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:11.660]  For us, he sent me one last year and we loved it so much
[2:35:11.660 --> 2:35:14.660]  He contacted us back and said would you like me to do another limited edition
[2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:16.660]  Just for you
[2:35:16.660 --> 2:35:18.660]  And Donald Trump sat for this picture
[2:35:18.660 --> 2:35:21.660]  It's similar to one of his regular photo portraits he does as well
[2:35:21.660 --> 2:35:23.660]  But that's Trump's look
[2:35:23.660 --> 2:35:25.660]  And we've got 2,000 of these we did
[2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:29.660]  500 had sold as of this morning
[2:35:29.660 --> 2:35:35.660]  It's 1995, something like this would normally cost hundreds of dollars
[2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:37.660]  It's 1995
[2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:42.660]  Quite frankly I need to raise capital for a studio I want to set up in DC
[2:35:42.660 --> 2:35:45.660]  And a Washington bureau so I'm going to be doing a lot of different drives here
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:48.660]  With t-shirts and other products that may cost a little bit more
[2:35:48.660 --> 2:35:51.660]  And I just thought if you want to get in early
[2:35:51.660 --> 2:35:53.660]  We do things kind of opposite here
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.660]  Get it for 1995 that's fine
[2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:58.660]  I'm going to up the price of these though tomorrow whatever's left
[2:35:58.660 --> 2:36:00.660]  To 50 bucks
[2:36:00.660 --> 2:36:04.660]  Which is still a low price if you want to help fund the future of the fight for America
[2:36:04.660 --> 2:36:05.660]  And what we're doing
[2:36:05.660 --> 2:36:07.660]  Now I'm going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment
[2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:10.660]  Let's finish up this report that I was breaking down
[2:36:10.660 --> 2:36:14.660]  Which is again titled Trump Day One
[2:36:14.660 --> 2:36:15.660]  Here it is
[2:36:15.660 --> 2:36:17.660]  We've always been a free country
[2:36:17.660 --> 2:36:19.660]  And always been very free willed
[2:36:19.660 --> 2:36:21.660]  But after World War II and stuff we were the good guys
[2:36:21.660 --> 2:36:23.660]  You know we were the world power
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:27.660]  And we kind of got in line believing we were exporting Americana worldwide
[2:36:27.660 --> 2:36:30.660]  We found out we were exporting tyranny worldwide
[2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:32.660]  And finally America hit bottom
[2:36:32.660 --> 2:36:35.660]  And it's come back up to the top or close to it
[2:36:35.660 --> 2:36:38.660]  Doesn't mean Trump's perfect, doesn't mean I'm perfect
[2:36:38.660 --> 2:36:40.660]  But I've got to tell you it doesn't mean you're perfect
[2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:41.660]  But we've got good will in our hearts
[2:36:41.660 --> 2:36:43.660]  Get Daniel's article up on infowars.com
[2:36:43.660 --> 2:36:45.660]  Not satire
[2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:48.660]  Politicians keeps campaign promises
[2:36:48.660 --> 2:36:50.660]  Repeal Obamacare
[2:36:50.660 --> 2:36:52.660]  Pull out a TPP
[2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:56.660]  Renegotiate NAFTA and the GAD
[2:36:56.660 --> 2:36:57.660]  And the list goes on and on
[2:36:57.660 --> 2:36:58.660]  Just secure our borders
[2:36:58.660 --> 2:37:03.660]  I saw a story today where Mexico was deporting all these Cubans
[2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:05.660]  Now the United States won't take Cubans
[2:37:05.660 --> 2:37:07.660]  Obama only did that because they said to be patriots
[2:37:07.660 --> 2:37:09.660]  He says oh we won't take you, we'll take anybody else
[2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:12.660]  So now Mexico's deporting them, yeah exactly
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:13.660]  Because you're not a citizen
[2:37:13.660 --> 2:37:15.660]  You don't come and get all the stuff free
[2:37:15.660 --> 2:37:17.660]  It's not hateful towards a Cuban
[2:37:17.660 --> 2:37:18.660]  Or hateful towards a Russian
[2:37:18.660 --> 2:37:20.660]  Or hateful towards a Japanese person
[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:22.660]  It's common sense
[2:37:22.660 --> 2:37:25.660]  So I want to leave you with a press conference earlier today
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:27.660]  Where Trump talked about cutting regulations
[2:37:27.660 --> 2:37:29.660]  At least 75%
[2:37:29.660 --> 2:37:30.660]  These aren't done for the environment
[2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:32.660]  These are done to hamstring America
[2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:35.660]  Because globalists have invested in China and India
[2:37:35.660 --> 2:37:38.660]  And by the way, I'm not against Mexico, China and India
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:40.660]  In 160 other third world countries
[2:37:40.660 --> 2:37:42.660]  I want them to get livable wages
[2:37:42.660 --> 2:37:45.660]  And by America competing, we'll raise the bar
[2:37:45.660 --> 2:37:47.660]  And make them raise the bar to compete
[2:37:47.660 --> 2:37:48.660]  And take care of their people
[2:37:48.660 --> 2:37:52.660]  All the major mathematicians, economists admit that's true
[2:37:52.660 --> 2:37:54.660]  I want China to be free
[2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:56.660]  I want India to be free
[2:37:56.660 --> 2:37:58.660]  The Chinese people are incredibly smart-hearted people
[2:37:58.660 --> 2:38:00.660]  Who've been under a tyranny that David Rockefeller
[2:38:00.660 --> 2:38:03.660]  In her own banks in 1949 put in over them
[2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:05.660]  Called Mouse the Tongue
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:07.660]  And the Indian people, what amazing entrepreneur
[2:38:07.660 --> 2:38:09.660]  Is being turned lose, the Mexicans as well
[2:38:09.660 --> 2:38:11.660]  The point is, we're not going to have a bunch of kingpins
[2:38:11.660 --> 2:38:14.660]  Using those countries and those people
[2:38:14.660 --> 2:38:18.660]  To leverage us and turn us into corporate slaves
[2:38:18.660 --> 2:38:21.660]  We're going to try to truly deliver the American idea
[2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:24.660]  And raise up those nations
[2:38:24.660 --> 2:38:27.660]  Madonna can talk all day long
[2:38:27.660 --> 2:38:29.660]  About how she wants to blow up the White House
[2:38:29.660 --> 2:38:30.660]  To be allowed to do it
[2:38:30.660 --> 2:38:32.660]  The truth is, we're blowing up politically
[2:38:32.660 --> 2:38:36.660]  The New World Order and its entire stinking project
[2:38:36.660 --> 2:38:38.660]  I mean, Islamists can run around all day long
[2:38:38.660 --> 2:38:40.660]  And brainwash the women of America
[2:38:40.660 --> 2:38:43.660]  Who don't have men who are under Stockholm syndrome
[2:38:43.660 --> 2:38:45.660]  To believe that liberalism is wearing a burqa
[2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:48.660]  Or a hajib, but nobody buys into it anymore
[2:38:48.660 --> 2:38:50.660]  Nobody they could think
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:53.660]  Yeah, Soros may have a throng of dumb-down idiots
[2:38:53.660 --> 2:38:56.660]  But we've got the thinkers, they've got the stinkers
[2:38:56.660 --> 2:39:00.660]  Well, that's the final bulletin for this historic Monday transmission
[2:39:00.660 --> 2:39:03.660]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWars
[2:39:03.660 --> 2:39:05.660]  We're going to put a lot of people back to work
[2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:07.660]  We're going to use common sense
[2:39:07.660 --> 2:39:10.660]  And we're going to do what's supposed to be done
[2:39:10.660 --> 2:39:13.660]  We're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals
[2:39:13.660 --> 2:39:16.660]  That are taking everybody out of our country
[2:39:16.660 --> 2:39:18.660]  And taking companies out of our country
[2:39:18.660 --> 2:39:20.660]  And it's going to be reversed
[2:39:20.660 --> 2:39:23.660]  I think you're going to have a lot of companies come back to our country
[2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:27.660]  Companies that left are going to come back to our country
[2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:30.660]  And they're going to hire a lot of people
[2:39:30.660 --> 2:39:32.660]  It's inconceivable to me
[2:39:32.660 --> 2:39:35.660]  That this was allowed to happen in the first place
[2:39:35.660 --> 2:39:37.660]  And I'm not blaming President Obama for this
[2:39:37.660 --> 2:39:40.660]  I'm blaming many, many years
[2:39:40.660 --> 2:39:42.660]  Long beyond Obama, believe me
[2:39:42.660 --> 2:39:45.660]  This has been going on for decades
[2:39:45.660 --> 2:39:49.660]  And it's a trend that we're going to stop cold
[2:39:49.660 --> 2:39:52.660]  And we started today which is
[2:39:52.660 --> 2:39:55.660]  My first official day deciding major things
[2:39:55.660 --> 2:39:59.660]  So I actually started from the hour I got here
[2:39:59.660 --> 2:40:02.660]  But this is the day that we wanted to sign
[2:40:02.660 --> 2:40:05.660]  Some of the legislation having to do with it
[2:40:05.660 --> 2:40:07.660]  So if you have any questions, let me know
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:10.660]  We'll start doing it right now
[2:40:10.660 --> 2:40:13.660]  What are we going to do to renegotiate after?
[2:40:13.660 --> 2:40:15.660]  I forgot that there was not an answer
[2:40:15.660 --> 2:40:17.660]  When are you going to renegotiate after?
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:20.660]  At the appropriate time
[2:40:20.660 --> 2:40:22.660]  You asked for it, God gave it to you
[2:40:22.660 --> 2:40:24.660]  That's the real wrecking ball right there
[2:40:24.660 --> 2:40:27.660]  What is the new world order wrecking ball?
[2:40:27.660 --> 2:40:30.660]  He's the wrecking ball taking down the new world order
[2:40:33.660 --> 2:40:36.660]  I mean I said he got 30-40% done of his agenda
[2:40:36.660 --> 2:40:38.660]  In four years that he would have totally delivered
[2:40:38.660 --> 2:40:40.660]  Because it's hard to get stuff done
[2:40:40.660 --> 2:40:43.660]  But because they transferred so much power to the executive
[2:40:43.660 --> 2:40:46.660]  And because they done it illegally
[2:40:46.660 --> 2:40:49.660]  He can just
[2:40:49.660 --> 2:40:53.660]  Now they're going to come after him in a lot of ways
[2:40:53.660 --> 2:40:56.660]  They're going to claim what he's doing is illegal
[2:40:57.660 --> 2:40:59.660]  Otherwise I want to say for Jacobson McBrian
[2:40:59.660 --> 2:41:01.660]  Who I shot that with last night
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:04.660]  They did a great job actually finding mainstream news articles
[2:41:04.660 --> 2:41:07.660]  Even admitting our government put Mao Zedong into power
[2:41:07.660 --> 2:41:09.660]  You know, you read Gloria Stam's book
[2:41:09.660 --> 2:41:11.660]  And she admits she's CIA to break up the family
[2:41:11.660 --> 2:41:13.660]  People go, oh that's just her book
[2:41:13.660 --> 2:41:16.660]  But then there's an interview with her in the 60s admitting it
[2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:18.660]  That I didn't even know was around that we found this weekend
[2:41:18.660 --> 2:41:20.660]  It's like I didn't even know there were all those articles
[2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:22.660]  And stuff where they were admitting it
[2:41:22.660 --> 2:41:25.660]  That I'd read about that in the congressional hearings
[2:41:25.660 --> 2:41:27.660]  And things, I'm going to go to your calls
[2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:29.660]  A lot of times I overheat like a race car
[2:41:29.660 --> 2:41:31.660]  Because I just want to do so much and there's so much news
[2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:33.660]  And so many angles and so much I want to tell you about
[2:41:33.660 --> 2:41:35.660]  That I kind of blow up
[2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:37.660]  I'm not even mad at the crew or anybody
[2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:40.660]  I just
[2:41:40.660 --> 2:41:42.660]  I'm totally immersed in this
[2:41:42.660 --> 2:41:44.660]  I know I'm right
[2:41:44.660 --> 2:41:47.660]  And I know how evil the globalists are
[2:41:47.660 --> 2:41:50.660]  And it just freaks me out
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:53.660]  To know that these people are so ignorant
[2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:56.660]  Just like Leanne is a good person
[2:41:56.660 --> 2:41:58.660]  Because she got here four years ago and kind of
[2:41:58.660 --> 2:42:00.660]  80% agree with me, she knew who I was
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:01.660]  She was kind of libertarian
[2:42:01.660 --> 2:42:04.660]  But over time she's like, well this is really true, that's true
[2:42:04.660 --> 2:42:07.660]  And then now she knows as much as I do her more on many things
[2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:09.660]  And I'm sorry, yesterday on air she said she was freaked out
[2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:11.660]  And she was genuinely freaked out not being a drama queen
[2:42:11.660 --> 2:42:13.660]  I get like that sometimes, like
[2:42:13.660 --> 2:42:15.660]  They're on the news still saying
[2:42:15.660 --> 2:42:18.660]  Trump didn't have a crowd and showing an empty photo
[2:42:18.660 --> 2:42:20.660]  Before they opened the gates or right when they opened them
[2:42:20.660 --> 2:42:23.660]  And she's like, and people she knows are laughing at her
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:25.660]  And she's not upset because she's being laughed at
[2:42:25.660 --> 2:42:27.660]  She's upset because they're mentally ill, man
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:30.660]  We're in a lot of danger when
[2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:33.660]  You know, there are people sending me emails and tweets
[2:42:33.660 --> 2:42:36.660]  Going, oh, he did get rid of Martin Luther King's bust
[2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:39.660]  They think accepting the lie
[2:42:39.660 --> 2:42:41.660]  Like the Bible says, getting into the lie
[2:42:41.660 --> 2:42:43.660]  Gives them power
[2:42:43.660 --> 2:42:46.660]  I want to go to Ian and Chris
[2:42:46.660 --> 2:42:49.660]  And Morgan and Matt and Evan and everybody else
[2:42:49.660 --> 2:42:52.660]  But I'm like somebody playing a football game
[2:42:52.660 --> 2:42:54.660]  That doesn't want to lose and I remember
[2:42:54.660 --> 2:42:57.660]  Not wanting to lose a football game
[2:42:57.660 --> 2:42:59.660]  And getting really upset when we lost
[2:42:59.660 --> 2:43:02.660]  And I look back on how mentally ill that was
[2:43:02.660 --> 2:43:05.660]  But I got it was tapping into my normal human instinct
[2:43:05.660 --> 2:43:07.660]  To tribally not want to be beaten
[2:43:07.660 --> 2:43:10.660]  But now this is like 5,000 times what it was
[2:43:10.660 --> 2:43:12.660]  To not want to lose a football game
[2:43:12.660 --> 2:43:15.660]  I mean this is for my family, you, everybody
[2:43:15.660 --> 2:43:17.660]  And it's a bunch of scum
[2:43:17.660 --> 2:43:20.660]  I mean to be like if 15-foot awesome four-like aliens
[2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:22.660]  Arrived and said, we conquer you
[2:43:22.660 --> 2:43:24.660]  By the way, be cure all your diseases and everything else
[2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:26.660]  I would kind of say, well, I don't want to be conquerors
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:29.660]  I don't trust you, but it still wouldn't feel as bad
[2:43:29.660 --> 2:43:32.660]  As we're conquered by David Brock
[2:43:32.660 --> 2:43:35.660]  And Donna Shalala
[2:43:35.660 --> 2:43:38.660]  And Hilary who can't even hardly walk
[2:43:38.660 --> 2:43:40.660]  Some weird little witch
[2:43:40.660 --> 2:43:44.660]  No, you will not conquer me ever
[2:43:44.660 --> 2:43:46.660]  I hate you
[2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:49.660]  But I do what I do because I love my family
[2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:52.660]  But I got to tell you, I didn't know they could stack
[2:43:52.660 --> 2:43:56.660]  Crap that high, you know, that's an old drill sergeant term
[2:43:56.660 --> 2:43:59.660]  But crap can give life to plants
[2:43:59.660 --> 2:44:03.660]  Crap isn't the word, these people are liquid failure
[2:44:03.660 --> 2:44:06.660]  And it is exponential envy
[2:44:06.660 --> 2:44:09.660]  It is class envy, but it's beyond that
[2:44:09.660 --> 2:44:12.660]  America tried to deploy the most freedom ever in wealth
[2:44:12.660 --> 2:44:15.660]  And the globalists knew that that would make monsters
[2:44:15.660 --> 2:44:17.660]  That's the great paradox
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:19.660]  At least with some people become lazy evil slobs
[2:44:19.660 --> 2:44:22.660]  And they don't like the fact we got straight backs
[2:44:22.660 --> 2:44:24.660]  Whether we'd be black, white, Hispanic, whatever
[2:44:24.660 --> 2:44:27.660]  Because let me tell you something, they didn't like
[2:44:27.660 --> 2:44:30.660]  They didn't like anybody, black, white, Hispanic
[2:44:30.660 --> 2:44:33.660]  They were so freaked out it would attack more people of quote color
[2:44:33.660 --> 2:44:36.660]  Going into the events for the inauguration
[2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:38.660]  That's who was mainly bloody was Hispanic women
[2:44:38.660 --> 2:44:40.660]  They would target a woman
[2:44:40.660 --> 2:44:42.660]  Or an Asian woman
[2:44:42.660 --> 2:44:44.660]  They'd target little women
[2:44:44.660 --> 2:44:48.660]  I mean, again, what type of filth does this?
[2:44:48.660 --> 2:44:52.660]  I mean, if I'm going to fight somebody and target somebody
[2:44:52.660 --> 2:44:55.660]  It's going to be the biggest man they got
[2:44:55.660 --> 2:44:58.660]  That's not how these people work, they're rats
[2:44:58.660 --> 2:45:01.660]  And so I just realized that
[2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:03.660]  You always kind of question what you're doing
[2:45:03.660 --> 2:45:05.660]  Just as a safe thing to do
[2:45:05.660 --> 2:45:07.660]  And so I always kind of question my research
[2:45:07.660 --> 2:45:10.660]  I always question my gut and now I'm just like
[2:45:10.660 --> 2:45:13.660]  This is so dangerous because
[2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:16.660]  If I keep questioning and not just act instinctively
[2:45:16.660 --> 2:45:18.660]  Against the enemy, we're going to lose
[2:45:18.660 --> 2:45:20.660]  I have to just go with everything in my gut
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:22.660]  Everything in my soul, everything in my heart
[2:45:22.660 --> 2:45:24.660]  And I got to hit them hard
[2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:27.660]  I've got to open bureaus all over the country in the world
[2:45:27.660 --> 2:45:30.660]  I've got to work 18 hours a day, I've got to be more focused
[2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:33.660]  I feel guilty and pathetic that I haven't done more
[2:45:33.660 --> 2:45:37.660]  Death and hell and scum, my God, they're so bad
[2:45:37.660 --> 2:45:40.660]  Good God, I can't believe how bad they are
[2:45:40.660 --> 2:45:43.660]  It's unspeakable
[2:45:43.660 --> 2:45:47.660]  They are soul-sucked, hateful scum
[2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:50.660]  Who hate us and hate our healthy children
[2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:52.660]  And I'm not going to assume you have unhealthy children
[2:45:52.660 --> 2:45:55.660]  But you see they say, oh, now you can't have a mommy or daddy
[2:45:55.660 --> 2:45:57.660]  Because somebody else doesn't or you can't have a woman
[2:45:57.660 --> 2:45:59.660]  On the cover of National Geographic
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:01.660]  Because the new sex revolution is about
[2:46:01.660 --> 2:46:04.660]  Men and women don't exist because the old humans don't exist
[2:46:04.660 --> 2:46:07.660]  Because we've been given a program to kill us
[2:46:07.660 --> 2:46:11.660]  Then I do the logical next-level equation and I go
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:13.660]  Is this guilds of psychopaths that are anti-human
[2:46:13.660 --> 2:46:15.660]  Or is this aliens?
[2:46:15.660 --> 2:46:17.660]  Because if you really do the analysis
[2:46:17.660 --> 2:46:18.660]  It's like it's only makes sense
[2:46:18.660 --> 2:46:20.660]  This is how you kill a species and then I realize
[2:46:20.660 --> 2:46:23.660]  There's the Bible, the fallen one
[2:46:23.660 --> 2:46:26.660]  You know, the media makes a joke when I talk about this
[2:46:26.660 --> 2:46:30.660]  Because they go, oh my God
[2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:32.660]  Alex, please, there's a fallen entity here that wants to destroy us
[2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:34.660]  How insane?
[2:46:34.660 --> 2:46:37.660]  Only 70% of the world population or more believes that
[2:46:37.660 --> 2:46:39.660]  Why does every culture believe that?
[2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:42.660]  There's a fallen evil here trying to destroy us
[2:46:42.660 --> 2:46:45.660]  Because it's true, whatever it is
[2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:47.660]  Interdimensional, spiritual, that's what that means
[2:46:47.660 --> 2:46:50.660]  That's interdimensional is the modern term for spiritual
[2:46:50.660 --> 2:46:52.660]  Spiritual being proven
[2:46:52.660 --> 2:46:55.660]  Not religious, not government systems
[2:46:55.660 --> 2:46:58.660]  Not systems of men, what we know in every culture
[2:46:58.660 --> 2:47:00.660]  That there's a good, great spirit
[2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:02.660]  Native Americans that loves us and gives us life
[2:47:02.660 --> 2:47:06.660]  And then there's bad things that come here to jack with us
[2:47:06.660 --> 2:47:08.660]  And then you see it clear as day
[2:47:08.660 --> 2:47:11.660]  Donald Trump knows all this and is trying to rally humanity
[2:47:11.660 --> 2:47:14.660]  Because there's free will in this universe
[2:47:14.660 --> 2:47:17.660]  To get humanity to awaken to what's happening
[2:47:17.660 --> 2:47:19.660]  And to build a world for humans
[2:47:19.660 --> 2:47:21.660]  Because if we don't start valuing humans and workers
[2:47:21.660 --> 2:47:23.660]  There won't be any place for us
[2:47:23.660 --> 2:47:25.660]  They're building a world where we don't exist
[2:47:25.660 --> 2:47:27.660]  But we're meant to build and we built beautiful things
[2:47:27.660 --> 2:47:31.660]  So we start saying, we only buy things made by humans
[2:47:31.660 --> 2:47:33.660]  On the packaging, it needs to say
[2:47:33.660 --> 2:47:35.660]  My mom was a kid, they'd have cereal and say
[2:47:35.660 --> 2:47:37.660]  Untouched by human hands
[2:47:37.660 --> 2:47:40.660]  They'd make the joke, say, what, did a monkey do it?
[2:47:40.660 --> 2:47:42.660]  See, that was cool back then, it was automated
[2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:46.660]  And we want to say, touched by human hands
[2:47:46.660 --> 2:47:48.660]  And we started loving those human hands
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:52.660]  Those human hands start becoming beautiful again
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:55.660]  Because we worship God, and we're made in God's image
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:47:58.660]  So we don't worship ourselves, but we respect ourselves
[2:47:58.660 --> 2:48:01.660]  And respect the temples God has given us
[2:48:01.660 --> 2:48:04.660]  The enemy gives us disease and death and pain
[2:48:04.660 --> 2:48:08.660]  Look at Trump, life extension, conquer disease, all of it
[2:48:08.660 --> 2:48:10.660]  The enemy was just...
[2:48:10.660 --> 2:48:12.660]  When I saw a clip of Obama during that line
[2:48:12.660 --> 2:48:15.660]  And Obama was just like...
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:18.660]  Oh, he's getting all the secrets now
[2:48:18.660 --> 2:48:21.660]  Oh, no, they are beside themselves
[2:48:21.660 --> 2:48:24.660]  But the decision was made in the intelligence agencies
[2:48:24.660 --> 2:48:26.660]  I'm not glorifying the point is they were set up
[2:48:26.660 --> 2:48:28.660]  To control us and destroy us
[2:48:28.660 --> 2:48:30.660]  But humans are still in control of those
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:32.660]  And we're about to transfer power to the AI
[2:48:32.660 --> 2:48:34.660]  And said, this is the end of humanity
[2:48:34.660 --> 2:48:36.660]  We better not go with this, globalism's evil
[2:48:36.660 --> 2:48:39.660]  We better back out of this right now, before it's too late
[2:48:39.660 --> 2:48:43.660]  The only hope humanity's got is to pull out of this program
[2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:45.660]  I'm skipping this break, too
[2:48:45.660 --> 2:48:47.660]  I know the network needs money, but that's fine
[2:48:47.660 --> 2:48:49.660]  I can have my own network, my own show, I can do whatever I want
[2:48:49.660 --> 2:48:51.660]  I can go to my house through a five-hour show if I want
[2:48:51.660 --> 2:48:53.660]  And have no ads
[2:48:53.660 --> 2:48:55.660]  I fund the whole entire network anyways
[2:48:55.660 --> 2:48:57.660]  Wouldn't even... All the other talk shows on it
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:48:59.660]  Bitch about me, complain, they don't know 98% of the money
[2:48:59.660 --> 2:49:01.660]  That funds Genesis is from me
[2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:03.660]  It's actually 100, I couldn't even believe it
[2:49:03.660 --> 2:49:05.660]  None of them even exist compared
[2:49:05.660 --> 2:49:09.660]  I'm not even bragging, that's actually shameful
[2:49:09.660 --> 2:49:12.660]  To know that I'm supporting a bunch of people that disdain me
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:16.660]  It's the same story over and over again
[2:49:16.660 --> 2:49:21.660]  The same dependency, the same sluggism
[2:49:21.660 --> 2:49:23.660]  That we see mirrored all around us
[2:49:23.660 --> 2:49:26.660]  Hated by the people we build
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:28.660]  Hated by the people we empower
[2:49:28.660 --> 2:49:31.660]  Hated by the people we've given life to
[2:49:31.660 --> 2:49:33.660]  How do you think God feels?
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:41.660]  And by the way, I like Ted Anderson and Judy Sears
[2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:43.660]  I mean, I just... Those are the shows on there
[2:49:43.660 --> 2:49:45.660]  They think they're all in competition with me
[2:49:45.660 --> 2:49:48.660]  And I was like, crap, I'm not in competition with any of you people
[2:49:48.660 --> 2:49:51.660]  I'm in competition with the devil
[2:49:51.660 --> 2:49:54.660]  I'm in a death battle
[2:49:54.660 --> 2:49:57.660]  And now you see the enemy say they're in a death battle
[2:49:57.660 --> 2:49:59.660]  They know they're in a death battle
[2:49:59.660 --> 2:50:02.660]  Only the spirit of knowing you're in a death battle
[2:50:02.660 --> 2:50:04.660]  Will have you in
[2:50:06.660 --> 2:50:08.660]  I don't know how all this is gonna end
[2:50:08.660 --> 2:50:10.660]  But like I told them a thousand times
[2:50:10.660 --> 2:50:14.660]  You wanna fight, better believe you've got one
[2:50:14.660 --> 2:50:17.660]  You wanna enslave my spirit?
[2:50:17.660 --> 2:50:18.660]  No!
[2:50:18.660 --> 2:50:21.660]  And I'll call on God to protect me
[2:50:21.660 --> 2:50:23.660]  And use me however God sees fit
[2:50:23.660 --> 2:50:26.660]  And if I'm destroyed, my whole family with it
[2:50:26.660 --> 2:50:28.660]  I don't blame God
[2:50:28.660 --> 2:50:30.660]  I blame the stinking trash
[2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:32.660]  Who will pay
[2:50:32.660 --> 2:50:34.660]  Now
[2:50:34.660 --> 2:50:36.660]  And the devil that deceived them
[2:50:36.660 --> 2:50:38.660]  Was cast in the lake of fire and brimstone
[2:50:38.660 --> 2:50:41.660]  Where the beast and the false prophet are
[2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:43.660]  And shall be tormented day and night
[2:50:43.660 --> 2:50:46.660]  Forever and ever
[2:50:46.660 --> 2:50:49.660]  Tormented by their own spirit
[2:50:52.660 --> 2:50:54.660]  No, I mean I really shouldn't be on a talk radio format
[2:50:54.660 --> 2:50:57.660]  I shouldn't be involved with other sponsors
[2:50:57.660 --> 2:50:59.660]  That I don't agree with
[2:50:59.660 --> 2:51:01.660]  And other people and other things
[2:51:01.660 --> 2:51:04.660]  I just need to be pure and be info wars
[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:06.660]  And I don't intend to leave GCN
[2:51:06.660 --> 2:51:08.660]  I just sit here and I skip these ads
[2:51:08.660 --> 2:51:10.660]  And everybody flips out about them
[2:51:10.660 --> 2:51:11.660]  Well, you know what?
[2:51:11.660 --> 2:51:13.660]  How about I just go away for a couple months
[2:51:13.660 --> 2:51:15.660]  How about that sounds, you know?
[2:51:15.660 --> 2:51:17.660]  Because all I want to do is defeat the neural order
[2:51:17.660 --> 2:51:18.660]  I don't want to play games
[2:51:18.660 --> 2:51:20.660]  I don't want to go to balls
[2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:22.660]  I don't want to sit around all the beautiful people
[2:51:22.660 --> 2:51:24.660]  I don't want to impress anybody
[2:51:24.660 --> 2:51:26.660]  I want to awaken humanity
[2:51:26.660 --> 2:51:28.660]  And it's almost
[2:51:28.660 --> 2:51:31.660]  A sin to even have to raise money to do this
[2:51:31.660 --> 2:51:33.660]  But that's how we operate
[2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:36.660]  And I want to be flooded with the money
[2:51:36.660 --> 2:51:38.660]  To put correspondence all over the country
[2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:40.660]  And all over the world and really go to the next level
[2:51:40.660 --> 2:51:42.660]  I want to be flooded with this trash
[2:51:42.660 --> 2:51:43.660]  The enemies put out
[2:51:43.660 --> 2:51:45.660]  But as God turns evil to good
[2:51:45.660 --> 2:51:47.660]  To be used against them
[2:51:47.660 --> 2:51:49.660]  And we just sell products
[2:51:49.660 --> 2:51:50.660]  That everybody needs
[2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:52.660]  Everybody wants that are powerful
[2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:53.660]  That people need
[2:51:53.660 --> 2:51:55.660]  That counter the globalists on every front
[2:51:55.660 --> 2:51:56.660]  I mean, it's all about life
[2:51:56.660 --> 2:51:58.660]  Water filtration, high quality seeds
[2:51:58.660 --> 2:51:59.660]  Great supplements
[2:51:59.660 --> 2:52:01.660]  Because I only
[2:52:01.660 --> 2:52:03.660]  Promote and produce things
[2:52:03.660 --> 2:52:05.660]  That I would do
[2:52:05.660 --> 2:52:07.660]  And that's not because I'm a perfect
[2:52:07.660 --> 2:52:08.660]  That's common sense
[2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:10.660]  If I'm going to give my kids a drink of water
[2:52:10.660 --> 2:52:13.660]  I believe it's something that I'm going to drink
[2:52:15.660 --> 2:52:16.660]  It's so common sense
[2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:18.660]  I know I've got loaded phones here
[2:52:18.660 --> 2:52:20.660]  I've had them for an hour and I apologize
[2:52:20.660 --> 2:52:23.660]  I just
[2:52:23.660 --> 2:52:25.660]  I just put up with a lot of crap
[2:52:25.660 --> 2:52:27.660]  And I'm not bitching about it
[2:52:27.660 --> 2:52:30.660]  It's just that you get sick of it
[2:52:30.660 --> 2:52:33.660]  And you get sick of all the weakness, don't you?
[2:52:33.660 --> 2:52:35.660]  But I'm not going to join the New World Order
[2:52:35.660 --> 2:52:36.660]  And just ride everybody off
[2:52:36.660 --> 2:52:37.660]  Because let me tell you
[2:52:37.660 --> 2:52:38.660]  I've been around the globalists some
[2:52:38.660 --> 2:52:40.660]  That's the weakest, worst people there are
[2:52:40.660 --> 2:52:42.660]  And they're projecting how much
[2:52:42.660 --> 2:52:44.660]  They hate themselves on to all of us
[2:52:44.660 --> 2:52:46.660]  And using media and culture to make us
[2:52:46.660 --> 2:52:47.660]  Ugly like they are
[2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:50.660]  So they feel better about what they are
[2:52:50.660 --> 2:52:52.660]  Well, I got news for them
[2:52:52.660 --> 2:52:55.660]  You don't run the show
[2:52:55.660 --> 2:52:56.660]  And you don't run the heavens
[2:52:56.660 --> 2:52:58.660]  And you don't even run humanity
[2:52:58.660 --> 2:53:00.660]  And everything you build against us
[2:53:00.660 --> 2:53:01.660]  Is going to be used against you
[2:53:01.660 --> 2:53:04.660]  And it's going to be directly responsible
[2:53:04.660 --> 2:53:05.660]  For your downfall
[2:53:05.660 --> 2:53:06.660]  And that's why you hate me
[2:53:06.660 --> 2:53:09.660]  Because you know that I speak the truth
[2:53:09.660 --> 2:53:12.660]  And you know that this flesh isn't pure
[2:53:12.660 --> 2:53:15.660]  But my spirit is and means everything I say
[2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:18.660]  And I see you
[2:53:18.660 --> 2:53:21.660]  Every horrible part of you
[2:53:21.660 --> 2:53:23.660]  Every facet
[2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:27.660]  Every surface, every little deep thought
[2:53:30.660 --> 2:53:34.660]  And I am horrified at your fallen state
[2:53:34.660 --> 2:53:36.660]  From my fallen state
[2:53:36.660 --> 2:53:39.660]  But I can see way down below
[2:53:39.660 --> 2:53:42.660]  On this precipice, this rock that humanity's broken
[2:53:42.660 --> 2:53:43.660]  It's back on
[2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:45.660]  You see the heavens here and hell below
[2:53:45.660 --> 2:53:47.660]  And I reach up towards God
[2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:50.660]  Begging, begging for salvation
[2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:51.660]  A horrible, dirty creature
[2:53:51.660 --> 2:53:53.660]  And then I see you reeling in your evil
[2:53:53.660 --> 2:53:55.660]  Loving it down below
[2:53:55.660 --> 2:53:57.660]  Giving yourself and your children over to it
[2:53:57.660 --> 2:53:59.660]  And all I say is, my God
[2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:00.660]  Please, Heavenly Father
[2:54:00.660 --> 2:54:01.660]  Cut us off from them
[2:54:01.660 --> 2:54:03.660]  Remove us from them
[2:54:03.660 --> 2:54:06.660]  Let us have a new world away from them
[2:54:06.660 --> 2:54:09.660]  And God says, no
[2:54:09.660 --> 2:54:11.660]  This is the great test
[2:54:11.660 --> 2:54:13.660]  And I know it's true
[2:54:13.660 --> 2:54:14.660]  Because without the test
[2:54:14.660 --> 2:54:16.660]  We wouldn't be who we are
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:17.660]  Without the process
[2:54:17.660 --> 2:54:20.660]  We wouldn't grow through the levels
[2:54:20.660 --> 2:54:22.660]  To now be where we've come
[2:54:22.660 --> 2:54:24.660]  And to know that even greater things are coming
[2:54:29.660 --> 2:54:30.660]  I guess let's go to Coles
[2:54:30.660 --> 2:54:31.660]  I apologize
[2:54:31.660 --> 2:54:33.660]  He just hung up
[2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:34.660]  I was going right to Ian in London
[2:54:34.660 --> 2:54:35.660]  And he hung up right as I was
[2:54:35.660 --> 2:54:36.660]  That's where when you look at the call
[2:54:36.660 --> 2:54:37.660]  He's been there for an hour
[2:54:37.660 --> 2:54:38.660]  And they go pshh
[2:54:38.660 --> 2:54:39.660]  It's like they feel pshh
[2:54:39.660 --> 2:54:41.660]  It's gone
[2:54:41.660 --> 2:54:42.660]  Chris in Connecticut
[2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:44.660]  You're on the air, go ahead
[2:54:44.660 --> 2:54:46.660]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:54:46.660 --> 2:54:48.660]  Thank you, long time listener
[2:54:48.660 --> 2:54:50.660]  Been a listener since 2011
[2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:51.660]  A lot of my family listened
[2:54:51.660 --> 2:54:52.660]  Thanks for putting up with me, brother
[2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:53.660]  Go ahead
[2:54:53.660 --> 2:54:54.660]  No problem
[2:54:54.660 --> 2:54:57.660]  I was at the inauguration with my father
[2:54:57.660 --> 2:54:58.660]  We were in the north
[2:54:58.660 --> 2:54:59.660]  Oh, you were there where it was totally empty
[2:54:59.660 --> 2:55:00.660]  There was no one?
[2:55:00.660 --> 2:55:02.660]  There was, it was packed, man
[2:55:02.660 --> 2:55:04.660]  Wait, the CNN said
[2:55:04.660 --> 2:55:06.660]  He still says there was nobody there
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:08.660]  Oh, it was so packed
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:10.660]  I couldn't even believe that
[2:55:10.660 --> 2:55:12.660]  When I got back and saw it
[2:55:12.660 --> 2:55:14.660]  Floating around Facebook
[2:55:14.660 --> 2:55:17.660]  And it was just an amazing experience
[2:55:17.660 --> 2:55:19.660]  But there were some nasty protesters
[2:55:19.660 --> 2:55:21.660]  I saw protesters within communists
[2:55:21.660 --> 2:55:23.660]  That was my first time ever
[2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:25.660]  Ever experiencing anything of that
[2:55:25.660 --> 2:55:26.660]  Magansgood
[2:55:26.660 --> 2:55:28.660]  I've seen it through your show
[2:55:28.660 --> 2:55:30.660]  But I've never experienced anything like it
[2:55:30.660 --> 2:55:32.660]  It just made me kind of
[2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:34.660]  Always looking behind my shoulder
[2:55:34.660 --> 2:55:36.660]  Making sure somebody wasn't going to punch me in the face
[2:55:36.660 --> 2:55:38.660]  We're wearing a red hat
[2:55:38.660 --> 2:55:40.660]  And it was
[2:55:40.660 --> 2:55:42.660]  And then we, you know
[2:55:42.660 --> 2:55:44.660]  Even before that we were outside
[2:55:44.660 --> 2:55:45.660]  Waiting at the deplorable
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:46.660]  And that was scary
[2:55:46.660 --> 2:55:48.660]  We didn't get to go to it
[2:55:48.660 --> 2:55:50.660]  I couldn't even get into it
[2:55:50.660 --> 2:55:51.660]  I heard they kicked Roger out
[2:55:51.660 --> 2:55:52.660]  And I couldn't get more info
[2:55:52.660 --> 2:55:53.660]  And I had to have thrown batteries
[2:55:53.660 --> 2:55:55.660]  And attacked Larry King down the street
[2:55:55.660 --> 2:55:56.660]  Who wasn't even going to it
[2:55:56.660 --> 2:55:58.660]  I was like a big liberal
[2:55:58.660 --> 2:56:00.660]  I was like, kill Larry King, he's an old white guy
[2:56:00.660 --> 2:56:01.660]  I almost killed him
[2:56:01.660 --> 2:56:03.660]  He tore his car up, set it on fire
[2:56:03.660 --> 2:56:05.660]  Knocked the windows out
[2:56:05.660 --> 2:56:07.660]  Just frothing insanity
[2:56:07.660 --> 2:56:09.660]  And he's got to attack Hillary
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:10.660]  Because she's white
[2:56:10.660 --> 2:56:11.660]  They're just nuts
[2:56:11.660 --> 2:56:14.660]  But I saw people that went through with little kids
[2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:16.660]  And I'll be honest
[2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:18.660]  I pushed them out of the way and stuff
[2:56:18.660 --> 2:56:20.660]  But man, if I brought my kid to that
[2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:22.660]  And they want to make it where you can't do it
[2:56:22.660 --> 2:56:24.660]  If somebody attacks my five-year-old kid
[2:56:24.660 --> 2:56:25.660]  I'm going to hurt some people, man
[2:56:25.660 --> 2:56:28.660]  I mean, and how wimpy they were
[2:56:28.660 --> 2:56:29.660]  They thought they would hit us
[2:56:29.660 --> 2:56:30.660]  And I'd hit them back
[2:56:30.660 --> 2:56:31.660]  And they'd freak out and scream
[2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:32.660]  And I'd attack them
[2:56:32.660 --> 2:56:34.660]  Again, it's just weird, man
[2:56:34.660 --> 2:56:36.660]  I better believe if I saw any of that
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:39.660]  With a little kid, I would have stepped in
[2:56:39.660 --> 2:56:40.660]  Even though I probably would have
[2:56:40.660 --> 2:56:42.660]  You've heard me ranting about how bizarre
[2:56:42.660 --> 2:56:43.660]  And twisted and crazy they are
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:46.660]  Am I exaggerating?
[2:56:46.660 --> 2:56:47.660]  No, not at all
[2:56:47.660 --> 2:56:49.660]  I mean, I'm thinking in my head
[2:56:49.660 --> 2:56:52.660]  I'm like, wow, this is something out of one of your videos
[2:56:52.660 --> 2:56:54.660]  Online that I've seen many times
[2:56:54.660 --> 2:56:58.660]  It was pretty brilliant
[2:56:58.660 --> 2:57:00.660]  I brought you down to a major realize
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:03.660]  How it was like a cult feeling
[2:57:03.660 --> 2:57:05.660]  Yeah, it was like hatred
[2:57:05.660 --> 2:57:07.660]  There's nothing positive about it
[2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:10.660]  I mean, we walked around the woman's march
[2:57:10.660 --> 2:57:12.660]  I mean, my father and my father stopped
[2:57:12.660 --> 2:57:13.660]  And prayed over these people
[2:57:13.660 --> 2:57:15.660]  And some people took pictures of them
[2:57:15.660 --> 2:57:17.660]  But I don't blame it for doing it
[2:57:17.660 --> 2:57:19.660]  It was just you got nothing out of it
[2:57:19.660 --> 2:57:21.660]  That's what everybody said it was there
[2:57:21.660 --> 2:57:22.660]  People that weren't Christian
[2:57:22.660 --> 2:57:23.660]  They said, I feel spiritual
[2:57:23.660 --> 2:57:24.660]  I feel like I'm in the presence of evil
[2:57:24.660 --> 2:57:25.660]  They would just start praying
[2:57:25.660 --> 2:57:27.660]  Because these are slaves
[2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:30.660]  You're seeing this earth as a boot camp, a test
[2:57:30.660 --> 2:57:32.660]  People that are deciding to choose the lie
[2:57:32.660 --> 2:57:34.660]  People that are deciding to choose
[2:57:34.660 --> 2:57:36.660]  Against men and women having kids and a species
[2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:38.660]  We're being tested
[2:57:38.660 --> 2:57:39.660]  I mean, it's incredible
[2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:42.660]  This is a beyond any science fiction movie, folks
[2:57:42.660 --> 2:57:44.660]  You're living it
[2:57:44.660 --> 2:57:46.660]  100% agree with it
[2:57:46.660 --> 2:57:48.660]  And it would open my eyes even more
[2:57:48.660 --> 2:57:50.660]  And there was just no message
[2:57:50.660 --> 2:57:52.660]  There was really no message
[2:57:52.660 --> 2:57:53.660]  Just all over the place
[2:57:53.660 --> 2:57:54.660]  And it was just
[2:57:54.660 --> 2:57:56.660]  And that's because the enemy always says
[2:57:56.660 --> 2:57:57.660]  Oh, you think we're done
[2:57:57.660 --> 2:57:58.660]  We have no message
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:00.660]  The message is there is no message
[2:58:00.660 --> 2:58:02.660]  We just have ten minutes of hate
[2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:05.660]  Mindless screaming people that think they're intellectual
[2:58:05.660 --> 2:58:08.660]  Exactly, I totally agree with you on that point
[2:58:08.660 --> 2:58:11.660]  And another one thing I wanted to bring up is
[2:58:11.660 --> 2:58:14.660]  I went to the second floor ball with my father
[2:58:14.660 --> 2:58:16.660]  Because we couldn't get into the other one
[2:58:16.660 --> 2:58:19.660]  And we met, his name is Zedek Gazda
[2:58:19.660 --> 2:58:22.660]  He was the one that took the video of Hillary stumbling into her van
[2:58:22.660 --> 2:58:24.660]  And you should get that guy out
[2:58:24.660 --> 2:58:25.660]  He is a really nice guy
[2:58:25.660 --> 2:58:28.660]  And he has a story to tell about how he got there
[2:58:28.660 --> 2:58:29.660]  You know, I think we ran into him
[2:58:29.660 --> 2:58:30.660]  And he was explaining who he was
[2:58:30.660 --> 2:58:31.660]  And the people were mobbing me
[2:58:31.660 --> 2:58:32.660]  And I didn't get to it
[2:58:32.660 --> 2:58:33.660]  I think we have his number
[2:58:33.660 --> 2:58:34.660]  I think Duke got it
[2:58:34.660 --> 2:58:36.660]  A memory server to get him on
[2:58:36.660 --> 2:58:38.660]  Yeah, that one guy probably changed the whole election
[2:58:38.660 --> 2:58:40.660]  One person, the lone wolf
[2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:42.660]  They fear so much, the lone individual
[2:58:42.660 --> 2:58:43.660]  The lone free will
[2:58:43.660 --> 2:58:44.660]  More calls coming up
[2:58:44.660 --> 2:58:45.660]  Only short is coming up
[2:58:45.660 --> 2:58:50.660]  But I'm gonna stay
[2:58:50.660 --> 2:58:52.660]  I am very proud to announce the introduction

[2:58:57.660 --> 2:59:00.660]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum

[3:00:16.660 --> 3:00:19.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:19.660 --> 3:00:32.660]  There's no need now to break the law
[3:00:32.660 --> 3:00:35.660]  No, it's fulfilled the law
[3:00:35.660 --> 3:00:40.660]  So I might as well put some action
[3:00:40.660 --> 3:00:43.660]  In my life breaking the law
[3:00:43.660 --> 3:00:46.660]  Breaking the law, breaking the law
[3:00:46.660 --> 3:00:49.660]  Breaking the law, breaking the law
[3:00:49.660 --> 3:00:50.660]  The law
[3:00:50.660 --> 3:00:55.660]  Resistence to tyrants is obedience to God
[3:00:55.660 --> 3:00:56.660]  The entire Bible
[3:00:56.660 --> 3:00:58.660]  And entire history
[3:00:58.660 --> 3:01:02.660]  Is about innovators resisting the tyrants
[3:01:02.660 --> 3:01:03.660]  Resisting the bullies
[3:01:03.660 --> 3:01:05.660]  And the bully's always a mass
[3:01:05.660 --> 3:01:07.660]  Huge power to suppress the people
[3:01:07.660 --> 3:01:09.660]  Because they know history's lessens
[3:01:09.660 --> 3:01:11.660]  But it's never enough to stop
[3:01:11.660 --> 3:01:17.100]  will of men and women who resonate with justice. And light is coming back into the world. Not
[3:01:17.100 --> 3:01:23.300]  the false light of Lucifer. Because he lost his light when he rebelled against God. He
[3:01:23.300 --> 3:01:29.460]  was only the bearer that shielded the host from God's full power. And now that Lucifer
[3:01:29.460 --> 3:01:36.020]  has fallen, God's full power can be delivered to the people. And all the Satanists and all
[3:01:36.020 --> 3:01:41.540]  the enemies try to resurrect their God. Their God was never a God and has fallen.
[3:01:41.540 --> 3:01:45.420]  George and Washington. Thank you for holding it on the air worldwide.
[3:01:45.420 --> 3:01:53.020]  Yeah, Alex. And contemplation of this Trump revolution and something occurred to me. For
[3:01:53.020 --> 3:01:58.480]  decades now the American people and indeed the world has been suffering under the genocide
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:02.980]  known as Pocospiric aerosol program or atmospheric injection.
[3:02:02.980 --> 3:02:06.820]  The big question is, is Trump going to kill the secret geoengineering programs? And the
[3:02:06.820 --> 3:02:09.700]  answer is, I'll bring it up to him next time I talk to him.
[3:02:09.700 --> 3:02:14.500]  I was going to ask you if you knew if he had this on his radar screen, and if not, how
[3:02:14.500 --> 3:02:20.100]  do we get it in front of him? And where do you place this on the important scale?
[3:02:20.100 --> 3:02:27.500]  Well, the secret manipulation of our atmosphere that the global escape of Nobel Prize 492
[3:02:27.500 --> 3:02:32.820]  that went operational by 95 is huge. It's a lot of its declassified. That's what's crazy.
[3:02:32.820 --> 3:02:36.220]  There's this giant body admitting they're doing it. We use the word chemtrails. So it's
[3:02:36.220 --> 3:02:41.860]  a layman term. They go, there's no such document. But when you go, oh, high altitude aerosol
[3:02:41.860 --> 3:02:47.060]  geoengineering program, they go, of course, it's going on big deal. You can read it CFR,
[3:02:47.060 --> 3:02:50.940]  UN, there's treaties on and it's going on. And then you actually study with scientists
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:54.740]  because most of it's classified. What would this do if you're doing this? They go, it
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:03:01.260]  would destroy the atmosphere. And then again, you say, is our humans running this? Because
[3:03:01.260 --> 3:03:05.740]  why would we want to do that? And again, I don't get into the whole UFO thing. I don't
[3:03:05.740 --> 3:03:09.580]  bash those that do because you can't, you can't prove it one way or the other. But I don't
[3:03:09.580 --> 3:03:14.140]  see it as a little tinfoil flying saucer landing. It's interdimensional. It's spiritual. It's
[3:03:14.140 --> 3:03:18.940]  an influence, like a carrier wave blasting at the earth saying, kill yourselves, kill
[3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:22.740]  yourselves, kill yourselves. It's like a psychic message. Kill yourselves, kill yourselves.
[3:03:22.740 --> 3:03:26.140]  Don't innovate. Kill yourselves, kill yourselves. Hate everyone. Destroy yourselves, destroy
[3:03:26.140 --> 3:03:30.500]  yourselves. Don't innovate. Don't get off the planet. No, no, die, die. Your species is
[3:03:30.500 --> 3:03:37.260]  ugly. You're no good. You feel it. And then basically these demons get humans to then
[3:03:37.260 --> 3:03:42.100]  build and manifest the geoengineering, the nuclear weapons, all this evil crap in hopes
[3:03:42.100 --> 3:03:46.500]  we blow the planet up. Like the Bible said, the devil's plans blow the earth up. I mean,
[3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:53.540]  Revelation describes pillars of fire 10 times the size of mountains and metal giant insects
[3:03:53.540 --> 3:03:59.460]  flying around, firing missiles, murdering everybody and huge plagues and the sea dying
[3:03:59.460 --> 3:04:05.220]  and turning red and, you know, volcanoes blowing up. And you're like, and everyone worshiping
[3:04:05.220 --> 3:04:11.540]  the beast and seeing an image of him that's a huge hologram. I mean, you read it. It's
[3:04:11.540 --> 3:04:17.780]  like, whoa, and Daniel and Ezekiel. And they're the little high priest of the fake Christian
[3:04:17.780 --> 3:04:24.220]  order lying, going, Oh, Ezekiel's figurative. Ezekiel's figurative. Don't know. That's
[3:04:24.220 --> 3:04:27.980]  none. Don't look at that. I mean, it's, it's a lot more hardcore than they tell you is
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:33.980]  what I'm getting to. Anything else, Morgan?
[3:04:33.980 --> 3:04:38.300]  What about your idea? What about your idea of where this fits in on this on the scale
[3:04:38.300 --> 3:04:42.860]  of importance? Because he certainly has his plate full and there won't be any shortage.
[3:04:42.860 --> 3:04:45.420]  Well, here's the deal. I don't want to get into talking to trouble the phones. It doesn't
[3:04:45.420 --> 3:04:48.660]  happen that often. The thing is, a lot of them listen, people listen. Let's just put
[3:04:48.660 --> 3:04:55.060]  it to you that way. So we don't need to even talk to him to get into that. But I can't
[3:04:55.060 --> 3:05:00.660]  talk about it. Okay. It's just, just, just believe me. Trump knows what's going on.
[3:05:00.660 --> 3:05:05.340]  The Associated Press is reporting this week that former President Barack Obama was releasing
[3:05:05.340 --> 3:05:10.660]  money right and left hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office on Friday. On Friday
[3:05:10.660 --> 3:05:15.460]  morning, he released $221 million in U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority on
[3:05:15.460 --> 3:05:19.500]  the morning, just hours before he was set to leave office. Now, one State Department
[3:05:19.500 --> 3:05:24.060]  official and several congressional aides say that the Obama administration formally notified
[3:05:24.060 --> 3:05:27.860]  Congress it's going to be spending that money on Friday morning, just hours before Donald
[3:05:27.860 --> 3:05:32.780]  Trump became president. Now, also more than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was
[3:05:32.780 --> 3:05:37.820]  released at the same time, including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.2 million
[3:05:37.820 --> 3:05:43.700]  for UN organizations. Now, GOP lawmakers have placed holds on the Palestinian funds, but
[3:05:43.700 --> 3:05:48.020]  not on everything else. Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch,
[3:05:48.020 --> 3:05:52.660]  but they're not legally binding. So it looks like Obama's funding spree, all of it is going
[3:05:52.660 --> 3:05:57.660]  to be going through and he did this literally hours before Donald Trump had taken the office.
[3:05:57.660 --> 3:06:25.660]  Well, I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.

[3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:31.040]  The age of denial is over and denied anymore.
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:47.280]  By the way, I've kept my mouth shut but let's pull up Fox News. Judge Napolitano is on there
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:53.920]  talking about the Supreme Court. Joyce, it's coming up. Our President George H. W. Bush
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:57.920]  famously appointed David Souter who turned out must be hard to sit on there and talk about
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:04.960]  yourself. What are you saying, Alex? I'm not gonna say it. Well, no, it was, it was,
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:10.880]  actually, I don't think it's going to be Napolitano. Not in the first round, no.
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:16.480]  You think maybe number second one or third one? Oh, I don't think anything. I just said that.
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:21.520]  Okay, wait, wait, wait. Rick Tillerson weeks before they said him. I mean, that's just the
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:25.280]  Easter Bunny told me it certainly wasn't President Trump and who talks to him. Wait,
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:29.040]  President Trump? Oh, the President Trump. President Donald Trump. He didn't tell me that. He didn't,
[3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:32.240]  though. He didn't. You know, it's, it's like media matters. He's Trump off because he's well
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:35.440]  known. People don't want to take credit for what he's done. I didn't say Trump gets stuff for me
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:39.920]  and does what I say. I say we're singing from the same sheet of music. That's why it's pure
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:43.920]  Americana. It's why they hear me say one thing he says is the next or he says is the nice saying
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:49.040]  because it's the same common sense approach that it's dialing into reality and not the giant deception.
[3:09:49.040 --> 3:09:52.240]  That's why you can go out on the streets of Washington, D.C. with all the other Trump
[3:09:52.240 --> 3:09:56.560]  supporters, people you've never met before and immediately you have a connection. Immediately
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:10:01.520]  you have some powerful, you can just feel it between you. I mean, there's videos of you dancing
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:05.280]  with people in the streets just smiling. I mean, you didn't, you didn't need to meet these people.
[3:10:05.280 --> 3:10:09.120]  You didn't have to have a conversation with them. You just say, hey, we want to make America
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:12.320]  gradient. Hey, we're patriots. Hey, we love life. We don't want to fight with them. We're lovers of
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:15.840]  liberty. You're a lover of liberty. We always spend it whenever you say a black person was
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:21.120]  incredibly smart or well-spoken. They go, that's racist. That's in the official university handbooks.
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:24.960]  Don't tell a black person they did good on a report or a speech or something because that's
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:30.480]  condescending. No, I tell white people or Hispanics that. And when I said that particular black guy,
[3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:34.800]  forget his name, that just came up and talked, that he was more eloquent than I was and crystallized
[3:10:34.800 --> 3:10:40.640]  and better than I was, I wasn't saying to be condescending. He was like, no, it's racist to say
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:44.080]  he can't be exceptional because they need the state to control the black people.
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:48.720]  And what freaks me out though is the white people and black people and others that support
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:52.720]  Hillary look like cars run over them. And it wasn't that they were just poor. A lot of them
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:57.360]  were professors and people. They're just giving in to lies and hate. They're the haters. Well,
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:03.360]  we don't really operate on the identity politics platform. No, I don't, but it's true that we
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:08.720]  just cover it because there are, I mean, that guy from India, I mean, he had more passion on fire
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:12.560]  than I am. But here's the thing, these guys only talk shows. I need to find out who that black guy
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:17.600]  is. Who that guy from India aren't given shows. Well, all I'm saying is, is they were amazing.
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:21.360]  And you go talk to some liberal black person. It's like a liberal white person. They can hardly
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:26.080]  talk, man. No, I mean, what has happened to these people, the people that I witnessed of all races,
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:31.840]  colors and creeds out in DC that knew who we were. What I'm saying, it was a beautiful crowd. Yep.
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:38.320]  That's it. And every person was beautiful. And it goes beyond just like, oh, the black people
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:42.640]  were beautiful, you know, for black people. I mean, they were exceptional, of exceptional.
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:47.200]  Well, since we're on that topic, Alex, this video is actually, it came down my Twitter feed. And I
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:51.760]  don't know how many people have seen this, if you've seen this, but there's this black barista,
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:57.120]  I guess it's at a Starbucks or something. And a white Hillary supporter gets fully triggered
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:01.600]  that there's a black barista. And apparently she's not getting tipped enough. And just like
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:06.640]  the liberal that we saw on the airplane, she goes into a full meltdown. They're totally entitled.
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:11.040]  She's screaming at everybody in the restaurant, screaming about how she wishes that, oh,
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:14.240]  I wish everything for you. Everyone in the restaurant is staring at this woman like,
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:18.800]  you have completely lost your mind. You've gone completely bad crazy. And then even the barista
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:23.600]  at the end of this, her little two minute rant goes, so was it coffee or caramel?
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:28.480]  She's like, I'm not even listening to you. You're out of your mind. This is probably
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:32.960]  some student who's just working to this, whether they were Hispanic, black, white,
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:38.400]  most people are intermarrying, just people. The Trump crowd was smart, informed, well-dressed,
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:43.680]  beautiful, electricity in their eyes. And then I didn't feel good that our crowd looked great.
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:47.280]  And I almost looked kind of like tired and exhausted compared to them. I was kind of like
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:52.080]  the 50th percentile. Whereas I walk around liberal areas of Austin, like a Donis or something.
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.240]  And then I'm just, it's like some, there's a big differences when I'm saying the articulateness,
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:04.640]  the smartness, the eyes, the eyes have it, Chico. They never lie. They've been, they have been
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:08.480]  psychologically defeated, Alex, is what it is. And for whatever reason. But they were,
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:12.960]  they were weird before, but I agree. They were just like, if Hillary had won, we would just start
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:16.240]  fighting harder. It's like, they thought they've lost, they're just flopping around,
[3:13:16.240 --> 3:13:19.680]  eating beetles on their backs. But for some reason, I feel like I wouldn't be out on the streets
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:25.360]  holding a sign. I just feel like that's not where I go. That's not what I do, because
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:29.440]  it just doesn't do anything. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not saying it's anti-American. I'm just
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:34.480]  saying I can, I can walk around on the street all day long and Hillary Clinton would still have been
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:38.880]  the president. I would rather be here with the microphone trying to inject reality, trying to
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:42.880]  inject truth, trying to cover the news. Well, yeah, they see a bunch of dumb, dumb people by their own
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:47.760]  system and think, great, these are victims. I mean, like the Democratic party lady saying,
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:52.000]  white people are inherently bad. I'll suppress them. I'm white, but I'll gatekeep the white people.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:56.160]  Again, the idea that white people are the problem. So what did you do, Alex?
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:13:58.320]  Why is everybody trying to get in the country's white people built?
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:03.200]  You've been sitting in front of that microphone for 20 years plus, and now Donald Trump is the
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:10.240]  president. Yeah, it's Twilight Zone. And I was on a flight back down here, and one of the Trump
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:15.120]  people was, uh, every told me what he was, but I know he is. He's on Fox. I did NDA also. I was like,
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:19.440]  don't worry, man. But I already knew all this anyways. And he was just telling me how much
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:25.040]  they love all our stuff. And, uh, the love out there was one of the head guys. And, uh,
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:29.280]  and it was just, it's just amazing. But it's not about impressing Trump or his family. They're like
[3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:33.520]  with us. These are people that already knew this before we came along. It's because they just see
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:38.560]  the same truth, but resonated with what we've helped build. They wrote it on this big populist wave.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:42.160]  I am not like a lot of people are like, aren't you mad that everybody really knows that more
[3:14:42.160 --> 3:14:45.920]  than half the Trump supporters are you and you're the reason you want. I'm like, I don't care.
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:50.560]  As if I have the skills of an executive and the energy of this guy, he's better than I am. I'm
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:55.040]  going to be honest about Trump. I'm better in some ways, but Trump isn't even showing you what he's
[3:14:55.040 --> 3:15:00.000]  got. That's what's scary. Let me tell you something. I don't want to get into like
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:04.000]  Trump cult here or something, but media is always, what's Trump talking about with you?
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:11.680]  Trump knows my agenda before I even talk to him and finishes my sentences when it's like the most
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.320]  great. He's like, synced. The guy's psychic. I'll just say it. Trump's got to be psychic, folks.
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:20.480]  It's like you're talking to Superman. And so the whole thing you see out there is his public persona
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:25.040]  is like one-tenth of Trump. That's why they're so damn scared of him, man. It's like God has sent
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:29.360]  like Superman to break their back. Well, they say he's a time traveler and he's actually from the
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:33.680]  future and he's here to save us. But the truth with Donald Trump, this is what they're saying.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:38.320]  This is what they're saying. I don't know, man. It's pretty weird. But Alex, here's what it is to
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:42.880]  me because I was going back and I was looking at some stuff that Donald Trump did back in the 90s
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:47.920]  when he was a billionaire. The guy is honestly just a hard worker and he just wants other people
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:53.200]  to work hard because he knows- Well, he's kind of OCD about success and victory. He loves piles of
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  work. I mean- But let's be honest though. I like piles of work to defeat them. I don't enjoy any of
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:01.680]  it. But let's be honest. When you're working hard and you have something at the end of it that's
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:07.760]  rewarding, that's a good feeling. That's a feeling of accomplishment. And I think that
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:11.360]  that's what Donald Trump wants to see in other people. Now, that doesn't mean you have to be-
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:16.240]  He does not get off on seeing your failure. Exactly. He gets off on seeing you work hard
[3:16:16.240 --> 3:16:20.720]  and being a success. That's what he gets up for. Now, that doesn't mean that you might- You might-
[3:16:20.720 --> 3:16:24.240]  You might not be someone that likes to work 40, 50, 60 hours a week. You might be someone that
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:27.120]  likes taking it easy and hanging out at the beach or doing- That's fine. That's okay.
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:29.920]  Hey, how do you think- There's all these other billionaires with hundreds of billions
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:32.960]  that can't beat Trump. Why do you think he's one of the lower-level billionaires?
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:36.800]  Why do you think he's got all these top guys ready just like to just go with him?
[3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:40.960]  It's because he's- Folks, he's- Well, he's been- Who knows how long he's been-
[3:16:40.960 --> 3:16:44.160]  You can freaking read your mind. That's why. And who knows how long he's been talking about
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:49.120]  this stuff behind closed doors. He signs the deal to get rid of TPP. He looked at the cameras.
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:53.040]  He looks at the people around. He says, we've been talking about this for a long time, right?
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:56.400]  So they knew. They knew he was going to- Take a look at Barron, like when he's walking behind
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:00.160]  his dad and then he's getting attacked. His dad turns his head and right as he does it,
[3:17:00.160 --> 3:17:05.440]  Barron turns his head. It's like, sink. Whoa. I'm not going to give the media a heyday,
[3:17:05.440 --> 3:17:11.360]  but it doesn't matter. The force is strong in this one. That's crazy. And they are freaking out.
[3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:14.080]  But as I've always said, for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:18.080]  They want to destroy humanity. They want to enslave us. God is going to
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:22.880]  ex-men, everybody that wants to beat them. Look at the Bible. Look at all the other cultures.
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:27.440]  When stuff gets really bad, people go to the next level. You're not going to suppress this.
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:33.280]  Not with your AI, not with any of your crap. Get ready. You're about to get overrun.
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:38.960]  There's so many people out there that are starting a new life with this Donald Trump
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:42.400]  presidency, whether it's a new job. And that's what it's about. They want us to feel beaten,
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:47.680]  disempowered, and this is real hope. This doesn't go by a lottery ticket. This is believe, work
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.520]  together. And by the way, we're going to bring the jobs back. They blocked. See, a lot of people
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:54.480]  think like Oprah Winfrey in the secret, like you just imagined something and that, but that's a
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:59.520]  total lie. It's satanic. You have to work hard, believe, have ancestors that built the platform
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:04.400]  for you and then use the avenues you were given. Then you could do almost anything and see what
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:08.400]  we've built. Humans envision it. We built it. It might take 100 years now, but we've built the
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:14.160]  technology up to the point that now what we envision can happen in a month or a year or an hour.
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:20.720]  You see, folks, that's the big secret. We're here at the cusp about to unlock all the mysteries.
[3:18:20.720 --> 3:18:26.080]  They've already unlocked a bunch of them. Okay. And the decision was made not to give us any of
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:31.120]  this and basically start wiping us out. Well, humans fighting back in the intelligence agencies,
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:36.080]  because they were given access to this said, what the hell? We're going to wipe out 99% of people
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:40.320]  and have the Zuckerberg merge with a machine because he doesn't want to see anybody on Kawaii
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:47.840]  at his house. You know what? We're coming for you, man. It's over. Not even a weekend yet.
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:55.120]  Look, he said it. It's the destiny. You're not going to stop the Providence and the destiny.
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:19:00.080]  We are accepting it like electricity. We're reaching up to God. God's free will. Not like
[3:19:00.080 --> 3:19:03.920]  the devil. We are reaching up for it, Owen. Just like you said, the night you couldn't even sleep,
[3:19:03.920 --> 3:19:08.480]  the energy level's going up so high, isn't it? And I mean, my energy, I can't even handle it so
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:14.400]  strong and we are reaching up for the Thunderbolts, the Promethean fire. Trump has reached for it
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:18.000]  and gotten it. I have reached for it and gotten it. You are reaching. Everyone is reaching and
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:23.280]  getting it, but God will only give you what you can stand. I'm 43, 43 and like a week or two.
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:28.240]  I just can't imagine if I'm able to honor it enough and bless them to live to be 70.
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:34.080]  Imagine the level then what this is going to be like. Well, we're, this is not going to be easy.
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:37.120]  Skip the break. They're going to continue to come after us. They cannot let humanity.
[3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:41.040]  Oh, listen, listen. We're only being given this respite and this strength and confidence to get
[3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:45.840]  ready for the big stuff we're going to face. Exactly. And who knows when they're going to
[3:19:45.840 --> 3:19:49.920]  try to stop humanity from getting to the stars, stop humanity from reaching its destiny like
[3:19:49.920 --> 3:19:53.760]  they've been trying to do for my entire life. The gremlins need to just get out of the way.
[3:19:54.640 --> 3:19:58.560]  Move. Get out the way because here's the thing too. If they were smart, Alex,
[3:19:58.560 --> 3:20:02.160]  they would have already done it by now. If they were smart, they would have put their tail between
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:05.760]  their legs and they would have said, you know what? We were defeated. If I keep trying to fight this,
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:11.360]  I'm, I'm, I'm utterly defeated. There is not nothing left. There's still something left
[3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:15.280]  to the globalist. There's not going to take his people up and give them everything without
[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:20.000]  testing them first. So if you continue to stand for the people that are falling, they don't get
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:24.400]  the incredible opportunities they're being given right now. Just give up. Stop it. Get out of the
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:28.960]  way. If you continue to try to fight humanity, if you continue to try to suppress humanity and all
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:33.280]  the things that we can accomplish, reaching the stars, life extensions, just all the technology,
[3:20:33.280 --> 3:20:36.880]  all the industry, everything Trump is talking about in that presidential inauguration speech,
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:41.760]  you're going to be completely and utterly defeated. You will be completely and utterly
[3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:45.920]  defeated. And it won't just be because of humanity. Humanity is already an unstoppable force,
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:51.040]  but God will completely defeat you. And that's what I knew before the speech. It was all
[3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:53.200]  secret about the speech. I didn't get this from Trump. The New York Times said,
[3:20:53.200 --> 3:20:57.280]  did you talk to Trump before the speech? They already were monitoring and had a guy looking
[3:20:57.280 --> 3:21:01.520]  for me in the crowd, New York Times. That's how the guy was obviously, you know, I'm just a New
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:05.680]  York Times reporter. And the point is, is that they were on me and they're like, how did you,
[3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:09.680]  you talk to him? Because they think it's all access physically. And I was like, no, I didn't
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:12.400]  talk to him. I knew what he was going to do. The New York Times said, I don't think they did
[3:21:12.400 --> 3:21:17.440]  an article. They go, he was taping. He goes, how'd you know that? I said, man, I didn't know it.
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:22.400]  I felt it. Was it, was it Benjamin Applebaum from the New York Times by any chance? Because
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:28.240]  that's the guy that started the fake news about the inauguration being low attended.
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:31.360]  He's the one that originally tweeted that picture. I found this out today. Benjamin
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:34.400]  Applebaum, Washington correspondent for the New York Times. It's funny you say that.
[3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:37.120]  You are fake news. I think it might have been him. I looked at the badge.
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:40.800]  He's total fake news. He's got bald head. I think glasses, maybe a goatee.
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:44.960]  Yeah. He had a goatee and glasses and a hat. Benjamin Applebaum. He's the one that's there.
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:51.520]  That's him. Oh my God. I can't believe this. Man. I mean, I have literally a point blank range.
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:54.880]  I got to start being indecisive. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did we talk about this before going
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:59.920]  on? Are we just on the same page? Are we just synced up? Look at the tweet. He's the one that
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:04.560]  started the fake news. CNN ran with it. Go to his media tweets. You'll find it. He originally
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:09.520]  tweeted, here's a picture from Obama in 2009. Here's Trump. Of course, it's at 8.30 in the morning.
[3:22:09.520 --> 3:22:13.600]  They won't even let anybody in. Protesters are blocking the way to get in. And then he's like,
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:18.000]  oh, nobody turns out. So Benjamin Applebaum is totally fake news from the New York Times.
[3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:20.800]  And I think that's him. I think that's him. The same guy. Yeah, there he is.
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:25.040]  How did you even think to, like, oh, I, I, oh, he ought to release the tape. He did that.
[3:22:25.040 --> 3:22:31.040]  8.20. It was at 8.20. So I was fake news. I said 8.30. It was 8.20 AM. So before 8.30 even.
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:34.800]  And again, they knew that they showed totally and people would go, oh,
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:37.440]  like, there was a crowd. They waited until like, they just started pouring in.
[3:22:37.440 --> 3:22:39.440]  And then I've got this story here. I think this was the,
[3:22:39.440 --> 3:22:43.360]  That's like saying a Dallas Cowboys game that was sold out of playoff game had only,
[3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:47.520]  you know, 20% attendance because you take a photo an hour after the kickoff.
[3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:51.120]  Yeah. You're like hours before the kickoff. I mean, like, they just opened the gates.
[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:55.360]  Oh, it's empty in here. It's like, no, everyone's out. And you're like at the Dallas Cowboy game.
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:00.160]  It's totally packed. You're like cheering with 80,000 other people. And then you get on Twitter
[3:23:00.160 --> 3:23:04.480]  and Benjamin Abelman's like, Oh, nobody was at the Cowboys game. You're like, what? I can't even hear.
[3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:07.200]  That's why we're here. And this used to get to me too. It still gets to me,
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:10.560]  but she's really going through this right now. Cause she has friends and stuff that are laughing
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:13.680]  at her. And she's not sad cause they're laughing at her cause she doesn't have any, you know,
[3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:18.400]  can't handle being laughed at. She's upset. I mean, it's upsetting when they've been brainwashed.
[3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:23.040]  It's upsetting when people are under this. This is a story from the independent journal review.
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:27.840]  They basically capture all the image from tooth, all the images from Obama in 2009,
[3:23:27.840 --> 3:23:32.960]  all the images, all the angles. And what you'll see is they're pretty much both completely packed.
[3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:36.480]  Okay. That's the truth of it. And they had people trying to keep us from getting in.
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:40.560]  Well, and we documented that. There was the one video. It was another, it was another white.
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:43.760]  By the way, you were in another area. I was blocked at three entrances and attacked.
[3:23:43.760 --> 3:23:47.600]  I was blocked. Trump had me thrown out of the inauguration. I got blocked at two areas.
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:50.880]  I think it was maybe the red and the orange entrance. There were like six or seven different
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:56.000]  entrances, but actually one of the videos that went really viral, it was on. Go back. It's
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:59.760]  even more packed for Trump. Look at these photos. Yeah. So there's the, this is from the independent
[3:23:59.760 --> 3:24:04.640]  journal review. But regardless, the point is, no, no, no, no, it was there. Apple bombs.
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:09.280]  No, but Benjamin Apple bomb is fake news from the New York Times. That's, that's what the story here
[3:24:09.280 --> 3:24:13.120]  is. And of course there were a lot of people out there, but nobody wants to talk about this. Alex,
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:18.800]  we had a video, the Trump protesters blocking the entrances and they were, they were standing
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:22.640]  in the, I'm not mad at our crew because no one was here to do it. But I kept saying,
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:26.880]  they're beating us up. They're taking women and there was a few blurbs, but to me, it was big.
[3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:32.480]  And instead I opened the newspaper up and learned I attacked Trump people and was thrown out. No,
[3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:39.120]  I couldn't get in for hours. I think that the video where the woman was getting assaulted,
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:43.520]  there was, I'm not sure if it was the same one that you saw, but there was a woman,
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:48.560]  she's actually from Austin. She's, she protests in Austin. She's from Austin. She was at the
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:54.880]  clown protest back when Trump was here in August. She was in DC. Rob do caught her. And then another
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:58.640]  journalist caught her spitting while they're blocking the streets. They were arm in arm
[3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:01.760]  blocking the street. You're talking about the big guy that hits the women and the men. Yes. No,
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:05.920]  no, I saw that too. Yeah. Okay. Cause I'm waiting to get my credentials. That's why I'm in the video,
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:12.160]  TMZ, but they're hitting him and some women. And then my security comes out as I just come out.
[3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:15.920]  I'm like, Hey, look at this. I told the cops do something. I'm, I'm, I'm across by the barricades
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:21.120]  of the main enters. They're trying to stop people even coming down the sidewalk to come do it. Right.
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:25.040]  They've got barricades up. So you've got to come down this tube and by then they're hitting him
[3:25:25.040 --> 3:25:29.600]  once the video's on. So he hits them back, hitting them with poles, punch you in the side and they
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:34.880]  spit on him too. Well, that's when he pushes her back. Yeah. Yeah. So no, no, no, no, no. Again,
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:38.880]  I wasn't even looking for this. I know they were attacking women 200 yards up is where the main
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:42.240]  assaults are going on where they're not letting anybody in. They wouldn't let us in there. They
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:47.200]  wouldn't want us in another one. We went around for hours with just lines. And I would, people
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:52.880]  let me cut. There'd be lines like half mile long trying to get in. I would just cut, you know,
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:56.320]  say, I got to get in. They go, Alex, sure. Go ahead and cut. And I'd get there and the cops
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:02.480]  were doing nothing. And there'd be like a hundred people blocking 10,000 getting in. But, but the
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:07.600]  Trump supporters aren't wimps. They're so nice. They didn't want to assault anybody. So the people
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:11.200]  knew their orders from Soros. They didn't know why they were being told this for blockage. So
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:16.320]  there wouldn't be a crowd, but still a record crowd got into spite. And I wanted that image of no one
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:20.560]  there because they had the Metro police on their side. They thought it would happen. But so many
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:24.880]  places, bikers for Trump and everybody's ran over them. That's another interesting thing that I'm
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:31.040]  trying to figure out here, because obviously we see confrontations with police like Eric Gardner,
[3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:35.200]  Kelly Thomas, and most police are good, but Obama is going to control that. Well,
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:40.560]  pull up the photo of the police wearing the Soros pink hats. But the strange behavior that I
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:46.960]  witnessed in DC was that not just the police were lack of confrontational, they just let
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:52.640]  people get away with this. I mean, outside only one side of the deplorable Alex. I mean, it was
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:57.440]  just complete chaos in the streets. They were throwing things, beating people, spitting at
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:27:02.320]  people. I mean, it's trying to rob people throwing batteries. And the cops just stood there and watched
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:06.320]  the whole thing. So it's like, I don't know. Let me hear something else. I'm sitting there with
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:11.040]  the Navy Seals and Army Black Ops folks as my protect. Well, I'm thinking of the whole story.
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:18.000]  But the point is, I'm sitting there and I'm watching all this happen. And they're like,
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:23.760]  look at this. And it showed the riot police that DC had. Purposely, they were the smallest men,
[3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:29.760]  men, women and smallest men. Again, like this, just to see what make the army wear red high heels.
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:35.120]  It was like put the biggest wimps in as the riot police. I had a group of two people. I ended up
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:39.360]  yelling at these people. The videos on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, they're walking around
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:44.160]  following me, saying my name, threatening me. The cops are right there like, oh, oh, enjoy it.
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:48.400]  We're coming for you, Owen. We're coming for you. Following me around. The cops are hearing the whole
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:51.440]  thing. It's hard not to break their nose at that point. And I'm standing there. I'm like, okay,
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:54.640]  the police aren't going to do anything. I have the video right in the face. I'm like, oh, are you
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:58.080]  fans of mine? You guys must be fans. And then they ignore me. I'm like, you know what, you guys are
[3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:01.840]  children. You guys are pathetic. And it's tough not to sock them right in the face. I mean,
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:06.560]  but then you know what happened after that? They went the cops actually pulled me away and
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:11.280]  forced me to go inside. They're like, Oh, quit confronting them. Just go inside. Like officer,
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:15.280]  you just heard them following me around, threatening me, saying my name. No, that would
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:19.920]  happen to me. I'm trying to get in to multiple deals. The police dragged me off and it turns
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:24.800]  into Alex Jones arrested drunk at the inauguration. So it's just it's just kind of this whole other
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:31.760]  strange thing we got going on with a new police behavior where they're not doing enough to stop
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:35.840]  these crazy people in the streets from coming. That's what Black Lives Matter in Soros is about.
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:39.440]  Yeah. Letting a cop know you ever confront a liberal. You're going to be fired.
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:41.920]  Exactly. So a lot of the cops don't like it. But they're just like,
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:46.000]  Oh, and that's another thing. I'm actually trying to find the original source for this. And I
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:52.960]  haven't found it yet. But the anti fascist and Tifa people put a post up somewhere. And I'm not
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:28:56.800]  sure where it was. I'm trying to find this. I've asked for people on Twitter to help me find this.
[3:28:56.800 --> 3:29:02.960]  It says, for those of you who were put in jail at the Trump protests, our handlers are going to bail
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:08.160]  you out. So who do you think that is? Well, they admit Soros funded 50 of the grips. Islamic
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:12.640]  Jihad funded a bunch of others. Hamas connected grips. Did you see all the women wearing hijabs?
[3:29:12.640 --> 3:29:16.880]  They had like Muslim women and men overlooking it, putting hijabs out of big bags on women's
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:21.760]  heads like they were being anointed that, Oh, I'm a liberal woman. I wear hijabs. And it was,
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:25.120]  and it turned out in the news that they were admittedly funding it. I mean, what the,
[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:29.840]  since when did the leftist women want to like be induction Islamic Jihad? Since they have no idea
[3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:34.720]  what it is, is my guess. No, no, no, no, no, they know they hate America and they hate the family.
[3:29:34.720 --> 3:29:38.800]  They hate white men as they love abortion. So I mean, I'm not saying if you've ever had an abortion,
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:42.960]  you're a devil. The point is you don't love it. You don't like make it your God, you know, you don't
[3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:48.560]  like run around. We're going to come back, take a few calls and play this compilation clip. Stay with
[3:29:48.560 --> 3:29:56.720]  us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:00.480 --> 3:30:04.160]  Well, just in case you missed it, info wars was on the ground live,
[3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:09.440]  covering every piece of action imaginable on the Washington DC grounds as the inauguration was
[3:30:09.440 --> 3:30:14.560]  taking place. And we caught not surprisingly a number of protesters behaving badly. One video
[3:30:14.560 --> 3:30:19.120]  shows a man frustrated with anti-fascist blocking a street in Washington DC. And one of these
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:23.680]  fascist punches the man in the face before being attacked. The incident taking place on Friday
[3:30:23.680 --> 3:30:28.320]  during Trump's inaugural speech. The video starts with an unnamed man, let's call him Thor, asking
[3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:32.400]  the anti-fata Stooges if they're going to prevent him from going to work because they're crying,
[3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:37.360]  you know what, then they seem to have lost it with the word war. Yes, pretty much a masked female
[3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:41.680]  responds. Come on, babe, let the ladies through at which point some of the women pass. Now,
[3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:46.240]  this guy rushes behind the women and turns around and says, f you, your roadblocks are
[3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:51.120]  expletive. And then she responds by attacking him. Yes, she punches him right in the face.
[3:30:51.120 --> 3:30:55.760]  Looks like these protesters that are part of the women's march after the inauguration were just
[3:30:55.760 --> 3:31:00.480]  as bad. Catch us here for all of the action. I'm Margaret Helve reporting for info wars.com.
[3:31:00.480 --> 3:31:04.480]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you know,
[3:31:04.480 --> 3:31:09.440]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:14.000]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman,
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:18.640]  and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:22.560]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,

[3:33:12.000 --> 3:33:20.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:26.480]  show. Broadcasting live from Deep in the Heart of Texas, Austin in the final days of the first
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:33.920]  month of 2017. Here we are. Donald Trump's the president. He's delivering just fantastically.
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:36.800]  You know, the crew made the point, I always tell them to bring up points that they think
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:43.440]  are important. They go, this is almost a diversion. The sanghy removed the bust of Martin Luther King,
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:48.000]  saying that there was no crowd there to see him. But you know, we have to fight these fights
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  because they've gone and defended themselves once they've been caught. I'm using the term
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:56.720]  double down too much, but that's what it is. We have to discredit them. So these are real
[3:33:56.720 --> 3:34:01.040]  fights. He knows what he's doing. He's making a big deal out of it because they want to discredit
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:08.720]  him. We've got to discredit them. That we need to bring over those people in the middle of the road
[3:34:08.720 --> 3:34:12.320]  who are seeing the people crying on the airplane, seeing the people crying on the streets, seeing
[3:34:12.320 --> 3:34:17.200]  us discredit the fake news. They're starting to come over to our side. That's why people chant USA
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:25.120]  when that liberal gets kicked off the plane. Who's just, they feel so entitled, but Trump, I mean,
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:33.280]  the TPP's gone. That didn't get being renegotiated. Huge jobs being announced. Every day coming back,
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:38.320]  the stock market exploding while the globalists try to deflate it. I mean, Trump is on the phone,
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:43.280]  hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs back to the U.S. and having success. I mean,
[3:34:43.280 --> 3:34:48.160]  in, he's doing it. It's straightforward. He's telling the truth. There's nothing hidden.
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:52.800]  How much do you think? Thank God we have a Russian president. Do you think Obama even tried to bring
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:56.960]  jobs back? Do you think he even cried calling anyone? But notice how they steal this piece of
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:35:03.360]  classic New York Americana from us and tell us though, this is a Russian blueprint. Well,
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:06.880]  I guess the Russians are our friends if they're running, trying to get all the jobs back here and
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:11.600]  trying to stop war and power the family. Thank you, Putin. Thanks, Russia. They'll probably
[3:35:11.600 --> 3:35:15.840]  take clips and have a saying that, but again, people know they're lying and that's out of context.
[3:35:15.840 --> 3:35:22.000]  And again, how, okay, the WikiLeaks have never been denied and Donald Trump is delivering for
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:26.720]  America. So if he's a Russian agent, thank you, Russia. I mean, it's just, it's the most ridiculous
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:30.240]  thing, but that, that whole thing has fallen on deaf ears now, Alex. They, you notice, although
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:34.560]  Gallup admits he's exploding, you notice how they're not trying to push that fake news anymore about
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:39.360]  Russia. They've pretty much given that up. Nobody talks about it. Chuck Schumer, CNN, they just,
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:44.480]  they just let it go. It was a huge deal. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Like this is the end of the
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:48.880]  world is pissing on him. This is the end of the world. Trump is a Russian agent. Trump elected.
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:53.040]  He was elected by Russia. Oh my God. They're flipping their file. It's Russia. And then just
[3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:58.000]  a week later, oh wait, listen, drain the swaps from Putin. Yeah, all these American jobs are for
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:02.400]  Russians. Don't you know we're bringing Russians over here to fill all these factories? No, we're
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:09.440]  not. No, we're not. But that's, but they gave it up. That's my point. It was, I want to go to phone
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:13.200]  calls. I want to play this clip, but it didn't work. They've been really nice waiting. What do
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:17.600]  you expect them to do next? Because I'm sure we've already played this and we haven't played it.
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:21.600]  The anti-Trump feminist chant a la Akbar during protests in Germany. I want to play that in a
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:27.760]  minute. Apparently honor killing stony women to death and FGM are compatible women's rights. And
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:32.720]  I had people when Islamic groups were leading the march and had women putting the jibs on. I was like,
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:37.360]  Hey, you claim him in locker room talk out of context. 12 years ago was bad. Okay. I don't
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:41.680]  really do that. But you record me all the time. Maybe sometime I'd say something like that. The
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:50.000]  point is, is that he's not actually running mass sex slavery of women like the Islamic jihad out
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:56.320]  of Saudi Arabia and killing women. If they drive the car to the grocery store, you know, and they
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:37:01.040]  just scream, you're an effing white male. Shut up. Let's cue that clip up video. Anti-Trump
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:05.200]  feminist chant. God is great. All Akbar during protests in Germany. Here it is.
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:14.320]  Laura, just chop your head off.
[3:37:14.320 --> 3:37:25.600]  That's a woman that looks like a man. They don't even let women speak in Islam.
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:32.880]  You just hit a woman. That doesn't look like a woman. Here, let's back this up. I got 20
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:47.760]  seconds. I saw a woman without her man and I chopped her head off. I'm gonna kill my daughter.
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:55.760]  She talked back to me. But it shows cuckolding. We haven't acted like men. And so now our women
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:00.720]  are running off literally wanting to be in sex life free. I guess that's the dynamic here.
[3:38:00.720 --> 3:38:07.600]  Let's go back to the unreal, obvious. She's obviously the man in the relationship. She's
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:11.840]  got her little girl there. So she loves her Islam. She's in charge. She likes it. She's
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:17.360]  like kind of the Janet Reno racial Maddow type, which is fine except you're chanting Allah Akbar
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:22.160]  while saying I'm a misogynist because I believe in males being strong and women being strong
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:27.920]  here in the West that gave birth to the entire putting women on a pedestal. This entire attack
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:33.520]  is on women. They are the species. Make no mistake. I'm a first wave masculinist. I want to hear
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:36.800]  more about this. I'm starting the masculinist. We're masculinists. I don't think you're the
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:54.720]  first to do that one. Okay, maybe. Anyway, let's get serious here. They were doing this on the
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:59.680]  street in DC. That always like weird Muslim men approvingly looking on. But that's what I'm saying.
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:03.760]  So this is not going to do. And look at the liberal women. Oh, Allah Akbar. How cute.
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:08.560]  Oh, dismantle white supremacy. It'll be dismantled when they take my head off my shoulders.
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:14.560]  It'll be great when I can't drive a car or go outside without myself. Yes. Can we show Saudi
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:22.320]  Arabian just type in male male escorts escorting Saudi Arabian women. They call it like men escorting
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:27.200]  Saudi Arabian women. Type that in. You have to have a male escort. Take you outside. But
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:31.760]  the women of Germany like, Oh, God, that's going to be awesome. Oh, it's so liberal.
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:39.600]  Like Allah Akbar. They're not coming with like a vibrator form. It goes Allah Akbar.
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:44.160]  They're like worshiping. Oh my God. Well, actually, I guarantee in Germany itself,
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:47.120]  I was going to say if you're a capitalist, that's something that you might actually want to try
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:51.920]  to actually, yeah, and it's got a little headshot, but it would also have like razor blades. You
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:55.840]  could just sexually mutilate yourself at the same time. It's like, I want to follow Islam.
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:40:02.240]  So you should sell them loppers like Islam conversion kit. Somebody like a pair of loppers.
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:12.160]  I'm not joking here, Owen. Oh, I know. It's just so ridiculous. I agree with you, dude. I mean,
[3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:15.360]  this is the most unintentional. They're out on the streets though. They're out. This is what I'm
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:23.040]  saying. This is why I would never protest because you getting in front of this microphone and
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:28.640]  fighting the lies and disinformation with truth and passion and humanity, you won, okay? You won.
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:33.200]  Getting out on the streets, we won. We won. Getting out on the street. Meanwhile, our brainwashed
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:37.120]  brethren run around screaming Allah Akbar. And you notice, I mean, I'm sorry, but when Martin
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:40.880]  Luther King walked the streets, here's the difference. This is why Martin Luther King
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:46.480]  walked the streets. He was attacked by people keeping him from marching and we were attacked. Exactly.
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:51.280]  That's why he did it because if he went out in March, he could illustrate how people would beat
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:56.480]  him up. But the meanwhile, it worked. Meanwhile, what do they do to us? We get beat up. They show a
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:41:01.840]  photo on the news and talk about the radio that I was arrested and they show a photo
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:08.560]  from eight months ago in July where the police were escorting me when I was attacked by communists.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:14.400]  They show that and say I'm arrested in DC trying to crash the Trump inauguration. They were trying
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:19.360]  to protest. See Cleveland police. They think you're so dumb. Back up on the very image. It says the
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:28.720]  date, the 22nd. Oh my gosh. This is, but they're in DC. No, Cleveland. So I got called. They said
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:32.400]  though, I was not just this publication. It's everywhere that I would look at Buckley there.
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:37.200]  They said I was arrested. And then all of this happened that I was here's the headline. That's
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:42.640]  so obviously Alex Jones is having a bad inauguration day and they admit I was kept from going in
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:48.240]  in the new republic. That's quote proof of my conspiracy. They were blocking me. Here's another
[3:41:48.240 --> 3:41:54.160]  one. Alex Jones gets kicked out of Donald Trump's inauguration video and it's video of them keeping
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:42:02.640]  me out and then they cut in shots of the police protecting me saying I was arrested again. Talk
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:07.360]  about. Can we go back to Allah Akbar? I'm going to go to the calls. One more. I got to get one more
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:16.160]  because God is great. I just want to bet that that is a paid atheist liberal and that she just
[3:42:16.160 --> 3:42:23.280]  wants to take crosses down. But to be rebellious and like pee pee in a pee pee on us, she then is
[3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:31.200]  running around saying Allah Akbar. Love Trump's hate. This is journal failure. And there's so
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:35.280]  much love on our side. I can't even tell. That's why I cut that radio on top. I can't believe all
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:39.680]  the amazing people. I'm sure that you experience it to Alex, but you know you got to be a little
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:43.280]  more tight with security. Well, the weirdest thing is this like women pretending to be men.
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:46.880]  One time I took my kids about a year ago with Shane Steiner and his wife who's very attractive.
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:50.240]  And I took my kids to the bowling alley. They got this place called Main Event.
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:54.400]  We go over just how to play pool some of the kids are playing another game of
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:43:01.680]  of of a bubble hockey bowling bowling. And we're in there and Shane's wife, Amy's,
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:05.600]  I can't believe this. And there's like little, there's like women that are about five foot five
[3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:11.600]  really skinny but butch haircuts in white t-shirts. Like they're who's the famous guy that the
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:15.920]  French love so much. James Dean. They're dressed like James Dean with cigarettes on their arms
[3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:20.160]  and everything. It's cool. And they're coming over like hitting on her right in front of us.
[3:43:20.160 --> 3:43:26.240]  And and she's like, get away. They're like, oh, yeah. And then they try to bull up to me a little
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:30.480]  bit. And I'm like, is this a joke? Because in a man's world, if you hit me, I don't care,
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:36.000]  you're dressed like a man. I don't care. They're a lesbian. I've got lesbians dressed like guys
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:41.280]  trying to pick up my buddy's wife who's a supermodel. I mean, this is reach next level.
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:46.240]  I mean, you know, I'm like a gorilla. I'm not bragging. I mean, it's like a war machine. I get
[3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:52.000]  in the fight. I'm sitting here with literal like five foot five women trying to take a woman away
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:56.160]  from us. You said this. Yes, she got mad. Amy says, I want to get out of here. This has got to stop
[3:43:56.160 --> 3:44:00.160]  because they were standing at the pool table next to us sharing us like they wanted to kill
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:06.400]  us after that saying I can't believe they hate lesbians. You said this yesterday that you think
[3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:12.400]  you could take on 50 to 100 of them. I'm dead serious. He's not exaggerating. You really could
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:17.120]  have until I run out of air. The problem is you run out of air, but it's in your fist. I'm broken.
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:20.720]  I mean, you still keep going. You might have been having that Trump energy. Just just grand.
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:27.040]  I was actually thinking about that because at one point I kid Daniels was filming me and I was
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:31.280]  standing in front of the Antifa people that were coming. There are a couple hundred of them
[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:34.480]  and I'm like, Oh kid, I'm gonna start recording, start recording. We got him coming up. And I
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:40.640]  just start reporting right there, but I could just see it. Alex Jones and Q take on the entire
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:45.680]  and seriously entire Antifa protest line. And then you just turn around. There's 200 of them.
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:48.960]  And then Alex is standing there. And then five minutes later, the streets are just empty.
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:55.200]  It's not anything. We're tough. They're that pathetic. Hey, hey, you found the doctor where
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:59.280]  they said, don't worry, our handlers will get you out. So yeah. So I think the crew found this too.
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:05.040]  And this, uh, this was posted on a 4chan thing by some anonymous and Antifa post here. So
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:09.440]  what they do is they say, Oh, this is what we've been doing for years. And I quote,
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:15.440]  we show up f up at fascist faces, break random s and then watch the right wing peers. And it
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:19.840]  goes on and talk about how they disrupt, disrupt, disrupt. But now they're all upset because we
[3:45:19.840 --> 3:45:25.120]  were actually arrested this time. We got rounded up and arrested. And now we face 10 years in jail.
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:29.920]  Some of us are even in still in jail now, but luckily of us, some of us got bailed out by
[3:45:29.920 --> 3:45:37.120]  our backers. So here's what I say because this was on 4chan. I think that 4chan should expose
[3:45:37.120 --> 3:45:42.800]  whoever made this post. I think that they should out whoever this person is, turn them into the
[3:45:42.800 --> 3:45:48.960]  DC police or the FBI. And we need to find out who it is that's backing them and why they're
[3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:54.400]  financing terrorism, because that's what this is. They admit it. They show up to fight people
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:46:00.240]  and break things. They were caught on organized crime. It's like the KKK in the 60s trying to
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:05.040]  block black people voting or marching. It's the same thing. How is it? Alex, explain this to me.
[3:46:05.040 --> 3:46:11.200]  How is it that we can have no knock drug raids on the wrong house, almost a weekly event in this
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:16.400]  country, but I can't get fascist protesters who are breaking things in the streets arrested?
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:22.080]  How is that going on? Well, it's one thing if they were like had a, were actually had some
[3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:26.240]  objective. It's to block us from our free speech. Or it'd be one thing if they were peaceful.
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:30.800]  Well, that's what you actually, you could protest to be heard. Notice they'll never talk to us. Oh,
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:34.720]  no. Because they're all bought and paid for. They are the bottom of the barrel. Some of them even
[3:46:34.720 --> 3:46:39.440]  admit it when they're like, Oh, sorry for professional reasons. I can't talk to you. Oh, why is that?
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.040]  Oh, professional already a professional protester now.
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:47.680]  Professional dumbass. No doubt about that. That's the new term. You know, my buddy Hugh has a name.
[3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:51.200]  I pull up that he's listening to some music. It's one of his friends. I said, that is the most
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:56.240]  horrible crap I've ever heard. He goes, yeah, it's called crap. And he goes, it's, I go, what's that?
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:47:01.040]  He goes country rap. And I knew countries been merged with rap lately. And I said, did you just
[3:47:01.040 --> 3:47:05.760]  coin that? And I said, yes, well, I'm stealing it. So here in bowl war steals, because he works for us
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:11.360]  for proprietary, my property, when they merge country with rap, it's called crap. So we've got
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:17.680]  crap music now. Country rap is crap, crap music. I've never heard. I've never heard any crap.
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:21.760]  No, that's new. Okay. It is horrifyingly bad. I don't want to hear it. I know that.
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:25.680]  I know you don't want to hear it. I actually, there's a rapper. You could definitely torture
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:29.920]  somebody. I was like, what on earth is that coming out of your car? There was a, there was a rapper
[3:47:29.920 --> 3:47:33.680]  from St. Louis called Nelly who tried to do that. I quit listening to him after that. The crap,
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:39.440]  he put out a crap album. Yeah, the merger of rap and country is crap. That's what it is.
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:45.040]  No, like it is though. But if it sounded good, I'd listen to it. I like some rap. This was crap.
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:51.040]  You like ludicrous? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like some ludicrous. He's kind of got a in your face type
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:57.120]  of rap. Well, move. Get out of the way. You see them headlights? You see me knock them curtains down?
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:03.360]  Who bought them TVs, bitch? Tell me that. Hey, you know what though, Alex? Of all the pathetic
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:07.760]  protesters that we saw, and I don't know how often you see this, but I see people that recognize
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:12.240]  us and they come up to us. And before they even talk about what news we do or anything,
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:18.160]  they talk about how they love our products. Yeah, we're going to plug. I see that every time.
[3:48:18.160 --> 3:48:23.200]  They say train is off the tracks, laugh out loud. We got to take a few phone calls. Hey,
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:27.520]  they're going to sell out in the next few days. It's the official artist that does the famous
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:30.640]  Reagan drawing. I want people to see the Reagan drawing because that's what's so cool. The famous
[3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:34.160]  one with him in the cowboy hat. It's beautiful. We have that thing in our office, too. He's done
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:41.440]  an original exclusive 2000 of these for us. This is on lithograph paper. High quality. There's only
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:46.320]  2000 of these. It was 500 have been sold as of this morning. At 1995, they're going to probably
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:50.240]  sell out today. I need to actually make some money to put up in the tube and pay for it. We're not
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:55.120]  making that much on this. I need to fund a new Washington bureau. Go get the nutraceuticals.
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:49:00.160]  Go get the t-shirts. Go get the products in four store.com. They're great products sourced by us.
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:04.800]  The highest quality. What we use at very low prices. Go check out the new body armor, the nano

[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:31.840]  or call toll free 888-253-3139. Okay, let's go ahead and take a few calls here. I told her by
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:35.200]  the big specials on these supplements were about to end that they're now gone. We can't go that
[3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:38.480]  long with them, but it doesn't matter. They're already great. They're already discounted. So
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:44.400]  support us. You want to see us raise more Hades against the globalist support us. Pray for us.
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:47.040]  Spread our links or articles. We're in a war against these people.
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:52.800]  I mean, we're evil folks that think it's weird to have feminists calling for Islamic jihad and
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:57.200]  Islamic sharia law, where they wouldn't be able to leave the house without a male escort, a male
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:50:04.000]  opinion, a male chaperone. Saudi Arabia, men must accompany women outdoors. Type that in,
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:08.480]  see it for yourself. And then they look at us going, ask you, ask you, jihad.
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:13.440]  Let's go ahead and hold them like a trooper.
[3:50:14.240 --> 3:50:19.280]  Abbott in California. You've held so long. Give John Harmon your name and number. He'll email it
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:25.680]  to us. We will send you one of these autograph lithographs of the 45th president of the United
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:32.800]  States of the galaxy. Go ahead. You're on the air. Hello, Alex. Hello, Owen. Hello, my friend.
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:38.320]  And greetings to the InfraWars team and crew. Thank you, sir.
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:44.000]  I'm calling today with something that might seem a little off topic and, but to me,
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:47.760]  it seems, you know, kind of the forefront. It's okay. We're not screening your call.
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:50.160]  I know most shows you call and they screen them, but you're on air.
[3:50:51.200 --> 3:50:56.880]  All right. So this may seem a little antiquated, but, you know, we voted for the president and
[3:50:56.880 --> 3:51:02.720]  got president and overwhelmingly apparently one of the other things that we have to do, I believe,
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:08.560]  is that we have to truly vote with our dollars. Now, no, that's right. I will not see a Tom Hanks
[3:51:08.560 --> 3:51:12.960]  movie, even though I like the actor Tom Hanks. I hate the person Tom Hanks. It's just over. I go,
[3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:16.640]  no, I'm not going to that. I actually go and read nowhere to not go into this. No, we're not going
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:20.160]  to that. No, we're not going to this. We start doing this. They're all out of business. Go ahead.
[3:51:20.160 --> 3:51:30.000]  So what I mean is by actually starting to pull the wealth out of the vaults of the banks and what
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:37.520]  people don't seem to realize is that our money, our currency is the US coin from 1790. No, I mean,
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:41.680]  I understand it all. It's cold and silver and that's great. But I mean, if Trump said control
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:45.760]  the fiat system, he wants to reform the Federal Reserve, if we mess with the fiat system right
[3:51:45.760 --> 3:51:50.240]  now, they're already trying it will implode everything. And I get it's a Ponzi scheme that Ron Paul
[3:51:50.240 --> 3:51:56.560]  has said, you just can't turn it off. You got to phase it out. You can phase it out by withdrawing
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:52:05.280]  coin from the banks and then circulating our currency. Now, so if I go to a bank, I can get
[3:52:05.280 --> 3:52:10.160]  real gold and silver coin. You can't. This isn't about gold or silver. This is about getting the
[3:52:10.160 --> 3:52:14.240]  species that's available to you currently. And that's pretty much going to be in the form of
[3:52:14.240 --> 3:52:21.120]  either copper or zinc, you know, whatever. But Eisenhower gave us the Eisenhower dollar in the
[3:52:21.120 --> 3:52:26.240]  70s. That basically weighs two halves. It weighs four quarters and it weighs 10 dimes. Those are
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:33.840]  the silver coins, you know, quotes. But basically, coin is decentralization. It puts the hand.
[3:52:33.840 --> 3:52:37.520]  No, I get it. We should keep cash. We should keep coin. I absolutely hear you. We need to
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:41.360]  keep that. The globalists want to get rid of it because then they can tax you by the banks
[3:52:41.360 --> 3:52:45.840]  when you do a withdrawal and make a transfer. It's horrible. Digital total money is horrible.
[3:52:45.840 --> 3:52:49.360]  Well, wasn't there a case, I think it was... It was a fail-ins. They've had to take
[3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:53.600]  money from people's accounts in Europe. Well, wasn't it Texas that tried to get
[3:52:53.600 --> 3:52:57.840]  gold from the Federal Reserve? Yeah. Federal Reserve was like, oh, and they just kind of put
[3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:01.280]  them in a waiting pattern and then they... Germany did, too....not producing the gold?
[3:53:01.280 --> 3:53:06.480]  Five years ago, Germany asked for some reason. That was $50 billion. They still don't give it to them.
[3:53:06.480 --> 3:53:10.480]  Yeah. So who knows if the gold's even there? Oh, yeah, it's a disaster. Great points. Write an
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:16.320]  article about it, Evan. Pretty complex thing for a call, but people shouldn't... Ryan Little King
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:25.120]  from Canada. Hi, Alex. I'm a big fan. I listen every day. Hi to you and Owen. I've been a police
[3:53:25.120 --> 3:53:30.960]  officer for 15 years in Canada. I've been aware and researched globalism since I was about 17.
[3:53:30.960 --> 3:53:36.720]  I used to live in the United States. That's how I found the show for that topic. I've been listening
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:43.920]  to your show since about 2008. Thanks for your support for law enforcement and for your criticisms
[3:53:43.920 --> 3:53:50.560]  where criticism is needed. I've been hoping for a long time that you would be coming up to Canada
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.120]  branching out here. On a Sunday broadcast, I heard you mentioned that you were considering
[3:53:55.120 --> 3:54:01.200]  branching out to the UK or Europe with Watson. And today, I heard you say, again, that you feel
[3:54:01.200 --> 3:54:06.640]  that maybe it's time to branch out globally. And I'm calling to say, please do, Alex. Please do.
[3:54:07.360 --> 3:54:10.960]  Well, I'll do it if the money comes in. I don't like managing things. I can't stand it. And I'm
[3:54:10.960 --> 3:54:19.520]  not a good manager at some levels, but we just have a commission. I mean, I keep waiting for
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:24.080]  people to do it, but we want to do it. And so we're going to try to do it. It's just up to you. So
[3:54:24.080 --> 3:54:28.960]  I appreciate your support. No, I'd be in presumptuous here, Alex, but given the opportunity to change
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:34.080]  careers, the heartbeat to join in for war. And I have some capital that I could bring to the table
[3:54:34.080 --> 3:54:38.960]  and I would be more than that. Listen, we'd love to do that. It'd be easy to have an infiltrator.
[3:54:38.960 --> 3:54:43.040]  We've had that before, but you sound great. We have people that go to our distribution center
[3:54:43.040 --> 3:54:46.720]  that isn't even our same building and try to knock on the door and get in. And, you know,
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:50.640]  we're like 10 miles away from where they're coming, trying to get jobs. We don't even have the money
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:54.640]  yet to hire a bunch of people. Then we got to vet them. But yes, we do just write articles,
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:59.440]  write blurbs, source info wars, show us the work you do on YouTube, write articles, do it under
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:05.040]  a known diploma, a pen name. And then Paul Watson for about two years was writing about info wars
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:11.440]  18 years ago. He was 17 years old. And when he was 19, I hired him. He's been here 16 years. So
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:15.440]  Paul Watson, when I only had like five employees, liked what we were doing, was listening to us,
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:19.840]  did a great job, wrote, had his own website, did his own advertising, made money himself.
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:23.040]  And I went and hired him. And I had to actually, I was like, well, you're already making that much
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:27.280]  off writing about my show. Well, I guess I'll match it. It was like a couple thousand a month.
[3:55:27.280 --> 3:55:32.320]  That was a lot of money for me at the time, but we did it. So kind of go out, prove yourself.
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:38.880]  And I'm not saying prove yourself saying prove who you are, create your curriculum vitae. And then
[3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:43.600]  we'd love to get you part of the operation because as we grow, we want to hire more people. It's
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:47.760]  just that it's very hard to do. And then we have attrition because folks can't handle this info
[3:55:47.760 --> 3:55:51.280]  or they got a family member that's sick or, you know, they've got something else they want to do.
[3:55:51.280 --> 3:55:56.240]  That's great. But we do have an attrition rate. Also, people get on air. They kind of get their own.
[3:55:56.240 --> 3:56:00.880]  Wow, I'm really a big wig. I want to go do my own thing. And they run off like people, you know,
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:05.760]  to an elephant graveyard to collapse. I wish they'd go off and be successful. But I hear you.
[3:56:05.760 --> 3:56:11.520]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. You know, you went out, you proved yourself. Oh, and you
[3:56:11.520 --> 3:56:16.400]  went out. You went out dominated, you know, and he'd scree looks and all of it. And then we've
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:20.240]  hired you. You've done a great job. So that's how it works. We kind of have to see people in
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:25.840]  action. Well, and the thing about it is, it's just this place can't be run like a typical business.
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:30.800]  There's so many people that want to work here. There's so many great people that send us information.
[3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:36.400]  I mean, my email alone just gets hit all day long. I can't even imagine yours or Rob dude.
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:41.680]  We get father emails there. Yeah. So I mean, but that's what you're talking about. If you go out
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:47.360]  there in the battlefield, you stick your neck out there and you prove your worth in the battlefield.
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:50.880]  That's how you're going to get noticed. You I'll be honest with you, Alex. I sent my resume here
[3:56:50.880 --> 3:56:56.080]  probably five times and nobody I don't even think anyone still to this day has even read my resume
[3:56:56.080 --> 3:56:59.840]  to be perfectly honest. Well, how are we supposed to work at guns? But that's what I'm saying.
[3:56:59.840 --> 3:57:04.480]  Literally, it's where we're on the battle tank. We're on the battle cruiser in the battlefield.
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:07.840]  And then people are like, Hey, look at my resume or hey, can I get a job? And it's just like,
[3:57:07.840 --> 3:57:11.760]  sorry, I got a nuclear missile. I'm trying to get, you know, get rid of off my back here.
[3:57:11.760 --> 3:57:15.040]  And you know, I'm just kind of crazy every level trying to defend Trump to get worried.
[3:57:15.040 --> 3:57:18.640]  It was just like, we can't, I mean, it's no insult. People used to send emails like,
[3:57:18.640 --> 3:57:23.520]  I got a return from Governor Jeff Bush and I go, fine, set up auto returns to people.
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:27.760]  And we do look at some of it and read the stuff. I mean, like 500 letters a week. I don't want to
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:31.200]  discredit letters. I'm trying to look at them. We get great clippings. It's kind of like,
[3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:36.240]  we're just grounding. You go out and attack the enemy. You politically, you go out and speak
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:40.320]  out. You go out and challenge him. Start your own YouTube channel. And the truth of the matter
[3:57:40.320 --> 3:57:44.400]  is now is the best time to do it. There's so many people out there that are taking advantage of this
[3:57:44.400 --> 3:57:51.440]  time in history. They see the void of real news versus fake news. They see no fill it.
[3:57:51.440 --> 3:57:56.400]  Don't think you just come to info wars or like Drudge, you know, at one of the highest levels
[3:57:56.400 --> 3:57:59.600]  right away. Like, I don't think I'd be the president right away. You know, I'm like, like,
[3:57:59.600 --> 3:58:03.040]  like jealous Trump's bigger than I am. I love it. He's like at that level.
[3:58:03.680 --> 3:58:07.920]  By the way, the first time caller artificial intelligence, social media, I'm out of time,
[3:58:07.920 --> 3:58:12.480]  try to call back tomorrow. Yeah, they're planning to take over with all this artificial intelligence
[3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:18.160]  fake bots to look like humans to make us feel alone. So that's a whole nother topic. Just know
