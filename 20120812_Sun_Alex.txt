[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.000]  Well, every radio broadcast we engage in is extremely important, but this one obviously more than many of the others.
[00:39.000 --> 00:50.000]  It is Sunday, the 12th day of August 2012. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next two hours,
[00:50.000 --> 01:00.000]  because we are every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, 12 to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[01:00.000 --> 01:11.000]  Coming up in about 35 minutes from now, we're going to have Max Kaiser on with us, former stockbroker and vener of the virtual trading systems.
[01:11.000 --> 01:26.000]  He is going to be joining us to break down the controlled implosion of Europe that is being segwayed into the controlled implosion of our economy by design.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  And we're going to break down the Reuters article carried by Chicago Tribune and others.
[01:32.000 --> 01:44.000]  Exclusive, U.S. banks told to make plans for preventing collapse, but then they go on to say it was largely held secret. There's nothing really new in this article, but it did get some attention in the last few days.
[01:44.000 --> 02:00.000]  What's Saturday and today? Yes, in 2010, plans were drawn up to deal with the second banking crisis or collapse and for there to be no, quote, government bailouts, taxpayer bailouts.
[02:00.000 --> 02:09.000]  Same thing was done in 2008. They make you beg to basically have a tax to the banksters to prop up their derivatives that are impossible to prop up.
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  But now they're admitting that the recession never ended almost four years ago. Now they're admitting the globe is in a depression.
[02:16.000 --> 02:31.000]  More and more experts are breaking this down and our police and military sources are saying, and you've heard them on air, but you've also seen the news, they're preparing for civil unrest or delivering giant black armored war wagons to every major city.
[02:31.000 --> 02:46.000]  The military, the army is saying only the army can keep order, but the economy is so great, but we're going to have local governments collapse and go bankrupt and then have the military roll in.
[02:46.000 --> 03:04.000]  And Ron Paul, back in May, warned of this. And he also warned before that back in February of this year.
[03:04.000 --> 03:20.000]  But he's been warning going back to my film, Matrix of Evil, shot here in Austin in 2003 about once the globalist implode the world economy by design with derivatives, the great danger comes when they pose as the savers.
[03:20.000 --> 03:36.000]  So Max Kaiser is going to be joining us coming up a little bit after the bottom of the hour. He'll be with us for the balance of the broadcast and we're going to take your calls in the second hour for Max here today, your questions, your comments, your statements about the true nature of the economy.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Now, some people say, hey, let's put a good face on this is all confidence based.
[03:42.000 --> 03:54.000]  And if we were in an economy that wasn't fully manipulated, the confidence is important. But the only confidence out there is in the globalist that they want to destroy confidence in the real economy.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  They can very hard to operate if you're not an insider, the globalist exempt themselves to crony monopoly world.
[04:02.000 --> 04:20.000]  So the only system that they allow there to be confidence in is their fraud that is based in our enslavement. And so we have to create zero confidence by pointing out this criminal operation, or they're going to be able to complete their takeover and their
[04:20.000 --> 04:34.000]  claim. The only way out of this is is waking up to the fact that it's been engineered and these people are bragging about it. So that is the big issue. We're going to be breaking down. We come back. We'll play part of Ron Paul's warning.
[04:34.000 --> 04:45.000]  We'll get into all this news. There's a lot of other news. The reporter that broke it a year ago says that it was really a pedophile ring there in pervert Valley.
[04:45.000 --> 05:00.000]  Well, of course it is. But now it's in the news that Sandusky was pimping little kids. Of course he was. Now the president who helped cover it up there at the university has been sent to homeland security.
[05:00.000 --> 05:15.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[05:15.000 --> 05:32.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[05:32.000 --> 05:50.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[05:50.000 --> 06:03.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:20.000 --> 06:42.000]  Welcome my friends and thank you for joining us. We are live on this 12th day of August 2012. Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:42.000 --> 06:59.000]  Former top stockbroker even worked with George Soros and his son and of course invented what is now used as the virtual trading software by Goldman Sachs and others. Max Kaiser, worldwide TV host and radio host will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:59.000 --> 07:12.000]  He's over in Europe. It's late at night there, but I'm going to twist his arm to join us for about an hour and 20 minutes or so so that in the second hour today, we can open the phones up for your economic questions or statements.
[07:12.000 --> 07:23.000]  And he's got some big inside dirt on JP Morgan. Chase, over and over again, he's broken big stories here on the air. He rarely contacts us. We usually end up contacting him to come on.
[07:23.000 --> 07:34.000]  He contacted us Friday after the show and said, I got something big. How soon can I get on? And I said Sunday show. The producer did. So he'll be joining us.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  Here's the deal. We got Paul Ryan being picked as the VP for Mitt Romney. Going to get into that. We've got Daily Mail and others reporting. Jerry Sandusky shared boys.
[07:44.000 --> 07:57.000]  He molested with other high profile pedophiles linked to Penn State as part of a sex ring. Gee, do you think fish swim in the sea? He was raping kids in the middle of the work day in the showers.
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  The former head of the school that helped cover it up. The Washington Post is reporting.
[08:03.000 --> 08:16.000]  Graham Spanner has been sent to a national security job. So secret, we can't be told what it is at the Department of Homeland enslavement.
[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  Gee, I got a lot of heat saying that Paterno knew what was going on when this first broke last year.
[08:25.000 --> 08:35.000]  Of course, you know, they've pulled down his statue now. Again, ladies and gentlemen, the only thing that's never ceases to amaze me is the depths of the naivete.
[08:35.000 --> 08:45.000]  18 plus children. I found press reports before this even a reportedly broke. I went back and found articles from 1992.
[08:45.000 --> 09:01.000]  Supposedly all started in the late nineties. I remember having a Senator John DeCamp on who wrote the Franklin cover up more than a decade ago when he said that his investigations of child molesters running the government.
[09:01.000 --> 09:16.000]  Of course, the camp was also former CIA went all the way, all the way to places like the Penn State football program. And of course, in that interview for more than 10 years, I think it's 12 years ago, people found it online.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  You hear me saying, let's not go there. No, no, no, that hasn't been adjudicated in court and shutting him down. He said Boys Town in Pennsylvania was doing it. That came out years later.
[09:24.000 --> 09:42.000]  I mean, the stuff that he discovered is unbelievable, but confirmed. It is just the depths of evil that have taken over. I mean, look at the reports out where the head of Homeland Security in New York is suing Janet Napolitano.
[09:42.000 --> 09:58.000]  He's got a bunch of men lined up as witnesses. They would do things reportedly to the men in Homeland Security. I mean, senior deputy directors and people in the Justice Department that I can't even say on air, even though it's in a New York Daily News or places from the suit.
[09:58.000 --> 10:16.000]  These people are crazy. Okay. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. So again, I told you, ladies and gentlemen, if they're raping kids and broad daylight on weekdays in the showers at the fieldhouse, that means the entire systems involved.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  I don't know how many of you played football. I played football. Wasn't very good at it. But let me tell you, middle of the week in a fieldhouse, it's full of people.
[10:24.000 --> 10:36.000]  At night, it's full of coaches watching film tapes. Field houses at a high school are full of people, much less a major college. They're like an anthill. Okay, okay.
[10:36.000 --> 10:52.000]  That's the kind of news we'll get to later. Let me just get into Paul Ryan now. But here's what the big broadcast is about today. This is what the meat of the broadcast is about today.
[10:52.000 --> 11:03.000]  The military admits now that they're preparing for civil emergency martial law by another name is still martial law.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  The quote Shakespeare arose, still arose by any other name.
[11:08.000 --> 11:31.000]  Terony is still Terony by any other name. Now, this is a long-term program. This is going on before we went into the Depression in 2008, with all the Cook numbers, how we left the recession four years ago, and, you know, the fake Nielsen ratings and the fake Gallup poll and just this whole fake system may spew at us.
[11:31.000 --> 11:51.000]  But if you look at what's happening with the Euro, if you look at what's happening around the world, the 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion plus, in fake derivatives that make Bernie Madoff and Kenley Blush, if you look at all of that, it is hundreds of times what we owe or what we could ever pay back.
[11:51.000 --> 12:03.000]  The banksters that run the six megabanks that have bragged that they've cancer, I just had a Freudian slip called them cancer, that they have conquered the world. This cancer has taken over.
[12:03.000 --> 12:16.000]  And as Max Kaiser said a few weeks ago on my show, I'm always pointing out these people are cancer, they want to take over. If cancer had a consciousness, it would, you know, think that it was survival of the fittest social Darwinism.
[12:16.000 --> 12:28.000]  It's its right to take over. When really it kills the host. And Kaiser said, yeah, cancer is programmed to take it all. They're programmed to take it all. They will take it all.
[12:28.000 --> 12:45.000]  They've got the mainstream media up there shilling for them, the establishment facade. Now that that facade is crumbling, they're coming in with internet censorship and control of the new media and presidential alerts breaking in over radio and TV and your cell phone.
[12:45.000 --> 13:02.000]  But bottom line before we go to break and come back and I really break this down system why not just here but all over the world because it's a global system these these these Ponzi scheme operators got the planet to buy into based on the dollar.
[13:02.000 --> 13:16.000]  They are preparing for a total collapse from which the banksters are going to pose as the savers and a big telltale sign of when they're getting ready to drop the hammer.
[13:16.000 --> 13:32.000]  And Fox News, Chicago Tribune, Reuters, Washington Times. I mean, I've got them all here about martial law about highway checkpoints about financial collapse, but just starting to report on it like it's not a bad thing.
[13:32.000 --> 13:46.000]  Washington Times is saying it is a bad thing that the others are talking about how great this is. Hey, gee, I wish our study had some troops marching around. I've actually played newscast here in St. Louis where they have regular army driving around and tanks arresting people and running
[13:46.000 --> 14:02.000]  checkpoints and they got guys in the news going gee I think it's really great wish they'd stay. Well, don't worry they will. So this is the conversion of our economy into the Ponzi scheme. They sign on your pensions the country everything to too big to fail.
[14:02.000 --> 14:16.000]  And it's designed to black hole everything into it with the bankers regulating it with a total centralized system picking winners and losers, aka monopoly cronyism mafia kleptocrat government fascism
[14:16.000 --> 14:34.000]  and corporatism is not a good enough word for it with socialism at the bottom of it to keep the public through socialism that leads into communism dependent on systems that offshore banks run because they've got to have groups that'll burn the cities
[14:34.000 --> 14:48.000]  down if they don't get their welfare checks or the welfare checks stop having purchasing power. And that's the question I want to pose here I'm going to write an article of Watson the next few days dealing with historically other empires Rome and others bringing in large immigrant populations
[14:48.000 --> 15:08.000]  creating large welfare populations exact same things been done before all of those ancient civilizations and even modern ones end up collapsing and large swaths of burning show Rome burned will the west. There's already fires and riots and and police shooting people all over Europe
[15:08.000 --> 15:24.000]  once beautiful bastions of wealth are pitted out husk Argentina just 15 years ago was the richest country south of the United States 100 years ago the saying was as rich as an Argentine that they were even richer than the people in the US per capita
[15:24.000 --> 15:42.000]  all of that's gone totally enslaved to shovel because they signed on to the Ponzi scheme here's the point the globalist want to implode things to buy everything up for pennies on the global digital currency strategic reserves special drawing rights
[15:42.000 --> 16:00.000]  SDRs so when we come back Ron Paul's warning of it of how they're going to stage the collapse and bring in martial law as the solution we're going to break that down play a clip from a talk Ron Paul gave that we're going to get Max Kaiser on about this and a lot more stay with us
[16:00.000 --> 16:14.000]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions only corn soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices
[16:14.000 --> 16:29.000]  the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from food direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases

[20:17.000 --> 20:25.000]  for us you want answers well so does he it's Alex Jones on a GCN radio network
[20:25.000 --> 20:51.000]  all right Alex Jones here we are back live on this Sunday broadcast
[20:51.000 --> 21:05.000]  well a lot of people are really excited because mainline neocon radio told them that Paul Ryan is so conservative that George Washington basically worships him from the grave
[21:05.000 --> 21:23.000]  the problem is his record not his rhetoric but his record he supported no child left behind the federal takeover of education the prescription drug benefit known as the largest expansion of welfare states since Lyndon Johnson's
[21:23.000 --> 21:39.000]  transportation security administration he helped set that up as well the TSA to grope everybody that harasses all the travelers and groves your family he supported the Patriot Act giving government enhanced powers for warrantless snooping
[21:39.000 --> 21:55.000]  the troubled asset relief program that bailed out the too big to fail trillions of dollars of your money the foreign banks he supported bailing out General Motors and using your tax money to ship it to China and the National Defense Authorization Act
[21:55.000 --> 22:13.000]  the secret arrest and killing of U.S. citizens in short he is a typical Bush era Republican that's what Jack Kenny the new American magazine wrote we've got a story up at info wars dot com and I agree with those statements Paul Ryan's Tea Party problem voted for bailouts before he was against it yes
[22:13.000 --> 22:31.000]  and again people say well then what are you going to do vote for Obama no I'm just saying let's get honest here the global offshore banks that are financing Mitt Romney and financing Obama get what they want and these guys are puppets at the end of the day
[22:31.000 --> 22:52.000]  sure with Obama you get some really nasty anti second amendment Chicago crime syndicate people who are really dangerous but Mitt Romney has supported banning semi autos before and you notice we've seen Fox News promoting banning banning the owning of semi autos
[22:52.000 --> 23:03.000]  we've seen Bill Crystal we've seen Rupert Murdoch we've seen Bill O'Reilly we've seen Michael Savage come out and say you know what ban semi autos
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  and if that doesn't concern so-called conservatives I'm just a constitutionalist
[23:09.000 --> 23:20.000]  Thomas Jefferson was called a classical liberal well you know what I like Thomas Jefferson I've read his writings I like what he had to say you want to call me right winger left winger whatever I want freedom
[23:20.000 --> 23:30.000]  okay and when foreign banks in hundreds of publications we wrote an article a few weeks ago titled banks declare they've conquered the U.S. and Europe
[23:30.000 --> 23:40.000]  and it has all the video clips of the head of the EU and the head of Goldman Sachs and CNBC and the Economist magazine bragging that they've conquered us
[23:40.000 --> 23:52.000]  and that they're going to use the crisis that Herman von Rupy at that time head of the EU now he's head of the council saying we're going to use this crisis to bring in the world government
[23:52.000 --> 24:01.000]  and we're going to use the crisis to take over in fact I've got articles here today where the Federal Reserve Chief was on national news what Friday
[24:01.000 --> 24:13.000]  and then again this morning Bernanke of the private Federal Reserve saying Europe needs more centralization and more power and more taxes and then lectures the people says they're lazy
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  books the Europeans aren't lazy and what are Americans working three jobs on average a piece lazy too
[24:19.000 --> 24:28.000]  no most the money doesn't even go to welfare it goes to these cronies and the Fed she was talking about all this dictatorial control they want
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  there's two articles up at drudgereport.com these are also in infowars.com right there in the middle column they've moved down from the top
[24:36.000 --> 24:47.000]  one of them is something reported on a week ago but it's finally getting out there and that's good news the Civil War of 2016 U.S. military officers are told to plan to fight Americans
[24:47.000 --> 25:04.000]  in a quote Tea Party insurrection and it just goes on to talk about how they believe the main threat is going to be the Tea Party and linking up with Al Qaeda
[25:04.000 --> 25:19.000]  and you're like that's ridiculous the Tea Party is so Islamophobic if they see a Sikh who isn't even Muslim people start at 20 to attack like piranhas but whatever you heard at Tea Party you are with Al Qaeda
[25:19.000 --> 25:28.000]  of course I told you the internal documents already said that you've heard that here about 5,000 times probably no exaggeration I say it every day last four years since we got secret documents
[25:28.000 --> 25:38.000]  three and a half years ago saying returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians literally in the army drills the bad guys wear overalls or coveralls and John Deere hats
[25:38.000 --> 25:51.000]  leave it at footage of it in my films where they films like police state for the rise of FEMA my fourth police state film and the guys they fight are wearing farmer outfits
[25:51.000 --> 26:05.000]  the military doesn't train to fight Al Qaeda our military trains Al Qaeda they use them against the Russians the Serbs in the mid 90s and then they used them against Libya and now Syria and the CFR came out last week
[26:05.000 --> 26:17.000]  and said quote we need Al Qaeda I have links to that in articles right now saying how good they are so Al Qaeda is now good the TSA needs to go down your pants to check and see if
[26:17.000 --> 26:32.000]  and you know check and see if Hank Williams is hiding under there because that's basically who they don't like so here it is and it's the Washington Times they have links to the there's a whole bunch of military reports
[26:32.000 --> 26:44.000]  and then Drudge also links to our report by Suzanne Pausel US Army tactical manual describes how to control domestic insurrection that's another one how to put you in a reeducation camp
[26:44.000 --> 27:01.000]  oh yeah it's public they don't even hide that the FEMA camps that don't exist in Mexico so so I thought you might want to just check those two out because because here's the issue I'm going to say this very very slowly because we have new listeners
[27:01.000 --> 27:15.000]  that we're gonna go to Ron Paul before we go to Kaiser because I'm gonna have him on to the next hour we're gonna come back and play clip from Ron Paul and go to Max Kaiser and I want to say right now foreign mega banks are bragging can we cue that clip up from from
[27:15.000 --> 27:33.000]  CMBC that I played 20 times that they're bragging everywhere that they've conquered America and to to make sure they fully bankrupt us under their control they have been training the military to take our guns and put us in labor camps and collapse society
[27:33.000 --> 27:48.000]  and Ron Paul is talking about this and they're going to use the giant welfare hordes as the weapon to make us beg for it so here is a clip of them bragging that we're under global government run by international bankers here it is
[27:48.000 --> 28:04.000]  mostly what they do is hold summits I think that right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim
[28:04.000 --> 28:21.000]  Mario you say we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke put put and that we won't go any lower than say 5% down from here
[28:21.000 --> 28:34.000]  and of course we are because if we look at the economic data there's nothing to get excited about in that all right let's just stop right there and then they go on with all four guests admitting we're under global government slave to bankers but in our article bankers
[28:34.000 --> 28:48.000]  declare they've conquered the US and Europe they we've got clips of them saying they've conquered us and laughing about it because they know you're watching the Olympics they know you're watching dancing with the stars they know you're watching America's got talent they know
[28:48.000 --> 28:59.000]  you're watching you know paint dry okay I'm not saying you're bad that you are but the point is these criminals that make Bernie made off look like an angel are in control right now
[28:59.000 --> 29:09.000]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[29:09.000 --> 29:19.000]  not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[29:19.000 --> 29:29.000]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[29:29.000 --> 29:39.000]  eat foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about their delicious long term storeable foods
[29:39.000 --> 29:47.000]  the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait

[30:14.000 --> 30:22.000]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity

[33:00.000 --> 33:10.000]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:30.000 --> 33:46.000]  my friends the United States and the rest of the world is being mocked up we've already been captured to a great extent
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  but we're going into draconian authoritarian oppression because the ruling class that happens to be private central bankers
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  they hired the ADL and southern property law center the last 50 years to demonize anybody that pointed that out including congressmen
[34:02.000 --> 34:10.000]  they have people arrested in Europe that point that out they have now openly themselves bragged we have captured you through fraud
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  now we're going to take over what's left now we're going to shut down your cities via agenda 21 and carbon taxes ha ha ha
[34:18.000 --> 34:29.000]  and now my military sources but also in mainstream news and my police sources are saying October late October early November total collapse
[34:29.000 --> 34:39.000]  Chicago Tribune saying that the federal government's getting the big six megabanks five of them us ready during a collapse to not have federal help
[34:39.000 --> 34:49.000]  just really incredible information I have a video showing all these articles up at info wars dot com titled us banks told to prepare for total collapse
[34:49.000 --> 35:00.000]  that's up there red link to info wars dot com under it I'm driving into work Friday and see a drone over 290 I got footage of it got out found the operator
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.000]  it was text dot you want to see that footage it's up at info wars dot com so these are the proliferating so much now that I can't even drive to work
[35:09.000 --> 35:20.000]  of course past that was a checkpoint on the road to for trucks but it blocks the road it's just such a free country so we're going to be going over all of that right before Max Kaiser leaves us
[35:20.000 --> 35:32.000]  now it's it's close to midnight over there in Europe on the continent where he joins us from we're going to be going to him here in just a second to go over this but here's the 64 million dollar statement
[35:32.000 --> 35:44.000]  if we do not identify the globalist as the culprits of this they're going to continue the collapse because it's designed they brag it is to consolidate power as they pose as the saviors
[35:44.000 --> 35:54.000]  they're always busy you know telling you you're not in a recession or depression but give us more power or you will be as they walk us in to this system that they've bragged they're establishing
[35:54.000 --> 36:06.000]  we'll talk to Max Kaiser for the balance of this hour and as much of the next hour as he can do as we take phone calls in the next hour but first here's Ron Paul just an excerpt the full speech is up at info wars dot com
[36:06.000 --> 36:19.000]  Ron Paul warns Americans of coming economic collapse and he's getting into point three here the dollar is inevitable to fail will other currencies fail first and then it they're all tied to it or will it fail first
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.000]  here is a few minutes of that and we'll go to Max Kaiser of Max Kaiser dot com here it is
[36:25.000 --> 36:37.000]  it's impossible to predict the time when confidence will be lost but it can come quickly resorting to buying other paper currencies will not be of much help when the dollar crashes most likely the purchasing power of all currencies
[36:37.000 --> 36:47.000]  since all currencies hold dollars as a reserve will go down as well this means that dollars and other currencies will go into buying consumer items precious metals and other physical properties
[36:47.000 --> 37:00.000]  consumer prices will soar as well as interest rates the central bank will lose control and the more they inflate the worse the competence becomes the interest rates will respond to these efforts by rising sharply
[37:00.000 --> 37:10.000]  if the Fed tries to reverse the run on the dollar interest rates will also soar and the pain on the American citizens will be of such proportion that political chaos will result
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  either scenario leads to political and social chaos the third event and the most dangerous
[37:17.000 --> 37:25.000]  with no ability of the federal government to fund its commitments international or domestic major changes will occur in our system
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.000]  the social unrest will elicit cries for government to exert unusual force to head off a complete breakdown of law and order
[37:33.000 --> 37:43.000]  the ultimate trap will be set for a system of government claiming to protect a free society if more power and police authority are not given to the federal government
[37:43.000 --> 37:52.000]  it will be argued that only anarchy will result if more government policing power is given it will mean a lethal threat to civil liberties
[37:52.000 --> 38:04.000]  already we have permitted the notion that a single person the attorney general or the president can decide who is an enemy combatant thus denying that individual the right of habeas corpus
[38:04.000 --> 38:14.000]  permitting indefinite detentions without charges made this attitude towards civil liberties has changed significantly since the fear built around 9 11
[38:14.000 --> 38:23.000]  yes I know declaring one an enemy combatant is reserved only for the radical Muslims engaged in terrorism against the United States
[38:23.000 --> 38:33.000]  to be reassured by this reasoning is quite dangerous and naive logic should not lead us to equate suspects with terrorists and include American citizens
[38:33.000 --> 38:43.000]  and yet this has already been set by precedent under difficult circumstances our political leaders will not be hesitant to use these powers to maintain order
[38:43.000 --> 38:55.000]  tragically the people may even demand it we are rapidly moving toward a dangerous time in our history society as we know it is vulnerable to political and social unrest
[38:55.000 --> 39:05.000]  this impending crisis comes as a consequence of our flawed foreign and domestic economic policies a silly notion about money ignorance about central banking
[39:05.000 --> 39:16.000]  and ignoring the onerous power and mischief of out of control intelligence agencies are unsustainable welfare state and a willingness to sacrifice privacy and civil liberties
[39:16.000 --> 39:29.000]  in an attempt to achieve safety and security from an inept government dangerous times indeed what can be done about it must we wait for the inevitable and expect to restore our liberties in a street fight
[39:29.000 --> 39:38.000]  against the overwhelming power of the state not a good option the only way that we we can prevent blood from running in the streets is to offer a better idea
[39:38.000 --> 39:50.000]  of the proper role of government in a society that desires first and foremost liberty and that is impossible without a firm commitment by our thought leaders to the ideas of freedom
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  the source of all creative energy and prosperity and all powerful state is the threat the all powerful state is the threat that's what America's built on
[40:00.000 --> 40:08.000]  and Max Kaiser three and a half years ago in the Obama deception broke down exactly what would happen economically and we've now seen it unfold
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  he'll be with us throughout the next hour he joins us from the continent of Europe right now normally a France he's in Amsterdam right now
[40:16.000 --> 40:25.000]  and of course Max Kaiser is a filmmaker broadcaster former broker and options trader he is known for his invention of virtual specialist technology a software system
[40:25.000 --> 40:35.000]  used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange and a lot of the new systems are based on that and for his accurate predictions of global economic events he correctly predicted the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac breakdown
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  and what happened in Iceland's economy and it just goes on and on it's labeled JP Morgan the biggest financial terrorist on Wall Street
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  he's got some breaking news on them but we'll get to that when we start the next hour we're going to break here in a few minutes Max you heard what Ron Paul was just talking about
[40:50.000 --> 40:59.000]  it's now confirmed they're gearing up the military for every US city and telling banks get ready for collapse but telling the public everything is just fine
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  Max Kaiser what is the real state of the world economy right now
[41:03.000 --> 41:14.000]  Hey Alex great to be on well last time I was on your show remember you asked me to make a prediction when this global collapse is coming I said on the outside maybe nine months
[41:14.000 --> 41:25.000]  but even in those short few days since I spoke with you last it seems like the drum beats are beating louder toward this idea of a global financial collapse
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  and the banking regulators are asking all the big banks around the world to come back to them with a worst case scenario what you have on your books
[41:33.000 --> 41:44.000]  and how would you go through a collapse and interesting JP Morgan of course responded they said that they've got a negative equity of about 30 or 40 billion dollars on their books
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  so the entire 140 billion dollar market cap would be gone in an Enron like instant
[41:50.000 --> 42:01.000]  of course they're totally plugged into the Fed and the Treasury which would collapse the Fed and the Treasury and the US dollar so when Ron Paul talks about the collapse of the US dollar
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.000]  what you fill in here for the for those who are following this at home and want to get the whole playbook
[42:07.000 --> 42:21.000]  first we see the collapse of JP Morgan then the collapse of the Treasury and the Fed and the collapse of the dollar brought about by JP Morgan's books which have 90 trillion dollars worth of what they call derivatives
[42:21.000 --> 42:32.000]  basically claims that are impossible to ever fulfill that's bigger than the entire gross domestic product of the entire planet earth 90 trillion dollars just one bank
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  all right now now stay there Max because again you're retired at a young age former stockbroker inventor of a lot of the modern systems they use today
[42:40.000 --> 42:51.000]  but come back in layman's terms even for our business listeners break down the point we're reaching right now and why they've got armored vehicles being loaded off trains in every major city right now
[42:51.000 --> 43:00.000]  for the American people and the people of Europe why are they gearing up for total collapse can it be averted stay with us
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  hey hey guys thanks a lot for having me talk to you about
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  florida 95% of the fraudulent tax returns are coming from florida
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  so says the agent that I spoke to
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  the day before you guys broke the story about this huge fraud
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  you know either they don't have the money to pay
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  you know the people that the real people that you know
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  have their tax returns being held up I'm an identity debt victim
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  and she said that they were from florida at 400,000 returns blah blah blah
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  you know the ineptitude is just you know ridiculous
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  and you know it's like okay I guess she says
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  well ma'am just to be clear 95% of it's not informed
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  that's just the person you talk to
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  the big processing center for the IRS that broke that here in the US
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  they they're reporting on it going on all over the country
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  but what's your question for max keiser
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  well you know and again like I said that the big place in Austin
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  that's where everybody has to send their returns for fraud
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  so to answer your question about why all those tax centers are in Austin
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  is because that's where the people who have to send their paper
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  sure what's your question for max we're almost shows almost
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  and my question is and in a separate thing is just real quick
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  I listen to all issues but what do you guys think of the zeitgeist movie
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  and its contention that we should just take all of our money out of all the
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  I think it's absolutely horrible that guy told me
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  yeah thank you for the call that guy told me I should be sent to a reeducation camp
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  everybody living in a big plastic city with a government computer deciding
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  who does what sounds like hell I mean you have send me to hell
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  that's basically where that would be comments on that max keiser
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  well yeah a full disclosure I'm in that movie
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  but I've never seen it well I'm in it too
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  it's been seen tens 50 60 million times just one version
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  but let's go to let's just get off that
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  ma'am if you want to go to the plastic city it's waiting for you
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Aaron in Washington you're on the air we got to move quick here go ahead
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  yes Aaron that was explosive how you got on the air go ahead
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  hey hey I got you Max quick question price of discovery
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  most people aren't aware of how the commodities markets work
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  what is your anticipation of how we're going to see a collapse of price of discovery from paper
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  going over to real physical
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  okay well price discovery is what happens at the point of a sale
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  where the buyers and the sellers are mixed together
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  and a price that is mutually beneficial to all parties is derived
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  through something usually called a specialist
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  now I created invented the virtual specialist technology patent number 5950176
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  US Patent Trade Mark Office
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  which is an improvement on that technology
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  it has been hijacked by canner Fitzgerald and canner entertainment
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  so it'll never see the light of day
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  but going forward now you have rogue computers that are programmed to
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  do what's called electronic wash trading
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  where they pick a price above or below the current market
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  and they put on a series of trades
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  and buys and sells simultaneously to manipulate price direction
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  and that's not price discovery
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  but they do that to manipulate markets
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  and to confiscate wealth from these markets
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  isn't that just high-tech naked shorting
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  it's high-tech lynching
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  high-tech it's siphoning off of the, it's siphoning essentially
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  basically the stock market by and large is becoming a pure fraud
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  which I even saw mainstream articles the last two weeks saying
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  all this high-frequency trading is discrediting the integrity of the system
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  which you had just said the week before
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  how long until this becomes evident
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  and the fraud makes the whole thing fall in on itself
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  because all of this fake price discovery
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  the caller makes a good, you know, it's a good call, it's a good concept
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  and people should familiarize themselves with this idea
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  but it hollows out all the what you could call collateral of the system
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  so you have transactions, you have trades, you have fees
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  but there's no collateral backing it up
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  so the only thing that is backing it up
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  are these 0% interest rates that allow for unlimited borrowing at zero cost
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  so we're fueling the speculators, gotta jump to another call
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Jeff in Michigan, you're on the air and then James, go
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Hello Max, my question is
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  you're more familiar with what has gone on recently in Greece
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  and the people's reaction
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  do you believe the banks are going to, in order to keep the public's confidence in them
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  are they gonna try and blame a collapse on a war, on the drought
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  or something other than their derivatives
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  or will it be transparent to the public and they'll
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  Yeah, how do they find golly that the Greeks are lazy
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  that's why their government signed them on to Europe's debt
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  to turn it around backwards, I mean, where is that going?
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  Well, scapegoating is a known scyopt, isn't it?
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  We saw that in Europe in the 30s
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  and one group had their wealth confiscated
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  and then they were scapegoated, they were called vermin by the other side
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  and they eventually were all incinerated
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  and when Paul Morris says we're going through a financial holocaust
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  with 100 million people already put into poverty by the crisis
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  over the past five years with millions now dead or dying
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  this is exactly what is going on
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  and they will use any event that they can to mask the holocaust
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  it could be an agricultural drought, it could be a spying food prices
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  it could be a collapse of a bank
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  that's one that they use often and quite effectively
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  then one of these too big to fail banks collapses
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  could be standard charter, it could be HSBC, it could be Bank of America
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  suddenly now there's a crisis, suddenly now there's...
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  Point is the whole system is based on massive fraud
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  thank you Jeff, James in North Carolina, you're on the air, welcome
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  Hi, thanks for the time, two quick questions
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  one, Max, will the euros with Laura at 120 hold?
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  No, okay, the other question is
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  I'm holding a bunch of puts on Morgan
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  if the stock goes to zero will I get paid
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  or will they just say yeah we owe you the money there's the door
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  if you won't see it?
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Well, you have good company there because I believe Jim Rogers
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  is also a short JP Morgan, he's a big time money manager
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  but the puts, if you're short, you go through the options clearing corporation
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  which I guess if Morgan goes under
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  they will have trouble matching trade, so I would say...
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  Yeah, but the governments will just pay it off in devalued dollars
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  and other currencies, the problem is that will bring in hyperinflation
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  I believe they're going to continue to bail out and pay all this off
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  it's just going to go into hyperinflation, Max
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Yeah, well the caller was asking specifically about the workings of the options market
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  and having been an options broker on Wall Street for many years
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  and one of the biggest options producers in the shares in Lehman-Hutton system
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  I would not hold those contracts
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  So you think they may actually stick people that are trading?
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  Alright, got it, kind of like we saw in the MF Global, thank you James
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Other question?
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  Will I see volatility increasing in JP Morgan between now
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  and the time that the derivatives come home to roost?
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  All of the trades are computer generated
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  and you see for example in the volatility index which is called the VIX, the V-I-X
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  it's not reflecting the true underlying volatility
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  So all of the signifiers that would tell you how bad the volatility is
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  are being curbed, they're being shut down with all this computer trading
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  So you can't get a good...
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Exactly, as it gets more and more fraudulent they scramble the numbers more and more
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  which fogs the whole system
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  Thank you James
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Audrey in Dallas and then Peter, we're getting everybody in
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  Audrey, quick question
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  Alright, my question is, Angela Merkel has been front and center in Europe
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  with Germany being the big powerhouse economically speaking
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  and it's come out recently that their economy is finally on the chopping block
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  What's the trigger to watch for as far as Germany's collapse?
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  Well, we've been saying Germany is really the big beneficiary in all this
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  You know, before the euro was created they were forbidden from reuniting
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  then magically what the euro came, the reunification of Germany
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  and they're the biggest winner so far because
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  if they go to a European wide fiscal consolidation policy
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  we run out of Berlin and out of Frankfurt
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Germany is now conquering economically
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Yeah, they are doing what they have tried to do before
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  and a lot of people call it the forthright
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  and keep in mind that Germany's unemployment numbers are very strong
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  they have very strong employment numbers
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  their social welfare system, the healthcare, etc. is in surplus
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  and their export market, as long as they're in the euro
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  and the euro is weak, their export market thrives
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  they don't want to leave the euro because then they
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Basically, it's like you said, musical chairs, but the people are also
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  got musical hang grenades
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  and who knows who the hang grenade is going to explode in their hand
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  but it's going to kill everybody in the room
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Here's a prediction, you know, a wildcard prediction
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Everyone has been talking about China as being the next superpower
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  I disagree, I think China is going to collapse
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  I think the next superpower is going to be Germany
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  I've been saying that for two years now
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  I agree with you, I agree
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  the euro rising, absolutely
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  Well, the Deutsche Mark could rise, but the reconstituted
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Eurofied Deutsche Mark run out of Berlin
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Max, we got to get you back on later in the week
