[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, June 9th.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  The year is 2021.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and wow, it's all coming out.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Remember, one of the top globalist strategists
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  and one of the main field marshals, Klaus Schwab,
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  set on international French television
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  that first we're going to make you stick barcodes on your hands
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  to buy and sell, then you're going to accept implantable microchips.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Now, CVS across the United States makes their employees wear a barcode
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  stuck to their hand as part of this conditioning mechanism.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  We got exclusive video of this.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  We found out there was one mention of it in the news
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  and almost no one else covered it.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  But this is just one of our crew members at the pharmacy.
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  I should have noticed that they have these barcodes stuck to their hands.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  And indeed, that is going on.
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  We're going to be showing you that coming up later in the transmission today.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  Now, before we go there, we have the huge news
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  that we now have Dr. Dazwick,
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  the head of the Wuhan Gano Function Program for Fauci,
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  his direct lieutenant, his aide to camp,
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  admitting that, quote, Chinese colleagues
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  were developing killer coronaviruses at the facility.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  So we already knew that, but they lied about it to Congress previously.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  That is a giant, giant, giant development.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  Then, of course, we have Laura Ingram last night covering this.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  Operation lockstep from 11 years ago,
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  which is the blueprint for what you now see unfolding.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  That is so huge, and that is coming up as well today.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  Also, Greg Rees has done a new report on the Nuremberg Code
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  that has a whole bunch of really, really prominent scientists
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  and lawyers, top law firms, pointing out that this is punishable by death and execution.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  What's going on with the intimidation
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  and an attempt to forcibly make us take injections,
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  which is now becoming officially forced inoculation.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Nuremberg 2.0 is the video.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  It's very, very important.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  We're going to be getting to that, actually, next segment,
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  but it all integrates together.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  And then Judge Joe Brown, man, amazing,
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  went to dinner with him for almost three hours last night.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  He held court there, and he did all the shows,
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  my show, the War Room, American Tunnel,
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  and he's leaving today, but he's back,
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  and the guy can talk more than I can.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  It's just amazing how smart he is,
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  the incredible, famous trials he held,
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  and also he's quite the deep-sea diver.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  Really, back when that was all pretty damn dangerous still is,
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  back in the 1960s and stuff.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Incredible stories of watching killer whales
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  kill and eat sharks and dolphins and everything else.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Pretty amazing.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  My wife was blown away after, like,
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  we were sitting there eating for two and a half hours, three hours.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  They were turning the lights off at the restaurant,
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  and my wife's like, I want to keep hearing more of this.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  So I'm telling you, he's quite the storyteller.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  Pretty amazing.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  Let's go out to break with a little bit of Laura Ingram
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  talking about Operation Lockstep
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  that we covered 11 years ago.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Here it is.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  Oh, by the way, the think tanks in Washington.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  It's a malapropism.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Think tanks are on board, too.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  Back in 2010, the Far Left Rockefeller Foundation
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  helped produce a shockingly prescient report
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  on four possible future scenarios
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  that could play out over the next 15 to 20 years.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  One of them involved a global pandemic
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  that's remarkably similar to what happened
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  over the last year.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  During this pandemic, quote,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  international mobility of both people and goods
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  screeched to a halt.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  Normally bustling shops and office buildings
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  sat empty for months,
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  devoid of both employees and customers.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  National leaders around the world
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  imposed airtight rules and restrictions
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  from the mandatory wearing a face mask
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  to body temp checks.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  Wow.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  That does sound familiar.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  11 years ago.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  The report went on to detail how the powers that be
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  would never let that imaginary crisis end.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Even after the pandemic faded,
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  this more authoritarian control and oversight
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  of citizens and their activities stuck
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  and even intensified.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  and their privacy.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Laura, this is coming up today.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  My enemies are your enemies.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  They're the globalistic extremists.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  They are a consortium of bad scientists,
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  pedophiles, control freaks, devil-worspers,
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  vampires, wherever you want to call them,
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  that are highly predatory
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  and are setting up a false
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  famously land system
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  of constant bombardment of propaganda,
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  drugs, and electromagnetic
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  radiation
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  to change the very DNA
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  of the human species
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  to mutate us into a form
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  that they can control
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  like a pawn on a chessboard.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  The bottom line is
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  they want to play God. They are playing God.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  And the news is only going to
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  tighten around our necks from here on out.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  So many other people want to be positive.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  They want to put out fake news
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  and want to only cover limited amounts
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  of what's happening with New World Order.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's all about world government.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  It's all about the end of the human system
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  as we know it. And on its ashes, a nightmare being built.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  it's June 9th
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  on this live, original Wednesday
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  transmission.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, very thankful
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  for you all tuning in today.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  Every broadcast is important, but today
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  there's a confluence of events
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  that are just very startling
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  and extremely revealing on so many fronts.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  How are the globalists going to carry out
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  a worldwide takeover, a medical tyranny,
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  a forced inoculation with a deadly gene therapy
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  and establish a world ID,
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  the Mark and the Beast Implantable Microchip System,
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  which is now being announced officially
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  by Gates and by Klaus Schwab and others.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Well, they're going to create racial
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  and cultural division
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  as a distraction while they do that
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  and Obama and others have been running around
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  race-baiting in a massive way.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  We're going to have Judge Joe Brown
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  again today in studio with us
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  because two hours yesterday was not enough.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  And then we've got Larry Pinckney already scheduled.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  He's going to be joining us in the third hour
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  dealing with the attempt at race war
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  because that is the big push this summer
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  in the next year.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  They are also gearing up with racial conflict
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  in Europe as a way to keep
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  political control over any populist movement.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  So look for that
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  as well today.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  This first hour
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  is something you got to tell everybody you know
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  tune in for
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  because we have exclusive
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  video of
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  what's coming in the very near future
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  what's already here in many areas
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  and that is companies making you not just
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  where necklaces that track you
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  and beep if you get within six feet of others
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  but barcodes stuck to your hand.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  Next will be implantable chip
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  Klaus Schwab sets
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  will pull that video up as well.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Then even more out of control.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  The Nobel laureate for the discovery
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  of HIV
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  and the development of the first HIV vaccine
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  has
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  done another big interview
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  and is warning
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Luke Montanier
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  that
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  the PCR
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  systems and all the rest of it are basically
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  a fraud that none of these things
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  are going to protect you.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  The COVID-19 is basically an overblown hulk
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  but most importantly
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  that the main line literature
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  shows that if you create an autoimmune response
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  to this common protein in the body
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  that can basically grow
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  crystals
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  in your brain, heart and lungs
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  and arteries similar to mad cow disease
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  and kill you and we're already seeing
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  these neurological disorders
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  we're calling them new neurological disorders
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  where people are basically having mad cow disease.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  They just accelerated Parkinson's
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  brain fog and then brain death.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  He says it's a quote
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  unacceptable mistake
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  and that's just main line news saying that.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  He and Wolfgang Wudorg and all of them
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  are actually saying that's what the former
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  head scientist advisor just retired
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  a few years ago on good terms
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  very respected Dr. Yedon
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  head scientist advisor
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  over vaccines
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  keep scientists period
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  but over the vaccine program said
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  millions are going to die
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  from this oh and this Nobel Prize winner
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  says it's going to pass the
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  prions on generationally
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  that's right they're teaching our body
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  to grow prions
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  they're turning us into factories of death
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  that kill us and that will also
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  be implanted into our children
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  next level
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  evil
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  this is truly unspeakable
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  that's coming up
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  and so much more
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  today
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  we also have a lot of human animal
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  spliced clone news
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  that we're going to be laying out. Please remember
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  every AM and FM station you're listening to is precious
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  tell folks about them every TV station is precious
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  and cable station tell folks about it
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  your word of mouth is key to fighting this
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  and victory and we've got a chance people are waking up
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  but not fast enough and share the links
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  from band.video
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  and infowars.com
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  and newswars.com and if those are blocked
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  where they are a lot of places share the new backup site
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  link that takes you right to band.video
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  all the great links and URLs
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  and that is freeworldnews.tv
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  share that to your whole email list

[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Nuremberg 2.0
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  here is Nuremberg 2.0
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  it's your mission to get this out
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  if it is the mission you accept
[10:47.000 --> 11:11.000]  you don't want to lay down and die here it is.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Dr. Fulmick
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  was given by the WHO
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  and the CDC
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  was knowingly set to a level
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  that guaranteed 100%
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  false positives
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  or false negatives so there is no pandemic
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  this is all about getting people to take the shot
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  their argument is that we are at the very least
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  being subjected to an illegal experiment
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  and at the worst
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  global genocide
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  Dr. Fulmick points out
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  how the experimental jab is in clear violation
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  of all 10
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  of the Nuremberg codes
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  which carry the penalty of death
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  for those who violate them
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  number one
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  voluntary consent is absolutely essential
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  there should be no intervention
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  or any element of force
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  fraud, deceit, duress
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  or any form of constraint
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  or coercion
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  by definition a vaccine
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  must provide immunity to the virus
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  protect recipients
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  from getting the virus
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  reduce deaths, infections
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  circulation
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  and transmission of the virus
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  we are told the experimental jab
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  does none of these
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  yet they fraudulently call it
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  a vaccine
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  as far as duress, constraint
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  and coercion it's everywhere
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  if you want your life back
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  get the shot
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  number two
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  the experiment should be such as to yield
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  results un procurable by other methods
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  the most fruitful method
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  would be a healthy immune system
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  which can be achieved
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  through good health and natural
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  supplements such as vitamin D
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  vitamin C and zinc
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  but the people are not being told this
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  in fact those who pointed out
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  are being vilified and silenced
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  number three
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  the experiment should be designed
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  and based on the results of animal
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  experimentation
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  the experimental jab skipped animal testing
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  number four
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  the experiment should be so conducted
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  as to avoid all unnecessary
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  physical and mental
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  suffering and injury
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  according to official reports
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  there are already thousands of deaths
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  and over a quarter million
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  injuries from this experiment
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  number five
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  no experiment should be conducted
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  where there is an a priori reason to believe
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  that death or disabling
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  injury will occur
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  past trials have shown a strong possibility
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  that these new spike proteins
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  will cause a body to attack itself
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  this is known as
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  antibody dependent enhancement
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  or ADE
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  and recent doctors have blown the
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  whistle that this could end up killing
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  everybody who's been vaccinated
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  in the next two years
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  number six
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  the risk should never exceed the benefit
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  COVID-19 has
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  a 98-99% survival rate
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  less deadly than the seasonal flu
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  the experimental jab
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  is already the most dangerous
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  vaccine in VAERS
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  30 year history
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  number seven
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  proper preparations should be made
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  and adequate facilities provided
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  to protect the experimental subject
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  against even remote possibilities
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  of injury, disability
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  or death
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  there were no preparations made
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  for these facilities
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  the subject shows up for their shot
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  and goes home
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  number eight
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  the experiment should be conducted only
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  by scientifically qualified persons
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  this experiment has been exclusively run
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  by politicians
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  the media
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  celebrities
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  and big pharma bureaucrats
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  number nine
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  the subject should be at liberty to bring
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  the experiment to an end
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  experts have attempted to end this madness
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  and their voices continue
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  to be silenced
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  number ten
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  the experiment must be brought to an end
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  if resulting in injury or death
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  and yet the experiment pushes on
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  once again
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  those who violate these international
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  laws are subject
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  to the death penalty
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  legal proceedings are moving forward
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  and evidence is being collected
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  whistleblowers are directed to contact
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  the international team
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  at www.securewhistleblower.com
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  this is likely the biggest crime
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  ever committed against the world population
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  and the question is
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  do we still have a judicial system
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  to exact justice
[15:45.000 --> 16:01.000]  for infowars.com this is greg rees
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  your voice counts

[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  be it over the internet or in person
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  it changes the world
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  the globalists know their agenda is unpopular
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  they know you're angry
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  if you want to get around big tech
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  it's more important than ever that we use

[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  granny do write
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  granny do write thanks for holding her on the air
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  go ahead
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  I love your products I am a granny
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  and for all the
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  senior citizens out there that may have
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  or age spots as they're lovingly called
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  my skin
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  is just really gorgeous actually
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  people think I'm 55 years old
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  and I was already
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  taking your other supplements but I thought
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  but when I started taking it
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  but you know over a period of time
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  I started noticing okay
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  you know this is a ticket this is working
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  this is wonderful you know
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  I don't have to put on
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  derma blend anymore you know
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  so anyway it worked wonderfully
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  and it really has totally cleared up
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  my skin
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  the equation is very simple
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  the mega banks control the media
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  they control big pharma
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  they control academia
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  they control the military
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  industrial complex
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  they control big tech
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  and everywhere that they have been in control
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  in the third world they have established
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  absolute total despotism
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  and dehumanization
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  it is the western christian
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  idea of human freedom
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  that ended slavery and that
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  promoted women's rights and so much more
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  that actually threatens them
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  so because they can't defeat that
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  empowering ethic
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  they instead co-opted turn it upside down
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  and use
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  the idea of equality to actually destroy
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  human freedom
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  and the free market that threatens them
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  and obviously some control
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  that's why they target info wars
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  because we understand the keys to the feeding
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  of the only way our transmission gets
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  out is if you promote info wars
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  and ban that video
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  we have every double your efforts we are all on this together
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  that's right folks
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  they released the virus on purpose
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  it was an inside job
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  and they hyped up the fear
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  even above how deadly it was
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  to bring in total control
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  and now it's being announced
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  you won't be able to go to a concert unless
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  you've had these deadly injections
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  you won't be able to get on a plane unless
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  you've had these deadly injections
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  Bloomberg, AP Reuters
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  they are all announcing at the food
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  they are all announcing at the food
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  fighters are announcing it
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  shameful
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  I'd expect it from Bruce Springsteen
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  the globalist
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  Hemeroid of Barack Obama
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  but this is their big push
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  and it's all here
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  and the very people that cooked up the virus
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  and released the virus
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  are the ones that are taking over the world
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  saying they are doing it to cut human
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  carbon footprints
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  that's what this
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  is all about
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  is about dehumanizing
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  teaching us that we're not essential
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  this is the big globalist move
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  and you notice
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  who came out last night
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  talked about the great reset
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  who came out last night and talked about event
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  201
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  who came out last night and talked about the Rockefeller Foundation
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Operation Lockstep
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  she's covering it all now
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  that's Laura Ingram
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  we covered Lockstep 11 years ago
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  and wrote about it for m4wars.com
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  it's not about getting credit but we saw it
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  our listeners pointed it out
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  and we covered it and said this is a globalist plan
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  for a takeover
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  because the Rockefellers and the Carnegie Endowment run the whole show
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  the former head of the Carnegie Endowment
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  is now the CIA director
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  everything you see
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  drag queen story time
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  open borders, human smuggling
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  world government
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  forceful microchip pushing
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  it's all them
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  without war without men
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  without women without families
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  a post human world
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  and if you'll accept grotesque
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  obese ugly men
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  coming and having their way with your children
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  coming and having them bounce on their knees
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  and tell them about the LGBT
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  movement
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  on Nickelodeon for five year olds
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  you will accept
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  anything
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  you'll accept men in the showers
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  with your eight year old girls at school because
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  the coach identifies as a woman
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  you'll accept anything
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  you'll accept a man with genitals
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  male genitals saying
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  give me a pap smear and the woman nurse says you
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  have a penis and then she's fired
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  or suspended that happens in the UK
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  and the US they go in on purpose
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  get up in the stirrups
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  and say give me my gynecological
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  exam
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  you're a man
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  you haven't even surgically had your
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  Johnson removed but you're gonna
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  really assault a nurse
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  and then if she doesn't go along with the cult
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  programming of your gaslighting
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  when you're a freak out of a
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Rob Zombie movie
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  you know men dressed up in crazy wigs
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  that's stuff out of chainsaw massacre
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  that's the stuff out of horror
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  that's the stuff out of HP Lovecraft
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  out of it the clown
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  big giant you know
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  ex-con men
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  attacking women in shops and throwing things around
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  because somebody called him hey man
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  don't you call me man
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  oh man you're gonna bow to me I'm gonna bully you
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  I'm the new protected class
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  of men
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  coming in your little girl's shower
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  but now there's Laura Ingram covering it all
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  that's the good news about in Four Wars
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  that's the good news about what we do
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  what we talk about is covered now in the UN
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  debates it's covered in the EU parliament
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  it's covered in Japan
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  it's covered in Brazil it's covered in Mexico
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  it's covered in Africa everywhere
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  we are the trailblazers you are the trailblazers
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  spreading the word
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  and getting our links and articles
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  out to everyone you know
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  infowars.com
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  newswars.com
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  so here's Laura Ingram
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  part of what she said last night
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  National leaders around the world impose airtight
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  rules and restrictions
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  from the mandatory wearing a face mask
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  to body temp checks
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  wow
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  that does sound familiar
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  10, 11 years ago
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  the report went on to detail
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  how the powers that be would never let
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  that imaginary crisis end
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  even after the pandemic faded
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  this more authoritarian control and oversight
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  of citizens and their activities
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  stuck and even intensified
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  citizens willingly gave up some of their
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  sovereignty and their privacy
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  to more paternalistic states in exchange
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  for greater safety and stability
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  this heightened oversight took many forms
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  by in metric IDs
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  for all citizens, title regulations
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  of industries whose stability was deemed
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  vital to national interests
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  now despite the Rockefeller report
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  predating this show by many years
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  none of what was laid out
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  in that report should surprise any
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Ingram angle viewers
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  and then she went on
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  into the permanent lockdown and how this is nothing
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  but a giant power grab
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  so I'm going to go through
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  the Nobel Prize winner
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  for virology
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  saying that what is in these vaccines
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  will give you mad cow disease basically
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  and we'll pass it on to your children
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  wow and so much more that's next segment
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  and then this incredible Mark of the Beast
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  video where CVS workers are now
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  affixing barcodes to their hands
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  that's all
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  coming up but first
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  people have really asked for collectibles
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  from info wars so they could
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  support the broadcast and have a memento
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  to know that they're
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  basically part of the team
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  and so we did this we printed
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  100 of these very simple white
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  postcard with a special message from
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  myself and some original info wars art
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  that I came up with of a wolf
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  chasing a sheep
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  and then you flip the card over
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  and you can see that it's
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  now a sheepdog
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  chasing a wolf
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  and that's what we should be
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  that's what we should be doing
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  and so it's very very nice this is the second
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  run we printed 100 of these last time
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  just white on black this is silver
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  on black came out pretty good
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  and there's 250
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  of these and when you get it
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  everyone is numbered and signed by
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  me it is collectible
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  and it is again a
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  sign of basically the fact
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  that you are at the front lines
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  of this fight there are $100
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  a piece
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  and you get the film in game
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  blueprint for global enslavement
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  with it also
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  signed
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  and so that is
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  now available at infowarstore.com
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  last time
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  I offered 100 of these they sold out
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  in about an hour and I really appreciate
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  folks that did that because that's what makes it all possible
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  so I thank you for that support
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  this is suitable for framing as well
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  we are also
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  launching in game available for
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  $9.95 now
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  but you get the info wars defeat the globalist
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  10 sticker pack
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  with stickers like this big
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  bumper stickers mask are for slaves
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  and criminals
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  legalized freedom
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  arrest Bill Gates
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  freedom lives
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Alex Jones was right
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  vaccines killed
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  arrest Fauci
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Covid-19 is a hoax
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  life is fiery with its beauty
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  and under all of them it says infowarstore.com
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  and you get the film for $9.95

[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  infowarstore.com
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  so that's two different deals that help get the word out
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  and if you support us we'll stay on air
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  if you don't we won't be here and I'm not complaining
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  but you can see that there's no where
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  that's more effective more valuable
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  more over the target than info wars
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  and you are the listeners that care about us
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  we care about you
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  we care about all conservatives and nationals
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  and patriots that we literally launched their careers
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  are too cool for school
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  and know that they're associated with this
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  they might get censored so they don't give us any support
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  that's okay
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  you give us support
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  and we appreciate you for standing with us
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  and those great amineff affiliates
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  that are out there as well this is the limited
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  250 of these that I'm going to sign
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  here I guess today or tomorrow I'm going to sign them all
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  and the DVDs all signed
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  and then delivered to your door
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  and I want to thank you all for your support
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  alright we're going to come back and just hit the terrific news
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  stay with us
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  what are champions made of
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  here's a man who can show you
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  ah
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  triple eight two five three one three nine
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  triple eight two five three one three nine
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  triple eight two five three one three nine
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  one three four three nine
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  four eight two five three three one three nine
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  one three four four four three one three nine
[28:39.000 --> 28:21.000]  one three four five three three one three nine
[28:43.000 --> 28:43.160]  infrastructure
[28:43.160 --> 29:04.240]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[29:04.240 --> 29:09.000]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.520]  image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have. Being given free will. Being
[29:14.520 --> 29:20.400]  given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[29:20.400 --> 29:25.280]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[29:25.280 --> 29:29.800]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.120]  of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.320]  of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and
[29:39.320 --> 29:45.280]  that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship
[29:45.280 --> 29:50.240]  the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God because
[29:50.240 --> 29:55.320]  we're made by God. And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.560]  have it, while you still have it.
[29:58.560 --> 30:02.480]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and
[30:02.480 --> 30:09.600]  about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well,
[30:09.600 --> 30:13.880]  the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts. The history of contaminated
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.320]  vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe, the fact
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.920]  that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines,
[30:22.920 --> 30:28.520]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites,
[30:28.520 --> 30:33.200]  Native Americans, the list goes on and on, but what about the fact that Fauci testified
[30:33.200 --> 30:40.480]  to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half of the
[30:40.480 --> 30:45.520]  NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, virologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine
[30:45.520 --> 30:49.840]  and don't think it's safe? Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it,
[30:49.840 --> 30:53.160]  and it's the same thing in the private practices out there, similar numbers, that that's not
[30:53.160 --> 31:01.000]  something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer.
[31:01.000 --> 31:10.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Man, come on, man. I ain't finna go Alex
[31:10.840 --> 31:16.960]  Jones level with y'all. Man, come on, man. What y'all want? Like, wake up. I want people
[31:16.960 --> 31:21.400]  to wake up right now. I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance. We
[31:21.400 --> 31:26.760]  have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale. White male! So Alex Jones'
[31:26.760 --> 31:30.920]  whole brand is based on the idea. He's giving you the real story, not the fake news out
[31:30.920 --> 31:35.040]  there. Hey, listen, I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't
[31:35.040 --> 31:42.480]  a game. Humanity is awakening. InfoWars.com. This is Alex Jones. The tyrants did it. Hint
[31:42.480 --> 31:46.680]  words from the guns, stallings from the guns, mouths from the guns, and I'm here to tell
[31:46.680 --> 31:53.800]  you, 1776 will commence again if you're proud to take our fire on. Alex Jones. InfoWars.com.
[31:53.800 --> 31:58.040]  I just don't know who you are. You guys know who he is? So Alex Jones is InfoWars. Very
[31:58.040 --> 32:03.640]  popular. InfoWars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You need to listen to Alex
[32:03.640 --> 32:11.480]  Jones. We know we're under attack. We know it. We're breaking the conditioning. Ah! Ah!
[32:11.480 --> 32:21.720]  Talking about Alex Jones. InfoWars. Alex Jones. InfoWars. Alex Jones. That's just
[32:21.720 --> 32:27.520]  level one. What's level two? I'll tell you. The animated contest of liberty is waiting
[32:27.520 --> 32:34.280]  for you. If you've got to take it in your hands, you've got to have the will to accept
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.600]  the truth and buck the system and the group collective. Do that and you'll learn your
[32:38.600 --> 32:43.600]  way to the next round. This is the InfoWars.
[32:43.600 --> 33:01.600]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, they're going to see some serious s***.
[33:01.600 --> 33:16.600]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today. Joe, why is it got to be a humanoid? Why? Because if
[33:16.600 --> 33:23.600]  you make it a few percentage points, another animal or another creature, it's a gray area.
[33:23.600 --> 33:26.600]  There's no human rights. You have an animal rights movement. You have a human rights
[33:26.600 --> 33:32.600]  movement. There's no alien movement. Aliens are real. They're creating human animal
[33:32.600 --> 33:37.600]  hybrids that are a new creature never here on earth. It's alien. So the aliens are
[33:37.600 --> 33:43.600]  already here. AI is alien. The chimeras are alien. Aliens are already here. So you're
[33:43.600 --> 33:48.600]  saying they're making these human animal hybrids so they can what, harvest tissue from them?
[33:48.600 --> 33:53.600]  That's just level one. What's level two? What's level eight? Because a lot, I'll tell
[33:53.600 --> 33:58.600]  you, a lot of, for the best of my knowledge, a lot of people think, oh, it's human
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.600]  harvesting of fallen gongs or these buddhas really healthy. That's big. That's going
[34:03.600 --> 34:13.600]  on because they... That's two and a half years ago, but I'm saying the exact same
[34:13.600 --> 34:19.600]  thing, 25 years ago because it was in the medical literature. They just don't popularize
[34:19.600 --> 34:25.600]  it. In the medical community, at the highest managerial levels is in on it. Most of them
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.600]  are eugenicists. They are socially engineering the population.
[34:30.600 --> 34:38.600]  All right. It happened again today. I was reading news at my house for several hours
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.600]  before I got here. I was looking at all the clips. And then by the time I got on air,
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.600]  I was totally pissed off and just wanted to turn the desk over. And I want to be clear
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.600]  why I'm externalizing that. That's how we should all be feeling. And I don't want to be violent
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.600]  and I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want you to hurt anybody. I'm just saying,
[34:56.600 --> 35:07.600]  it's normal when hundreds of top prominent Nobel Prize winners, head of the EU advisory
[35:07.600 --> 35:16.600]  medical board, former chief scientist advisor, university heads, Rockefeller hospital head,
[35:16.600 --> 35:24.600]  Cedar Sinai, just everybody. I'm actually proud of the scientists and doctors that have
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.600]  said the head of the vaccine program came out before the whole COVID thing in December
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.600]  of 2019 and said vaccines don't work. They're killing people. The front lines wobbly. We
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.600]  don't test these. We're just told what to do by Big Pharma. We basically just guinea
[35:40.600 --> 35:44.600]  pig the public. She was covering her butt though because they know there's all this
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.600]  happening in these scandals. And so they did the big COVID thing to bully everybody trying
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.600]  to get the public to accept it so they wouldn't listen to whistleblowers that were already
[35:53.600 --> 36:00.600]  going public 18, 19 months ago. See how that works? They created a bigger scandal, a bigger
[36:00.600 --> 36:06.600]  crisis, to divert from the previous crisis. They changed the people's attention from one
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.600]  story to a bigger story. And then the scary part of that formula is how do they divert
[36:11.600 --> 36:17.600]  from this giant catastrophe that dwarfs even the autism hundreds of millions of boys brain
[36:17.600 --> 36:23.600]  damaged from the poison vaccines? Well, if billions are taking these shots and every
[36:23.600 --> 36:27.600]  expert looks at it and says this is going to cause neurological disorders, heart attacks,
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.600]  blood clots, before it happened Wolfgang Wudang filed an emergency report in December of
[36:32.600 --> 36:39.600]  last year with Dr. Edon to the EU. I read the report on there issued an emergency on it.
[36:39.600 --> 36:46.600]  And they said we expect blood clots, we expect strokes, we expect uteruses to disintegrate,
[36:46.600 --> 36:51.600]  we expect tumors to pop up everywhere, we expect proteins to start growing in the brain
[36:51.600 --> 36:59.600]  and causing Alzheimer's in young people. And baby, it all started day one. And the British
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.600]  military was the advisory group. They said we recommend these vaccines stop. They go
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.600]  around the national civilian board recommend nobody above 75, nobody under 16 and nobody
[37:10.600 --> 37:14.600]  pregnant. And that was put out as we don't recommend you take this, but that was just
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.600]  a notice. Then, oh, take it, it's safe. Everybody should take it. Kids should take it. So they
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.600]  warned you you shouldn't take it, but then gave you the authorization to take it and
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.600]  then had media bully you and line say it was safe, you should take it. So see, it's like
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.600]  if you're buying a car and there's like a 20 page contract, he goes, yeah, just sign
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.600]  here. It's all there. There's some fine print. You might want to read it, but if there's
[37:36.600 --> 37:43.600]  nothing there for you to see, you're reading the fine print. It's a big ripoff. I mean,
[37:43.600 --> 37:49.600]  it's all right there. This is incredible. And I can sit back all day and ask, okay,
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.600]  what are they about to do before all this goes down? And as this unfolds, well, that
[37:55.600 --> 38:02.600]  means a big war, cyber attacks, shutdowns of society, another bio attack. Why are they
[38:02.600 --> 38:08.600]  mainly targeting Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK, Canada and the US with the really
[38:08.600 --> 38:20.600]  deadly vaccines? It's a big deal. It's a very, very, very big deal. And now they've got
[38:20.600 --> 38:24.600]  Fauci and this is the really important point. And I know you guys gave it to me, but it
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.600]  got lost in my stacks. We reprinted for me. I can see it in an article I sent you this
[38:28.600 --> 38:33.600]  shot where it's like, oh, there's two tracks of COVID. The West took your shots. It's
[38:33.600 --> 38:37.600]  basically over here. There's no more deaths because they just set the PCR test at 28
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.600]  cycles. So it's all false negative. Set the false positive at 40. Basically, everybody's
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.600]  false positive. But the third world is still terrible. They've got to stay locked down.
[38:46.600 --> 38:51.600]  The lockdown's what starves them. And they've all got to take special shots. So special
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.600]  shots that have been made. I told you this would happen have been prepared by the EU
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.600]  and by the US through the UN, special lots that actually say on them, this has been in
[39:01.600 --> 39:08.600]  the news, not for use in the West, not authorized, because this is very special for the black
[39:08.600 --> 39:15.600]  people and very special for the Latin Americans and very special for other areas they're
[39:15.600 --> 39:22.600]  bombarding with this. When I say very special, I mean very special. And they've caught
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.600]  them, of course, before doing this. So this is deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly dangerous.
[39:28.600 --> 39:34.600]  And it's depopulation that's taking place. So we're going to be covering all of that
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.600]  here today. Joe Brown is coming in again. Knocked it out of the park on The War Room
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.600]  on American Journal at 8am today. He was on. And just I invited him back today. He said,
[39:45.600 --> 39:50.600]  sure, he'll do it. The guy is just amazing. He doesn't just talk to talk to. He says a
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.600]  lot. It's a really smart guy. And I'm really impressed because I have a lot of knowledge
[39:55.600 --> 40:02.600]  and I was sitting there talking to him last night for like three hours almost. And he
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.600]  was correcting me and stuff. I know a lot. He's like, no, that's not that German general.
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.600]  It was the Prussian general von Kliwitz. And I was like, you're right. I got the name wrong.
[40:10.600 --> 40:15.600]  I mean, he just, it's 73. I hope I'm like that when I'm 73 because he's got some real
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.600]  gravitas. And I think it kind of gets cartoonized by, you know, the TV judge, but he's a real
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.600]  judge and very, very impressive. So that's some of the things we're going to be covering.
[40:26.600 --> 40:29.600]  We're going to go to break. I'm going to really put a thinking cap on. We're going to come back
[40:29.600 --> 40:32.600]  and just blitz through all the news. The video, the Nobel laureate saying, don't take the
[40:32.600 --> 40:38.600]  vaccine. You'll be Alzheimer's. You'll go prions in your brain. Peter Dazik, the right-hand
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.600]  man of Fauci coming out admitting that they were working with the Chinese communist colleagues
[40:44.600 --> 40:50.600]  with killer coronaviruses, something they previously lied about. And then now the two-tiered system
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.600]  where if you're not vaccinated, you can't go to the grocery store or to a football game
[40:54.600 --> 41:00.600]  or a rock concert. I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.600]  things are with the globalist attack of humanity and all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[41:04.600 --> 41:10.600]  I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure.
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.600]  So I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's
[41:14.600 --> 41:20.600]  police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or
[41:20.600 --> 41:26.600]  industry, people are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to go along
[41:26.600 --> 41:30.600]  with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where
[41:30.600 --> 41:36.600]  M4 comes in. You fund us. You support M4SWARE.com. You get great products at the same time.
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.600]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target you for
[41:42.600 --> 41:48.600]  to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please
[41:48.600 --> 41:54.600]  keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[41:54.600 --> 41:56.600]  Fund us at M4SWARE.com.
[41:56.600 --> 42:02.600]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. I've been on there 27 years
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.600]  and the last year or so, I've said that. But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.600]  our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can
[42:10.600 --> 42:16.600]  to shut us down. So please pray to keep M4SWARE on the air and please support the local station
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.600]  you're listening to as well. At the same time, go to M4SWARE.com while you still can and get a book,
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.600]  get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.600]  in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist,
[42:33.600 --> 42:39.600]  but I can't do it if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.600]  however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.600]  at M4SWARE.com. Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures
[42:51.600 --> 42:58.600]  the soul. All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[42:58.600 --> 43:05.600]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[43:05.600 --> 43:14.600]  that this is all a test. This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.600]  giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.600]  eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really does come down to that. So as sad as
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.600]  things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God
[43:29.600 --> 43:36.600]  is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author
[43:36.600 --> 43:43.600]  of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at mainstream media
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.600]  in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington, D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult,
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.600]  it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.600]  and you're bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the
[43:58.600 --> 44:04.600]  universe. Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.600]  material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of
[44:08.600 --> 44:13.600]  microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.600]  public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product they
[44:18.600 --> 44:23.600]  are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy

[44:59.600 --> 45:04.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:30.600 --> 45:38.600]  All right. We got Judge Joe Brown coming up and we got Larry Pinkney in the third hour and so much
[45:38.600 --> 45:46.600]  more today. I am also going to be introducing and covering some news, co-hosting some with
[45:46.600 --> 46:01.600]  Gerald Salente, the great trans forecaster in the fourth hour. But I just want to pull back here
[46:01.600 --> 46:08.600]  for a moment because I have to remind myself to not just don't be angry but to also be calm
[46:08.600 --> 46:15.600]  because sometimes it's best to cover things of this magnitude from a calm focused cerebral
[46:15.600 --> 46:23.600]  place and then to make the cerebral decision that you're then going to take action against
[46:23.600 --> 46:31.600]  the corruption with real purpose and then you can use your passion and your anger as the
[46:31.600 --> 46:38.600]  propulsion system and your love of your fellow humans and your family. But once it's been
[46:38.600 --> 46:46.600]  scientifically directed, once you've made the cold calculation to then set your will against
[46:46.600 --> 46:51.600]  something, that's how you really change history. That's how you win. Not just kind of halfway
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.600]  know what's going on and be angry and then get emotional and then be like Frankenstein
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.600]  going to the countryside scaring people. Believe me because that's kind of what I'm like. I'm
[47:00.600 --> 47:06.600]  only preaching at you because I'm the worst about this. But at least I'm pissed, at least
[47:06.600 --> 47:10.600]  I'm pissed. But the times I've really been successful is when I have that moment where
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.600]  I've done all this research and I just sit there at my coffee table or lay there in bed
[47:15.600 --> 47:24.600]  middle of the night or whatever it is you're going to do and just make that decision and
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.600]  know it's the right thing to do and to know you're going to take action and to know you're
[47:28.600 --> 47:35.600]  on that path to victory. It's about making commitments and following through on those
[47:35.600 --> 47:38.600]  steps. That's what makes the world go around. And you know the globalists said they want
[47:38.600 --> 47:43.600]  to set up world government depopulate us through tainted vaccines, through genetic engineering
[47:43.600 --> 47:48.600]  and they're doing it. And so you've just got to ask yourself do you want to deny what's
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.600]  now even on Fox News about the world government takeover and the Rockefeller Foundation and
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.600]  Operation Lockstep and the plan to do all this. I mean they're admitting they're doing it
[47:59.600 --> 48:04.600]  to you. It's in the fine print and hell now it's not the fine print, it's on the front
[48:04.600 --> 48:14.600]  page. Quite literally. The Senate legalized animal human clones 15 days ago. Wouldn't pass
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.600]  the law against it and said that's just you can do whatever you want now because they've
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.600]  been doing whatever they want. It's the Wild Wild West just like big tech censors everybody
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.600]  and surveils everybody does whatever the hell they want and helps farm regimes crack down
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.600]  their own people and lectures us all day about how white people are bad, America's bad. That's
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.600]  just a rear guard action they're using. So we don't get focused on what Tim Cook and
[48:36.600 --> 48:44.600]  Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai and their controllers are doing. So let's get to it right now. Nobel
[48:44.600 --> 48:54.600]  Laureate Luke Montagner warns COVID vaccine may lead to neurological illness. Of course he
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.600]  agrees with all the other top scientists. You don't really think about that. The actual
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.600]  scientists that knew this and tested it said you're going with something known for two
[49:04.600 --> 49:11.600]  decades. If you try to create a vaccine for basically any cold virus, the only way you
[49:11.600 --> 49:18.600]  can do it is to attack the shell and not the RNA, but the spike protein itself. And if
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.600]  you do that, again, you make the body shut down or get hypersensitive and it'll the main
[49:24.600 --> 49:32.600]  area they predicted would be cardiovascular. So this is the Nobel Prize winning top
[49:32.600 --> 49:39.600]  virologist in the world. Hands down for about six months saying don't take the vaccine
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.600]  and for over a year saying it was made no lab. But when I would try to cover that and people
[49:46.600 --> 49:50.600]  would post up from my show saying that when I would have doctors on Twitter and Facebook
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.600]  would ban it saying it's not accepted by the UN. Think about that. All these top scientists
[49:56.600 --> 50:02.600]  are silent. Think about the criminal culpability for the war crimes and the crimes against
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.600]  humanity that have been carried out. Here's another one by him. Nobel Prize winner French
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.600]  virologist Luke Montagner explains how COVID-19 vaccines are creating variants and actually
[50:14.600 --> 50:23.600]  killing the people that take the shots. Nobel Prize winner mass COVID vaccination, an unacceptable
[50:23.600 --> 50:32.600]  mistake. It's not a mistake, though, bro. It goes on. So here he is in one of the latest
[50:32.600 --> 50:41.600]  interviews. I'll read the subtitles best I can. Explaining this is going to grow the
[50:41.600 --> 50:45.600]  proteins in your tissues. So when it grows in your heart, you have a heart attack. Grows
[50:45.600 --> 50:49.600]  in your lungs, your lungs bleed out. Grows in your brain, you have a bleed out. And that's
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.600]  if it really starts growing. If not, you just fog out and your neurons don't work anymore
[50:53.600 --> 50:59.600]  and that Alzheimer's main cause is different types of prions growing. Mad cows just where
[50:59.600 --> 51:04.600]  you died a week because they grow so fast that particular crystal that was in those
[51:04.600 --> 51:07.600]  sheep and cows because they were feeding them meat. They're not supposed to. It was going
[51:07.600 --> 51:10.600]  through their blood-brain barrier and they're getting into their tissues and growing and
[51:10.600 --> 51:14.600]  when you would eat the meat, it would get through your gut. Especially if you were old, that
[51:14.600 --> 51:17.600]  licky gut and get into your brain and grow. It's just crystals, like crystals growing
[51:17.600 --> 51:22.600]  a cave or crystals growing underground or crystals can grow in your kidneys. It's crystals
[51:22.600 --> 51:27.600]  growing in your ass. So here he is joining all the other scientists saying this is going
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.600]  to happen. You don't think Bill Gates and the UN and Fauci didn't know this. Fauci did
[51:31.600 --> 51:37.600]  studies at UT on rats with these same vaccines under other names eight years ago and it killed
[51:37.600 --> 51:47.600]  almost all of them. Growing crystals in them. Growing protein crystals. Here it is. You
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.600]  can see side effects that affect the future generations as well. In our generation in
[51:52.600 --> 52:00.600]  five or ten years, that's absolutely possible. Notably something we call neurodegenerative
[52:00.600 --> 52:06.600]  illnesses. These are sequences that resemble the prion sequence in the RNA of the coronavirus.
[52:06.600 --> 52:24.600]  These prions could disorder the natural proteins in the brain. Modifying them to make prions.
[52:24.600 --> 52:29.600]  So you're going to get to go to the food fighters and go to Bruce Springsteen and down the road
[52:29.600 --> 52:33.600]  get in the grocery store. But you're going to literally, I mean everybody I know that's
[52:33.600 --> 52:37.600]  taking it. People that are friends of mine that wouldn't listen. Lawyers I know you name
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.600]  it. Look like they're fifteen, twenty years older and there's just you can see it like
[52:41.600 --> 52:47.600]  somebody hit them with a baseball bat. And you talk to people that are at nursing homes.
[52:47.600 --> 52:50.600]  They work there. They work in this building's family too. They say oh yeah everybody's up
[52:50.600 --> 52:53.600]  in Adam. You know them. You're friends with these folks. They play dominoes. They play
[52:53.600 --> 52:57.600]  cards. They watch TV. You're friends with them. They said like everybody gets the shot.
[52:57.600 --> 53:02.600]  No one gets out of bed for a week. Three or four patients die and then it just gets worse
[53:02.600 --> 53:09.600]  from there. They're killing everybody and Bill Gates said he wanted to kill the old people.
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.600]  So they really did it folks. And they even war game out in Operation Lockstep and then
[53:13.600 --> 53:18.600]  of course in Event 201 and Crimson Contagion is the big one. How within a year of people
[53:18.600 --> 53:24.600]  being vaccinated neurological disorders explode collapsing civilization. You're like oh yeah
[53:24.600 --> 53:29.600]  this is meant to collapse things. When we're taking care of a third of the US population
[53:29.600 --> 53:33.600]  there are more that will probably be neurologically gone in a year or two. Five years you heard
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.600]  it because if it kills rats in six months he's thinking ah five ten years for humans.
[53:37.600 --> 53:43.600]  That's you know it's all dead wrecking. But in five ten years oh my god and by then these
[53:43.600 --> 53:50.600]  idiots getting pigs would have taken 20 shots apiece. So this is their move and they're
[53:50.600 --> 53:56.600]  getting people to sign on for their own destruction. We have a responsibility to warn people.
[53:56.600 --> 54:01.600]  Now I want to thank you all for your support. I've been plugging a lot because we were in
[54:01.600 --> 54:05.600]  the red for the first five months. Started to get back in the black and as soon as the
[54:05.600 --> 54:09.600]  sales end you know nobody's supporting us and I'm not complaining. You need to keep us
[54:09.600 --> 54:13.600]  on air obviously. So we've innovated. We've gotten some new great sponsors that are amazing
[54:13.600 --> 54:20.600]  that I'm so proud of. One of them is Biopros. TheBiopros.com and you get one pack and you
[54:20.600 --> 54:24.600]  can get the next pack for a discount. It's a different type of way for your septic tank.
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.600]  It uses naturally developed but specially bred non-GMO bacteria. They're totally safe
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.600]  that go in there and it's up to 100 times better than traditional septic tank systems
[54:34.600 --> 54:43.600]  that use enzymes. So it is the Biopros.com. One word. TheBiopros.com.
[54:43.600 --> 54:48.600]  TheBiopros.com. TheBiopros.com. We're very very proud of the sponsor.
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.600]  Especially brainless the general market. It was only available for oil companies and industrial level pig farms
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.600]  and things like that but we've got them to come out with a civilian version of this.
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.600]  At TheBiopros.com. Separately we have three new products in that everybody needs. It's
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.600]  something you need, your children need, your family needs for your body, your cells, your
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.600]  immune system. You know when they say vitamin D or vitamin C or these things are essential
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.600]  it means you've got to have them. We've got three new great multivitamin products that
[55:20.600 --> 55:25.600]  will blow you away at InfoWarsStore.com. We have the Whole Food Multivitamin 25% off.
[55:25.600 --> 55:30.600]  We have the InfoWarsLive Vitamin C and Zinc 25% off. We have the InfoWarsLive Vitamin D3
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.600]  and Calcium 25% off. All super high quality organic source that actually works in your body.
[55:35.600 --> 55:41.600]  Together all three are 40% off. InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you all for your support.
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.600]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[55:46.600 --> 55:50.600]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.600]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public is so dumb
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.600]  down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.600]  them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed. Yes that's the position
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.600]  of the globalist they play God and they think because we don't stand up they have a right
[56:08.600 --> 56:13.600]  to do this to us. And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me. They
[56:13.600 --> 56:18.600]  tried to join them. But metaphysically at a spiritual level I have the Holy Spirit.
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.600]  I'm connection with God and I know that God does not like that so I cannot join the enemy.
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.600]  But I'll tell you at a selfish level I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[56:28.600 --> 56:32.600]  the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.600]  Whether you're just a steel worker or a school teacher or a Henry Kissinger you're not God.
[56:37.600 --> 56:43.600]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.600]  of the universe doesn't like. And that's a fact.
[56:48.600 --> 56:57.600]  As men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[56:57.600 --> 57:04.600]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality.
[57:04.600 --> 57:11.600]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior
[57:11.600 --> 57:18.600]  vitality in males. Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses
[57:18.600 --> 57:25.600]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes.
[57:25.600 --> 57:30.600]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[57:30.600 --> 57:37.600]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.600]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store.
[57:40.600 --> 57:47.600]  Never been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[57:47.600 --> 57:57.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[58:17.600 --> 58:37.600]  There is no mechanism for Trump to get reinstated. That is delusional.
[58:37.600 --> 58:44.600]  If Trump really believes he will be back in the White House this August, he should get help.
[58:44.600 --> 58:49.600]  You are not well, sir. You need to get over this.
[58:49.600 --> 58:53.600]  But perhaps what we are witnessing these days is more of a slow-motion coup.
[58:53.600 --> 59:02.600]  This brings us to a nightmare scenario, a Republican-controlled Congress overturning the 2024 presidential election results
[59:02.600 --> 59:08.600]  to install Trump or a Trump mini-me in the White House. Max, it's going to keep a lot of people up tonight.
[59:08.600 --> 59:13.600]  What will it mean for our democracy if your nightmare scenario becomes a reality?
[59:13.600 --> 59:20.600]  Well, I don't want to be overly alarmist, but I think we should be alarmed because potentially this could be the end of American democracy.
[59:20.600 --> 59:25.600]  I never thought I'd be saying something like that. It would have sounded incredible even a year ago.
[59:25.600 --> 59:32.600]  We will take control of the White House again sooner than you think, meaning obviously as evidence mounts that there was proven election fraud
[59:32.600 --> 59:35.600]  and as evidence mounts that Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent.
[59:35.600 --> 59:41.600]  Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong.
[59:41.600 --> 59:49.600]  And as evidence mounts that Fauci, working with Obama and others, launched COVID-19 to kind of bring down the U.S. and embarrass President Trump
[59:49.600 --> 59:52.600]  and bring on the Great Reset that they're going to be removed.
[59:52.600 --> 59:59.600]  If I'm being fair, am I building you up to be thicker skinned about this than you are?
[59:59.600 --> 1:00:03.600]  Are you actually worried about this new sort of re-upping of attacks on you?
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:11.600]  What is the thread going through what's happening now is very much an anti-science approach. So that's a big, big difference.
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:19.600]  I mean, it is what it is. I'm a public figure. I'm going to take the arrows and the slings, but they're just, they're fabricated.
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:24.600]  And that's just what it is. But we'll just have to do our jobs, Rachel.
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:36.600]  My job was to make a vaccine and use my institute and this talented scientist that we have there and that we fund in the various universities
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:42.600]  to get a vaccine that was highly safe and highly effective and we succeeded. That's what I do.
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:48.600]  All the other stuff is just a terrible, not happy type of a distraction.
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:54.600]  So this is an incredible statement by Trump. And you add that into China.
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:59.600]  It is with this virus and a lot of the president's surrogates, he is the real president.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.600]  That's just a fact, are now coming out and saying it was obviously released on purpose.
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:11.600]  And this was all done by design and mainstream news now saying we bet the deep state launches a cyber attack.
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:13.600]  We bet the deep states behind the cyber attacks.
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:18.600]  Let's start with these cyber attacks, aid attacks every day in the United States right now. They're targeting food.
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:21.600]  They're targeting gas. They're targeting television or water supply.
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:26.600]  Does the government have to do more to force businesses to protect themselves and their customers?
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:33.600]  So I think the first thing we have to recognize is this is the reality and we should assume and businesses should assume
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:37.600]  that these attacks are here to stay and if anything will intensify.
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  I mean, they're really making their move in their transhumanist revolution to play God.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  But first, let's get to the big clip. Here's Trump cryptically.
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.600]  We're going to take back the Senate, take back the House. We're going to take back the White House.
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:54.600]  And sooner than you think, it's going to be really something special.
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:02:01.600]  But the love and the affection and the respect that you've given all of us, it's really important.
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:08.600]  The Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been and it's going to be a lot stronger than it is right now.
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:12.600]  We're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. Thank you all very much.
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:16.600]  That support has been so incredible. Thank you.
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:20.600]  That is a declaration of war against the deep state that has said, they've said it publicly.
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:24.600]  If he continues to run the Republican Party and goes around the country getting other good members of elections,
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:28.600]  the House and Senate and good material positions and legislative positions,
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:38.600]  in corporate positions, pushing people to those positions, that they're going to indict his son, him, Giuliani,
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:42.600]  I guess he didn't have a dog, but the dog if he had one, they'll indict him sandwich,
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:46.600]  that they're going to go after Trump with those indictments if he doesn't back down.
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:52.600]  Well, he's not backing down.
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:55.600]  Strap yourselves in.
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:00.600]  It's not a secret why in leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:06.600]  they encourage people to live in tents and cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:11.600]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset,
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:16.600]  they want to lower expectations. They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:19.600]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:22.600]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse.
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:26.600]  The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes.
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:31.600]  They are separate from us. Their children go to private tutors. They admit this.
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:35.600]  And now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other,
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:40.600]  so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.600]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:47.600]  This is all their admitted plan.
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:51.600]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational.
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:54.600]  Suppose the human future. You better find out about it right now.
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:04:23.600]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  Last hour, my friends, we played a new TV interview in France with the Nobel Prize winner for virology.
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:38.600]  Recognized as the top living virologist in the world.
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:44.600]  Luke Montenier saying this is going to grow.
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  Pryons in your brain give you Alzheimer's.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:53.600]  And you'll probably pass it on to future generations. Well, that's what all the other top scientists are saying as well.
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:57.600]  That's what's so incredible is I cannot believe we're on air.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:02.600]  And I have hundreds of articles, 30, 40 video clips, special guests coming in, everything.
[1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:07.600]  I'm not just repeating this news. I don't have news. How do I say anything else?
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:16.600]  And then Fauci engaged, funded gain of function and created it and lied to Congress and have now been caught.
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:21.600]  And now we've got congressional testimony.
[1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:26.600]  Fauci's director of the Wuhan lab gain of function operation.
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:32.600]  Dr. Dazik admits Chinese colleagues developing killer coronaviruses.
[1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:35.600]  So now first, oh, that's not going on. We're not involved now.
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.600]  Okay, maybe some of it's involved. Okay.
[1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:42.600]  It happened, but we're not involved.
[1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:50.600]  I have him on video in 2019, right as they were releasing it.
[1:05:50.600 --> 1:06:02.600]  Saying we've combined five viruses from the bats with the coronavirus, all of it to create a vaccine so that all five of these new viruses can be protected with one shot.
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:08.600]  There's the motive. There's the takeover. Have the lockdown, bring in the world ID, bring in the medical tyranny, get the control in place.
[1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:14.600]  And that's all in operation lockstep from 11 years ago, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:20.600]  I mean, it's all here. Listen, why is crimson contagion so important?
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:23.600]  General Flynn looked at it.
[1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:30.600]  It's a war game from 2023 2025 really set in 2023.
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.600]  Back to 2020.
[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:38.600]  And it's the same scripts and the same names and the same tweets.
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:43.600]  They were gained two years before COVID.
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:47.600]  And then a year before COVID right there in live time.
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:52.600]  So they had a blueprint of what to tweet and what to say when they actually did it.
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:58.600]  They get a rehearsal.
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:06.600]  Here's the analogy. It'd be like if neighbors out in the woods were cutting some firewood on the edge of their property.
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:15.600]  And they saw a neighbor burying what looked like bodies in the backyard.
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:20.600]  They call the police. The police get a warrant. They go out there. They dig up the bodies.
[1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  But all they've got is the neighbor saying I saw my neighbor Bob Johnson or whatever his name is burying the bodies.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:31.600]  Turns out it's his wife and kids. This is a hypothetical story.
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:33.600]  But you see these stories all the time.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:37.600]  Well, Bob won't admit to doing it.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:43.600]  But the police find his diary in his handwriting why he was thinking about killing him and then why he did it.
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:47.600]  You would have the smoking gun.
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:50.600]  But it's bigger than that. These intelligence agencies are compartmentalized.
[1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:51.600]  They're not all involved in this.
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:55.600]  And the corporations are transferring power from the intelligence agencies to themselves.
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:58.600]  But they know they're still being watched and they know they may be caught.
[1:07:58.600 --> 1:08:06.600]  And so it's not just a manual on how to run the operation like a playbook or a script for a movie or a play.
[1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:11.600]  It's not just a battle plan. It's also a cover story if they get caught.
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.600]  And look, I know I harp on this.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:15.600]  I know the audience has heard me say this.
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:18.600]  You've been listening for 20 years. You hear it every week.
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:20.600]  You've been listening the last few years. You've probably heard me 20 times.
[1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:29.600]  But I'm just now getting foreign intelligence agencies and U.S. intelligence agencies, current people, to listen to me.
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:33.600]  I'm just now getting the FBI to listen to people that aren't on the bad guy's side.
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  I'm just now getting Congress to listen.
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.600]  I'm just now getting Sean Hannity and Laura Ingram and all of them to listen.
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  And this is no secret. I don't say this to brag. You should know why they want us off the year.
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:49.600]  We have been extremely effective at putting together the information, putting out the special reports that I and McBreen
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  and Reese and everybody puts out. The whole crew here.
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:58.600]  Don Salazar, Kit Daniels, if I'm not mentioning people, it's not because they're not awesome.
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:00.600]  I'm taking an hour to mention them all.
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  Harrison Smith, the list goes on and on.
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.600]  And these reports are so powerful that they are the blueprints.
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:18.600]  So more and more, I'm telling you why we're successful so that you realize why your word of mouth is key, is king, is everything.
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  I mean, you understand if you don't spread the word, they win.
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  So I've got all these clips and all this evidence and all this proof, even more coming out right now.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:33.600]  But if you don't care, and look, I know you do.
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:38.600]  But if you don't get that this is not a regular radio show where I'm just trying to entertain you and make you tune in every day
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:41.600]  and make you feel good, you got the wrong show.
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:43.600]  I want to save humanity. This is a mission.
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  I've known about this for a long time.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:53.600]  I didn't realize, in fact, when I was growing up, that some of the people I knew and I was around were right in the middle of it.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.600]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and I don't want to be part of this.
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  And a lot of scientists and a lot of doctors and a lot of nurses and a lot of politicians and a lot of media people don't want to be part of it either.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  And I have been very surprised and pleased by all the big Nobel Prize winners, all the prestigious scientists.
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:21.600]  I mean, all of the chief scientists at these major companies have come out and said, this is insane.
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:23.600]  This is dangerous. Don't do it.
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  So many of them, I can't even keep track of them.
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:33.600]  Major Indian Institute looked at the virus, said it was man-made. They've been proven right.
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:38.600]  Turns out Bill Gates threatened to pull funding from the entire country if they didn't remove the report.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  Well, now you see it's out there.
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:50.600]  So again, if they were invincible, they wouldn't be spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year of your money, taxpayer money, through their foundations they get because they're tax exempt.
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:53.600]  See, they have big companies that are tax exempt.
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:56.600]  All the money comes in tax-free. That's your taxpayer money.
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:07.600]  And then it goes out to carry this out because their one mission, their one directive is to destroy the genetic matrix of humans and complete their takeover.
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  Because once they've shattered the human genetics, once they put a virus into our genes to make us grow generationally, pry on crystals in our bodies to disease us and curse us and kill us,
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  once they've done this mutation, they believe they will so break the back of humanity that we'll have to go to genetic engineers to be able to create new humanoid clones to even claim we have procreation.
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:39.600]  Within just a few more decades, no one will be able to have children.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:46.600]  That's all official numbers if you follow the graph, fertility of women going straight down, fertility of men going straight down.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:49.600]  And so this is the artificiality, I'll say it again.
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:12:02.600]  They don't just want to have the carrots and the beets and the tomatoes and the potatoes and the soybeans and the corn and the wheat be GMO and not be able to reproduce.
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:09.600]  You've got to go to them to get a special seed that even grows because see life, God gave us something that just keeps going and renews itself.
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  It's a perpetual motion machine is life.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  They cut that off and say, you've got to come to us.
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  And so they're introducing the clean break.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.600]  That's what Schwab calls it a cut.
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  He said they will try to escape the Great Reset.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:35.600]  But we have created a deep cut and now into that cut, the new system will rise like a river can cut through and create the Grand Canyon.
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  He's saying we've cut you and if you don't submit to us, you have no business.
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:41.600]  You have no future.
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:47.600]  You must surrender to us and then everything will be okay for you, but you will have no children.
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:50.600]  And that's why none of the top levels have children now.
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:54.600]  The managerial class, the McCrons and the Mirkles and all them.
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:13:03.600]  The top levels have a bunch of kids, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Gates's, the Ted Turner's, the Saudi Kings, the British, you know, the Chinese leadership.
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  They've all got five, six kids.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  But for everybody else, you can work with them.
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:14.600]  And literally if you start having children, they go, okay, that's it.
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:19.600]  You're not in the club because metaphysically when you have children, it's like putting chips in.
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.600]  And they see that as new soldiers.
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.600]  That's what they have articles going, women don't have children.
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  It's evil.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:27.600]  Children are evil.
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:28.600]  They're bad.
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:29.600]  Women, you're bad.
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  You're dirty.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  Why are we listening to this satanic cult?
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.600]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  I'm all in.
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:35.600]  See, I put chips on the table.
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  I believe in the future.
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  I'm betting on humanity with my four children.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.600]  You understand?
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.600]  I'm all in.
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:48.600]  And we have the strength of the universe and our ancient species that God flows through.
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:57.600]  We will destroy the New World Order and Satan will be bound to destroy it.
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:59.600]  Your voice counts.
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:04.600]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.600]  They know you're angry.
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:13.600]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:17.600]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts,
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.600]  you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,

[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  That's 833-470-0438 for Info Wars Emergency News Alerts.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:43.600]  Or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:48.600]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States,
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:19.600]  and that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:23.600]  that could barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:26.600]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:30.600]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:33.600]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:36.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:44.600]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:54.600]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:02.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.600]  These began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:19.600]  The natural sources were then made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:32.600]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:40.600]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:45.600]  have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.600]  Go to infoorstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:17:07.600]  with the Mega Immune Support Pack now 40% off.
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:28.600]  Crashing the lies and disinformation. Waging war on corruption. It's info wars.
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:31.600]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Very honored to be here.
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:34.600]  Very thankful to you, the viewers and listeners and the straight crew.
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:38.600]  And this man who I count as a friend of mine now, we had a great almost three hour dinner last night
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.600]  with Judge Joe Brown, who already knew who he was.
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:44.600]  I watched his TV show. I knew he'd done a lot of big trials.
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  But then I got home last night at like 11 and my phone's blowing up going,
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:52.600]  you didn't know he did the famous Martin Luther King murder trial.
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:54.600]  You didn't know he did the big diamond.
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:58.600]  I knew he was a big judge, but I guess that's how it got the big TV show.
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:02.600]  And so talk about interesting man, his deep sea diving orca whales,
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:06.600]  killing dolphins, the stuff he's seen is just incredible.
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:08.600]  And so Larry Pinkney's on next hour.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:12.600]  He's going to ride shotgun with us with Larry Pinkney.
[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:16.600]  This guy actually knew a lot of the founding members of the Black Panther Party,
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:19.600]  not the new Black Panther Party. And so that should be an interesting interview
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  with the two of these gentlemen on together next hour.
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:26.600]  Judge, there's so much to cover. I've got some legal questions for you.
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:31.600]  Concerning the FBI saying they want to arrest members of Congress for their words,
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:34.600]  criticizing the election, questioning it.
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:40.600]  Frank Figzioli, if that's how you say his name, has gone on MSNBC and called for arresting people
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:45.600]  that challenge the election results. Sounds very draconian, anti-free speech.
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:49.600]  I mean, we're going to play that clip coming up in the last segment of this hour,
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  but thank you for being here again.
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:56.600]  All right, sir. By the way, you one of those guys that's good to hang out with
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:59.600]  and kick it with and drink some beer with.
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:03.600]  Oh, we had a great few bottles of wine. We didn't have any beer.
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:04.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  But I'll make believe.
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:07.600]  I had a good night though. You're fine.
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:11.600]  You are too. You've got a lovely and charming wife,
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:15.600]  and you really have a good household because she likes listening to you.
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:17.600]  Well, she really enjoyed your stories are amazing.
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.600]  Well, my I'm sorry, I'm listening to you. She likes listening to you.
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:25.600]  My ex-wives tell me you tell me to shut up. They don't want to hear anything.
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:27.600]  Well, if somebody's boring, I tell them to shut up.
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.600]  But they've got something to say. It's interesting.
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:35.600]  All right. This thing with the FBI here, this is just absolutely disgraceful
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:41.600]  because they even say that demands that that individual be removed
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:46.600]  because there is an absolute prohibition on any consequence,
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:52.600]  the anything that a U.S. Senator or member of the House of Representatives
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:58.600]  says on the House or Senate floor or to and from a session
[1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:02.600]  or during the course of representation.
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:07.600]  And to question that election, if you such a damn full charlatan
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:11.600]  that you would say that someone should be arrested
[1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:17.600]  for questioning something that a whole lot of the citizens of this country question,
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:23.600]  then you need to be put in an HD Wells time machine and taken back to 1933
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.600]  because the German National Socialist Workers Party,
[1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:32.600]  a.k.a. Nazis would love to have you.
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:35.600]  Absolutely. I'm going to play the clip, cut up last segment of this hour,
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:39.600]  because it's hard to believe, but this is what Saki, the press secretary, is saying.
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.600]  It's what the FBI director is saying. This is really getting creepy,
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:44.600]  but shifting yours back to...
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:47.600]  Well, how about, you know, if you want to be equally stupid,
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:52.600]  how about talking about Maxine Waters for her actually urging people
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:57.600]  to break the public peace and commit criminal activity to spit on people
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:02.600]  that supported the opposition or break the windows of cars out
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  that had the bumper stickers of the opposition on.
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:11.600]  That sounds like something that is never to be tolerated in the United States of America.
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:15.600]  Well, she said actually go out and they called it mostly peaceful
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.600]  when people burned down $2 billion worth of property.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:22.600]  Well, that's awful.
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:28.600]  You burned down black businesses, protesting some black person getting shot down by police.
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:31.600]  That is really, really suspect.
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:34.600]  Okay, we could go off into that.
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  And then they shot the off-duty black police officer that was guarding the business, remember?
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.600]  Yeah, look at that right there.
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:43.600]  That is not on the floor of Congress.
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:49.600]  Not even in her jurisdiction and that is advocating breach of the public peace,
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.600]  but that's all right.
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:56.600]  So you know you've got fascist functioning when they say things are horrible
[1:21:56.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  if one party says it and okay if the other or it's not even a party.
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:05.600]  It's just probably the majority of this country.
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:07.600]  But I like James Brown.
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:09.600]  I like James Brown.
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:12.600]  Yeah, the thing too.
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:13.600]  Look at it this way.
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:21.600]  They've got an 1877 act that is loosely titled the Confidence and Elections Act.
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:24.600]  And that should have been evoked.
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:25.600]  It's still good law.
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:31.600]  And what it's about is when there is something that causes the integrity of a federal election to be questioned,
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:35.600]  there is provision for a 15-man committee to be formed.
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:39.600]  Five from the House, five from the Senate, and five from the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:47.600]  And they are instructed following that act to go out and do an independent audit
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:53.600]  of what happened to report back in no less than 10 days.
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:56.600]  In other words, take at least that much time to count.
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:58.600]  But nobody advised Trump to call for that?
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:01.600]  Well, actually it was being called for.
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:06.600]  And interestingly enough, when that break-in occurred on January 6th,
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:08.600]  they were just about to bring that up.
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:09.600]  They were, yeah.
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.600]  So here you go, loop-de-loop.
[1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:14.600]  What's wrong with evoking an act?
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  What do you think the act is for if there are not questions about its validity?
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:21.600]  Why is there a law if you're not allowed to ask questions?
[1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:23.600]  Yes, and then you come up and you say,
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:27.600]  you blast beam against the Constitution of the United States of America
[1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:32.600]  that you supposedly take an oath to uphold in your office as an FBI agent
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:38.600]  and talk about you want to arrest members of Congress for asking questions
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:42.600]  that their constituents, I'm sure, would like to have answered.
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:43.600]  I mean, what's the problem?
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:50.600]  Well, since we're going there now, this is, we'll get to it next segment,
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:52.600]  but it's really crazy.
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:56.600]  And he's not the only one there all over the place saying that, you know,
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:01.600]  we've got to basically use the CIA and counterterrorism against anyone
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.600]  that incites people to question the election.
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:05.600]  So he's really calling for martial law.
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  We'll play the clip next segment.
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:11.600]  And by the way, that's why we have the Second Amendment.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:17.600]  That right there.
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:22.600]  Why do you think they are so spoiling for a physical fight?
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  They aren't.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.600]  They just hope they can use the technicalities to keep them from manning up
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  and having to answer for what they have been claiming so falsely.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:36.600]  They've got Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, mainstream media,
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  and now the FBI getting on board this.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  I mean, when are Americans to be penalized for asking questions?
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:45.600]  It's definitely dangerous.
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  What do you make of huge development?
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:51.600]  Three different states tour the Arizona audit floor more expected every day.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.600]  And reportedly when they say this audit comes out soon,
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:56.600]  it's overwhelming that it was stolen from Trump.
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  Look at what happened in Florida in 2000.
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  It went the other way.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.600]  So I mean, it's probably the second or third most discussed issue
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:11.600]  in American politics, electoral corruption.
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:17.600]  I mean, that's the grist of American politics for 240 years.
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  So all of a sudden now 2021 because Associated Press attested everything was fair.
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  They became an official governmental entity to assuage the worries of the American public.
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  What's going on here?
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:35.600]  I don't get it, but I do get it.
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:39.600]  It's called Z-Kyle.
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:41.600]  You're absolutely right.
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.600]  They're going to probably freeze frame that and say,
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  Judge Joe Brown's a Nazi.
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  That's Hitler's salute.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:49.600]  Yeah, that's what I'm saluting our current administration.
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:50.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:51.600]  We'll be right back.
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  God's sake.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:53.600]  God's sake.
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:54.600]  All right.
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:57.600]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:00.600]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack of humanity,
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.600]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:07.600]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:10.600]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things zero public doesn't get to see.
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.600]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress,
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:22.600]  people are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:24.600]  They don't want to go along with the globalists,
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  but they're scared.
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:27.600]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:29.600]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:30.600]  You fund us.

[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  what the globalist will target you for,
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:43.600]  to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:44.600]  That's our job.

[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:09.600]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.600]  working together in perfect synchronicity

[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:20.600]  InfoWars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.

[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:55.600]  InfoWars.com
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:58.600]  My enemies are your enemies.
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:00.600]  They're the globalist, they're an exterminist.
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:05.600]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control for each devil or spurs.
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:10.600]  Vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory
[1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:16.600]  and are setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda,
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:20.600]  drugs and electromagnetic radiation
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:27.600]  to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:29.600]  like a pawn on a chessboard.
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:33.600]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  and the news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:44.600]  and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:48.600]  but at the end of the day it's all about the population, it's all about world government,
[1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:51.600]  it's all about the end of the human system as we know it
[1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:53.600]  and all its ashes and nightmare being built.
[1:29:53.600 --> 1:30:22.600]  That's the thing that can turn around and stop it.
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:24.600]  There's a war on for your mind.
[1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:33.600]  Well, Frank Figliozzi is assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for Counterterrorism.
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:35.600]  That's right.
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:37.600]  Isn't that just amazing?
[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:43.600]  And he goes on MSNBC and says what Biden said
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:47.600]  and said what Socke said and what they're all
[1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:53.600]  and what Nunez, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Community said two months ago
[1:30:53.600 --> 1:30:57.600]  he said we're in these meetings and they say we're preparing for a white supremacist uprising
[1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:01.600]  and they go what's a white supremacist, they go anybody that supports Trump or questions the election.
[1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:05.600]  Then they add the Daily Show with Trevor Noah last night.
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:07.600]  I saw this this morning.
[1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:12.600]  30 minute attack on Ted Cruz and myself and then it cut to KKK rallies and said
[1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:16.600]  these are their supporters, this is defamation designed to get us killed.
[1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:20.600]  As if Ted Cruz or I have anything to do with a stupid as Democrat KKK.
[1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:22.600]  This is incredible.
[1:31:22.600 --> 1:31:27.600]  And so they're branding any opposition to election fraud, any opposition to the open borders,
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:35.600]  any opposition to globalism as insurrection and here he is on MSNBC very aggressively saying
[1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:41.600]  we need to go after the members of Congress when it's the Democrats that have been inciting violence.
[1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:42.600]  Here it is.
[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:47.600]  Look, Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6th is domestic terrorism.
[1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:50.600]  What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism?
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:58.600]  In order to address that problem, arresting low level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a road block.
[1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:04.600]  In order to really tackle terrorism and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.600]  the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:13.600]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now,
[1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:16.600]  people in and around the former president.
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:17.600]  That's how you do this.
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:27.600]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:31.600]  Judge, you were shaking your head during that.
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:37.600]  He just said we need to disrupt and stop networks run by congressmen of terrorism.
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:40.600]  I mean, this is a coup talk.
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:42.600]  They're saying we want a coup.
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:43.600]  This is a coup against America.
[1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:47.600]  I'm not a legal scholar like you, but what the hell do we just see?
[1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:50.600]  This is somewhat unique.
[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:59.600]  You are actually looking at something that looks very much like a repeat of 1933, 1934 in Germany.
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:04.600]  And it is bad.
[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:15.600]  Now, that salute I gave wasn't supporting the contention, but it is sarcasm, was sarcasm,
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:20.600]  directed towards somebody that's actually acting like their fascist.
[1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:22.600]  You were saluting their fascism as satirist.
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.600]  That's exactly it.
[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:30.600]  It's disgusting to hear some damn fool that went to an American law school that's
[1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:39.600]  a member of somebody's bar that does not have any more savvy as to what he just said,
[1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:47.600]  where you are going to what, criminally charged people for freely speaking their minds.
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:53.600]  That is worse than McCarty back in the 1950s, going around red-baiting.
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:55.600]  That is disgusting.
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  That person is not fit and as soon as soon as anybody takes control,
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  rests control of the house and the Senate from the Democratic Party,
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  which I suspect will happen in the midterms, they need to demand this fool's immediate firing.
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  And anybody in line that is supporting this, all the way up to the Attorney General,
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:31.600]  needs to be impeached and removed from office for supporting this travesty against the American way.
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.600]  It's not just clansmen or white supremacists, there are a whole lot of black folk,
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:45.600]  Native American, Asians, Hispanic Americans out there who do not like that.
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:50.600]  So what is the devil about us? You lumping us into this group?
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:54.600]  And I dare some full question, my black credentials.
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.600]  I mean, I've been on the front lines for years.
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:00.600]  Well, you don't agree with Biden that if you don't vote for him, you're not blocked?
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:02.600]  Hell no, he's a damn fool.
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  So I mean, just to make a statement like that, you've got to be a jerk.
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:11.600]  And that's just consistent with his entire public career over the last half century.
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:16.600]  That's what I'm saying is Obama came out and said Americans need to be guilty for being white.
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:19.600]  But then he's buddies with Joe Biden, Mr. KKK.
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  And cousins to George Herbert Walker and George Walker Bush and to Dick Cheney.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:30.600]  So while we will be.
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:32.600]  It's crazy how those guys are related.
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  Well, yeah, I got a little on that.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:38.600]  Hold on, let me look this up so I get it actually right on my phone.
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:47.600]  Since we're talking about that, there's a very interesting gentleman who I guess did real good work.
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  Back when.
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:54.600]  Let's see his name is Sam Samuel Hinkley.
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:36:03.600]  He was a French Huguenot Protestant and he entered into an indentured servitude agreement to get to the American colonies.
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:07.600]  So he could escape religious persecution.
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:11.600]  He died in 1662 in Cape Cod.
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  However, he's had seven American presidents who are direct descendants of his, including both Bush's and Barack Obama through his.
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:39.600]  Well, Obama's mother, the late Mrs. Soutoro, and also one American vice president, Dick Cheney, Brad Pitt, the actor Warren Buffett, the billionaire and a whole lot of other rich folks.
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:45.600]  So I guess he was doing it back in before he croaked in 1662.
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  He had some mojo.
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:56.600]  Yeah, it did. I don't know too many people that are ancestors to seven American presidents in one VP.
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:58.600]  I guess that's good.
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  I sure would like to find that out.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  I saw somebody that did that the future.
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  He was definitely busy.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:06.600]  I mean, you can hold your head up.
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:09.600]  Well, yeah, he's dead, but you know, wherever he may be.
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  Now that said, this is disgusting. I have no words that can adequately express what I think about that.
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:36.600]  All of these people who over the last 240 years of all races and ethnicities who've gone out and sacrificed for the cause of the United States Constitution and the dream this country stands for.
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  That range is from our military personnel who made the sacrifice that we celebrated on Memorial Day.
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:51.600]  That's the people like Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, anybody who went out trying to actualize the promise of this place.
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  That's all of the civil rights demonstrators and everybody else in his full blaspheme against them because he just slapped what they died for, bled for, got mutilated behind and stood up for and tried to turn it into something that Adolf Hitler would be proud of.
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  And he said people question the election are inciting violence.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  We need to use any terrorism to take them out.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  I mean, this is what he said.
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  That's what we need to be careful of.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  This current regime is going about the business of putting nice fancy labels on stuff.
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  You said during the break, you said they're attempting a takeover if they're not successful and then the music started, we went live.
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:38.600]  Can you repeat what you said?
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  I'm going to get that.
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  They put these fancy labels on things that look like they have a good cause.
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:54.600]  But when you read the body of them, they're setting up a Nazi like fascist like state where people's rights under the bill of rights and it's totally aggregated.
[1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  Now back to this.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:07.600]  What this kind does not seem to get is that when you do something like they're doing in America, it becomes a two-edged sword.
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  It swings this way and it can go back the other way.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:26.600]  And although you are, oh, we have to protect these fools from the era of their own ways and we have to make everything comfy for all of the rest of the people that don't have what it takes to do what these real citizens do.
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  Well, it can swing back the other way.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  And it's not pretty.
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  And by the way, this kind of stuff is what the founding fathers thought about when they propounded the Second Amendment.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  Well, yeah, he says he's coming for your views to lock you up.
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  Yeah, First Amendment is going out the window the way these guys are going.
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  I've never in the 50 years I've been involved in law, 50 more, 50 plus actually.
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  Oh, we've got to go to break.
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:53.600]  Come back with us and come back.
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:40:01.600]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:06.600]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:15.600]  Humanity is strong.
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:16.600]  We're incredible.
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:20.600]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:23.600]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:24.600]  So prayer is essential.
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  Research is essential.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family.

[1:40:54.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:31.600]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:35.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega immune support pack.

[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:22.600]  The beauty of the universe, an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:26.600]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean,
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:32.600]  or the beauty of your life, your husband, the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic,
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:40.600]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system,
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:48.600]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it.
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  All right, Judge Joe Brown, we got caught up in that break.
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  You know, their hard satellite breaks got to go to them live.
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:36.600]  You said last night what you were saying to me during the breaks about this incredible frost roads we're at,
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:43.600]  and what this deep state corruption is trying to do with this attack on free speech and this call for the CIA,
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:49.600]  the FBI to be used against the American people, 470-something people that weren't even violent,
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:55.600]  most of them held in solitary confinement, I mean, even foreign governments,
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  even Elizabeth Warren is saying this is wrong, and now to have this counterterrorism FBI operative on TV
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:06.600]  and the FBI director testifying the number one threats white supremacist,
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.600]  and then defining that as questioning the election or supporting President Trump.
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:13.600]  I mean, this is extremely dangerous. No one I know is buying into it,
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  but they just keep pushing it.
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  You were saying in all your years as a judge and a lawyer and everything, you never see anything like it.
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:21.600]  What's really going on with these creepy guys?
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:23.600]  Because they talk about coups.
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:26.600]  He's the one who want the coup against members of Congress.
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:34.600]  I've never heard anybody involved with national law enforcement advocate breaking of the law.
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:41.600]  First off, he's advocating that the government engage in violation of citizen civil rights.
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:56.600]  Next thing, he is attempting to bring the CIA in which as per its federal charter is forbidden activity inside the United States
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.600]  against citizens only abroad.
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:04.600]  So he is advocating in at least two instances that the law be broken.
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:08.600]  He ought to be removed because that in fact shows unfitness for office.
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:17.600]  This looks like honestly, the ultimate episode in the franchise revenge of the nerds.
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:27.600]  It's from people who cannot deal with the reality of doing something straight up like men and women do.
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:36.600]  They have to sneak and creep in the dark alleys and sneak up in the dark and try to stab this country in the back with this kind of thing.
[1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:46.600]  And the way the media is playing it is though this is a normalcy and not a transgression on what this country is supposed to be about.
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:49.600]  Now, it has its shortcomings, no doubt.
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:47:04.600]  But I mean, we're working on it and it's not good for somebody in this kind of position to jump out there and start talking about violating the law to do what?
[1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:14.600]  To make somebody safe from the accusation that okay, the election looks like, smells like, sounds like it was stolen.
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:15.600]  Maybe it wasn't.
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  But don't you think that the government that had confidence in its own people would do something about reassuring them that this election was not stolen?
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  And he voked the 1877 Act, the Confidence in Elections Act, and go out and do what that act says is supposed to be done, which is to put up a 15-member committee, a commission composed of five congressmen, five senators.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  And the five-member, as you said, going to vote on that day when we got set up on January 6.
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  So in the law, in the law, Judge Brown, when he says, we have right-wing extremists, they're dangerous, we need to use counterterrorism against them, and we have laws against any American that's something wrong.
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  In the group, we need to target their leadership, arresting the people that protested is just a speed hump to getting to the leadership that is the Congress.
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:18.600]  So this is a bureaucrat saying, I want to organize and remove elected people.
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  So he's at war with the people, he calls a speed bump, and then the representative, he's saying, is their main target.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  This is an outrageous announcement of criminal coup intent.
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  Am I wrong, Your Honor?
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  Am I wrong? And as a matter of fact, it sounds like a couple of plagiarized speeches I'm aware of that were made in Nazi Germany in 1933 and 1934 to justify depriving the Germans of their constitutional rights in the name of safety.
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:49.600]  That was after the burning of the German parliament building.
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  They call it the Reichstag, and that occurred and gave them justification to have these Braconian crackdowns, and what you're talking about is imposing national martial law, and that's just not done.
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:06.600]  Wow, that just hit me like a ton of bricks, Judge.
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  This is Reichstag 2.0, but we know with Marinus Landerloob and the Nazis, the evidence has really set the fire, found a mentally ill young man to blame who they executed, Marinus Landerloob, and then Hitler used that to basically declare martial law and the rest is history.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:45.600]  That's what was used to lock up Slavs, Jews, anybody that Hitler deemed utter munching or anything else to slaughter Soviet citizens, to slaughter those in the Ukraine, Poland, what is now the Czech Republic, you name it.
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  By the way, guys, you found some great, best Reichstag footage I've ever seen, I've never seen HD of it. Roll that, you guys were showing, keep going, Judge.
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:50:06.600]  But, you know, this just is not American, and you want to blame the right wing, and you're listening to the left side utter out of their own mouths worse.
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  Well, exactly. If I heard Trump say, I'm going to arrest members of Congress for their speech, I'd be against Trump. I mean, on a scale of one to ten, on a tyranny scale, Judge, when you're saying we want to just nebulously grab members of Congress and use anti-terrorism on them, meaning get rid of the due process, that just sounds like a coup to me.
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:49.600]  Yeah, and this administration, the Biden administration ought to be right now preparing a long speech to denounce this, and reassure the public that he and she are not going to any way, any form, any shape, countenance such blasphemy against the American Republic being part of their administration.
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  Wow. So, if they don't, look out because you see what time it is.
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  And what time is it?
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  We are on the verge of a lot of things happening in a takeover occurring. I've seen something like this, but never to this extent. I saw it when I was in junior high school, and they were having this red-baiting thing about communists being everywhere and behind everything.
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:40.600]  And when you had a federal form, it was a job, employment application for departments. I remember when I was 15 and filled the first one out, it was a long page on you do not belong to this organization, you have not affiliated knowingly with anyone who is in these organizations.
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:41.600]  It was a litmus test.
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:52.600]  Yes, and they had a long series, but that wasn't as bad as this, at least you could say we were in a military confrontation with somebody.
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:55.600]  But it was still an American and dangerous.
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:57.600]  But this is happening now.
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  Yes, Eisenhower denounced McCarty and interestingly enough, Prescott Bush, the Bush's father, joined in that denunciation of that kind of thing as un-American.
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  So that happened 60-some years ago, 65 years ago. Why are we revisiting that?
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:32.600]  Well, I mean, it's not just this FBI guy. I see, Biden's actually said the similar things, and they are really trying to gear up to come after everybody.
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:38.600]  I guess they want to start a fight, but I agree with you. They don't really want that fight. What is all this, just an attempted bullying?
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  Yeah, it's what has been staged by 50 years where the propaganda coming out of the mainstream media, and slowly but surely, the Nazis didn't have but 15, 20 years to do what they did before they was smacked into World War II.
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:21.600]  But we've had 50 years of propagandizing the American public to denounce masculinity, to denounce femininity, to abandon manhood, womanhood, and childhood, to advocate that something's wrong with anybody that wants decency, decorum,
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:39.600]  and respect to denounce anyone who does not deal with the classical family situation, does not deal with rationality, logic, reason, analysis, and this passionate overview of things and say,
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:57.600]  we have to be an emotionally driven madhouse, and it looks like the inmates have taken over the asylum, and you have the judges, the doctors, the lawyers, the elected officials being inmates, and everybody is being forced to live in an asylum.
[1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:03.600]  But that's not what this place is about. That is not appropriate.
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:17.600]  This is an issue that's more important than the ethnic problems this country has, the race problems this country has, anything else, the economic problems this country has.
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:29.600]  And when you start seeing people putting in place the implements of a coup, then we ought to be all unified in saying hell no.
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:36.600]  You see those headlines, mainstream, get rid of the nuclear family, pull the plug, it's bad. That is the human system.
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:44.600]  What group would say get rid of a family, a cult that wants to run your life? Stay with us.
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:52.600]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced to last 27 years to be a public figure,
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:55:00.600]  and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God. And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:07.600]  but just give me a break. The Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:15.600]  And I get it. While you've been turned off by big churches, while you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too.
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:23.600]  Believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential.
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:30.600]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.

[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  Frank Figliuzzi is the poster child for un-American tyranny calling for the CIA outside of law to go out and remember some Congress who promote basically freedom.
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:23.600]  And so we're going to get to other subjects next segment, Judge, but you're really, as a famous lawyer, famous judge, smart guys, really shocked by his attack and his statement.
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  You were research engineering what he said. If we watch the video and surprise, it wasn't a scandal because this has become part of the course. They're normalizing this.
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  So under law and as a former judge, what do you make of this statement for people that don't understand why it's so outrageous to you?
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:44.600]  I severely question his fitness to remain a member of the bar.
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:52.600]  I mean, this is just really, really out there. This is not something that an American lawyer should advocate to the public.
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:58:01.600]  It gives them the wrong ideas. And today's public is so far from being inquisitive enough to actually read something.
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:15.600]  They hear it, get it as a text on a cell phone, see it on Instagram or Facebook, see it on mainstream media, and they think it's a reality.
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:23.600]  People say Associated Press has declared this was a fair election. Who in the hell is Associated Press? They aren't an official agency.
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:28.600]  There's no investigation with the strictures of law applied to it.
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:43.600]  And then for the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to come out through one of its senior representatives and declare publicly that they intend to suppress the Bill of Rights,
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:56.600]  where they intend to violate due process, where they are going to break the federal law and violate citizen civil rights as a policy to bring in the CIA,
[1:58:56.600 --> 1:59:06.600]  to prosecute members of Congress who have an absolute constitutional immunity for anything in debate on the House or the Senate floor.
[1:59:06.600 --> 1:59:17.600]  Where in the world did this fool come from? What rot did he crawl out from under? And I'll probably get all kinds of hell about it, but I'm an old man. I don't care, you know.
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:24.600]  Oh, they don't want to have a debate about this. I mean, because I'm not a lawyer like you, but we're a judge, but this is just classic tyranny.
[1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:31.600]  Like, oh, everybody that protests is bad. We're not just going to arrest them. We're going to get the Congress. I mean, it's like that.
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:45.600]  We have all of the woke black folk who are upset about their circumstances now, 160-some years after the Civil War, where they don't feel that they're fully first-class citizens.
[1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:53.600]  What happens if they come up with some protest like this? Are you to institute Jim Crow again?
[1:59:53.600 --> 2:00:01.600]  Well, that's right. First, it was for the Muslims, and while they're right now, it's conservatives. Next, it'll be liberals.
[2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:09.600]  How about if the Asian population says we aren't protected under the new laws because it was a sham? Are they to be locked up?
[2:00:09.600 --> 2:00:17.600]  How about Catholics that come out and talk about discrimination and something is wrong? Do they get locked up? Jews get locked up?
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:27.600]  Is followers of Islam get locked up? Hindus get locked up? Buddhists get locked up because they say something is not...
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:30.600]  You can lock one group up with their speech. You can lock them all up.
[2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:39.600]  Yeah. In other words, a cause of associated press says it. You disagree with that. You're supposed to be prosecuted?
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:47.600]  And by the way, Wuhan, AP said it didn't come out of Wuhan, so you'd be censored off the Internet even if you were a medical doctor or a senator.
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:54.600]  They were censoring on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube congressional hearings with scientists because the UN didn't agree it could come from a lab.
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:56.600]  Now they admit that.
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:01:10.600]  That's classic. He's a charlatan. He's a liar. He's trying to foment and incite violence by... And he's being anti-Asian by calling it something that came out of a Wuhan lab.
[2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:18.600]  And now look at this administration. They were yi-re-ra-ra. Get them before saying that. Now they're saying it.
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  So, you know, this is like sauce for the goose. This is sauce for the gander. That's the American way. So what happened?
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  We're looking at something un-American. We're looking at something from a racist. We're looking at something from a bigot.
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:42.600]  And this is part of his administration, like Harriet Truman said 70-some years ago. The buck stops here.
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  That's where it ought to stop. Alright, Judge Joe Brown, straight ahead, back in 60 seconds.
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:02:01.600]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity.
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:26.600]  And what level we want to go to. And it really does come down to that. So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:36.600]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will. And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:45.600]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:56.600]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bath because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:21.600]  So I'm not going to play the clip. Everybody sees it. It's all over the news. Obama, the former president, who did get elected unlike Joe Biden. I mean, he did get elected.
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  He is the former president. He came out and he said that basically America is inherently bad and racist. I guess that's why they elected a black man.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:48.600]  I mean, he is I would say part African unlike Kamala Harris. But if you expand on that, he endorses Joe Biden, who was this big Dixie Crat and who was in all these newspaper articles saying really horrible racist things that judge Joe Brown when he was on a federal think tank saw.
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:59.600]  So that's why originally I wanted to get him here. He testified to that here on air yesterday. But now these new emails that are confirmed and text messages of Hunter Biden calling people the N word.
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  I mean, who does that anyways? It's just there's something wrong with these people. You were saying it's a dog whistle. Break that down.
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:24.600]  Here's what's happening. You have a president of the United States who used to glorify the fact that he came from a formerly slave holding state Delaware. He complained about it not having the fortitude to join the glorious south and become part of the Confederacy.
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  That's been long hashed out. But to start saying that again back in the early 1970s and by the way, what I heard was not 1977. It was five years before that.
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  And I was present and I heard it with my own ears and saw it with my own eyes. It was in over Delaware.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:59.600]  Now, that said, you have Hunter Biden, who is a product of this old line racist family. Well, not old line, this racist family, this racist background.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:10.600]  I'm sure he heard a lot of this growing up in the household around the dinner table. And you have somebody who is actually damn full enough to say anybody that doesn't vote for me is not black.
[2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:17.600]  And I put my black credentials up against anybody's anytime anywhere.
[2:05:17.600 --> 2:05:33.600]  And for some fool to say that is ridiculous. He's relying on dog whistles where we have had 50 years where the propaganda that has caused the black community to feel like it belongs to the Democratic Party and they won't come off that slave plantation.
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  After all, the Democratic Party was charted at the beginning of the 19th century with the specific goal of spreading slavery into the new territory required under the Louisiana purchase.
[2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:58.600]  So I guess some of these people who don't understand what it means to think like a free person and to bargain their votes for benefits, actual tangible benefits.
[2:05:58.600 --> 2:06:18.600]  They feel safe on being back on the plantation of the plantation masters, the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, they've had their problems, but at least in 1851 when they were charted, it was on the campaign plank of abolition that is abolishing slavery.
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  Now, I'm not going to give anybody a free pass. I declare myself to be an independent and I'm going where my vote gets the best benefit for me, this country, and my people, my family, and somebody that's trying to keep decency in place.
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:54.600]  Now, this guy walking around with this duck tail back wind looking like he was out of the 50s from 20 years before that. This is the person you've got in the White House right now and he has an attorney general of the United States of America.
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:07:17.600]  He is in charge of the FBI, this part of the federal apparatus that comes under the chief executive. That's him. And he has not done anything right now to censor or discipline or remove this idiot who came out and said what he said about attempting to, not the attempting, but the
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:34.600]  desirability of implementing prosecution of congressmen and senators for what they say when they express the desires, the wishes, the questions, the fears of their constituents. What is this?
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:48.600]  So, judges, they're clearly making a run at martial law. They want to use racial division as a trigger to be the cover of saying where the Democrats were good, anybody that isn't for our takeovers or races is a white supremacist.
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:55.600]  That's clearly the mode they're running. How do we stop that? How do we deal with that?
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:08:07.600]  Well, it's like you had another one where they said BLM has fallen from grace. This was, I think, was either the New York Times or something like that.
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  They said BLM has fallen from grace due to the activity of conservative far right republics. No, it didn't. A lot of black people found out the fraud was being perpetrated upon them by the BLM organization.
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:25.600]  The mother of the girl that got killed said that they're all full of it.
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:38.600]  Yeah, and let that switch over from BLM black lives matter to BFM black families matter, black fathers matter, black finance matter, black females matter, black fidelity matters.
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  You know, you have all sorts of things that you have here because the concept is not a bad one. Everybody in this country has a life that should matter the same as everybody else's.
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:52.600]  Everybody has an opinion. Everybody's entitled to an opinion.
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:55.600]  It's the Democrats in the deep state hiding behind black people.
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:01.600]  Those opinions may not be worth anything, but they have an absolute right to express them.
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  And I've spent my whole adulthood trying to deal with making sure people maintain and keep and can exercise.
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:16.600]  Let me ask this question. You agree clearly they're trying to have a diversion for Biden and all his tyranny over racial conflict.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  How do we break that? How do we poison us?
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:27.600]  These things should not be uttered in the United States of America, even if someone has their right to utter those things.
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:39.600]  But this person has an official position and such as the black caucus are running around saying we have to support the FBI and for them to come up with that kind of thing.
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:51.600]  When any damn fool can see that it can be so easily flipped and the script can be turned around when the people that the black caucus are supposed to be representing, which they don't,
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:10:02.600]  could be prosecuted for uttering something that was commonplace in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, well, stopped by the 80s.
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:09.600]  And that, I just don't get it. Are we that stupid?
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:18.600]  You've done a lot of famous court trials, but you were the main judge on the final trial with what really happened with the assassination of Martin Luther King.
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:24.600]  It wasn't a trial. It was post-conviction relief petition. And when I got to the bottom of what was going on in terms of the hearings.
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:33.600]  Yeah, the hearings in terms of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, that same FBI through J. Edgar Hoover had a lot to do with it.
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:39.600]  They supplied the murder weapon and ammunition and they recruited the two man team that killed him.
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:48.600]  So what's going on? It wasn't one man. It wasn't some row old nonsense.
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:58.600]  The FBI got the shooters. They gave them the weapons. There were five of these special weapons that they got provided from the Defense Department.
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:05.600]  With an invoice, serial numbers listed late December 1967, late April 1968.
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:12.600]  The Attorney General ordered them to return the five weapons to the Defense Department. They claimed they lost one.
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:21.600]  Yeah, sure. Now, that kind of thing is what they've been doing as a sub-refuge. Now, good Lord.
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:29.600]  All this time later, they come right out 60 years later and they say it in public and start saying,
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:45.600]  bring the CIA in, which according to its charter is forbidden to do anything in the United States, arrest and criminally charged members of Congress for saying what they were entitled to say on the floor.
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:50.600]  And the Democrats endorse it.
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:12:02.600]  Well, I'm looking up like where did it all come from? Did they parachute in as some commandos to take down the American Republic or what?
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  It's dangerous. It's very dangerous. It sounds like revenge of the nerds.
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  Well, you're right. You said that's what it was. The nerds decided to take over. They did. They did.
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  They were dissatisfied with their lot in life. They hate the fact that they could not fit in. Like most people, they now call norms and breeders.
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:30.600]  And, you know, this group is just attacking motherhood for goodness sakes. They feel they're insulted if you call somebody a mother instead of a birth parent.
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:37.600]  I mean, what in the world are they up to and why are we letting this happen? Why don't we boycott mainstream media?
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:45.600]  Why don't we boycott every commercial outlet for products that we are expected to go to grocery stores and...
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  I agree. It's either pro-human or it's done.
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:51.600]  We'll be right back with Larry Peyton. You're right. Shocking with us, judge.
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:58.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs. Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  The natural sources were then made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape. Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:41.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today. The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:51.600]  Go to inforstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune Support Pack. Now 40% off.
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:14:00.600]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control Big Pharma. They control academia.
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:05.600]  They control the military, industrial complex. They control Big Tech.
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:14.600]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:23.600]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:38.600]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:43.600]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:54.600]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars in Band-Aid video. So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:15:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:16.600]  All right. Judge Joe Brown was with us yesterday. He's in today as well. Going back to Tennessee later this afternoon. Great to have him with us.
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  Very popular guest. Another great guest, Larry Pinckney. He's a veteran of the Black Panther Party.
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:34.600]  A former minister of the Interior of the Republic of New Africa. A former political prisoner. The only American to have successfully self-authored a civil political rights case in the United Nations under the International Covenant of Civil Political Rights.
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  In connection with this political organizing activities in opposition to voter suppression.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:53.600]  Pinckney was interviewed in 88 on nationally televised PBS NewsHour, formerly known as the Madelon NewsHour. He is the editorial board member of BlackCometHitter.com. And he got banned on Twitter for basically challenging the election.
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:16:05.600]  And he's always on fire exposing the attempt to divide us and control us. And I would guess he's a fan of Judge Joe Brown. So it's good to have you both here together. Larry, thanks for joining us.
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:20.600]  Well, Brother Alex, first of all, thank you very, very much. I'm delighted and honored to be with you. You know that all the time. And to your wonderful audience. And my greetings to you, Brother Judge Joe Brown. Greetings to you.
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:25.600]  So I'll just let it go at that. And let's rock and roll.
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:37.600]  What do you make? Because Judge Joe Brown had a lot to cover. He got really upset when I played him that FBI counterterrorism guy saying arrest all the Trump supporters and use the CIA on Congress and let's take over. He was blown away by that.
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:43.600]  And then when he was ranting about the FBI, I just, I thought it sounded very similar to your views.
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:58.600]  Of course, it's very similar to my views. It's very similar to reality. And the fact is, is that we had better when I say we I'm talking about black, white, brown, red and yellow people, citizens of this republic.
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:16.600]  We had better damn well stand up and stand up to this what I call neoliberal fascism. These globalists, these Democrats quote unquote heavy quotation marks around that. These folks are all about subverting.
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:27.600]  And I repeat, subverting our republic. We must not allow this. We cannot allow this. We must reverse it.
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:30.600]  Judge, you guys, you guys hold court here.
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  Well, you know, congratulations and thank you for your successes and standing up and doing the right thing. Sir, I appreciate that.
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:45.600]  I'm from your era too. I imagine I know or knew some of the same people you did.
[2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:54.600]  But this would make it very easy to go after you or me or any other American citizens who say I have questions about what happened.
[2:17:54.600 --> 2:18:03.600]  I have questions about suppression of efforts to make fundamental changes for the good, in my opinion.
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:11.600]  But you see, if you can go after somebody for what they say on the congressional floor, and what can you do to ordinary citizens?
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:28.600]  What would have been enabled back in the 60s when the Panther Party was at the height of its effectiveness to all of those people who simply said something that somebody disagreed with?
[2:18:28.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  You see, right now, they are setting a precedent where it doesn't even have to be un-American. It's just, I don't agree with that. How do you deal with that?
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:43.600]  I agree. How do we deal with authoritarian takeover, Larry?
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:54.600]  First of all, we expose it constantly, just as you are doing right now. We let people know that this is precisely what we are dealing with, and that is authoritarian takeover.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:58.600]  I call it neoliberal fascism, because that's what it is.
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:11.600]  And as far as standing up on the floor of Congress and being held accountable, you know what? I think of what these pieces of scum did to President Donald J. Trump.
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:20.600]  Now, if they could do what they definitely did to him, imagine what they planned to have in store for us.
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:32.600]  But you know what? It's game time, and we're going to flip that script. We have to flip that script, because our very lives and the essence of our Republic are at stake.
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:35.600]  So that's my response to that, Brother Alex.
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:40.600]  I agree. So they flipped the script on us. How do we come together flipping on them?
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:56.600]  One of the first things we need to do is we have to understand the game that they're playing, and it's a vicious game. It's called divide, rule by division, play us off against each other.
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:10.600]  You know what? We can have our differences, as the French would say, vivre la différence, but we will not come out publicly and show any weakness, any crack, any difference whatsoever.
[2:20:10.600 --> 2:20:25.600]  We must understand what is at stake here. The script, indeed, must be flipped again, but this time, by us, we the people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow, citizens of this Republic.
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:33.600]  It's a dangerous game, Judge, because, I mean, this whole globalist chai-com, overthrow of the country, have us all kill each other, if it doesn't work, what happens?
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:37.600]  I think they're trying it, because what do they have to lose? They never get in trouble with what they've done.
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:52.600]  That's right. It's like, see, they don't have any sense of decency. They don't get it that nobody is supposed to be immune from these laws, but yet they want to put these things down on everybody else.
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:57.600]  They don't get chivalry that we have these rules, not because we're wimps, but because we don't want our kids under evil.
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:04.600]  That's right. They don't get it. See, it doesn't apply to them because they perceive themselves to be a righteous elite.
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:06.600]  It's delusional elitism.
[2:21:06.600 --> 2:21:09.600]  That's exactly what it is.
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:14.600]  How do you counter one of these elitists that thinks they're immune, which is delusion?
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:23.600]  Well, they really can't argue with you face-to-face or debate with you because they don't depend upon rationality, logic, and reason.
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:33.600]  They just get all the motive and it sounds good, and they're counting on the public's ignorance of the laws and the rule books, which is the Constitution.
[2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:38.600]  That's the rule book for the game that we play by living in this country.
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:48.600]  Beautifully said. So Larry Pinkney, how do we cause chain reactions? It's a good push and you're right. I'm generally just...
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:54.600]  But how do we explain to people how much danger they're in with what the globalist in this foreign takeover is?
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:22:00.600]  Because Americans, I think, should unify even stronger against us. It should be so obvious that this is ridiculous.
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:08.600]  And dangerous. And dangerous. It's very important for us as patriots...
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:12.600]  I don't give a damn what our color is, as patriots of this republic.
[2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:25.600]  It's extremely important for us to explain to people using their own experiences on their own local level.
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:38.600]  To levels, I should say, because it's plural. To explain to them what is actually being perpetrated and perpetuated upon them.
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:52.600]  People need to not only be angry, but they need to go way beyond that to saying, you know what, we need to come up with very strong responses.
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:23:07.600]  We've been too timid. We've been too tippet. We must be tenacious. We must help our brothers and sisters to understand on their local level.
[2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:20.600]  Alex, you've done this. I've seen what you've done in Austin and its suburb. You do it on the local level and then you leak it nationally to our entire republic.
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:27.600]  Alright, gentlemen, we come back. I want to then get into some of the subjects that the judge wants to get into.
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:31.600]  Larry, I want you guys to lead us. You hit a topic, he hits a topic, because this is a big debate.
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:37.600]  We all want to live our lives, just go to work and take care of our families, but we are under a takeover.
[2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:42.600]  And so the answer is, what do we do? Do we submit to that takeover? Or do we say no one? How do we do it?
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:53.600]  And then the judge wants to also get into all this attack on the family and some big developments there. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:23:53.600 --> 2:24:00.600]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:04.600]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:09.600]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:03.600]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny.
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:13.600]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:19.600]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:22.600]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:28.600]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do.
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:33.600]  I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:25:33.600 --> 2:25:40.600]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful.
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:45.600]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:59.600]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:21.600]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:26.600]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:30.600]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.

[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:55.600]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:00.600]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist, that the public's so dumbed down
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:05.600]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them,
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:10.600]  that they deserve to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the globalists. They play God.
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:15.600]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:19.600]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me. They've tried to get me to join them.
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:25.600]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection with God.
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:29.600]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:34.600]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:37.600]  believe in your part of it or believe that you're getting power out of it.
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:43.600]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:28:15.600]  And that's a fact.
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:22.600]  Welcome back here to the Alex Jones Show. I was just talking to Judge Joe Brown about how Larry Pinckney is a famous political prisoner.
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:27.600]  And then the judge is like, oh, I know Pinckney now, now that we're talking to him. Absolutely.
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:30.600]  He was even talking about the FBI setting up the Black Panthers.
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:33.600]  And now he helped bring them out to UCLA and all the rest of it.
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.600]  And then we're all clicking here. And then I'm talking about how they're trying to put congressmen in prison
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:41.600]  and trying to put all these hundreds of innocent people who did nothing in prison.
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:46.600]  Oh, I'm under criminal investigation. I've got subpoenas. And I just kind of mentioned that as a footnote.
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:51.600]  Well, that's what the judge was saying. They bankrupt you with these investigations of nothing.
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:58.600]  I'm not up there like Maxine Waters saying harass people. I'm not saying burn things down, but I'm under criminal investigation.
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:01.600]  The left's celebrating that. People say, well, you better shut your mouth.
[2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:03.600]  Now that makes you want to fight harder, Judge.
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:12.600]  Yes. See, one of the propaganda techniques is to say something often enough and people believe it, even if it's not true.
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:20.600]  And one of the extensions of that tactic is to keep saying somebody needs to be investigated.
[2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:24.600]  Somebody needs to be prosecuted for this, that and the other.
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:29.600]  And even though what they're talking about is perfectly legal, perfectly appropriate,
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:39.600]  those certain people that don't think out in the public start getting the subconscious and unconscious feeling that somebody's broken the law
[2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  and needs to be brought to justice when they haven't. And that same thing can be turned against them.
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:51.600]  I mean, think about it. If you can go after a congressman, what about all of the rest of us?
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:54.600]  Well, that's what you were saying during the break is you wanted to get back on the subject.
[2:29:54.600 --> 2:29:59.600]  I'm sorry, I'm picking up on it because it's a it's a big deal. They're doing this.
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:03.600]  Let me get into one other thing that they're trying to do the same tactic on.
[2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:07.600]  All right, we've got a secretary of education.
[2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:18.600]  And the secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, is saying he backs transgender athletes' rights.
[2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:26.600]  Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Well, let's think about some of the ramifications.
[2:30:26.600 --> 2:30:35.600]  You start talking about that. You have to ask the question, is it fair to make girls sports unfair to girls?
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.600]  To favor a few delusional boys?
[2:30:39.600 --> 2:30:46.600]  Is humoring the delusional more important than the healthy aspirations of real girls?
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:48.600]  What about their right?
[2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:57.600]  No sane and rational person or government could possibly say that the answer to these two questions is yes.
[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:02.600]  It's like you said, you have family friends whose daughters' arms have been broken, fighting men.
[2:31:02.600 --> 2:31:07.600]  Yes, wrestling, this intercollegiate wrestling. But see, here's the point.
[2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:19.600]  Years ago, feminists were saying it is unfair to women that men can get all of these athletic scholarships and get their college educations paid for because of their athletic prowess.
[2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:29.600]  Why can't the women? So now the women have that right and then you're getting some males who get to put on bras and wear wigs and they get the claim to be girls.
[2:31:29.600 --> 2:31:33.600]  So what is the plan behind it? Is all the big corporations are behind it? I want to get your take, Judge Miller.
[2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:48.600]  What to take is, is this part of this program to destroy the traditional nuclear family and dismantle cisgender privilege, meaning heterosexual privilege in the family.
[2:31:48.600 --> 2:31:54.600]  Exactly. Larry, what's your view on this?
[2:31:54.600 --> 2:32:03.600]  Very much with what Brother Joe said, but let me take this one step further. The ultimate plan is to destroy the Republic.
[2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:17.600]  Let's be crystal clear about that. If you destroy the family, if you destroy the traditional slash nuclear family, in essence, what you are actually doing is destroying the Republic.
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:27.600]  And don't think for one moment that these misleaders out there do not know that. They know that. They know precisely what they're doing.
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:34.600]  And that's their end game to destroy the Republic. This must not be allowed.
[2:32:34.600 --> 2:32:42.600]  See, there's nothing wrong with gay people doing whatever they want to do sexual. There's nothing wrong with that. That's their business.
[2:32:42.600 --> 2:33:01.600]  But when you start getting people talking about prosecuting congressmen for daring to question an American political procedure, when that, by the way, is number one or number one or two on the list of typical topics throughout American politics, that's crazy.
[2:33:01.600 --> 2:33:12.600]  Well, I mean, people that criticize trying to sterilize little boys in Scotland are beaten. Mothers are being arrested that say, I don't think my five year old should have his genitals cut off.
[2:33:12.600 --> 2:33:14.600]  Oh, yeah. This is a cult.
[2:33:14.600 --> 2:33:22.600]  Yeah, there's something else to going on here. I'm going to be running for mayor in Memphis Shelby County, Tennessee 2023.
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:40.600]  Now in 2012 2008, excuse me, the Justice Department under the Bush administration put up the money to replace every single election machine in the county because it was declared that they were corrupt.
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:50.600]  There could be no fair election because since 2000, every so called election was a rig selection.
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:34:00.600]  Now, they finally got around under the Trump administration to threatening to sue the county commissioners if they did not spend the money.
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  So they bought brand new machines, but those machines that they acquired have been in a warehouse and they have continued to use the corrupt machines for the last four election cycles, including the one that this charlatan with the FBI says cannot be questioned.
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:24.600]  And he's saying if you question, you're exactly Larry, we can see what they're doing here. How do we counter that?
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:42.600]  So how do they contrast this thing that machines that the Justice Department under Bush and Obama and Trump have declared to be corrupted and incapable of conducting a fair election, but yet were used for the last election cycle?
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:51.600]  How can they declare in the 14th largest city in the United States that there was a fair election? No question about it.
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:35:04.600]  When those very same corrupted machines that the administration, the current chief executive was part of, the Obama administration, that administration declared those machines.
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:12.600]  So let me ask you about first layer of the new judge. How do you counter something like this then? I mean, how do we respond this Larry?
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:23.600]  I respond to it and I suggest that more of us respond to it by indicating that the system itself as it is being perpetuated.
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:46.600]  The system itself is a farce. We're not even talking about fair or just or unfair. We should be. But it's a farce. It's set up and we need to make that clear to all of our brothers and sisters for taking in, I call it, a Stalinist process.
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:36:00.600]  You remember Joseph Stalin said, show me the man and I'll show you the crime. All right. This is precisely what we're dealing with with these neoliberal fascist so called Democrats.
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:16.600]  Right. We need to constantly expose it. We need to constantly, you know, we have no media. We have a propaganda machine that would make Goebbels of the Third Reich green with envy.
[2:36:16.600 --> 2:36:34.600]  All right. We need to face this reality, start talking with each other, working with each other and making sure, making sure that we understand who our enemy is. Why are they our enemies? What are they doing to us?
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:48.600]  Everyday ordinary people. I don't give a damn about your color. Everyday ordinary people. Once the people get that, and it doesn't take long, they do rise up.
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:37:09.600]  I agree. We got to go to break the judge just in general. What are solutions? Just not going along, speaking up. What do we do? We speak out. The American people has to form a massive consensus that irrespective of the political party that you belong to, irrespective of the particular slant you may or may not take on something.
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:21.600]  This is intolerable. No one is supposed to be in a position to threaten us and our representatives for speaking out and questioning what's going on.
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.600]  That got you really hot. That was an hour and a half ago.
[2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:41.600]  That got me angry. See, I see and have seen the danger inherent in this kind of thing. Most people don't pay any attention. So what? No, it doesn't work that way. It does not work that way because you see it's one step, two steps, three steps.
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:47.600]  And before long, those little one step at a time adventures have taken up a mile.
[2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:54.600]  And now they're making big jumps. Yeah, we'll be right back.
[2:38:17.600 --> 2:38:24.600]  They're really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership.
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:40.600]  Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us. You support M4SWARE.com. You get Ray Prostate at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:50.600]  That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at M4SWARE.com.
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:21.600]  Pharmaceuticals were then made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew. It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:27.600]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:41.600]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:51.600]  Go to M4SWARE.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune Support Pack, now 40% off.
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:40:01.600]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:07.600]  I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:40:07.600 --> 2:40:12.600]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:17.600]  But let's just say this. We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:24.600]  So please pray for us and please buy the products. And then M4SWARE.com, they're great products. Plus they fund the operation.
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:29.600]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:35.600]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.600]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:47.600]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:51.600]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:58.600]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tents.
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  Cities is homeless and they use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:10.600]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:15.600]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:18.600]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse.
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:24.600]  The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes. They are separate from us.
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:27.600]  Their children go to private tutors. They admit this.
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:35.600]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:41.600]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:47.600]  This is all their admitted plan. The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone operational.
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.600]  Suppose human future. You better find out about it right now.
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:57.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:09.600]  Welcome back.
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:13.600]  Final segment with Larry Pinckney. We're going to do one more segment with the judge and he's got to go back to Tennessee.
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:22.600]  Larry Pinckney has visited us. I've been interviewing him for 16-17 years. I listened to him at dinner for 5 hours, just like you last night for almost 3.
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:29.600]  This knowledge, you've got all of us. We're not just saying this. We know Larry's been there. You've been there.
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:34.600]  I've been researching and I've experienced it. Nothing that you guys love. This is a real takeover.
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:38.600]  You guys aren't just saying this. We're in a lot of danger right now.
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:45.600]  Yes. See, I was in a BSU back in the 60s. I was the community liaison for UCLA's BSU.
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:59.600]  And I know that myself and other activists, we got hauled in every few weeks by the FBI and interrogated because we said something as simple as black folk need to have equal rights in this country that are actualized.
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:13.600]  And that the student experience should be the same for everybody, but that was grounds for you being hauled in and driven 28 miles downtown LA and they took your money and you didn't have cell phones in.
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:18.600]  There was no way to get back home. You'd have to hitchhike to get your car 28 miles away.
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:22.600]  Wow. I mean, that was not right.
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  They locked Larry up for his political crimes, doing nothing. I've read your story, but pickings tell the judge what they did to you.
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:41.600]  Well, I was quite clearly a target of coin tell pro the counterintelligence program. They don't even try to deny that.
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:53.600]  I didn't mean to interrupt you in the famous congressional hearings later on code upro. He's a key person saying he's effective unifying black, white and others together. We want him to tell folks to quote.
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:44:07.600]  Well, he said that I needed the rather the FBI said that he needs to be neutralized because of his demonstrated ability to unify black and white. They said it. I didn't say it.
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:21.600]  I've got a copy of 302 saying that. See, this is one of the games they play. They talk about being all inclusive in there for everybody's rights, but they do not want everybody to get together and unify because that's too powerful.
[2:44:21.600 --> 2:44:24.600]  They want to keep everybody separate, divide and calm.
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:27.600]  Well, look at all this political correctness. It's making everybody hate each other.
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:46.600]  Yes. I mean, good Lord, you're supposed to be doing something to make humans or American humans more peaceful, but you do everything you can to make it worse. You destroy masculinity, but masculinity keeps down this public violence we see so much of now.
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:53.600]  So you throw something out there as a solution that makes the problem worse and you won't be rational in life.
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:45:00.600]  That's right. Masculinity is not criminality. You explained that that what a really masculine person keeps the peace isn't violent.
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:11.600]  Yeah, you're about public peace, dignity and order, making where you live a better, safer, more secure place filled with prosperity, sense of purpose, morality and ethics.
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  You enforce order in your community, but you can be brave and courageous when necessary. That's masculinity.
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:30.600]  But these characters want to destroy it. So they've got all of these boys that are turned into emotional wrecks who are propagandized as to the validity of purely emotional reactions to anything.
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  So they go out and they kill because they're frustrated and they've been told that's OK.
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:39.600]  That's why we're having so much violence out there right now.
[2:45:39.600 --> 2:45:47.600]  We had two whole years of this kind of thing out there empowering these idiots who don't know how to control themselves.
[2:45:47.600 --> 2:45:52.600]  Well, and a lockdown means a lot of these people are living with their parents. Now there's no money. Crimes are to go up, too.
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:46:02.600]  Yeah, exactly. That's all of it. See, it mixes in. Penitentiary systems no longer about controlling crime. It's about controlling surplus labor.
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:09.600]  But yet you have just the total lack of control over the border. And then you get...
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:13.600]  Well, in Europe as an American, we can't fly to Europe now.
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:18.600]  But Soros can have boats untested just coming in. The point is, it's all fraud.
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  Larry, I appreciate you coming all day between me and the judge. You've gotten some words in reds wise. They've all been powerful.
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.600]  What else do you want to impart to us? Because you're always a humble guy.
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:30.600]  But I've seen you give long speeches. They're amazing. And you've been a big guest on the show.
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  What else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  I want to say to the viewers and listeners to continue to support and to redouble and intensify your support for Info Wars and all of our brothers and sisters there.
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  I also want to say that what we are dealing with are political parasite pimping the pain of the people.
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  I repeat, political parasite pimping the pain of the people. They are turning up down and down up.
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:15.600]  This we must not tolerate. And you know what? It's way more of us, conscious thinking, critically thinking people than of them.
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:25.600]  But they would never have us know that. So I want to express my love as I always try to do to all of my brothers and sisters out there, of all colors.
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  And I want to say, carry on. Our Luto Continua.
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:39.600]  The struggle continues and it intensifies now, today, more than ever. Thank you so much.
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:46.600]  I was trying to get you off right now. We've got a few minutes left. But thank you for giving us that great parting word.
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:51.600]  What can you say to the people out there that are giving up?
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  Because a lot of people are getting mad. A lot of people are waking up.
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:59.600]  And some people have been awake a long time. They're really giving up and getting really depressed about watching this conscious evil.
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:01.600]  And they don't see why other people haven't woken up.
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:05.600]  And I tell those folks, it takes time just because you've been awake a long time.
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:09.600]  People are waking up quicker and quicker. You just cannot. People do not need to be down.
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:11.600]  We don't need suicide to go up, which has happened.
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:15.600]  We need people. How do we deal with all this evil and not get depressed ourselves?
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:20.600]  Because you've been persecuted a lot. You're a guy that's really, you know, got a lot of energy and you're not being defeated.
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  You're overcoming. So how do we overcome this evil and not let it dominate us?
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  We need to remind ourselves and each other that this is a protracted struggle.
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:38.600]  All right? Things don't happen. Stop believing what this propaganda media says.
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:40.600]  Things don't happen overnight. All right?
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:52.600]  And I think it was you and the judge were talking about how step by step by step by step, these globalists, these neoliberal fascists, okay, have been devouring us.
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:55.600]  But they did it step by step over a period of years.
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:05.600]  But you know what? We have to, I totally get it when people say, damn, why can't so-and-so see it?
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:12.600]  Well, maybe so-and-so does see it, but it takes time. And I don't mean another 10 years.
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:18.600]  Give them a couple of weeks, a couple of months, six months, whatever. Keep working on them, okay?
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:26.600]  Never, ever give up. Intensify. Don't give up. That's what they want us to do. They want us to think we are alone.
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:36.600]  Exactly. We've come so far. I mean, I think all these attacks we've seen is a sign of weakness by this whole global corrupt anti-human system that has no chivalry, no rules.
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:39.600]  Larry Pickney, God bless you, my friend. Thank you so much.
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:43.600]  Much love to you, Alex. Much love to you, judge. All power to the people.
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:48.600]  By the way, Larry Pickney hosts a weekly podcast with Darren McBreen that is at Band.Video. It's very, very popular.
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:54.600]  Find Larry Pickney's channel at Band.Video. Thank you so much, Larry Pickney.
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:50:00.600]  Judge, I see you're listening to him. What are your ideas about overcoming this system?
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:04.600]  Because I really see the corrupt elements of the system are in trouble.
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:10.600]  That's why I'm trying to bring down the whole system that the people benefit from to try to have some crisis where they control us.
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:17.600]  You see, the people that invented this kind of propaganda said the implacable enemy of what they're doing is the truth.
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:23.600]  You see, the truth has a logic to it that the lie does not have.
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:29.600]  One problem we're having is mainstream media is not listened to like it used to be.
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:38.600]  So a lot of people aren't even aware of these things going on, but some people do focus on every word of the entertainment rather than news that they do.
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:41.600]  And that's where the propaganda is, the comedy shows.
[2:50:41.600 --> 2:50:47.600]  And then, see, they spread it at cocktail parties, so they hear it from their friends and they assume it's true.
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:53.600]  So we have to get stuff out there for the select few who do have minds.
[2:50:53.600 --> 2:50:58.600]  That sounds simple, but that's the answer. We've got it as human intelligence on the grounds where the war is.
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:05.600]  That's it. We've got to get the word out there so people who do listen, who do search out the truth can spread it and say,
[2:51:05.600 --> 2:51:14.600]  no, that's not what's going on. But just this idea of being able to prosecute somebody who is a member of Congress for daring to have a question.
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:20.600]  And that question is one that's been asked over and over for 240 years of this country's history.
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:34.600]  And to say that they should be prosecuted and then turn the CIA into an instrument of domestic oppression, somebody has lost their mind and somebody needs to introduce a resolution to remove this vote.
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:39.600]  On a scale of one to ten, theoretically, not they're actually carrying it out, but they're trying.
[2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:42.600]  Theoretically, they're putting on the drawing board a tin of tyranny, right?
[2:51:42.600 --> 2:51:48.600]  Exactly. And see, the bad part about it is if they say it often enough, somebody's going to think it's true.
[2:51:48.600 --> 2:51:50.600]  That's what you said, is they're conditioning us.
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:51.600]  They're conditioning.
[2:51:51.600 --> 2:51:54.600]  So we've got to fight. You said during the break, so we've got to fight it.
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:52:02.600]  Three weeks from now, people will start taking that as it's already been proven that they're trying to do something to subvert the government
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:08.600]  by questioning this election so they need to be in jail because they're on America.
[2:52:08.600 --> 2:52:09.600]  See, that's the way it was.
[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:13.600]  Sure. And these agencies, the CIA, FBI have a talking point.
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:15.600]  He's not the only one doing it, saying let's arrest Congress.
[2:52:15.600 --> 2:52:19.600]  I mean, let's investigate them and if we can indict them, they should be arrested.
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:22.600]  I mean, having bureaucracies want to arrest Congress.
[2:52:22.600 --> 2:52:29.600]  Yeah. See, you've got an agency, the CIA, that made James Bond's bunch, MI6, the KGB.
[2:52:29.600 --> 2:52:36.600]  They beat the KGB, so you want to turn these folks loose inside the United States of America and see what happens.
[2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:40.600]  Well, the right-back judge, back in two minutes.
[2:52:40.600 --> 2:52:47.600]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:53.600]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:52:53.600 --> 2:53:01.600]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:07.600]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:10.600]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:16.600]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.

[2:54:51.600 --> 2:54:59.600]  I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart.
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:06.600]  Well Judge Joe Brown is an impressive guest and really fun to hang out with and eat a steak with and drink a glass of wine.
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:12.600]  We've got five minutes left and then I'm going to hit a few final stories and Joe's lumpy is going to take over and hopefully you'll be back with us again.
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  But there's a lot of points. The point behind the scenes, this guy knows everything.
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:19.600]  He knows a lot on air too, but behind the scenes this is off record, that's off record.
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:23.600]  But you've seen a lot my friend, you've got real wisdom and a great way of explaining it.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:26.600]  What other points in the four or five minutes we have left would you like to get out there?
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:30.600]  You've got to startle me with this revelation of what the FBI is doing.
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:34.600]  But you have to take it into context of what we've got on the plate.
[2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:43.600]  During the Obama administration there was an American citizen born actually in Detroit who was trying to save his born in Detroit son.
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  They filed a petition for an injunction against the Obama administration that had adopted the policy that it's okay if the American president without due process of law determines that somebody is a threat against the government.
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  He may order them killed.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:17.600]  So the federal court was astonished when it learned that the government was taking the position that the president could order that American citizens killing for basically doing nothing that he was subject to criminal prosecutional.
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:39.600]  And the court actually enjoying the Obama administration from anything further until it had been briefed, but that administration went ahead and killed him by drone about four weeks later and then killed his 16-year-old son for good measure four and a half hours after he had killed him.
[2:56:39.600 --> 2:56:45.600]  And that's the key, they're taking that decision and extrapolating it down to the American people and Congress.
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:57:03.600]  Yeah, now that gets freaky when there is a president from one administration saying the president of the United States can order the killing of another American citizen for something that's not breaking the law if that president thinks that person.
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:07.600]  And now they're building that bridge into Congress members.
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:23.600]  Yes. So when you put all this together, we better look out because it's getting out of hand. It's time to put down the basketball, baseball, football, housewives and all that other stuff in the sitcoms and start paying attention to what's going on.
[2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:27.600]  This is how it slipped up on some other people 80-some years ago.
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:29.600]  Exactly. You can lose it real quick like this.
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:33.600]  Yes, you can in weeks.
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:35.600]  And they're making a move on us.
[2:57:35.600 --> 2:57:39.600]  They are. See, it's oppression.
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  What happens through social media just looks all well, they're private. Yeah, but that isn't how it works. You're not supposed to oppress people in this country for simply stating ideas.
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:56.600]  And shutting somebody's speech down is a serious oppression.
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:58:04.600]  Exactly. It's not how you say it. It's just the thought, the concept. It's not profane language. That's okay.
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:10.600]  You can say it at the elementary school kids, all of the every nasty words you can think of, you can say it at the elementary school kids.
[2:58:10.600 --> 2:58:12.600]  But just don't question the election.
[2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:18.600]  Well, just don't come up with any critical analysis of thought that people might listen to.
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  That's right.
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:22.600]  Exactly. It's not bad speech or evil speech.
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:24.600]  It's popular speech.
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:27.600]  Let me say this. Those two individuals you had up there.
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:40.600]  I had the the communist barrier and Stalin. I actually had the experience of having taken a course from a woman who was a visiting Soviet professor from the University of Moscow.
[2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:46.600]  This was back in the 60s. The course was called the Soviet spirit of influence and world politics.
[2:58:46.600 --> 2:58:50.600]  And hold on. This is too big. I had one more segment, but I'll just have to do it tomorrow.
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:59.600]  Stay there. 60 seconds, judge. Come back. Start over and tell the story. You're going to tell it on air. Now you're going to tell it of just how important this is because this guy's been around.
[2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:06.600]  And then Joe Salante is going to be taken over. We'll be right back. And judge, by the way, give people the best website for people to find you.
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:13.600]  Okay. You can find me at Judge Joe Brown TV and I do not have a blue check. That's on Twitter.
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:16.600]  You can find me at Judge Joe Brown on parlor.
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:33.600]  I do have the red P. You can find me on Fridays with Valerie Denise Jones on our podcast thing that is syndicated on I heart radio and another bunch of outlets and that point is you're kicking ass week.
[2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:36.600]  Yes. And we do other things too.
[2:59:36.600 --> 2:59:46.600]  Ron Herd in Memphis. Would we all be the real Dana? So we've got to stay there. We're back in 60 seconds with this big production story.
[3:00:06.600 --> 3:00:24.600]  This is a false famous land system of constant bombardment of propaganda and drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:31.600]  The bottom line is they want to play God. They are playing God. And the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:38.600]  So many other people want to be positive. They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the world order.
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:45.600]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population. It's all about world government. It's all about the end of human system as we know it.
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:01:06.600]  And on its ashes, a nightmare being built. Only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:01:06.600 --> 3:01:15.600]  Judge Joe Brown just looked at me and he said, you know what changed from the 80s until now? People became afraid. I said, well, tell them what you mean.
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:18.600]  It was a great statement. Please repeat that.
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  It's okay to be afraid. You don't have to be brave. And that's not the American way after all. Isn't it the land of the free and the home of the...
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:42.600]  Well, see, being free is not safe. It's dangerous. And if you're too afraid to put it on the line to maintain your personal freedom, your individual freedom and liberty, you don't deserve to be free.
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:48.600]  That's what Kanye West basically said. He said, I make the decision to be free. That's a decision. I went, what do you mean? You can't decide to be free.
[3:01:48.600 --> 3:01:59.600]  And he said, that is exactly right. We need more of that. But you see, you notice they've attacked him because he has nerve, the temerity to come out and say something like that.
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:02.600]  What they really meant was being free and safe. He didn't say that.
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:10.600]  Yeah. But you see, those two individuals, we looked at barrier and style it.
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  That's right. Put those back up. They put those up not knowing that you've been given...
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:28.600]  This man here, barrier. He was head of the secret police for the Soviet Union during World War II and after. He even became Stalin's replacement until he got assassinated.
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:35.600]  This man, Joe Stalin, the woman that I had this course from, had only those two to answer to.
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  He had been the highest ranking woman on the Soviet Politburo. She had been Khrushchev's deputy chief commissar during the Stalingrad seat.
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:55.600]  She was a hero of the Soviet Union and she was teaching a course called the Soviet spirit of influence and world politics as a visiting professor from the University of Moscow.
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:03:16.600]  She said America is in grave danger of becoming a fascist country, not from some jackbooted, goose-stepping thugs, but from some, she called them, beatnik hippies who in good conscience would impose the worst sort of tyranny on other people to protect them from being a free people.
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  Wow. She really was telling the future.
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:30.600]  Yeah, it was some other stuff too she did. She showed me some translated documents and stuff like that and I read them and over the years they came through.
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:48.600]  And there was one other thing that was a translated document from Lenin. It was written in 1917 and he said Russia cannot become a free people with a democracy until there are no significant numbers of Russians with a living memory of their enslavement under the czar.
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:59.600]  So he laid out a plan on getting people to think for themselves, to think critically, and he apologized for the need for propaganda to get them to thinking positively.
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:17.600]  And he made a distinction in that and she used to about saying stuff that is essentially propaganda that encourages people to be intelligent, to be inquisitive, rational, logical and reasonable and talked about the dangers inherent when you try to do that versus the dangers.
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:24.600]  Versus the dangers that are just spread out all in there when you try to get people to stop thinking.
[3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:26.600]  And instead our system wants us not to think.
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:32.600]  Not to think. In other words, for God's sake, do not think. See, school, I remember when I was in school.
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:36.600]  Mr. Brown, what do you think about what we had last night on our assignment?
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:37.600]  Oh, Mr. Brown.
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:40.600]  Everything was about what is having debate. Now you're not supposed to have a debate.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:49.600]  No, the professor lectures and it's crazy and I told you about this experience and this is when I'm just going to end it.
[3:04:49.600 --> 3:05:02.600]  I audited this class at Memphis State University in Memphis and his professor in his political science class was pontificating about what this judge meant when he wrote this opinion about a certain matter.
[3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:13.600]  I'm the judge who wrote it. So he is pontificating about what I meant, but he didn't know I was sitting in there. So I held man up and said, well, aren't you a little, I said, yeah, I'm a little old, but I'm auditing.
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:18.600]  And I said, I don't think that's what the judge meant. So he was trying to tell me I was a fool and didn't know what I was reading.
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:23.600]  I said, oh, by the way, read the name of the person I looked down on your seating chart and see who's talking to you.
[3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:29.600]  I said, now you see how big a fool you are trying to tell me what I was thinking, what I wrote that, you know.
[3:05:29.600 --> 3:05:31.600]  Okay, fine. See, stuff like that.
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:33.600]  That's a small world. Yeah.
[3:05:33.600 --> 3:05:48.600]  Yeah. See, but there's a danger that because when you give somebody a forum and they look like authority, we've been so used to following the leader behind stuck on stupid that we buy into it that television.
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:05:52.600]  And I think the people that haven't been challenged there, they have become delusional.
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:54.600]  Yes, because they're not being challenged.
[3:05:54.600 --> 3:06:00.600]  Yes, indeed. In other words, somebody's told you that's the truth and nobody's offered a counter to say, well, it doesn't quite work that way.
[3:06:00.600 --> 3:06:09.600]  Then you go on a lot and oh, I'm doing the right thing. I'm trying to help everybody and it's my obligation to make sure they think right.
[3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:12.600]  That's what you don't want.
[3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:19.600]  I couldn't imagine that form of elitism where you can't have your opinion because I know I'm right. I'm not going to let you have it.
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:31.600]  That's not the American way. American way is to have consensus or reached out. And you can say we've had our problems. But like you said, we've been a lot better in other countries because of at least a little bit of freedom that actually finally got some oxygen here.
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:34.600]  Judge Joe Brown, thank you so much for the time, my friend.
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:36.600]  Yes, sir.
[3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:37.600]  Are you glad you came to Austin?
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:39.600]  I'm glad I came to Austin.
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:47.600]  Had a great meal last night, great conversations and barbecue and a good time here and you've got a great crew works here.
[3:06:47.600 --> 3:06:50.600]  And now you're about to get some, we got you some pizza for lunch.
[3:06:50.600 --> 3:07:02.600]  Yeah, and I like one thing about your crew. Everybody from assistance to everybody freely comes up and gives you stuff that they just looked up online to back up what's being.
[3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:04.600]  Oh yeah, everybody. It's all yeah.
[3:07:04.600 --> 3:07:13.600]  That's great. That's great spirit. That's not what you find in Hollywood. How dare you come up here and think you have some idea, you know, like come on guys.
[3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:18.600]  I've had mainstream media. They get really freaked out by the decentralization that scares them because they're all told exactly what to do.
[3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:24.600]  They're told here's your story and I go right here's what you're going to say and I go make it up.
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:29.600]  We're not. We're trying to find the truth. I mean, we have it all. Thank you, Judge Joe Brown.
[3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:32.600]  We're going to air a quick promo. We'll be right back with the girls.
[3:07:32.600 --> 3:07:38.600]  Let's take it over. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:45.600]  Man, come on, man. I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all, man. Come on, man. Which I like. Wake up.
[3:07:45.600 --> 3:07:50.600]  I want people to wake up right now. I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance.
[3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:54.600]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[3:07:54.600 --> 3:07:55.600]  White male!
[3:07:55.600 --> 3:08:00.600]  So, Alex Jones' whole brand is based on the idea. He's giving you the real story, not the fake news out there.
[3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:04.600]  Hey, listen. I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:08.600]  Humanity is awakening. Infowars.com.
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:10.600]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:14.600]  The tyrants did it. Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns.
[3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:20.600]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you're proud to take our firearm.
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:21.600]  Alex Jones.
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:22.600]  Infowars.com.
[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:23.600]  I just don't know who you are.
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  You guys know who he is? You know Alex Jones? That's Infowars?
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:27.600]  Very popular.
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:33.600]  Infowars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:37.600]  We know we're under attack. We know it. We're breaking the conditioning.
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:42.600]  Talking about Alex Jones.
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:43.600]  Infowars.
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:44.600]  Alex Jones.
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:51.600]  That's just level one.
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:52.600]  What's level two?
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:53.600]  I'll tell you.
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:58.600]  The animated contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  You've got to take it in your hands. You've got to have the will to accept the truth,
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:10.600]  fuck the system, and the group collective. Do that, and you'll learn your way to the next one.
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:12.600]  This is the Infowar.
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:25.600]  Jocelyn is coming up in just a few minutes.
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:30.600]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:40.600]  All right. I did not get to one of the big stories.
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:43.600]  They're making people wear barcodes that work at Walgreens.
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  We have the video.
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:46.600]  We'll come on at three o'clock on the war room.
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:47.600]  We'll break it on the war room.

[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:51.600]  And separately, one of our great sponsors.
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:52.600]  We're going to break it up.
[3:09:52.600 --> 3:09:55.600]  Jocelyn, what they take over is Infowarsphone.com.
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:09:58.600]  That's a satellite phone with the best prices you're going to get.
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:01.600]  All the calls that you were free, the phone is free.
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:04.600]  A $600-plus dollar value, all you do is sign up for a year.
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:10.600]  $99.95 a month for your 150 minutes to call out in an emergency.
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:11.600]  All calls to it are free.
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:13.600]  Cell phones are all tracked and controlled.
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:17.600]  In the crazy world we live in, everybody needs one of these at their house or in their car.
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:19.600]  And these are a great gift to give families as well.
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:22.600]  Infowarsphone.com.
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:23.600]  And it works anywhere.
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:24.600]  You can see the sky.

[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:33.600]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020.
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:36.600]  And ask for the Alex Jones special, the free phone.
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:37.600]  All right.
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:39.600]  Infowarsphone.com.
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:44.600]  Don't forget we've got our new specials on the multi-vitamin Infowars store as well.
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:48.600]  Jocelyn, what they take over?
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:54.600]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:11:00.600]  making you play the part of a victim until you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God.
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:04.600]  And the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:10.600]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:12.600]  an entire system.
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:18.600]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset,
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:21.600]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband,
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:25.600]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:29.600]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:33.600]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:35.600]  So don't worship the globalist.
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:36.600]  Don't worship the NFL.
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:38.600]  Don't worship all the things in the system.
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:41.600]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:43.600]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:47.600]  And appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:11:47.600 --> 3:11:49.600]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:53.600]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity,
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:56.600]  I've been forced to last 27 years to be a public figure.
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:00.600]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:03.600]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:04.600]  but just give me a break.
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:06.600]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:10.600]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:11.600]  And I get it.
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:13.600]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:17.600]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:18.600]  And I get it, me too.
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:26.600]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential.
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:31.600]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:33.600]  And so that's what M4 Wars is really all about.
[3:12:33.600 --> 3:12:35.600]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:37.600]  Thank you for spreading the word about M4 Wars.
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:41.600]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting M4WarsTour.com.
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:45.600]  Because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:13:11.600]  So thank you for the support M4WarsTour.com.
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:17.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:25.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  Hey, great to be 90.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:27.600]  Alex Jones Show.
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:31.600]  That judge was right on for so many things.
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:35.600]  And one of them is what a great show info was is.
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:38.600]  And what a staff that he has over there.
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:41.600]  I mean, I've been on Oprah, the Today's Show.
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  Good morning, America.
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:43.600]  You name it.
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:44.600]  I've been on it.
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:50.600]  And the staff of info was it's and the production with Alex Jones.
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  It's the top of the top.
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:58.600]  And that that advertisement, though a promo they got about info was and all the people,
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:14:04.600]  those stars, those prostitutes talking about Alex Jones, really well done.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  So it's great being on.
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:10.600]  And the other thing that he mentioned was about freedom.
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:12.600]  And it's been stolen from us.
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:16.600]  There's no question about it.
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:22.600]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been destroyed.
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:29.600]  We have these little dictators saying they have executive orders.
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:32.600]  And they told us what to do to fight the COVID war.
[3:14:32.600 --> 3:14:39.600]  And that's what they called it, the COVID war when it began in 2020, January.
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:41.600]  Chinese Lunar New Year.
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:46.600]  Have a Lunatic New Year.
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  We're going to war.
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:48.600]  We're going to war.
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:53.600]  Just as he mentioned, you know, talking about Stalin and communism, just as the people
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:15:01.600]  marched off to Heil Hitler, salute Stalin, march to Mussolini and believe a little daddy's
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:08.600]  boy born on third base and thought he had a home run, a little clown of a boy.
[3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:12.600]  Well, the young people, there used to be a thing called Mad Magazine and they had Alfred
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:13.600]  Newman.
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  Yeah, he later came out as George W. Bush, taking us to the Afghan war.
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:21.600]  Oh, did a great job, guys.
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:26.600]  Oh, it's only the longest war in American history, almost 20 years.
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:27.600]  And you lost it.
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:32.600]  But it cost us between the Iraq war, based on lies that Saddam Hussein and weapons of
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:35.600]  mass destruction ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:42.600]  Only think about like three, six trillion dollars when you had it all up.
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:47.600]  And then the Obama wars, you know, I want that guy Gaddafi added.
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:49.600]  I want that guy is sought out.
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:51.600]  I'm going to do the Afghan troops.
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:53.600]  Yeah, we're going to show.
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:54.600]  Yeah, there he is.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:55.600]  Little daddy's boy.
[3:15:55.600 --> 3:15:58.600]  How can anybody believe that ignorant piece of crap?
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:04.600]  And both of them, they press Scott Bush, the old, the granddaddy before, you know, it was
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:06.600]  sold stuff to Hitler.
[3:16:06.600 --> 3:16:11.600]  These are the people that are running and ruining our lives.
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:14.600]  I started a new movement.
[3:16:14.600 --> 3:16:21.600]  It's called the United Church or the Universal Church for freedom, peace and justice.
[3:16:21.600 --> 3:16:22.600]  That's right.
[3:16:22.600 --> 3:16:24.600]  We're going to be launching it soon.
[3:16:24.600 --> 3:16:25.600]  It's all done.
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:28.600]  It's been approved.
[3:16:28.600 --> 3:16:35.600]  A universal church of freedom, peace and justice, not these low life political pieces of crap
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:39.600]  telling us what to do.
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:44.600]  Arrogant, lying little boys and girls, you got to be equal.
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:45.600]  Look what they did.
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:49.600]  Again, they called us to COVID war.
[3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:51.600]  Did a great job in the Korean war.
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:53.600]  Hey, how about that Vietnam war?
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:55.600]  We could have did better, but we couldn't.
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:16:56.600]  They stopped us from killing.
[3:16:56.600 --> 3:17:01.600]  We only killed 20 million Vietnamese and we sprayed the whole place with Agent Orange.
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:04.600]  We could have did better.
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:14.600]  And then how about the Iraq wars and the Afghan war?
[3:17:14.600 --> 3:17:20.600]  The war against Syria, the war against Lebanon.
[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:23.600]  They haven't won a war.
[3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:26.600]  Excuse me, Libya, not Lebanon.
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:27.600]  Gaddafi has to go.
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:30.600]  It was the richest country in Africa.
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:34.600]  People had more benefits there than a lot of places in Europe.
[3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:35.600]  Gone.
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:43.600]  They haven't won a war and they lost the COVID war.
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:45.600]  They're lying little freaks.
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:50.600]  They've gone through the facts and start with the top one of the top freaks.
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:58.600]  An arrogant boy, Fauci, the fraud.
[3:17:58.600 --> 3:18:01.600]  His emails came out.
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:07.600]  He's telling Obama's former Health and Human Services Director,
[3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:11.600]  don't wear a mask when you go to the airport.
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:15.600]  Why?
[3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:19.600]  And drug stores are ineffective.
[3:18:19.600 --> 3:18:27.600]  And on CBS News, he also said the same thing.
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:29.600]  Don't wear a mask.
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  And that little scum masks up and freaks everybody out with his arrogance.
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.600]  Here, here's the box of the crap that everybody wears, these things.
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:47.600]  Not everybody, but a lot of people.
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:50.600]  Here's the box.
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:57.600]  I've done this a number of times, but this mask does not eliminate exposure
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:01.600]  to the risk of any disease or infection.
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:07.600]  But wear one because I'm the low life piece of scum crap governor.
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:09.600]  They'll tell you what to do.
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:15.600]  Like we got over here little daddy's boy Cuomo, little nothing of a clown
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:20.600]  of a gutless character over there in Jersey, mercy.
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:23.600]  Fat mouth Lamont over here in Connecticut.
[3:19:23.600 --> 3:19:25.600]  Yeah, that arrogant little clown.
[3:19:25.600 --> 3:19:28.600]  You know what he did?
[3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:31.600]  Last year, I told people to stay home and stay safe.
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:33.600]  Now I'm telling you to go out.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:36.600]  You're telling me to stay home and stay safe.
[3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:38.600]  You piece of crap.
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:40.600]  Call me a piece of crap.
[3:19:40.600 --> 3:19:44.600]  I suck my way up to become governor.
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:50.600]  You're a piece of crap because you're a rotten little lion's scum.
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:55.600]  Well, you're too stupid to know the facts.
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:58.600]  What facts you're talking about, so lengthy?
[3:19:58.600 --> 3:20:05.600]  Oh, the facts that are right here in the trends journal.
[3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:07.600]  Got it?
[3:20:07.600 --> 3:20:09.600]  This is one.
[3:20:09.600 --> 3:20:11.600]  This is this week's.
[3:20:11.600 --> 3:20:12.600]  That's how big it is.
[3:20:12.600 --> 3:20:15.600]  It's like a small book.
[3:20:15.600 --> 3:20:18.600]  It's like a book, 30,000 words.
[3:20:18.600 --> 3:20:20.600]  You take whatever you want is a table of contents.
[3:20:20.600 --> 3:20:23.600]  You break it all down.
[3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:26.600]  The numbers are there.
[3:20:26.600 --> 3:20:32.600]  Less than 1% of the people get the virus being outdoors.
[3:20:32.600 --> 3:20:35.600]  Less than 1% and you got a crap head like this.
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:37.600]  Stay home and stay safe.
[3:20:37.600 --> 3:20:39.600]  How about go screw yourself?
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:41.600]  And it's all over the world.
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:45.600]  You got, look at what's going on over there in Australia.
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:49.600]  Little boy Marlino, acting premier.
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:20:51.600]  The word premier is a curse word.
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:52.600]  You're not a premier.
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:54.600]  You're a piece of crap.
[3:20:54.600 --> 3:20:58.600]  A little political scum.
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:01.600]  One person has died in all of Australia
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:03.600]  at a 25 million people in six months
[3:21:03.600 --> 3:21:06.600]  and they locked down Melbourne and parts of Victoria
[3:21:06.600 --> 3:21:08.600]  and you can't travel back and forth.
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:13.600]  Because they had false positives on cases that never existed.
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:15.600]  And they took your guns away from you.
[3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:17.600]  Down under over in Australia.
[3:21:17.600 --> 3:21:22.600]  You've gone down under all right.
[3:21:22.600 --> 3:21:24.600]  Freedom.
[3:21:24.600 --> 3:21:26.600]  It's the only way that we'll win.
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:30.600]  And by the way, I'm having another festival on July 4th here
[3:21:30.600 --> 3:21:31.600]  in Kingston.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:34.600]  We'll be announcing it soon starting at 2 o'clock
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:36.600]  on John and Crown Street.
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:39.600]  A great crowd on Memorial Day weekend.
[3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:41.600]  We'll be back.
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:46.600]  The rally is out soon.
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:49.600]  You know, listeners calling to the show and they thank me
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:53.600]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:55.600]  and I beg you for support constantly.
[3:21:55.600 --> 3:21:59.600]  For prayer, for financial support and for word of mouth
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:01.600]  and then we're all in this together.
[3:22:01.600 --> 3:22:03.600]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:05.600]  hey, I got great products, please buy them
[3:22:05.600 --> 3:22:06.600]  or we won't be here on air.
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:07.600]  But it's true.
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:09.600]  We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:22:09.600 --> 3:22:11.600]  that promotes liberty at this level
[3:22:11.600 --> 3:22:13.600]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:15.600]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:18.600]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[3:22:18.600 --> 3:22:21.600]  and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:23.600]  our credibility is going up.
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:25.600]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:27.600]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:29.600]  We have all these other nations enslaved
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:31.600]  and America is still quasi free.
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:33.600]  You can't have info wars has been proven right
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:36.600]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:38.600]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:41.600]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:44.600]  supplements and so much more.
[3:22:44.600 --> 3:22:46.600]  They're wonderful products and they support the info.
[3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:47.600]  Thank you.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:52.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:22:55.600]  in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[3:22:55.600 --> 3:23:00.600]  Then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[3:23:00.600 --> 3:23:03.600]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions
[3:23:03.600 --> 3:23:05.600]  of naturally sourced drugs.
[3:23:05.600 --> 3:23:08.600]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:11.600]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[3:23:11.600 --> 3:23:14.600]  And the sicker people got the more their industry grew.
[3:23:14.600 --> 3:23:18.600]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[3:23:18.600 --> 3:23:21.600]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system
[3:23:21.600 --> 3:23:24.600]  which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:28.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[3:23:28.600 --> 3:23:30.600]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:32.600]  and vitamin D3 with calcium
[3:23:32.600 --> 3:23:34.600]  have been proven to be what we need
[3:23:34.600 --> 3:23:37.600]  to maintain a healthy immune system.
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:40.600]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting

[3:23:44.600 --> 3:23:46.600]  Now 40% off.
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:49.600]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat
[3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:52.600]  contaminated water, soil and subsurface material.
[3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:55.600]  By accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions
[3:23:55.600 --> 3:23:57.600]  to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[3:23:57.600 --> 3:23:59.600]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:01.600]  For the first time, the bio-pros
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:03.600]  are bringing to the public market
[3:24:03.600 --> 3:24:05.600]  a suite of bioremediation products
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:07.600]  to the everyday consumer.
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:09.600]  Their first product they are launching is called
[3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:11.600]  Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically designed
[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:13.600]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:16.600]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms,
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:18.600]  not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:24:18.600 --> 3:24:20.600]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:23.600]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:26.600]  and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:24:26.600 --> 3:24:28.600]  than similar microbial products
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:30.600]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:33.600]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:35.600]  and no genetically modified organisms.

[3:24:39.600 --> 3:24:41.600]  That's thebiopros.com.
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:43.600]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:45.600]  and the job it does is unparalleled.
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:47.600]  Thebiopros.com.
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:50.600]  As negative as times are right now
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:53.600]  and as depressing as things can be,
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:56.600]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:24:59.600]  This experience, this life on this planet
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:02.600]  is a reckoning.
[3:25:02.600 --> 3:25:04.600]  It's God giving us a chance
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:06.600]  to work things out with third dimension
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:09.600]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:11.600]  and what level we want to go to.
[3:25:11.600 --> 3:25:13.600]  And it really does come down to that.
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:16.600]  So as fat as things are and as evil as things are,
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:18.600]  look at all the good in the world as well
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:21.600]  and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:24.600]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  God is the author of us having free will.
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.600]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:33.600]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:35.600]  and this whole evil culture in Washington, B.C.
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:38.600]  and Fauci and the mass cult,
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:40.600]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:42.600]  It's all about telling you you're dirty,
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:44.600]  you're ugly, you're in the bad
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:46.600]  and you're making sure you're made in the image of God,
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:26:15.600]  the creator of the universe.
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:21.600]  Excellent.
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:24.600]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.

[3:26:29.600 --> 3:26:32.600]  And boy, Info Wars has really been fighting the war

[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:19.600]  That's something they never talk about, the prostitutes,
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:21.600]  getting in health so you don't get sick.
[3:27:21.600 --> 3:27:23.600]  You've got to take the vaccine instead.
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:27.600]  So ladies and gentlemen, for years Info Wars has been working
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:29.600]  to develop a new line of vitamins.
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:33.600]  But it's taking their time to ensure that they only source

[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:28.600]  when they're selling the COVID war
[3:29:28.600 --> 3:29:31.600]  and those slimmers that destroyed so much of life
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:35.600]  that can't come back, what's been lost has been lost.
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:37.600]  Stay home, stay safe.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:39.600]  How about go screw yourself?
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:43.600]  Stay home, stay safe.

[3:29:58.600 --> 3:30:00.600]  to keep you healthy.
[3:30:00.600 --> 3:30:02.600]  Yeah, the first book I worked on, many, many,
[3:30:02.600 --> 3:30:04.600]  I didn't write it, I worked on it.
[3:30:04.600 --> 3:30:06.600]  It was Natural Healing.
[3:30:06.600 --> 3:30:10.600]  I want a book, big book.
[3:30:10.600 --> 3:30:12.600]  I have an honorary doctorate from the National University
[3:30:12.600 --> 3:30:14.600]  of Health Sciences.
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:17.600]  I had a rally last 4th of July.
[3:30:17.600 --> 3:30:19.600]  Boy, did I get it held for it.
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:21.600]  People hated me for doing it.
[3:30:21.600 --> 3:30:23.600]  I died from the virus.
[3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:25.600]  Yeah.
[3:30:25.600 --> 3:30:30.600]  Everybody that was there died from the virus.
[3:30:30.600 --> 3:30:36.600]  The virus is attacking people with 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:38.600]  That's a CDC fact.
[3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:40.600]  I talked before about Australia.
[3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:42.600]  Google up the data.
[3:30:42.600 --> 3:30:44.600]  Go to the government health department,
[3:30:44.600 --> 3:30:46.600]  Department of Health.
[3:30:46.600 --> 3:30:48.600]  You know what the average age is?
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:50.600]  85.
[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:54.600]  What happens when you get to 86 if you don't die of the virus?
[3:30:54.600 --> 3:30:58.600]  Then you go to day camp and life starts all over again.
[3:30:58.600 --> 3:31:01.600]  You're locking down places when this is who's dying.
[3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:07.600]  Going back to these products is building your immune system.
[3:31:07.600 --> 3:31:13.600]  It's getting strong to stay strong.
[3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:19.600]  Every day I have a routine that I take with vitamin supplements.
[3:31:19.600 --> 3:31:21.600]  But I have big pharma telling me,
[3:31:21.600 --> 3:31:24.600]  no, no, no, you get the vaccination.
[3:31:24.600 --> 3:31:26.600]  Oh, now they're going to come out one with dementia.
[3:31:26.600 --> 3:31:28.600]  Did you see that one?
[3:31:28.600 --> 3:31:30.600]  That has a load of questions.
[3:31:30.600 --> 3:31:35.600]  Maybe you've got to be demented to take it.
[3:31:35.600 --> 3:31:37.600]  Yeah, you approved it.
[3:31:37.600 --> 3:31:44.600]  The FDA, the fraudulent drug commission.
[3:31:44.600 --> 3:31:46.600]  You've heard me say this before.
[3:31:46.600 --> 3:31:48.600]  It's not a revolving door.
[3:31:48.600 --> 3:31:50.600]  It's one big club as George Carlin used to say,
[3:31:50.600 --> 3:31:52.600]  and you ain't in it.
[3:31:52.600 --> 3:31:54.600]  That arrogant Gottlieb boy.
[3:31:54.600 --> 3:31:56.600]  The Gottlieb boy.
[3:31:56.600 --> 3:31:58.600]  Scotty Gottlieb.
[3:31:58.600 --> 3:32:02.600]  Yeah, he was the FDA head under Trump.
[3:32:02.600 --> 3:32:04.600]  You know where he is now?
[3:32:04.600 --> 3:32:06.600]  Sitting on the board of directors of Pfizer.
[3:32:06.600 --> 3:32:07.600]  That's right.
[3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:09.600]  I'm not making that up.
[3:32:09.600 --> 3:32:16.600]  You're going to believe this clown?
[3:32:16.600 --> 3:32:20.600]  No, no, these vitamins aren't good for you.
[3:32:20.600 --> 3:32:22.600]  No, they won't help you.
[3:32:22.600 --> 3:32:24.600]  You need a shot, little boy.
[3:32:24.600 --> 3:32:27.600]  Little boy, Scotty.
[3:32:27.600 --> 3:32:29.600]  You sell out.
[3:32:29.600 --> 3:32:33.600]  How dare you, Pfizer?
[3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:35.600]  Don't call these big pharma.
[3:32:35.600 --> 3:32:37.600]  Call a spade a spade.
[3:32:37.600 --> 3:32:39.600]  They're drug lords.
[3:32:39.600 --> 3:32:41.600]  And now they came out.
[3:32:41.600 --> 3:32:45.600]  Johnson and Johnson CEO came out today and said,
[3:32:45.600 --> 3:32:49.600]  that is Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola.
[3:32:49.600 --> 3:32:52.600]  Yeah, Rachel Levin.
[3:32:52.600 --> 3:32:54.600]  I got that clown telling me about health.
[3:32:54.600 --> 3:32:55.600]  Look at these people.
[3:32:55.600 --> 3:32:56.600]  They're telling me about health.
[3:32:56.600 --> 3:33:02.600]  Lighthead over there went one after another.
[3:33:02.600 --> 3:33:05.600]  Now they're saying, get ready for the other shot.
[3:33:05.600 --> 3:33:06.600]  Come the winter.
[3:33:06.600 --> 3:33:08.600]  So here's the deal.
[3:33:08.600 --> 3:33:11.600]  And when I come back, I'm going to talk about what's going on
[3:33:11.600 --> 3:33:14.600]  in the markets and inflation, because that's really big.
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:16.600]  But this is important.
[3:33:16.600 --> 3:33:20.600]  There's going to be an economic boost.
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:23.600]  There's no question about it.
[3:33:23.600 --> 3:33:26.600]  And it's going to be a big one.
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:35.600]  The COVID war is winding down for now, temporarily.
[3:33:35.600 --> 3:33:39.600]  Next year, they're going to be selling the new variant.
[3:33:39.600 --> 3:33:46.600]  Yeah, COVID war 2.0.
[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:48.600]  Take advantage of what's going on now,
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:53.600]  but be prepared for what's going to happen next.
[3:33:53.600 --> 3:33:55.600]  They're going to loosen up.
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:33:57.600]  No question about it.
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:01.600]  But come the autumn and come the winter,
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:04.600]  they're going to tighten up.
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:08.600]  And one country after another, as you know,
[3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:11.600]  again, it's all in your Trends Journal right here.
[3:34:11.600 --> 3:34:12.600]  TrendsJournal.com.
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:15.600]  History before it happens.
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:17.600]  Want to go to Spain?
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:18.600]  Got to get that shot.
[3:34:18.600 --> 3:34:20.600]  Want to go to France?
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:21.600]  Got to get that shot.
[3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:22.600]  Want to go to Greece?
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:24.600]  Got to get that shot.
[3:34:24.600 --> 3:34:27.600]  And now, just before I came on the air,
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:35.600]  the EU, or is it the F-U-E-U, anyway,
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:39.600]  pushing more and more for the vaccine passport.
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:42.600]  So what are the implications of this?
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:43.600]  Freedom?
[3:34:43.600 --> 3:34:45.600]  Gone.
[3:34:45.600 --> 3:34:46.600]  Beneath, though.
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:48.600]  But we're fighting to bring it back.
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:54.600]  We're fighting to bring it back.
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:34:58.600]  And again, I'm launching a church,
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:03.600]  universal church of freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:07.600]  So there you go, the EU COVID certificate.
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:13.600]  If we don't fight, we're finished.
[3:35:13.600 --> 3:35:16.600]  I want to live heaven on earth.
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:19.600]  I want to believe, oh, when I die, I'll go to heaven.
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:21.600]  I want to make heaven now.
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:26.600]  And I got all these lowlives that sucked the joy out of life.
[3:35:26.600 --> 3:35:30.600]  Arrogant little Andy Daddy Boy Cuomo.
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:34.600]  Mindless Whitmer, witless Whitmer.
[3:35:34.600 --> 3:35:39.600]  Little DeWine, a little Joyk over there in Ohio.
[3:35:39.600 --> 3:35:43.600]  Clown Boy Murphy.
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:47.600]  We'll be right back.
[3:36:14.600 --> 3:36:20.600]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[3:36:20.600 --> 3:36:25.600]  Alpha Power can help lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels,
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:27.600]  support healthy cholesterol, and more.
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:31.600]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:34.600]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:38.600]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.

[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:40.600]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films,
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:46.600]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[3:37:46.600 --> 3:37:48.600]  Thank you so much.
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:52.600]  I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the obnoxious.
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:55.600]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:38:03.600]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:07.600]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it,
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:10.600]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 Franken-Shot.
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:12.600]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:20.600]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the Franken-Shots.
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:23.600]  They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it.
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:26.600]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:29.600]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:32.600]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:34.600]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:38.600]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC,
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:40.600]  the medical staff refuse to take the vaccines.
[3:38:40.600 --> 3:38:45.600]  That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine.
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:48.600]  You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:52.600]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air,
[3:38:52.600 --> 3:38:55.600]  about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist,
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:38:59.600]  that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them,
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:02.600]  that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them,
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:04.600]  that they deserve to be killed.
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:07.600]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists. They play God.
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:11.600]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:15.600]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm you.
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:16.600]  They've tried to get you to join them.
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:20.600]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:22.600]  I'm connection with God.
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:25.600]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:31.600]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:34.600]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:40.600]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:44.600]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:47.600]  is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:59.600]  That's a fact.
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:18.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salante. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:21.600]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:25.600]  And as I said, do what you can to support Info Wars.
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:30.600]  And don't forget, we're having a Fourth of July Festival of Freedom, Peace and Justice.
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:37.600]  Again, in Kingston, New York, starting at 2 o'clock.
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:39.600]  We're going to have great speakers here.
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:45.600]  We already have Gary Null, Patricia Finn, Lynette Zhang.
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:46.600]  That's right.
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:47.600]  And more.
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:49.600]  And great music, great time.
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:57.600]  We have to unite for freedom, peace and justice. We'll be announcing more of it on the occupied peace site.
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:00.600]  And again, it's up to you to keep freedom alive.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:01.600]  It's up to us.
[3:41:01.600 --> 3:41:04.600]  And we can do it.
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:07.600]  I'll show you how weak they are.
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:19.600]  When Obama won back in 2004, no, no, excuse me, what was it, 2008?
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:22.600]  And Cheney, Dick Cheney.
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:23.600]  I've got to be proper.
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:24.600]  I don't want to get censored.
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:26.600]  Penis Cheney.
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:29.600]  He was getting blasted.
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:31.600]  He was down.
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:35.600]  And all of a sudden he started making the rounds on TV.
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:38.600]  And I'm saying to myself, here's this guy going out there defending himself.
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:40.600]  There's nobody defending him.
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:43.600]  That's right.
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:46.600]  You could get these people down.
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:47.600]  You could beat them.
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:54.600]  And you beat them with things that they have no idea about how to win.
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:41:56.600]  Freedom, peace and justice.
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:41:57.600]  You beat them on all those.
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:00.600]  They got, these cats are so tight-met.
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:03.600]  Not an ounce of boogie, not a drop of jive.
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:05.600]  You wipe them out.
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:12.600]  So moving on, I want to talk about the markets.
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:14.600]  The Dow's down again today.
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:19.600]  It's been flat down, flat down, still hovering near Heinz.
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:21.600]  You know why?
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:27.600]  They're waiting for more inflation data and to see what the Fed's going to do.
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:32.600]  So here it is.
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:40.600]  The higher inflation goes, the higher the Fed has to raise interest rates.
[3:42:40.600 --> 3:42:48.600]  The higher interest rates go, the lower the economy falls.
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:52.600]  The entire economy has been built up with cheap money.
[3:42:52.600 --> 3:42:53.600]  Unprecedented.
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:42:56.600]  Not only here, around the world.
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:42:58.600]  European Union, negative rates.
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:01.600]  Japan, negative rates.
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  As we wrote in the Trends Journal two weeks ago, over in Turkey,
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:14.600]  they got that Turkey over there running the show, Erdogan, another power-hungry freak.
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:19.600]  He fired his central bank stuff.
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:22.600]  Third one in two months.
[3:43:22.600 --> 3:43:27.600]  Inflations over 15% in their raising interest rates.
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:31.600]  Because if the money stays cheap and people keep getting all that cheap money,
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:34.600]  inflation keeps getting higher.
[3:43:34.600 --> 3:43:35.600]  Okay.
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:41.600]  Back to the markets.
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:45.600]  If inflation keeps going higher, which we forecast it's going to,
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:49.600]  it's going to have to raise interest rates.
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:53.600]  You know that housing boom that we're in now?
[3:43:53.600 --> 3:44:00.600]  With people outbidding everybody without even looking at the places?
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:01.600]  Over.
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:05.600]  When interest rates go up.
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:09.600]  Commodity prices, they're surging.
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:14.600]  Of course, that's adding to inflation fears.
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:16.600]  Kappa.
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:20.600]  Recently, Kappa hit an all-time high, came down a little bit,
[3:44:20.600 --> 3:44:27.600]  steal 10 lumber to build an average home.
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:32.600]  A new home with lumber, just with just the lumber.
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:35.600]  $36,000 more for the house.
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:39.600]  So the Fed's saying this is only temporary.
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:42.600]  That's a lot of BS.
[3:44:42.600 --> 3:44:44.600]  Will inflation numbers come down?
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:45.600]  Yeah.
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:46.600]  Oh, how about cars?
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:47.600]  Use cars?
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:50.600]  Woo, way up.
[3:44:50.600 --> 3:44:51.600]  Will they go down?
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:53.600]  Yeah.
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:45:00.600]  But how far down they're going to go?
[3:45:00.600 --> 3:45:02.600]  Say they go down 50%.
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:06.600]  They're still up over 150%.
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:09.600]  Goes back to the markets.
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:12.600]  When the Fed raises interest rates,
[3:45:12.600 --> 3:45:18.600]  this thing's going to crash big time.
[3:45:18.600 --> 3:45:21.600]  It's going to go down like we've never seen before,
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:24.600]  and it's going to be into the greatest depression.
[3:45:24.600 --> 3:45:28.600]  We've never seen inflation spikes like these in different categories.
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:32.600]  Oh, take a look at oil prices right now.
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:37.600]  Brent Crude, $72 a barrel.
[3:45:37.600 --> 3:45:44.600]  Go back to March, 2020, was down to next to nothing.
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:51.600]  Is that a 2018 high?
[3:45:51.600 --> 3:45:54.600]  Has been decided since 2018.
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:45:57.600]  Pumping it in your car?
[3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:00.600]  India, China, all the people importing it?
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:03.600]  Prices going up everywhere.
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:07.600]  They're going to have to raise interest rates.
[3:46:07.600 --> 3:46:11.600]  So what's going to happen to the real estate market?
[3:46:11.600 --> 3:46:18.600]  Where prices have gone up very sharply in select areas,
[3:46:18.600 --> 3:46:22.600]  particularly suburban and ex-urban areas beyond the suburbs,
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:27.600]  in the hot areas like up here in Kingston, New York.
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:29.600]  The prices here, according to Bloomberg,
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:32.600]  went up the highest about several months ago,
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:35.600]  because we're 90 miles north of New York City.
[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:37.600]  The Catskill Mountains are right over there,
[3:46:37.600 --> 3:46:39.600]  and the Hudson River is right behind me,
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:41.600]  a couple of miles away.
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:44.600]  We were on the Hudson River.
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:47.600]  So people are flooding up to this area.
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:50.600]  These prices in those kind of hot ex-urban areas
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:53.600]  around the country are going to stay high.
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:58.600]  Commercial real estate, we...
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:02.600]  And now when interest rates go up and all that debt they got to pay.
[3:47:02.600 --> 3:47:18.600]  So now today, Facebook announced that the people want to work from home, they can.
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:20.600]  You see the polls coming out.
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:22.600]  Again, it's all in the trends journal.
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:24.600]  You see the polls coming out.
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:29.600]  People don't want to go back to work if they're commuting long distances.
[3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:32.600]  You know, you're an hour and a half on the LIE to get into New York City,
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:34.600]  an ugly drive.
[3:47:34.600 --> 3:47:35.600]  So there you go.
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:38.600]  Facebook has more employees, choose full-time work.
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:40.600]  What's going to happen to the commercial real estate?
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:49.600]  What's going to happen to all those businesses that depended on communities?
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:52.600]  And it was overbuilt before.
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:56.600]  In New York, before this happened.
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:47:58.600]  East side, west side, all around the town.
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:01.600]  For rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent.
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:02.600]  For rent, for rent, for rent.
[3:48:02.600 --> 3:48:07.600]  Now it's for rent, for rent.
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:09.600]  There you go.
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:13.600]  Well, they got 86% of workers don't want to return to office full-time.
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:15.600]  So those are the kind of things we're writing about in the trends journal
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:17.600]  and putting it all together.
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:19.600]  And when I tell you the importance of interest rates,
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:22.600]  this is from the trends journal.
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:24.600]  This is the printout.
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:26.600]  You have a flipbook, by the way.
[3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:28.600]  And you can listen to it.
[3:48:28.600 --> 3:48:31.600]  Trump says Fed should cut rates to zero or less.
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:34.600]  Attacks to your own Powell again.
[3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:43.600]  This was 9-11, 2019.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:46.600]  Our pathetic slow-moving Federal Reserve headed by Jay Powell,
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:49.600]  who raised rates too fast and lowered too late,
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:54.600]  should get our Fed rate down to the levels of our competitor nations.
[3:48:54.600 --> 3:49:00.600]  And now, have as much as a two-point advantage with even bigger currency help.
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:06.600]  Also stimulate.
[3:49:06.600 --> 3:49:10.600]  All right.
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:14.600]  This is before the COVID war began.
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:17.600]  People forget what was going on.
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:19.600]  The Fed was buying, dumping,
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:22.600]  they bumped in $7 trillion into the repo markets,
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:25.600]  the overnight markets from September 2019
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:29.600]  to the beginning of January 2020, just before the COVID war began.
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:33.600]  This thing is so artificially propped up.
[3:49:33.600 --> 3:49:36.600]  And it's going to come down hard.
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:38.600]  Big and hard.
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:43.600]  But you can prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:47.600]  If you can see what's going to happen, why it's going to happen,
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:50.600]  and steps you might want to consider.
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:49:52.600]  Where's gold prices going?
[3:49:52.600 --> 3:49:54.600]  Where's silver prices going?
[3:49:54.600 --> 3:49:56.600]  Where are oil prices going?
[3:49:56.600 --> 3:49:58.600]  Where's real estate going?
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:00.600]  Where's crypto currencies going?
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:05.600]  Again, another whole load of crypto stories in the Trends Journal.
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:10.600]  We are in a period of flux right now.
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:13.600]  Even the media is weakening on Biden.
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:15.600]  Today they said, you know, he's leaving the country
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:18.600]  and things aren't stable for him.
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:21.600]  This thing's going to go down big and hard.
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:23.600]  So you can prepare now.
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:25.600]  So thanks for tuning in.
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:27.600]  We'll see you on Monday.
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:30.600]  And remember, do what you can to support Info Wars
[3:50:30.600 --> 3:50:33.600]  and of course the Trends Journal and Occupy Feats.
[3:50:33.600 --> 3:50:43.600]  Thanks for tuning in.
