[01:30.900 --> 01:35.580]  I say that I see an Associated Press headline they're restricting the use
[01:35.580 --> 01:41.740]  of the term Islamist can't even call Al Qaeda terrorists now because they're the
[01:41.740 --> 01:47.900]  good guys overthrowing Libya and Syria and now you can call anybody that wants

[02:26.580 --> 02:31.340]  marijuana and they hadn't gotten them back over a year later that is a

[09:05.580 --> 09:09.820]  of the new global wars they're about to start the implosion of the world economy
[09:09.820 --> 09:15.500]  and every national nationally sovereign state and the ushering in of the one
[09:15.500 --> 09:22.020]  world government and the church is all lining up again to worship abortion to
[09:22.020 --> 09:26.380]  worship gun control to worship the end of marriage to just worship tyranny
[09:26.380 --> 09:30.460]  period and openly call for world government as the Vatican is now doing
[09:30.460 --> 09:37.420]  here is the CNN headline report North Korea loads missiles on two launchers
[09:37.420 --> 09:44.300]  and they're talking about nuclear war by next Wednesday yes ladies and gentlemen
[09:44.300 --> 09:48.540]  they're talking about nuclear war we're not talking about nuclear war the
[09:48.540 --> 09:52.580]  establishment is two medium-range missiles have been loaded onto mobile
[09:52.580 --> 09:57.900]  launchers in North Korea and are ready to be launched South Korea's semi-official
[09:57.900 --> 10:04.940]  Yonhap news agency reported today citing military sources in Seoul by the way
[10:04.940 --> 10:09.620]  we have a correspondent in Seoul South Korea and we're working on that right
[10:09.620 --> 10:15.580]  now a US official not a servant but official with direct knowledge of the
[10:15.580 --> 10:20.220]  information told CNN on Thursday that missiles and launch components have been
[10:20.220 --> 10:24.580]  moved to the east coast of North Korea in the last few days and again that would
[10:24.580 --> 10:30.100]  be able to target the west coast of the United States or be able to obviously
[10:30.100 --> 10:34.380]  hit Japan it's much closer in response South Korea has sent ages destroyers
[10:34.380 --> 10:38.460]  equipped with advanced radar systems into both its coast Yonhap said citing
[10:38.460 --> 10:41.980]  Navy sources the apparent deployment comes amid further threatening
[10:41.980 --> 10:45.060]  statements by North Korea and heightening tensions in the region a
[10:45.060 --> 10:50.060]  situation that does not need to get any hotter US State Department said why did
[10:50.060 --> 10:55.900]  the State Department authorize with the UN then in the mid 90s ABB the nuclear
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.300]  reactor company the multi-actual company headed by Donald Rumsfeld to
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.300]  transfer the reactors to him to get the fissile material to make the atomic bomb
[11:04.300 --> 11:13.060]  warheads the primitive warheads the 1950s science-level warheads why was that
[11:13.060 --> 11:15.980]  done and there were reactors they could have been quote given the last time they
[11:15.980 --> 11:19.620]  were holding the world hostage oh you're threatening war with the South the
[11:19.620 --> 11:26.180]  conventional weapons here let us give you reactors to make a bombs I guarantee
[11:26.180 --> 11:29.180]  when we're in some new giant wars with al Qaeda that's being given the entire
[11:29.180 --> 11:33.100]  Middle East right now a year from now two years from now three years from now
[11:33.100 --> 11:38.620]  four years from now it will be a conspiracy theory that the West put al
[11:38.620 --> 11:45.700]  Qaeda in those countries it'll be how dare Alex Jones claim al Qaeda was put in
[11:45.700 --> 11:50.980]  by us and I'll be like I have LA Times Associated Press Reuters CFR from 2010
[11:50.980 --> 12:03.500]  11 and 12 13 here they shut up traitor shut up traitor yeah there's London
[12:03.500 --> 12:09.780]  Guardian dealing with the that's talking about in 2000 him transferring stuff to
[12:09.780 --> 12:17.020]  him he's doing it in 1995 96 anyways it's just having a memory in a culture of
[12:17.020 --> 12:22.340]  people that don't even know which end is up it's really weird I mean I guess I'm
[12:22.340 --> 12:26.780]  a heretic because I know sodium fluoride in the levels they put in the
[12:26.780 --> 12:31.180]  water and food are increasing cancer they admit it I know they're putting
[12:31.180 --> 12:35.940]  misfinal way in the plastics in that type of plastic to to reduce fertility it
[12:35.940 --> 12:41.020]  the White House science are brags about it John P. Holdren I mean I know they're
[12:41.020 --> 12:46.500]  doing all this I know they're bad I know they plan to bring in global crises to
[12:46.500 --> 12:50.980]  sell total tyranny and the shutdown of the alternative media as the answer and
[12:50.980 --> 12:55.580]  the shutdown of the old web with the new controlled Internet it's all being
[12:55.580 --> 13:01.180]  announced it's all happening they're going to take your pension funds all of
[13:01.180 --> 13:06.580]  it all of it you can have no independence all of your pension fund
[13:06.580 --> 13:10.860]  public or private will be taken all of your bank accounts will be taken and
[13:10.860 --> 13:15.660]  then your life will be taken how do I know that that's how tyrannies work
[13:15.660 --> 13:20.100]  if they can get any of it they're gonna get it all what I say three weeks ago
[13:20.100 --> 13:24.900]  when the Cypress thing started I said if they can get 10% people like how dare
[13:24.900 --> 13:28.260]  you say that they're not taking any money that was the first response it
[13:28.260 --> 13:31.980]  couldn't be true I was reporting on foreign press first few days you're a
[13:31.980 --> 13:36.340]  liar Alex on my own website in full wars calm the comments of trolls and
[13:36.340 --> 13:41.900]  spammers Alex you're making it up okay they are taking the money 7.5% it's not
[13:41.900 --> 13:46.220]  10% you dirty liar by the because they were covering articles from days before
[13:46.220 --> 13:51.260]  it was then 10% then it was 20 then it was 30 then it was 40 then it was 50 then
[13:51.260 --> 13:55.740]  it was 60 then it was 70 then it was 80 then it was 90 then it was all the money
[13:55.740 --> 13:59.900]  out of your bank account for many of the people that had accounts the lowest
[13:59.900 --> 14:03.940]  number was 40% out of your bank account and now they're saying they're gonna take
[14:03.940 --> 14:09.180]  more and you notice it first they were like yeah tough bailout for Cypress but
[14:09.180 --> 14:15.340]  it's what it needs Fox News reporting you know I'm Shepard Smith or whatever his
[14:15.340 --> 14:20.620]  name is that's right and then a few days later now they call it a bailout they
[14:20.620 --> 14:28.060]  don't even say money out of the accounts on CNN Fox MSNBC that's how it works you
[14:28.060 --> 14:32.340]  see and and now it's a conspiracy theory they didn't take money out in Cypress
[14:32.340 --> 14:38.260]  there's not two billion bullets and of course then it turned out that they
[14:38.260 --> 14:40.580]  sold it as we're gonna get the rich people's money when it was actually the
[14:40.580 --> 14:45.380]  poor people turns out hundreds and hundreds of mega rich that had their
[14:45.380 --> 14:49.420]  money there all their money was taken out in the weeks and months before
[14:49.420 --> 14:54.380]  Reuters reported oh but I forgot it doesn't exist I mean this is the crazy
[14:54.380 --> 15:02.740]  land that we've gotten to so they're now loading missiles onto the launchers all
[15:02.740 --> 15:07.180]  embassies told to evacuate staff from North Korea the British are pulling out
[15:07.180 --> 15:19.540]  that is the type of information that is unfolding right now and maybe this is
[15:19.540 --> 15:23.380]  like all the last threats you know remember Homeland Security about a
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.540]  month and a half ago they were talking about cutting a Homeland Security's
[15:26.540 --> 15:33.820]  ever-growing budget just to cut the growth of it just hundreds of billions
[15:33.820 --> 15:36.620]  of dollars a year conservatively they said we're just to cut a few billion of
[15:36.620 --> 15:43.820]  your growth and they said okay terrorist will hit us Al Qaeda working with the
[15:43.820 --> 15:49.300]  Tea Party remember that was the headline is going to head America and if
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.780]  anybody can think they'd go the Tea Party's made up of mainly Islamophobes
[15:52.780 --> 15:56.980]  who gave up all their rights believing they were gonna fight Al Qaeda now the
[15:56.980 --> 16:00.260]  government publicly runs Al Qaeda so they're flipping it over to the
[16:00.260 --> 16:05.060]  patriot movement is the terrorist but they came out and said well who's gonna
[16:05.060 --> 16:08.700]  hit us right wingers working with Al Qaeda haven't you seen all the new
[16:08.700 --> 16:19.220]  dramas on ABC CBS and Fox and Spike TV and everywhere else I mean I mean on all
[16:19.220 --> 16:26.260]  the shows the the the the killers are gun owner patriots haven't you seen the
[16:26.260 --> 16:36.020]  medical shows and then and then the cops are out there and there's a Tea Party
[16:36.020 --> 16:40.420]  event in Louisiana and people are visiting from Florida husband and wife
[16:40.420 --> 16:44.420]  who are engineers of two little boys so they raid the rooms of the people this
[16:44.420 --> 16:47.300]  is an anti-government thing you're not allowed to have a Tea Party event at the
[16:47.300 --> 16:51.660]  hotel with speakers you know good agents you're good maids went in and dug
[16:51.660 --> 16:54.980]  through stuff you know in the free country and claim they found a less than
[16:54.980 --> 17:02.180]  a gram of marijuana and a pipe and so the children were taken thank God in our
[17:02.180 --> 17:05.180]  free country if they catch you with marijuana your children are taken
[17:05.180 --> 17:10.300]  Air Force veterans a no criminal record and then a year later you know the
[17:10.300 --> 17:14.100]  government has the kids and then now the parents went and took their kids back
[17:14.100 --> 17:17.700]  oh my gosh can you imagine you know there's only one thing worse than that
[17:17.700 --> 17:21.940]  one time I went in the garage and usually if I left the door open and
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.700]  forget to close it night raccoons go in and try to find the dog food and the
[17:26.700 --> 17:32.620]  most evil thing that you've ever seen happens if there's a mama raccoon or
[17:32.620 --> 17:36.940]  daddy raccoon in the garage they're not mean about it they'll just kind of run
[17:36.940 --> 17:41.540]  out but if they brought their babies in with them and you try to get close they
[17:41.540 --> 17:44.620]  just get their back against the wall they won't leave and they start hissing
[17:44.620 --> 17:47.980]  and growling at you and if you go up to them they will attack you and bite you
[17:47.980 --> 17:53.140]  and I think all raccoons should be executed hunted down and put in fema
[17:53.140 --> 17:57.540]  camps because there's nothing worse than wanting your babies to be safe
[17:57.540 --> 18:02.540]  there's nothing worse than a parent wanting to be with their child
[18:03.860 --> 18:08.940]  I mean I think abortion is great in this country I think it's great we've
[18:08.940 --> 18:13.540]  killed 53 million babies I think it's great now the Journal of Bioethics is
[18:13.540 --> 18:16.620]  calling to kill babies up to age three I think it's great they're calling for
[18:16.620 --> 18:20.940]  death panels of old people and I think it's great that all over the country I
[18:20.940 --> 18:25.500]  know people I'll be in a restaurant listening or I was at Barton Springs
[18:25.500 --> 18:30.900]  once and heard a couple going it's just terrible yeah I can't believe it I mean
[18:30.900 --> 18:35.460]  that no criminal record he's a professor she's a scientist she wanted to have her

[24:27.300 --> 24:34.100]  advocate on grabbing guns he has a armed response security system so he has
[24:34.100 --> 24:42.700]  armed guards ladies and gentlemen that's a very expensive security to have we've
[24:42.700 --> 24:46.700]  actually looked at it for our office but why not just have us armed so show
[24:46.700 --> 24:51.900]  it show a show so so basically retired police generally or military with
[24:51.900 --> 24:57.460]  special permits for armed response for LA they show up to his house armed
[24:57.460 --> 25:03.180]  response Piers Morgan the resident gun control advocate of CNN protects his
[25:03.180 --> 25:08.580]  own personal property with signs warning that it is guaranteed by an armed
[25:08.580 --> 25:12.620]  response security services court a new investigation by self-described guerrilla
[25:12.620 --> 25:16.620]  journalist James O'Keeffe of the of the project Veritas it's known for his
[25:16.620 --> 25:21.100]  undercover video operations he recently exposed our journalist with a newspaper
[25:21.100 --> 25:25.340]  that revealed the addresses of gun permit holders in the New York City
[25:25.340 --> 25:29.820]  were unwilling to take a dose of their own medicine declare their homes gun-free
[25:29.820 --> 25:36.660]  zones I'm telling you these guys are the model of journalism it's funny I I was
[25:36.660 --> 25:40.900]  talking to him off air about some stuff and I said yeah you know you ought to go
[25:40.900 --> 25:45.140]  out and show you know Piers Morgan's bodyguards and they said actually we're
[25:45.140 --> 25:48.780]  on that we're going there next week but don't tell anybody it's just like
[25:48.780 --> 25:54.020]  bam and I'll be honest with you I've actually got reporters going out to LA
[25:54.020 --> 25:58.220]  that they've scooped us I'm more than happy we got guys going in well I'm
[25:58.220 --> 26:06.420]  not gonna say when and that's on their list is to but I gotta love it man you
[26:06.420 --> 26:10.300]  gotta love it you gotta absolutely love it I mean that's how you deal with these
[26:10.300 --> 26:15.180]  hypocrites and and that's why they're so upset about the alternative media back
[26:15.180 --> 26:22.020]  Fox News is asking is Drudge on the White House enemies list and of course the
[26:22.020 --> 26:27.780]  answer is yes it came out what three years ago in the news that I'm on the
[26:27.780 --> 26:31.060]  enemies list Drudge is on the enemies list oh bright Bart's on there but you
[26:31.060 --> 26:36.780]  can scratch him off yes they got him oh I'm sure it's they just announced how he
[26:36.780 --> 26:40.580]  died 45 minutes after he's at the hospital that's that's just a telltale sign
[26:40.580 --> 26:47.060]  when they tell you that there's no no no foul play immediately that you've got
[26:47.060 --> 26:51.460]  some really suspicious stuff going on but again here's the good news in all
[26:51.460 --> 26:59.460]  of this they wouldn't be freaking out they wouldn't be coming after us with
[26:59.460 --> 27:02.980]  all their government-controlled organs like Media Matters ADL Southern
[27:02.980 --> 27:09.820]  Parvy Law Center MSNBC CNN they wouldn't be demonizing info wars.com if we
[27:09.820 --> 27:14.780]  weren't effective so there's the good news you know my my grandpa was in the
[27:14.780 --> 27:21.100]  Army Air Corps they had an old saying he was flying out of North Africa into
[27:21.100 --> 27:23.980]  Italy and then after they took over Italy he was on the ground there but the
[27:23.980 --> 27:28.460]  point is did his 22 missions was that they had an old saying how do you know
[27:28.460 --> 27:32.420]  when you're over the target it's when you're getting the flak because they
[27:32.420 --> 27:36.100]  put the flak around the factories and around the military bases they put the
[27:36.100 --> 27:42.500]  big anti-aircraft guns and then they're shrapnel and they're like shells that go
[27:42.500 --> 27:47.100]  up and explode and they've got a bunch of pieces falling in hundreds of miles an
[27:47.100 --> 27:50.580]  hour through the air meant to knock out your windshields go through your engines
[27:50.580 --> 27:57.780]  and so how did you know where to bomb where you saw the flak coming up you had
[27:57.780 --> 28:01.340]  to fly into the cloud of flak
[28:01.340 --> 28:07.020]  and so where do you see the flak going up where do you see the flak coming in
[28:07.020 --> 28:12.660]  the only real media in this country does that mean I'm perfect no does it mean

[36:15.100 --> 36:18.500]  those that aren't formed the mercenaries the truly evil the truly
[36:18.500 --> 36:23.180]  virtuous there's a lot of different factions out there and and and there are
[36:23.180 --> 36:29.360]  different currents in this universe you need to stand up for liberty and evil
[36:29.360 --> 36:35.580]  will vanish like tyrants at daybreak like like like mist like phantoms at
[36:35.580 --> 36:41.500]  daybreak to quote Thomas Jefferson now we've got purges against gun owners and
[36:41.500 --> 36:44.620]  veterans veterans who've had their arms and legs blown off for having their
[36:44.620 --> 36:48.340]  kids taken veterans that are caught with even half a marijuana cigarette or
[36:48.340 --> 36:52.260]  having their children taken veterans are having their guns taken en masse there
[36:52.260 --> 36:56.940]  is a domestic purge like Nazi Germany started with groups that were unpopular
[36:56.940 --> 37:01.780]  at first and expanded on to everyone I've studied tyranny it's happening next
[37:01.780 --> 37:06.500]  hour I'm gonna get into that but a big surprise he's a smart guy he knows he's
[37:06.500 --> 37:10.780]  monitored so he was smart to get out of the country and then contact us he said
[37:10.780 --> 37:14.940]  I'm gonna have a surprise for you next week I'm an expert on Korea and I knew
[37:14.940 --> 37:18.420]  he was he helped write Tom Clancy's books co-authored him has had a lot of his
[37:18.420 --> 37:23.380]  books turned into major hit most in pitchers he's a has multiple degrees
[37:23.380 --> 37:28.460]  from what MIT and Harvard on his bio here in front of me today and did write
[37:28.460 --> 37:31.900]  the book on modern psychological warfare that was but for the State
[37:31.900 --> 37:36.300]  Department was picked up by the CIA and others he's a negotiated major hostage
[37:36.300 --> 37:40.740]  rescue operations he's run psyops he's brought down foreign governments that's
[37:40.740 --> 37:44.660]  all on record he won't brag about it you can Google dr. Steve Pachennick and find
[37:44.660 --> 37:49.340]  news articles about him and no one's seen what he looks like in about 20 years
[37:49.340 --> 37:54.500]  either but we got a photo from about 30 years ago and of course he is a member
[37:54.500 --> 37:58.940]  of the council on farm relations as well as he says a mole in there against the
[37:58.940 --> 38:04.580]  globalist he exposes that bin Laden was already dead other false flags and we
[38:04.580 --> 38:07.940]  get his email we called the hotel and now he's out on the DMZ
[38:07.940 --> 38:14.180]  dr. Steve Pachennick is there with a sandstorm coming in out of the desert on
[38:14.180 --> 38:19.340]  on the DMZ he's watching troops coming in right now and he can give you what he
[38:19.340 --> 38:24.220]  believes is the inside Intel scoop from his contacts on what's really happening
[38:24.220 --> 38:29.860]  with the biggest crisis the biggest saber-rattling in the 60-year conflict
[38:29.860 --> 38:36.020]  and ongoing conflict that is the the north-south Korea proxy situation so I'm
[38:36.020 --> 38:40.700]  gonna give him the floor now joining us from somewhere in South Korea right on
[38:40.700 --> 38:46.380]  the DMZ he is there dr. Pachennick thank you for going there and reporting for
[38:46.380 --> 38:51.940]  us well thank you Alex and thank you America for listening to me what
[38:51.940 --> 38:55.660]  happened on last week's show I was on Monday and we talked about stand-downs
[38:55.660 --> 38:59.260]  and all the other false flags but I didn't want to give you the surprise
[38:59.260 --> 39:03.460]  that I knew the next day I would be hit it out on my own money my own time
[39:03.460 --> 39:07.820]  without any assistance from anybody straight into South Korea and up to the
[39:07.820 --> 39:15.780]  DMZ right now I'm on the DMZ it's about 2 1 40 a.m. in the morning on Saturday so
[39:15.780 --> 39:20.460]  we're 11 hours ahead what I see is a huge sandstorm coming in from the Gobi
[39:20.460 --> 39:25.140]  desert of China and in a way that really is the metaphor for what's
[39:25.140 --> 39:31.460]  happening in Korea China is the primary mover of North Korea China is the
[39:31.460 --> 39:37.940]  responsible agent that creates Kim Jong-il Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un the
[39:37.940 --> 39:42.100]  reason I went here was to show the American public in real time through
[39:42.100 --> 39:48.340]  only through Alex Jones how distorted our representation is and of the media
[39:48.340 --> 39:54.140]  how inappropriate and how agitation propaganda is being played through CNN
[39:54.140 --> 39:58.540]  which I woke up to and it was unbelievable wolf blitzer serenade on
[39:58.540 --> 40:03.180]  Eminipur all the people that we talked about we don't know absolutely nothing
[40:03.180 --> 40:08.260]  are being told by our military and our government to create a sense of panic and
[40:08.260 --> 40:13.020]  agitation that there would be a nuclear missile strike somewhere on the Pacific
[40:13.020 --> 40:19.260]  possibly near Seattle possibly on the East Coast but the entire scenario is
[40:19.260 --> 40:24.420]  totally false while I'm here unofficially but the Korean government has
[40:24.420 --> 40:27.740]  not stopped me because I've worked with him let me explain a little bit of my
[40:27.740 --> 40:32.060]  history it's not just that I wrote about North Korea and I was here but I was
[40:32.060 --> 40:35.780]  deputy assistant secretary of East Asia which meant that Korea was under my
[40:35.780 --> 40:41.100]  jurisdiction and I was the first the first person to actually work with in
[40:41.100 --> 40:46.460]  the 1980s a man by the name of Chandu on no Tewoo our own government didn't
[40:46.460 --> 40:51.100]  really remember this and what that meant in simple language was I was able to
[40:51.100 --> 40:56.100]  help the military government of South Korea that's the president president
[40:56.100 --> 41:01.980]  lady whose name is part whose father was assassinated military crew I was able
[41:01.980 --> 41:06.180]  with the assistance of the US government to transform the entire country of
[41:06.180 --> 41:11.660]  South Korea in the 1980s from a military dictatorship to a civilian one and
[41:11.660 --> 41:18.060]  then eventually were brought in and directly in Kim Jong-un and Kim Dae-jung
[41:18.060 --> 41:21.700]  there's a lot of names here but those in the world will understand in the South
[41:21.700 --> 41:26.780]  Koreans I'm here in the DMZ zone and unidentified area I've been supported by
[41:26.780 --> 41:31.740]  the South Korean informally through my guides and others but I've had the
[41:31.740 --> 41:35.820]  opportunity and the unique one and the reason I've done this to really be able
[41:35.820 --> 41:40.300]  to co-op and to explain to the Americans through only through Alex Jones showing
[41:40.300 --> 41:44.620]  Alex and I am being paid this goes back to our friendship and to the belief I
[41:44.620 --> 41:48.660]  have and that he's the only media that I can get the real truth and as I'm
[41:48.660 --> 41:54.780]  seeing it now I see brigades and possible brigades about the five to ten
[41:54.780 --> 42:00.500]  thousand fifteen thousand young South Korean soldiers moving in concert with
[42:00.500 --> 42:07.180]  half tracks and tanks the tanks are old they're not modern I interviewed even
[42:07.180 --> 42:10.940]  though the military did not want to work with me I asked for formal request
[42:10.940 --> 42:14.540]  although I came in very quickly to the Republic of Korea army which I knew very
[42:14.540 --> 42:19.500]  well because I knew all of the generals so you have to remember America at 20 to
[42:19.500 --> 42:25.180]  30 years ago Korea South Korea was run by a military dictatorship the
[42:25.180 --> 42:29.660]  dictatorship was assassinated I was not involved in it but what I was was
[42:29.660 --> 42:33.700]  involved was the transforming the dictatorship into civilian government
[42:33.700 --> 42:38.300]  and now the leader of South Korea is a very elegant very competent woman who
[42:38.300 --> 42:43.260]  was the daughter of the president of the man who was the leading dictator by the
[42:43.260 --> 42:48.100]  name of miss Park she in no way has interfered with my work I was provided
[42:48.100 --> 42:53.340]  with a guy who speaks English Russian Japanese and is extremely knowledgeable
[42:53.340 --> 42:58.980]  was head of the major companies here and he recruited him very quickly he may be
[42:58.980 --> 43:04.980]  key to KCIA he may be not but we went immediately up to the DMZ zone on near
[43:04.980 --> 43:10.460]  the DMZ zone I see the half tracks coming in with tanks the tanks are very low
[43:10.460 --> 43:15.340]  quality they're not M1 Abrams the very sophisticated one but most importantly I
[43:15.340 --> 43:21.660]  wanted to express this the the spree the joy and kind of the sadness of when you
[43:21.660 --> 43:27.300]  see young men going to war when I know when I was drafted I was 24 25 what Alex
[43:27.300 --> 43:31.220]  was telling you these young kids have mandatory two-year service in the
[43:31.220 --> 43:36.460]  Republic of Korea Army which is in a very effective army in the old days we
[43:36.460 --> 43:41.740]  had to hold back PLO PLO men petroleum lubricant and oil because the South
[43:41.740 --> 43:45.700]  Korean Army was very effective and if we didn't hold them back they were tacked
[43:45.700 --> 43:50.900]  across the DMZ so you have to imagine Korea being split in half with a line
[43:50.900 --> 43:56.660]  of control we're on the one side of North Koreans have 2.2 million military
[43:56.660 --> 44:01.180]  soldiers with anti-poietic equipment and old generals who come out of the
[44:01.180 --> 44:06.580]  communist regime who were trained by Kim Il-sung now Kim Il-sung was the father
[44:06.580 --> 44:11.020]  of North Korea the reason they say he's crazy or it was an inappropriate is
[44:11.020 --> 44:17.140]  wrong Kim Il-sung was a very famous fighter against the Japanese occupation
[44:17.140 --> 44:21.020]  and to understand the history of Japan you have Korea you have to understand
[44:21.020 --> 44:26.980]  that Korea was slaughtered and by Japanese rule over a 35-year period
[44:26.980 --> 44:33.220]  starting from 1915 to 45 where the Japanese still do not want to apologize
[44:33.220 --> 44:38.260]  to Korea and where they use the women of Korea rape them pillage them can't and
[44:38.260 --> 44:43.420]  brought them to the Japan the service as the service women Japan will not
[44:43.420 --> 44:47.980]  apologize for this and very few Koreans in South Korea will ever forget what
[44:47.980 --> 44:53.140]  Japan has done despite the fact that Japan is now doing business they created
[44:53.140 --> 44:56.940]  hundreds of thousands of the ghost children so you've given us background I
[44:56.940 --> 45:01.540]  know you are a leading Korea Peninsula expert you were telling me off air this
[45:01.540 --> 45:06.740]  is a giant Psyop multi-faceted who's behind it what's the master plan Dr.
[45:06.740 --> 45:13.100]  Pachenek here's the major Psyops the major Psyops is we have had our army
[45:13.100 --> 45:20.020]  involved in several basically failed wars we had them invaded into Iraq as you
[45:20.020 --> 45:24.780]  know from Bush we had the invasion of Afghanistan thanks to Obama and we've
[45:24.780 --> 45:30.380]  had incursions into various Middle East countries all have failed we also have
[45:30.380 --> 45:35.660]  to remember that the U.S. Army failed in the war in Korea and that the only
[45:35.660 --> 45:39.580]  general who brought it forth and made peace on the DMZ was General Eisenhower
[45:39.580 --> 45:44.700]  so it took a military man to bring peace what really happened now was I
[45:44.700 --> 45:48.900]  anticipated that because the Navy was not involved in any of the prior
[45:48.900 --> 45:54.740]  incursions in Pakistan Afghanistan and only served as a deterrent in the
[45:54.740 --> 46:00.860]  Mediterranean and in the basically the the oil companies that denying any
[46:00.860 --> 46:05.500]  access to so-called terrorists which really weren't there they immediately
[46:05.500 --> 46:11.700]  switched to Asia as we began to get involved with Asian and not denial of
[46:11.700 --> 46:16.260]  access in the Straits of Malacca and instigated the Japanese militaristic
[46:16.260 --> 46:21.020]  Empire and at the same time we were forcing the Chinese in our
[46:21.020 --> 46:26.220]  confrontation to force the the North Korean so it's a kind it's a kind of
[46:26.220 --> 46:32.020]  kabuki of concentrated efforts on the part of the United States North Korea
[46:32.020 --> 46:37.580]  South Korea and China which I have seen for over 35 years what happens usually
[46:37.580 --> 46:44.260]  is that the lead of North Korea at the instigation of China because of our
[46:44.260 --> 46:48.460]  relationships that become poor as our relationship with China becomes poor
[46:48.460 --> 46:53.940]  China starts to act out and then informs North Korea to do something that seems
[46:53.940 --> 47:00.060]  silly or very dangerous as self-destructive in the meantime we
[47:00.060 --> 47:04.980]  know very well everything about Kim Jong-un the new leader he's been in
[47:04.980 --> 47:11.580]  Switzerland for 35 for 15 years he was a very poor student extremely shy very
[47:11.580 --> 47:16.340]  loved basketball but is in fact was never trained to either be a leader of the
[47:16.340 --> 47:22.780]  Communist Party or as they call him the Commissioner or the the master planner
[47:22.780 --> 47:29.700]  and master soldier of the DPRK or the Korean Army so I knew that basically we
[47:29.700 --> 47:35.940]  had a phantom army we had a paper tiger in the U.S. and we had basically a very
[47:35.940 --> 47:40.940]  strong China which where we all played in a greed that as our Navy went to the
[47:40.940 --> 47:46.540]  Asian course we basically would start creating another strategic tension as we
[47:46.540 --> 47:52.340]  had done with terrorism in 9-11 as we had done with Afghanistan the Hakani group
[47:52.340 --> 47:58.140]  in Afghanistan as we had done the Civil War in Pakistan and as we now
[47:58.140 --> 48:04.100]  supporting the Salafis in Syria all of this is done in order to fulfill the
[48:04.100 --> 48:09.420]  mandates of our soldiers who have not been in duty and in action and need to
[48:09.420 --> 48:14.060]  have the action and test out their battle plans in effect our military has
[48:14.060 --> 48:18.780]  been very ineffective there is no way as I see it on the DNZ and having worked
[48:18.780 --> 48:23.860]  with previous generals all the way in Seoul that you people have to understand
[48:23.860 --> 48:29.620]  that Seoul is only 30 miles away from the DNZ the DNZ is literally the demarcation
[48:29.620 --> 48:36.260]  with 2.2 million North Korean soldiers can invade in 30 miles and there is no
[48:36.260 --> 48:40.540]  army in the world including the U.S. Army and they know that very very well
[48:40.540 --> 48:45.500]  I've repeatedly went over this with several generals over 30 years and I
[48:45.500 --> 48:50.100]  informed them that we are nothing more than what we call a tripwire in other
[48:50.100 --> 48:54.820]  words U.S. soldiers being placed here was an unnecessary expense on the
[48:54.820 --> 49:00.300]  behalf of the U.S. public and the American presidents as a requirement for a
[49:00.300 --> 49:05.860]  tripwire that meant as soon as the North Koreans would attack into Seoul which
[49:05.860 --> 49:10.620]  they never would do and every South Korean knew that then there would be
[49:10.620 --> 49:15.300]  total conflagration well that never happened in 30 years I knew Kim Il-sung
[49:15.300 --> 49:20.500]  I knew how ruthless he was but he was very smart and I corrected saying this
[49:20.500 --> 49:24.180]  is the greatest saber-rattling escalation and why would the Chinese
[49:24.180 --> 49:29.820]  play along with the West I mean I know at the high levels I mean they're a
[49:29.820 --> 49:34.180]  globalist manipulating both sides but what's the larger game why is China
[49:34.180 --> 49:37.980]  playing along I mean we know the shift a few years ago was the ships in the
[49:37.980 --> 49:42.900]  Pacific you know the Middle East is be given to Al Qaeda there's you know to
[49:42.900 --> 49:46.700]  be a domestic crackdown on real Americans here that's the new war and then
[49:46.700 --> 49:51.740]  have real you know confrontations with the Chinese while the globalist have
[49:51.740 --> 49:56.540]  invested everything in China well let's take away the world globalist what we do
[49:56.540 --> 50:01.660]  have here and let me use another word Alex not to contradict you but basically
[50:01.660 --> 50:06.940]  what we have in North Korea unlike North Korea and even China South Korea is
[50:06.940 --> 50:11.580]  the fastest growing country in the Asia it is the highest productivity with the
[50:11.580 --> 50:16.300]  lowest number of unemployment and they have been producing products from
[50:16.300 --> 50:21.180]  Samsung to Hyundai and selling it's the new Japan it's the new Japan the most
[50:21.180 --> 50:25.660]  connected it's beyond the new Japan it is so strong it can and cannot compete
[50:25.660 --> 50:31.020]  Japan now let's get to China the reason we have this confrontation with China
[50:31.020 --> 50:35.500]  which we facilitated and we deal directly with China is the fact that we
[50:35.500 --> 50:41.620]  have a new leader in China named G-Pong G-Pong is a technocrat and much like Kim
[50:41.620 --> 50:49.260]  Jong-un the new leader of North Korea he is a spoiled hodled princely in other
[50:49.260 --> 50:54.060]  words in China you have to remember there was always a one-son policy and he's
[50:54.060 --> 50:58.900]  the free so he's like the baby boomer of the vicious demonic chai comms we'll be

[54:14.340 --> 54:19.060]  by the way he's gonna be on the DMZ Sunday that'll be Monday morning on the
[54:19.060 --> 54:23.500]  Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m. we're gonna get Dr. Pachennick on let's say in the
[54:23.500 --> 54:28.740]  second hour so that it can be 7 a.m. so you can actually get some sleep so 6 7
[54:28.740 --> 54:33.940]  a.m. that'll be Sunday 4 to 6 central he's there and again folks this is what
[54:33.940 --> 54:37.780]  he's done this is the desk he was over for a while he's talked a lot about this
[54:37.780 --> 54:42.420]  it's it's you know well known in the news media that that's what he did and he
[54:42.420 --> 54:45.820]  was telling me off air some interesting things what is the big picture here Dr.
[54:45.820 --> 54:50.420]  Pachennick you're there with this crisis how real is the crisis what does
[54:50.420 --> 54:54.900]  this signify you were getting into the new Communist Party head there in China
[54:54.900 --> 54:58.660]  you agree with me during the break that he is a giant spoiled communist baby
[54:58.660 --> 55:04.900]  boomer what this really signifies is our American inability over 30 years South
[55:04.900 --> 55:09.100]  Korea has grown because of people like myself and others like Don Greg Jim
[55:09.100 --> 55:13.260]  Lemley who worked here and really transformed this country from a military
[55:13.260 --> 55:18.660]  dictatorship to a civil civilian one what it also emphasizes is how poor and
[55:18.660 --> 55:23.780]  desperate North Korea is because we will not absorb we the United States and
[55:23.780 --> 55:29.340]  China will not absorb North Korea and a unification process into South Korea and
[55:29.340 --> 55:33.660]  the reason for that is that South Korean poverty and in an ethnic and
[55:33.660 --> 55:38.420]  communism I've had experience with 20 30 years ago when I took down the Soviet
[55:38.420 --> 55:43.140]  Union I took down East Germany and West Germany and everybody knows in the US
[55:43.140 --> 55:48.100]  government that if we were to take down quickly this is the North Korean
[55:48.100 --> 55:52.580]  government which we are able to do by just not providing food and forcing the
[55:52.580 --> 55:57.420]  Chinese to break open their borders we would have a major economic crisis so
[55:57.420 --> 56:02.500]  what this is is a controlled agitation propaganda in order to maintain a
[56:02.500 --> 56:06.780]  soft landing now let me explain this to our American people the reason we work
[56:06.780 --> 56:10.900]  with the Chinese and the reason we work with the North Korean because the
[56:10.900 --> 56:15.140]  American public doesn't realize we're supplying food in order to keep the
[56:15.140 --> 56:20.860]  people in North Korea at a subsistence level what's not not possible and what's
[56:20.860 --> 56:26.100]  happening here is the frenzy of the American media and once again Obama and
[56:26.100 --> 56:31.400]  his inept White House and the ability of secretaries they carry to keep his
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.540]  mouth shut they have violated every principle of international crisis
[56:35.540 --> 56:40.060]  management which I developed which others have worked when like Charles Hill and
[56:40.060 --> 56:45.580]  other administrations and who know that in order to keep a crisis like this from
[56:45.580 --> 56:51.380]  going from escalating by accident we keep the media away we don't discuss
[56:51.380 --> 56:56.340]  military equipment we don't get into the frenzy and warmongering of explaining
[56:56.340 --> 57:00.580]  what kind of missile systems the North Korean have how they can shoot the
[57:00.580 --> 57:05.340]  missiles into the sky and get into the east at western part of California and
[57:05.340 --> 57:10.940]  it's not possible the North Koreans have absolutely no capacity to develop a
[57:10.940 --> 57:15.940]  missile they can't even make an automobile they can't even they drop 57
[57:15.940 --> 57:20.300]  Chevy's around they're a total joke that it's a total joke they have a 2.2
[57:20.300 --> 57:24.140]  military army and when I saw the equipment it hasn't changed even now as I
[57:24.140 --> 57:29.140]  analyzed the equipment with my guide on the DMZ and I can see these soldiers on
[57:29.140 --> 57:34.180]  this other side with binoculars you have 2.2 million soldiers who are really
[57:34.180 --> 57:39.020]  hungry to starving they don't believe anymore in North Korea but what South
[57:39.020 --> 57:43.380]  Korea had done very brilliantly over the years with our encouragement was to
[57:43.380 --> 57:48.420]  create on the Hyundai and Tramsung sure they've used the threat to control their
[57:48.420 --> 57:51.980]  people let me throw this at you isn't the real danger when the wall comes down
[57:51.980 --> 57:55.740]  and that if there's not a transition because the West wants to keep this
[57:55.740 --> 58:01.500]  going as always Alex hit it right on the head and we made that mistake I made
[58:01.500 --> 58:06.540]  that mistake along with Baker and Zelek in the transformation in East Germany
[58:06.540 --> 58:11.500]  what we did not realize at the time when we brought in communist Germany which
[58:11.500 --> 58:16.940]  was even more economically advanced than South Korea the North Korea we had
[58:16.940 --> 58:23.220]  completely flooded the capability of the West Germans to handle 50,000
[58:23.220 --> 58:28.460]  East Germans who didn't have a work didn't have jobs weren't trained were an
[58:28.460 --> 58:33.820]  entrepreneur and basically lived at subsistence level it cost Germany and
[58:33.820 --> 58:38.180]  the United States a fortune sure so let's come back in one minute and talk
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.900]  about what's gonna happen
[58:42.340 --> 58:48.900]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[58:55.180 --> 58:59.260]  security system then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home

[59:56.820 --> 1:00:10.220]  the GCN radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you
[1:00:10.220 --> 1:00:17.700]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:24.820]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it has been said by many a historian that
[1:00:24.820 --> 1:00:29.020]  war is the health of the state our authoritarian state the Chinese
[1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:32.540]  authoritarian state the North Korean authoritarian state the South Korean
[1:00:32.540 --> 1:00:37.300]  state they all stand again on the surface from crises and diversions but
[1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:43.180]  with a collapsing hermit kingdom of Stalinist scum oppressing and sitting on
[1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:47.980]  top of the little skeletons that they've almost sucked dry could this all be
[1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:52.020]  jockeying for some new deal for a new level of aid because China doesn't want
[1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:56.420]  to do it why not let the North fall implode into China really cause them
[1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:59.340]  some problems and now the globalists don't want that they want to use Mexico
[1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:03.340]  to implode into us instead but could this get out of control and I think what
[1:01:03.340 --> 1:01:09.380]  Pachinik said to me off-air is they've got a bunch of rubes and boobs a bunch of
[1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:12.660]  pirates boobies over there who don't know what they're doing and four minutes
[1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:16.100]  doc you're back with a Sunday in the second hour you'll have more you're on
[1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:19.500]  the DMZ if stuff breaks you want to stay up we could do a nightly news tonight
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:22.700]  I'd love to love you to email some photos of what you're seeing that'd be
[1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:27.220]  powerful I'm sure you got a snapshot digital phone what's the big danger then
[1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:31.780]  could this be the North preparing to collapse well this is partly the North
[1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:35.180]  preparing to collapse but I don't believe that's that the real danger the real
[1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:40.180]  danger is China isn't very serious trouble because China cannot control its
[1:01:40.180 --> 1:01:45.260]  internal security so in turn China in its relationship with the United States and
[1:01:45.260 --> 1:01:50.140]  the fact that the United States think back correctly is supporting Japan and in
[1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:55.460]  the war between the United States Japan and China China's only research recourse
[1:01:55.460 --> 1:02:02.300]  is to instigate a very inappropriate agitation of North Korea claiming that
[1:02:02.300 --> 1:02:06.820]  they can send missiles and all our best recourse now is for a secretary of state
[1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:12.740]  and a president to cool everybody down to shut down and warn CNN and all the
[1:02:12.740 --> 1:02:17.900]  media that if they don't stop and cease and this is to create education
[1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:22.460]  propaganda which is the first principle of international crisis management and
[1:02:22.460 --> 1:02:26.820]  then they tell their own military generals to stop talking about missiles
[1:02:26.820 --> 1:02:31.580]  and construction of missiles and they'll have the capability to do this and try
[1:02:31.580 --> 1:02:37.500]  and handle it in a quiet discreet military fashion I have no problem if
[1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:42.460]  to a gene missile system destroyers are coming in here I have the South
[1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:46.660]  Koreans have agreed with me they have no problem with two stealth bombers coming
[1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:52.340]  in or two stealth fighter fighters but it has to be kept quiet the success of
[1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:58.060]  international crisis management in an appropriate society like Kim Jong-un
[1:02:58.060 --> 1:03:02.180]  whose brain I know very well and contrary to the media where they hype it up
[1:03:02.180 --> 1:03:06.420]  and said only a psychiatrist would really understand him well here I am the
[1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:10.580]  psychiatrist who really understands and then has 30 years of experience but our
[1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:14.900]  government our media our intelligence didn't want to hear anything I had to
[1:03:14.900 --> 1:03:19.700]  say so I go to the only outlet and the only man and friend that I've had for
[1:03:19.700 --> 1:03:24.500]  20 years who's allowed the truth to come out and that is for us to tone down our
[1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:29.540]  rhetoric stop the agitation propaganda stop announcing what we're doing we can
[1:03:29.540 --> 1:03:34.740]  quietly support Ms. Park who's handling this situation extremely well and I have
[1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:40.180]  to say the South Korean people all 30 million of them very young low bill of
[1:03:40.180 --> 1:03:45.100]  the ocean 40 are making fun of us and saying yes actually in the night before
[1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:49.540]  I was on a DMZ zone I had what we call the last supper where everybody joked
[1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:54.500]  we ate eel we drank some Kampai and we said okay gentlemen this is our last
[1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:58.780]  supper when in fact we knew there was nothing that was the dangerous soul is
[1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:04.100]  moving it's active it's clean it's appropriate the people are kind the
[1:04:04.100 --> 1:04:09.100]  children are kind no one is panic but they find it disgusting that the United
[1:04:09.100 --> 1:04:14.540]  States government is creating again more crisis more education in order to serve
[1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:20.380]  the U.S. purpose the Chinese purpose and to create another potential war the
[1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:24.780]  danger of all of this is because our president is so inept as we've seen in
[1:04:24.780 --> 1:04:31.940]  Pakistan Iraq and Syria and because the White House is an old antiquated bunch
[1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:35.420]  of people who have no experience whatsoever stop there I want to come
[1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:39.260]  back I've got another guest coming up Chuck Baldwin but but but Dr. Pachinic
[1:04:39.260 --> 1:04:42.980]  you are a psychiatrist a Harvard psychiatrist and and you help work to

[1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:51.180]  want you to come back and tell us the danger of high-pigness and getting it
[1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:55.980]  out of control and I want you to briefly give us an analysis of Kim Jong-un the
[1:04:55.980 --> 1:05:01.620]  Chinese leader as well and the South Korean leader and Obama introducing pro
[1:05:01.620 --> 1:05:07.460]  one all of your filtration in one system portable on the go no more do you have two

[1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:34.220]  edition the fifth day of April 2013 I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:41.860]  central with the Sunday show many of our M&M affiliates that carry the weekday
[1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:46.060]  show also carry the Sunday show but you really should call XM and get them to
[1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:51.380]  pick up the Sunday show as well that's how we get on more M&M affiliates as
[1:08:51.380 --> 1:08:55.020]  well if you're listening on the internet or on satellite in your area and
[1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:58.740]  there's not a local M or FM call the local talk station tell them pick up the
[1:08:58.740 --> 1:09:03.220]  broadcast that's how we've gone over 150 affiliates and we're with a small
[1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:07.620]  syndicator the big three pretty much have a monopoly we have like salmon
[1:09:07.620 --> 1:09:12.860]  swarm upstream and my point is the White House responds to us the globalist
[1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:17.700]  respond to us the globalist respond to the drudge report more and more there's
[1:09:17.700 --> 1:09:22.660]  only a few outlets that are really able to get real news out no one would know
[1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:25.540]  about the Copenhagen documents that they plan to shut off the third world
[1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:30.700]  energy supplies and our energy supply if info wars.com hadn't written about it
[1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:34.420]  with Lord Monkton and then drudge report.com hadn't picked it up I mean
[1:09:34.420 --> 1:09:37.540]  there's just hundreds of things like that no one know about the bullets the
[1:09:37.540 --> 1:09:40.900]  domestic arms build up all of this and listen to me you've heard all the
[1:09:40.900 --> 1:09:45.700]  historians we've had on you've heard all the military historians all the
[1:09:45.700 --> 1:09:50.860]  sociologist all the anthropologist I am a person because I enjoy it from a young
[1:09:50.860 --> 1:09:57.300]  age I'm a person that's read psychology anthropology sociology history and so
[1:09:57.300 --> 1:10:01.540]  it's not rocket science though what we see forming worldwide is a decadent
[1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:06.780]  cascade event with corrupt leverage disconnected leaders because of
[1:10:06.780 --> 1:10:11.260]  decadent disconnected populations not predominantly but enough of it to aid
[1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:16.740]  them and a government and corporate class that have become degenerate that's
[1:10:16.740 --> 1:10:21.580]  when world wars happen and we've told you that as the world economy melts down
[1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:25.700]  as there's currency wars physical wars will begin you notice they're now
[1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:28.580]  saying they're not going to call al-qaeda al-qaeda they're not going to call them
[1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:32.940]  as llamasist we're now told to call them good guys that's associated press today
[1:10:32.940 --> 1:10:36.900]  if you just join me I'll go to the article that's because the globalist are
[1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:41.100]  going to use them as the new proxy army because they're the old proxy army and
[1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:43.380]  we've got a guy on the line who was there with Jimmy Carter when all that
[1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:50.180]  started and who knows Brazinski and he's a psychiatrist and an MD he is an
[1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:52.500]  American psychiatrist former State Department official author and
[1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:56.100]  publisher he is currently acclaimed author and psycho political thrillers and
[1:10:56.100 --> 1:11:00.500]  the co-creator of the best-selling Tom Clancy op center and Tom Clancy's net
[1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:03.740]  force paperback series trained in psychiatry at Harvard University
[1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:08.060]  international relations and MIT his novels are based on 20 years experience
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:11.220]  and the truth is he won't ever talk about it on air but you can go look at
[1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:16.620]  overthrowing a major governments you'll get it credited to psych warfare you
[1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:20.820]  know he won't talk about it maybe it's not true the London Guardian says it is
[1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:24.700]  tricking the communists to kill the prime minister who they'd already captured
[1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:29.340]  you know I mean things like that really interesting guy who only really pops up
[1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:33.260]  on this show because other places would censor him or control what he talks
[1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:36.500]  about we had him on in the last hour we've only got about nine minutes left
[1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:41.580]  here but he was the head of the desk over that area of Asia for a period of
[1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:46.580]  time he he would he helped get rid of this on record of the military
[1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:50.660]  dictatorship was in South Korea for so long and a transition he's there on his
[1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:54.900]  own with a guide given to him by the government up on the DMZ right now I
[1:11:54.900 --> 1:11:59.740]  want you briefly to go over the mindset of Kim Jong-un the mindset of the new
[1:11:59.740 --> 1:12:04.300]  Chinese Communist leader why Obama and the media are hyping this and why you're
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:08.620]  saying there's a danger in the hyping where they're saying nuclear war could
[1:12:08.620 --> 1:12:12.140]  happen any minute the north is saying they're going to nuke the US what is
[1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:17.060]  behind all this dr. Steve Pachennick let me get into the mindset of Kim Jong-un I
[1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:22.180]  know his mindset extremely well he grew up in and Geneva Lake Geneva at
[1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:25.540]  Switzerland he went to the Swiss boarding school by chance it happens that I
[1:12:25.540 --> 1:12:29.500]  went to Swiss boarding school where I was kicked out he was not he was a very
[1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:34.060]  poor student he was very shy he was very in there and really only enjoyed
[1:12:34.060 --> 1:12:39.220]  basketball the reality is what you have it's the classical communist scenario
[1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:45.300]  and paradox with the entire Kim Jong-un family and the entire Kim Jong-il
[1:12:45.300 --> 1:12:50.460]  family had for the 15 years lived in Lake Geneva in prosperity and even Kim
[1:12:50.460 --> 1:12:55.500]  Jong-in said to his own father how is it that I can live a life of luxury
[1:12:55.500 --> 1:13:00.540]  horseback riding shooting skating and playing basketball while white people are
[1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:05.220]  starving and his father just said don't worry we will have the money and we'll
[1:13:05.220 --> 1:13:09.900]  always maintain our power structure so the real issue now is can the Korean
[1:13:09.900 --> 1:13:15.780]  military control Korea and the answer is not clear because they take directions
[1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:20.820]  exactly from the Communist China and a communist China G-Pong who I followed
[1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:25.620]  for over 20 years is the son of the famous revolutionary of the Communist
[1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:30.500]  Party who was indicted in the Cultural Revolution and was so called reform but
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:34.380]  was brought up through the system because of his alliances with the military
[1:13:34.380 --> 1:13:39.500]  and the chronic capitalism the corruption of China China has been having
[1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:43.380]  problem with the United States in our forced structure in East and Asian and
[1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:47.580]  the fact that we have moved all of our battleships and our Marine Corps
[1:13:47.580 --> 1:13:52.260]  East and Asia to deny access to the Chinese correctly to their trading
[1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:57.140]  companies and also the fact that they're collapsing internally so two countries
[1:13:57.140 --> 1:14:01.980]  are collapsing internally China because it cannot maintain social stability it
[1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:06.500]  does not have water it has to get water from the Tibetan high marks and the
[1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:11.780]  fact that its economy is totally a false economy and a runaway economy that's
[1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:17.380]  been funds funded by JPMorgan Goldman Sachs and all the hedge funds and
[1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:22.540]  including our former Secretary of Treasury Paul Peterson who didn't who
[1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:28.660]  knew nothing about banking at 1M2 but has always been a chronic capitalist of
[1:14:28.660 --> 1:14:33.700]  the Chinese so what you have is two very similar princelings who are not
[1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:39.500]  qualified to run their government in terms of the Chinese leader he's a
[1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:43.820]  technocrat never had diplomatic experience they lived in the United States
[1:14:43.820 --> 1:14:48.420]  really does not understand how maintain social stability like Dongchao Ping
[1:14:48.420 --> 1:14:54.220]  Zhang Jiamin, Zhou Enlai, Wu Chaoqi and all the regional revolution he's spoiled
[1:14:54.220 --> 1:14:59.180]  he's corrupt and he has all their families are corrupt and the same way we
[1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:04.940]  have this corruption in the spoiled Kim Jong-un who grew up in Switzerland you
[1:15:04.940 --> 1:15:09.460]  can't think of him as a North Korean you have to think of him as the prepping
[1:15:09.460 --> 1:15:14.060]  peace with sporting schoolboy who's shy and that has never been in the military
[1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:19.420]  has been forced by his own military to be the face of Korea because his father
[1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:25.180]  felt that his older son Kim Jong-un was too feminine so he needed a stronger
[1:15:25.180 --> 1:15:31.540]  face so what we have is a paper doll China and a paper doll North Korea all
[1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:36.740]  creating an episode because United States military has come in and said
[1:15:36.740 --> 1:15:41.020]  we're going to protect our national security interests our economic
[1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:46.420]  interest is all the way from Indonesia the Vietnam Philippines and Japan the
[1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:50.940]  reason for that is China has engaged in a what we call a low-intensity conflict
[1:15:50.940 --> 1:15:57.180]  in the Spratly Islands which I wrote about 20 years ago in the Pacifica
[1:15:57.180 --> 1:16:01.820]  longer handle the internal economy so when they can no longer handle the
[1:16:01.820 --> 1:16:06.700]  internal economy they push the Chinese the Koreans in order to make the
[1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:11.220]  kind of noise and what we called in psychiatry acting out behavior or baby
[1:16:11.220 --> 1:16:16.900]  like baby I called Kim Jong-un the baby in the crib who screams and yells looks
[1:16:16.900 --> 1:16:21.100]  at missiles that really can't fly anywhere has no capacity there's one of
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:25.980]  the few guys in America when his name is Charles Hill worked in North Korea and
[1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:30.700]  really what they're doing is we're fostering that type of reaction so that
[1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:36.380]  we can demonstrate how strong our Navy is how strong our capability to control
[1:16:36.380 --> 1:16:40.620]  the situation but in fact what's happening is we're showing the opposite in
[1:16:40.620 --> 1:16:44.940]  the South Korean people and the South Korean Army and intelligence is seeing
[1:16:44.940 --> 1:16:50.140]  exactly what I'm saying on the DMZ zone we become a joke we send over to self
[1:16:50.140 --> 1:16:54.900]  fighter planes at 22 which has absolutely no relevance because the North
[1:16:54.900 --> 1:17:00.180]  Koreans can never intact South Korea otherwise they will be in destroyed 22
[1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:05.700]  million people and South Seoul is only 30 miles away I'm right on the top of that
[1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:11.580]  the nuclear storm right on the DMZ as I'm talking to young Korean soldiers who
[1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:15.700]  quite frankly are not prepared to go to war and know under the hearts of the
[1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:20.060]  hearts that they will not confront the North Koreans are coming over but once
[1:17:20.060 --> 1:17:26.100]  that Kim Jong-un underneath the Chinese provocation and American ineptness in
[1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:30.660]  handling this control will create a situation where it will be out of control
[1:17:30.660 --> 1:17:38.580]  in the case of his grandfather they blew up South Korean presidential platform
[1:17:38.580 --> 1:17:44.260]  in the case of his father they also blew up ships so what happens in a
[1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:48.420]  certain crisis can get blown out very quickly number one because we don't
[1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:52.660]  have a president who really is qualified to run a well that was my final point is
[1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:56.540]  that it is that you've got special crony capitalist interests that want to work
[1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:00.620]  with authoritarian regimes as curl quickly wrote at Georgetown they want
[1:18:00.620 --> 1:18:04.940]  weak people reading off teleprompters so now there's no leadership anywhere it's
[1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:09.020]  like an absurdist science fiction Kurt Vonnegut novel where some kid from
[1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:13.940]  Switzerland is commanding a bunch of psychopaths the vampires you've got
[1:18:13.940 --> 1:18:18.900]  China on the edge of collapse you've got insanity here you've got crony interests
[1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:23.020]  shutting down all their competition I mean it looks like a civilization
[1:18:23.020 --> 1:18:28.300]  collapse type event down the road with this type of lunacy and then building up
[1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:32.660]  North Korea to the South Koreans looks completely insane because they know what
[1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:37.300]  jokes they are I mean this is Alice in Wonderland that's correct it's more than
[1:18:37.300 --> 1:18:42.220]  Alice in Wonderland it's Alice in Wonderland on steroids and LSD it's a
[1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:46.620]  total non-reality because we're talking to all the Chinese are these South
[1:18:46.620 --> 1:18:51.700]  Korean students workers and military they can't take this seriously so what we
[1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:56.780]  considered the day the war that King Jong-il declared the end of the world
[1:18:56.780 --> 1:19:01.420]  yesterday I went out with some of my South Korean military friends and
[1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:06.300]  intelligence operatives and we had our last supper consisting of the eel diet
[1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:11.860]  coke and rice and we all laughed showing how incompetent the leader King
[1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:17.140]  Jung-in was the leader of China and also POTUS I guess it will be your last meal
[1:19:17.140 --> 1:19:23.100]  with diet coke we were sending over two stealth bombers which cost us close to
[1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:27.020]  a couple of five hundred million to a billion they laughed when they said we
[1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:32.260]  sent to a jean missile ships which can do absolutely nothing so our posturing
[1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:36.620]  is like a paper tiger which China was like and we can do nothing in the
[1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:41.860]  entire situation I will dot dot dot and the South Koreans have complained
[1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:47.460]  to me as we have created agitation propaganda in the news media all right
[1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.300]  now we got to go to break I got to come back with one more segment with you
[1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:53.500]  because I got to find out what do you expect to see come out of this what is
[1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:58.220]  the danger then if it's all just posturing final segment from the DMG
[1:19:58.220 --> 1:20:04.820]  with Dr. Steve Poczenik you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if

[1:24:35.140 --> 1:24:40.140]  so-called ruling class wanting us their quarry disarmed dr. Pachanic sum it all
[1:24:40.140 --> 1:24:45.980]  up for people you told me during the break what the real danger is that
[1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:50.620]  Korea will implode North Korea will implode North and South into China and
[1:24:50.620 --> 1:24:54.500]  into South Korea and trigger World War 3 and your own words repeat that and
[1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:58.180]  talk about what the what the establishment is doing and why you
[1:24:58.180 --> 1:25:04.180]  think it's so dangerous what's going to happen now is because of this predictable
[1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:09.020]  everyone in the media says that these North Koreans are crazy and unpredictable
[1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:12.900]  the answer is no they have been extremely predictable including Kim Il-Sang
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:17.460]  Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un no little princely we know exactly the behavior
[1:25:17.460 --> 1:25:21.980]  better we know exactly how they work we know that every time they act out we
[1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:26.620]  can control it but in order to control it we need a very effective president in
[1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:30.060]  the United States and effective Secretary of State which Kerry is not an
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:34.300]  effective intelligence community which we do not have and a military that's not
[1:25:34.300 --> 1:25:38.380]  gung-ho and understands the limits of the capability the limits of the
[1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:42.940]  capability is that very simply that if North Korea attacks South Korea which is
[1:25:42.940 --> 1:25:48.580]  not likely through Seoul because we're only 30 miles away if they act out in
[1:25:48.580 --> 1:25:53.020]  any way that we cannot manage because of the hype that we have created through a
[1:25:53.020 --> 1:25:59.140]  CNN Wolf Blitz is a Kharia and Eminem poor and other generals in the US Army who
[1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:04.940]  should be shut down and indicted for creating agitation propaganda we could
[1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:11.020]  have literally an implosion of North Korean poverty stirring over into South
[1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:16.300]  Korea and then have a major collapse of both North Korea and South Korea but
[1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:20.580]  more importantly of China because the North Koreans are so poor that they're
[1:26:20.580 --> 1:26:25.340]  screaming over the border of China so we have an incompetent G-Pong who's a
[1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:30.860]  technocrat a princeling and a spoiled Chinese technocrat very much like Kim
[1:26:30.860 --> 1:26:37.740]  Jung-in who's a spoiled Switzerland trained leader who has been horded by
[1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:42.380]  every intelligence community in the world including the French the Swiss the
[1:26:42.380 --> 1:26:47.780]  Americans the Germans the Russians you name them because of 15 years if you're
[1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:51.580]  in a Swiss boarding school and you're playing basketball and you're not very
[1:26:51.580 --> 1:26:55.620]  smart and you're quite a famine and you don't know how to deal with women you
[1:26:55.620 --> 1:27:00.260]  certainly don't know how to manage a country so we're we're coming into very
[1:27:00.260 --> 1:27:04.620]  quickly thanks to our American media and the frenzy of the American media the
[1:27:04.620 --> 1:27:08.660]  frenzy of the military particularly the Navy to say that we're bringing in a
[1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:14.340]  GNC's that we will send in stealth bombers does not do anything to report
[1:27:14.340 --> 1:27:19.300]  control or quiet the temper of a crisis which is the principles of crisis
[1:27:19.300 --> 1:27:24.260]  management that I present but I created 30 years ago and very sagacious people
[1:27:24.260 --> 1:27:28.860]  like Don Greg generally and others who had worked in the CIA and had been our
[1:27:28.860 --> 1:27:33.580]  ambassadors here understood that you keep the the education and the warm
[1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:37.180]  mongering to the lowest flame what we're doing now is increasing the flame
[1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:42.140]  thanks to CNN thanks to our military on AV thanks to the ignorance of the White
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:46.460]  House the ineptness of our president the ineptness of the Chinese and the
[1:27:46.460 --> 1:27:52.260]  ineptness of the North Korea we could literally land in a world war three with
[1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:56.980]  not only nuclear proliferation but there is gas warfare and the ability of that
[1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:01.740]  we would never thought possible of the North Koreans to come into South Korea
[1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:06.940]  because where I am located I'm only 10 kilometers away from North Korea and I
[1:28:06.940 --> 1:28:11.980]  can see the North Koreans right now I see Kim Il-sung stations I see the
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:16.180]  mobilization of the troops but at the same time the young troops in South
[1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:22.540]  Korea are not qualified to fight into a army that has only three days of
[1:28:22.540 --> 1:28:27.980]  petroleum lubricant and oil so what we have here is an impending crisis that's
[1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:33.980]  totally mismanaged isn't that 101 that you don't build up the enemy as super
[1:28:33.980 --> 1:28:38.100]  dangerous and powerful they should be laughing at Kim Jong-un calling him
[1:28:38.100 --> 1:28:42.580]  pathetic and weak and he can't even get happening in South Korea excuse me Alex
[1:28:42.580 --> 1:28:46.740]  everybody here is laughing we're talking about it we're saying how absurd
[1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:52.460]  North Korea is we have absolutely no regard for G-Pong and we find him very
[1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:56.740]  inept as the Chinese students should start rioting in China to say this is
[1:28:56.740 --> 1:29:00.900]  not the leader of China but more importantly we find it very disgraceful
[1:29:00.900 --> 1:29:05.100]  what America is doing by announcing they're sending two stealth bombers one
[1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:09.580]  Chinese one North South Korean official said to me how stupid can you
[1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:14.340]  Americans be to send billions of dollars worth of two planes that will do
[1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:19.340]  absolutely nothing agent missile systems that will do nothing because it cannot
[1:29:19.340 --> 1:29:24.220]  protect from a nuclear war and all it is is a posture of a paper tiger would
[1:29:24.220 --> 1:29:29.340]  become where we're creating a situation where we show our weakness we show our
[1:29:29.340 --> 1:29:33.860]  incompetence we show our lack of capability to handle this situation
[1:29:33.860 --> 1:29:38.540]  which is literally land into World War three but we know everything about Kim

[1:33:47.980 --> 1:33:53.180]  along with the persecution of veterans gun owners all of it my only gift I
[1:33:53.180 --> 1:33:56.980]  think is to recognize things hidden in plain view like if I walked into my
[1:33:56.980 --> 1:34:00.020]  living room and there was a thousand pound you know elephants sitting there
[1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:04.100]  a ten thousand pound elephant I would recognize it as an elephant if Barbara
[1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:07.540]  walters told me it wasn't an elephant I would tell her she was a liar now that's
[1:34:07.540 --> 1:34:11.820]  called being a conspiracy theorist but we're gonna be talking to Chuck Baldwin
[1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:16.180]  pastor Baldwin former Constitution Party presidential candidate of course and
[1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:19.900]  will someone demonize is very evil along with Ron Paul and myself my
[1:34:19.900 --> 1:34:24.380]  homeland security but first off this whole North Korea thing will probably
[1:34:24.380 --> 1:34:28.780]  blow over but it shows how it's the greatest rhetoric since that war ended
[1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:33.020]  more than 50 years ago and you notice they're putting al-Qaeda in in the
[1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:36.300]  Middle East and the AP says don't call them al-Qaeda don't even call them
[1:34:36.300 --> 1:34:41.620]  Islamist they're good guys the CFR says quote we need al-Qaeda the new enemy is
[1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:47.180]  the American people I mean this is earth shaking off the charts you know
[1:34:47.180 --> 1:34:52.180]  congressional investigation freaking out oh my gosh they want to use homeland
[1:34:52.180 --> 1:34:56.700]  security as a coup d'etat against America I mean that's what it is instead
[1:34:56.700 --> 1:35:01.300]  it's like yeah now we fight returning veterans take all their guns and take
[1:35:01.300 --> 1:35:07.660]  their kids I mean this is civil war stuff but despite all that we need to
[1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:11.620]  just pray move forward speak out and resist because you wouldn't have the
[1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:15.260]  White House demonizing alternative media attacking drudge saying they're
[1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:20.500]  causing us problems when we're on drudge every week attacking us as well if we
[1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:24.460]  didn't have power and when I say hey there's not many of us actually fighting
[1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:29.020]  that's saying hey join us look we're only few that are actually prominent but
[1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:33.220]  we are hundreds of millions worldwide that know about liberty if we just speak
[1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:38.860]  out the enemy can be defeated there are different forces in the world it's not
[1:35:38.860 --> 1:35:44.180]  just evil and we just give the world over to evil the truth is folks I've
[1:35:44.180 --> 1:35:48.420]  confronted the new order over and over again and because I don't have fear I
[1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:51.460]  only have fear of them winning I only have fear of my weakness and my
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:56.180]  failure and and my dirty rags you know that are my best works but my spirit I
[1:35:56.180 --> 1:36:00.220]  mean when I see Christians having their children taken for no reason or I see
[1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:02.940]  people having their kids taken for not taking vaccines when there's no law I
[1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:07.740]  sit there and go to bed early and I don't recall it depressed they'll come
[1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:11.940]  take my guns I mean I feel it and people like oh that's wimpy don't care about
[1:36:11.940 --> 1:36:16.700]  other people it's because I am strong ladies and gentlemen that I burn with
[1:36:16.700 --> 1:36:21.740]  something beyond hatred or even love total commitment against these people and
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:28.980]  just the anger that my flesh is so weak it can't work 18 hours a day every day
[1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:33.620]  and that I cannot express to you the things I've researched and I know but I

[1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:24.940]  get pastor Chuck Baldwin on last week when I saw this article Franklin Graham on
[1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:28.860]  the wrong side of the Bible in history he's come out calling for a massive
[1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:32.460]  restriction of the second amendment the official Catholic newspaper we're gonna
[1:39:32.460 --> 1:39:37.620]  show that has come out and said quote repeal the second amendment you've got
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:43.460]  every denomination I know of I can't go to a church a Baptist church a Pentecostal
[1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:48.820]  church a Bible church without hearing government worship and and I for one
[1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:52.220]  have had enough okay and he wrote the book Romans 13 the true meaning of
[1:39:52.220 --> 1:39:56.260]  submission we also sell that an info or store.com great book to give to your
[1:39:56.260 --> 1:40:01.140]  pastors but but they're they're under 501c3 government funding but now they're
[1:40:01.140 --> 1:40:05.620]  coming out after the guns we've got to go after them and I wanted to ask pastor
[1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:09.740]  Baldwin biblically he doesn't really need an introduction here on this
[1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:14.580]  broadcast he's a radio talk show host syndicated columnist of course I've been
[1:40:14.580 --> 1:40:18.300]  a pastor many years in Florida now he's out in the mountain area building a
[1:40:18.300 --> 1:40:21.300]  remnant community out there staunch defender of the Bill of Rights
[1:40:21.300 --> 1:40:25.980]  Constitution Chuck Baldwin live.com I wanted to ask him in this great time of
[1:40:25.980 --> 1:40:32.020]  evil what do we do what does he think we should do because there is a purge
[1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:36.620]  against constitutional it's begun and as every other authoritarian regime it
[1:40:36.620 --> 1:40:41.300]  starts quietly you know a lot of times that the arrest that you know for petty
[1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:46.340]  made-up stuff starts and no one even covers it and no one recognizes it
[1:40:46.340 --> 1:40:51.140]  until it just becomes overwhelming or the dictatorship collapses so pastor
[1:40:51.140 --> 1:40:54.820]  Baldwin thank you so much for coming on with us. Hey great to be with you Alex
[1:40:54.820 --> 1:40:58.340]  thank you very much. Well you just heard that seven-minute intro there Rob is
[1:40:58.340 --> 1:41:01.620]  talking about all this where do you want to start first I mean it's like the
[1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:05.740]  damn broke the hedge is being lifted evil is flooding in and the preachers
[1:41:05.740 --> 1:41:12.140]  are all bought off. Yeah unfortunately the 501c3 tax exempt status has made
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:18.860]  slaves out of most pastors and churches they fear the IRS they fear the loss of
[1:41:18.860 --> 1:41:24.140]  their tax exempt status and so when they get into the pulpits they are afraid to
[1:41:24.140 --> 1:41:27.580]  discuss anything that might be controversial plus let's not forget
[1:41:27.580 --> 1:41:31.500]  this there's a lot of people out there in the congregations that are very weak
[1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:36.380]  very wishy-washy they do not want to hear the hard issues a lot of pastors
[1:41:36.380 --> 1:41:41.820]  are definitely afraid of offending their own congregations and they're afraid of
[1:41:41.820 --> 1:41:46.060]  losing the tithes and offerings of people they're afraid of the
[1:41:46.060 --> 1:41:50.980]  controversy that may erupt inside the congregation that combination has
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:56.180]  completely neutered the pulpits of America and you're right the churches
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:42:02.140]  and the pastors of America are literally contributing to the decline of our
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:07.340]  liberties here in this country today. It's now come out that the official
[1:42:07.340 --> 1:42:12.780]  communist Chinese government is advising Obama on gun policy if you just
[1:42:12.780 --> 1:42:16.260]  tuned in folks just the people's daily repeatedly it's been national news a few
[1:42:16.260 --> 1:42:22.140]  months ago they are now demanding every Hollywood film be put by them no form of
[1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:27.700]  communism or authoritarianism can even be shown forget criticizing communist
[1:42:27.700 --> 1:42:33.260]  China nothing can be shown we're now not just run by the New World Order here the
[1:42:33.260 --> 1:42:38.820]  communist Chinese that own our debt are occupying us and and the reason I bring
[1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:44.140]  that up is look at this the preachers are afraid to say anything that offends so
[1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:48.180]  now they're banning Lego toys of Jabba the Hut because some Muslims said it was
[1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:52.100]  supposed to be a Muslim just out of the clear blue sky political correctness is
[1:42:52.100 --> 1:42:57.100]  political control the Soviet Union called it political correctness and and and
[1:42:57.100 --> 1:43:01.220]  so now the preachers are like I don't want to offend anyone that's been used
[1:43:01.220 --> 1:43:05.140]  as a weapon to where now they can't even teach marriage they they won't even
[1:43:05.140 --> 1:43:09.460]  criticize abortion because it might offend someone now they're taking the
[1:43:09.460 --> 1:43:12.900]  crosses out of churches all over America I know you know about that
[1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:18.340]  initiative I mean this is it the do you agree the takeover is now happening oh
[1:43:18.340 --> 1:43:23.020]  there's no question I think it's been happening Alex you know back up years
[1:43:23.020 --> 1:43:27.060]  ago when when I was running for president 2008 I was going around the
[1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:31.740]  country and talking to pastors and I I couldn't tell you how many of them would
[1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:36.460]  say well you know we believe in what you stand for and and we know that you're
[1:43:36.460 --> 1:43:41.620]  speaking the truth and we know that we need change and blah blah blah but you
[1:43:41.620 --> 1:43:45.740]  know after all we're 501 C3 and we can't get involved and you know so we'll
[1:43:45.740 --> 1:43:51.300]  just pray for you so again that 501 C3 tactics and status has been the tool
[1:43:51.300 --> 1:43:56.140]  that Lyndon Johnson first created back in the 1950s that he knew what would
[1:43:56.140 --> 1:44:00.900]  happen he knew it would neuter and control the pastors and churches that's
[1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:04.860]  exactly what it's done and now when you get guys like Franklin Graham and
[1:44:04.860 --> 1:44:10.180]  Richard Land who by the way is a member of the CFR as you know coming out saying
[1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:15.500]  that they support Barack Obama's gun control initiatives especially the
[1:44:15.500 --> 1:44:21.820]  universal background check it shows the power that the government has over many
[1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:26.060]  of these evangelical leaders by the way Alex that's why my son Tim and I have
[1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:31.340]  written a brand-new book called to keep or not to keep why Christians should not
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:35.500]  give up their guns it's a brand-new book it's just about to be released from the
[1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:38.460]  prayer I want to carry it I want to carry it because we carry your book on
[1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:42.980]  Romans 13 absolutely very exciting this is going to be a blockbuster because we
[1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:47.700]  go into the New Testament the Old Testament the entire scripture and we
[1:44:47.700 --> 1:44:51.860]  prove conclusively that nowhere does the Bible teach that Christians should
[1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:57.100]  surrender their guns to any would be tyrant that we go into in-depth it's a
[1:44:57.100 --> 1:45:01.180]  blockbuster book there's nothing like it in print and when Christians get a
[1:45:01.180 --> 1:45:05.380]  hold of this and even non-Christians they're going to realize that natural
[1:45:05.380 --> 1:45:11.220]  law biblical law revealed law is on the side of the Second Amendment and so this
[1:45:11.220 --> 1:45:13.660]  is going to be a book that's really going to help people understand the
[1:45:13.660 --> 1:45:17.660]  issue and somebody needs to send a copy to Franklin Graham by the way we're going
[1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:22.420]  to talk about that coming up here in a moment but I'm sure you're familiar with
[1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:27.020]  it but I followed it but I talked to vets every day who's had a leg blown off
[1:45:27.020 --> 1:45:30.900]  or something they get them to say they're depressed and they take their
[1:45:30.900 --> 1:45:35.020]  child even though their wife is fine they're not just taking veterans guns
[1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:40.460]  now they're also taking their children and then you see cases where anti-
[1:45:40.460 --> 1:45:44.540]  government parents engineers with no criminal record Air Force veteran they
[1:45:44.540 --> 1:45:48.100]  took their kids yeah from the government that it had them for a year and then
[1:45:48.100 --> 1:45:51.500]  they demonize info wars.com because the guy that sticker at his house in
[1:45:51.500 --> 1:45:56.620]  Florida and I mean are they gonna like come grab my kids and say I'm anti
[1:45:56.620 --> 1:46:00.580]  government it's like well they're go your kids to a reeducation camp I mean
[1:46:00.580 --> 1:46:04.460]  they're just hiding this pure authoritarianism in plain view and
[1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:09.820]  every TV show now demonizes Christians demonizes pro-lifers demonizes gun
[1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:13.860]  owners I mean it's it it's like the running man or something you turn on any
[1:46:13.860 --> 1:46:19.060]  show and they're demonizing patriots and saying we're terrorists I mean this is
[1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:23.900]  twilight zone level yeah it is and what's what's amazing to me relative to
[1:46:23.900 --> 1:46:28.460]  the way you started the discussion here with pastors is do these pastors really
[1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:34.060]  think that by them sitting back and not speaking up and not taking a stand that
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:37.500]  they're going to be spared do they really think that they're going to be
[1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:42.460]  overlooked you know what you and I think this is very comparable to the Nazi
[1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:48.220]  Germany period of history when there were some 14,000 evangelical churches in
[1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:54.140]  Germany at the time and of the 14,000 evangelical churches in Nazi Germany was
[1:46:54.140 --> 1:47:02.460]  becoming Nazi Germany only 800 resisted Adolf Hitler that's about 5% now
[1:47:02.460 --> 1:47:08.780]  think about it Alex if 25% had a resisted Hitler if 50% had a resisted
[1:47:08.780 --> 1:47:12.860]  Hitler in the entire history of the world would have been changed but because
[1:47:12.860 --> 1:47:18.140]  the pastor said and did nothing Hitler was allowed to cease control of the
[1:47:18.140 --> 1:47:22.860]  government and then the country and enact all these 20 million they were
[1:47:22.860 --> 1:47:28.620]  like 75 million Germany counting 2 million soldiers lost 20 million people
[1:47:28.620 --> 1:47:33.940]  talk about a judgment talk about doing nothing and it's the same story over and
[1:47:33.940 --> 1:47:38.420]  over and authoritarians every time come after Christians that you know that's the
[1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:44.060]  point is that you're never going to do enough for them exactly exactly my
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:47.700]  point and that's what the preachers don't understand they think that by
[1:47:47.700 --> 1:47:52.540]  remaining neutral and trying to maintain politically correct messages etc.
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:57.220]  that they are somehow going to be spared any of this they're in denial well
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:00.340]  it's also a cop-out they go we're trying to win souls yeah we know the evil's
[1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.900]  taken over I went to a big church this weekend with Dave Mustaine when he was
[1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:06.420]  down pretty good sermon overall like the preacher but I saw the assistant
[1:48:06.420 --> 1:48:11.220]  preacher and stuff looking at us like scared like oh my gosh there's Alex Jones
[1:48:11.220 --> 1:48:14.660]  man that guy's trouble and I didn't do anything or say anything I you know I
[1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:17.900]  just you know went and checked out that church because my wife likes it but my
[1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:21.540]  point is is that I've friends and family that go to Baptist churches they get
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:25.620]  letters going don't even talk about politics at church dinners I mean this
[1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:32.340]  is the Soviet Union and then and as you know the Thomas Jefferson didn't even
[1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:37.580]  say religion shouldn't be involved in things it said government cannot be
[1:48:37.580 --> 1:48:41.740]  involved in religion as the first amendment states Congress shall make no
[1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:45.900]  law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise
[1:48:45.900 --> 1:48:49.540]  thereof but they've taken separation of church and state and made a debate about
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:53.860]  does it exist or not when it never even meant that it meant the government has
[1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:59.980]  no jurisdiction but they trick people into 501c3 they stop being a church and
[1:48:59.980 --> 1:49:05.460]  become a charity yeah that's exactly right that's exactly right they're not
[1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:10.860]  a church there are a government corporation the pastor is not a pastor
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:16.140]  he is a he is a corporate officer same with the deacons the elders they are
[1:49:16.140 --> 1:49:21.500]  viewed as corporate officers of the state and I really I really believe in
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:26.220]  this is kind of harsh for me to say but I mean I'm in the hardest battle for for
[1:49:26.220 --> 1:49:31.020]  so long and I really believe I'm about to tell you Alex I really believe that at
[1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:39.140]  the heart of the problem our pastors and churches today are state worshipers
[1:49:39.140 --> 1:49:44.580]  they are I really believe that they do not worship the king of the universe the
[1:49:44.580 --> 1:49:48.740]  king of kings and lord of lords they pretend that they do they get they sing
[1:49:48.740 --> 1:49:53.100]  songs they have praise services you know they have worship services they talk
[1:49:53.100 --> 1:49:58.700]  about Jesus they preach the gospel etc but every time when push comes to shove
[1:49:58.700 --> 1:50:03.780]  and you got to make a decision government is going to be the one that you
[1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:09.540]  saw that's right you who you serve is who you obey exactly right exactly right
[1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:13.340]  and who you give preference and who you give loyalty to and who you give
[1:50:13.340 --> 1:50:17.020]  sovereignty to and what's happened in our churches today is that they have
[1:50:17.020 --> 1:50:21.340]  fallen for this erroneous Romans 13 interpretation that Tim and I wrote
[1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:25.500]  about and you sell the book on your show and so many of your read listeners and
[1:50:25.500 --> 1:50:31.300]  readers have purchased it that Romans 13 misinterpretation has propagandized
[1:50:31.300 --> 1:50:35.820]  the church indoctrinated the church to the point that they're no longer able
[1:50:35.820 --> 1:50:40.100]  to properly analyze government from a biblical point of view it was Hitler's
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:45.820]  most quoted passage in his radio addresses do what I say Romans 13 do
[1:50:45.820 --> 1:50:49.380]  what I say Romans 13 when it's we're gonna talk about that but first the gun

[1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:49.780]  this is a short segment we're gonna have you with us into the next hour of
[1:55:49.780 --> 1:55:53.460]  Pastor Dixon who was persecuted the biggest Baptist Church or biggest church
[1:55:53.460 --> 1:55:57.340]  in the country period because he wouldn't be under government control thought
[1:55:57.340 --> 1:56:02.020]  I was in America but but but get into Franklin Graham your article the
[1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:05.500]  Southern Baptist Convention coming out and saying get rid of the Second
[1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:11.540]  Amendment I mean this is incredible yeah absolutely I think it's imperative that
[1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:15.300]  Christians and non-Christians alike understand that this is a very very
[1:56:15.300 --> 1:56:20.540]  serious attempt to dismantle the Second Amendment and unfortunately we have many
[1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:24.780]  evangelical leaders such as Franklin Graham Richard Land and many others who
[1:56:24.780 --> 1:56:29.860]  I have taken the position that the state is always right and that you never
[1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:34.620]  resist you never question the state and if the state says that you are to
[1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:38.380]  register your guns then you supposed to register your guns if a universal
[1:56:38.380 --> 1:56:42.980]  background checked in then so be it as we know the FEMA camps have been I'm
[1:56:42.980 --> 1:56:48.980]  excuse the FEMA has been instructing pastors for many years and schooling
[1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:54.500]  them in when the president declares a national emergency the asking the
[1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:59.580]  pastors to instruct the congregations to surrender their firearms this has been
[1:56:59.580 --> 1:57:03.980]  going on for years you've been reporting on this for years so by and by the way
[1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:07.940]  four years before it was declassified we broke it with Pastor Butch Paul
[1:57:07.940 --> 1:57:12.460]  yourself and others here on Genesis and we broke it nationally but people
[1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:16.580]  couldn't believe hundreds of pages of training manual they found out the
[1:57:16.580 --> 1:57:19.580]  pastor went and threatened him kicked him out of the hospital where he did
[1:57:19.580 --> 1:57:24.540]  free ministry for people and it gets worse there's the red light FEMA
[1:57:24.540 --> 1:57:29.420]  training to take guns and have pastors prepared for it they're planning to come
[1:57:29.420 --> 1:57:33.780]  for the guns this is like catching you know the Nazis you know infiltrating the
[1:57:33.780 --> 1:57:38.660]  White House or the chai comms I mean this shows the authoritarian creeping
[1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:42.140]  nature that they're they're waiting for these shootings which a lot of them
[1:57:42.140 --> 1:57:46.860]  they're staging yeah yeah there is whether they're staged or not the
[1:57:46.860 --> 1:57:51.180]  result is the same they're using the opportunity to come after the people's
[1:57:51.180 --> 1:57:55.780]  guns and this is where I think that the book that Tim and I have written is so
[1:57:55.780 --> 1:58:01.420]  important Alex instructing Christians that know where does the Bible teach
[1:58:01.420 --> 1:58:05.620]  that they are supposed to surrender their guns and even in the Garden of
[1:58:05.620 --> 1:58:10.220]  Gethsemane when Jesus said to Simon Peter put up thy sword they that live by
[1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:14.420]  the sword die by the sword that has been misinterpreted so much by Christians
[1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:18.020]  through the years it has nothing to do with surrendering your guns in fact
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:24.020]  Simon Peter kept his sword he put it in a scabbard Jesus protected him the power
[1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:28.660]  of his voice knocked over the soldiers that came to arrest them Simon Peter and
[1:58:28.660 --> 1:58:32.540]  the other disciple that was armed walked out of the Garden of Eden with their arm
[1:58:32.540 --> 1:58:37.660]  by the way it was against Roman law for them to carry a Roman slowly they were
[1:58:37.660 --> 1:58:46.020]  slaves they were captured stay there you are listening to GCN visit GCN live

[2:01:11.740 --> 2:01:15.500]  Romans 13 full of all the quotes to give to these preachers they already know
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:19.420]  the truth but again they don't really want to be preachers they want to be
[2:01:19.420 --> 2:01:24.260]  married to the state they are high priest of the state-run churches let's go
[2:01:24.260 --> 2:01:29.300]  back to Chuck Baldwin Chuck you were trying to get into Romans 13 what should
[2:01:29.300 --> 2:01:32.340]  we be saying to Franklin Graham and the rest of these people that say you know
[2:01:32.340 --> 2:01:36.420]  turn your guns in the big Catholic newspaper said quote repeal the Second
[2:01:36.420 --> 2:01:41.860]  Amendment yeah yeah what are they gonna do with with the words of Jesus when he
[2:01:41.860 --> 2:01:46.740]  told the disciples that if they needed to sell their clothes whatever they had
[2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:51.460]  to do go buy a sword what are they gonna do with that what are they gonna do with
[2:01:51.460 --> 2:01:56.060]  with the fact that Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old Testament
[2:01:56.060 --> 2:02:02.860]  and we have the command of God in the Old Testament of many of the delivers
[2:02:02.860 --> 2:02:08.780]  of Israel to arm themselves and to defend and to conquer God never told his
[2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:13.700]  people to lay down but never they always resistant if you are going to take out
[2:02:13.700 --> 2:02:18.740]  of the Bible all of the stories of resistance you would reduce the Bible
[2:02:18.740 --> 2:02:23.860]  by probably 60 or 65 percent many of the great stories that we revere as
[2:02:23.860 --> 2:02:27.940]  Christians in the word of God both Old and New Testaments have to do with
[2:02:27.940 --> 2:02:32.100]  resisting civil authority all the way from Daniel that's right the authorities
[2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:36.820]  are always resisted and always you know put in the block but the love stuff turn
[2:02:36.820 --> 2:02:40.580]  the other cheek is with your family with people around you trying to work
[2:02:40.580 --> 2:02:45.980]  things out that's where a correct pastor we see the turning the other cheek not
[2:02:45.980 --> 2:02:50.900]  letting people set you up go ahead well yeah and and all this is covered in our
[2:02:50.900 --> 2:02:54.100]  book to keep or not to keep why Christians should not give up their guns
[2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:57.580]  we go into all these passages of scripture and we deal with them
[2:02:57.580 --> 2:03:03.100]  individually one by one and we show that it does not teach submission to tyranny
[2:03:03.100 --> 2:03:07.420]  that just the opposite is taught there was a revealed and natural law given by
[2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:13.020]  God for self-defense that is a an eight and a liable right weapons
[2:03:13.020 --> 2:03:17.380]  everywhere restrained evil as Thomas Jefferson said it is a biblical
[2:03:17.380 --> 2:03:21.700]  principle it is a natural law principle it's founded and grounded in the word
[2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:26.180]  of God in the precepts of scripture and for Christians to take the tack that
[2:03:26.180 --> 2:03:30.820]  government is God and that we are to do whatever government says regardless of
[2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:35.380]  how scriptural or unscriptural might be is idolatry I mean let's call it what it
[2:03:35.380 --> 2:03:40.860]  is Alex it's idolatry it is the worship of the state and I'm what I'm concerned
[2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:45.260]  about is that there are many pastors and Christians out there that really aren't
[2:03:45.260 --> 2:03:51.380]  maybe in their hearts understanding what they're doing but they've been taught
[2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:55.820]  this so long and so often that they just think that's the only accepted the
[2:03:55.820 --> 2:04:00.940]  theology they've never been taught anything else that's why in 1775 and
[2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:06.340]  76 Jonas Clark had instructed his congregants at the church of Lexington
[2:04:06.340 --> 2:04:12.780]  for years before the events of April 19 1775 on Lexington Green which took
[2:04:12.780 --> 2:04:16.180]  place right in front of the church house where those men worshipped every
[2:04:16.180 --> 2:04:20.940]  Sunday and so whenever that day came and they can they marched on Concord to
[2:04:20.940 --> 2:04:25.060]  seize the arms they were able to stand in front of them those men and men that
[2:04:25.060 --> 2:04:29.380]  were mainly the church congregation of the church of Lexington pastor Jonas
[2:04:29.380 --> 2:04:33.340]  Clark they were able to do that because the pastor had taught them the
[2:04:33.340 --> 2:04:37.580]  principles of liberty for many many many years well most of the militias were
[2:04:37.580 --> 2:04:41.560]  led by the preachers that's why the king of England said damn these black

[2:09:51.500 --> 2:09:57.780]  evil this country has rationalized and rationalized now I want to read to you
[2:09:57.780 --> 2:10:02.260]  the the in fact you guys pull up the first amendment online for me I need to
[2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:05.780]  have my pocket constitutions normally normally in here somebody somebody

[2:10:08.900 --> 2:10:14.980]  constitution first amendment starts with Congress shall make no law respecting
[2:10:14.980 --> 2:10:19.660]  the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[2:10:19.660 --> 2:10:23.260]  and then it goes on or freedom of the press freedom of assembly or the right
[2:10:23.260 --> 2:10:28.140]  to you know assemble the redress of grievances but but you there it is
[2:10:28.140 --> 2:10:31.020]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[2:10:31.020 --> 2:10:34.380]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abusing the freedom of speech or the
[2:10:34.380 --> 2:10:37.460]  press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the
[2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:42.000]  government for redress of grievance now you never heard it was Congress shall
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.500]  make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:52.420]  exercise thereof this country you know my dad's family goes back to the Mayflower
[2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:56.140]  this is very rare by the way it's 200 plus thousand Americans are living had
[2:10:56.140 --> 2:11:01.260]  somebody on the Mayflower my mother had two people on the Mayflower forget his
[2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:04.540]  name the barrel maker and the famous woman they got married the lowest gun the
[2:11:04.540 --> 2:11:08.740]  totem pole was the barrel maker they got married that's my ancestors and then
[2:11:08.740 --> 2:11:14.020]  my dad's side kind of a scoundrel of a guy but the captain of the Mayflower now
[2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:18.980]  the whole point here is ladies and gentlemen they had gone and my mother's
[2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:22.940]  gone and visited where my family it was from in England and then went over to
[2:11:22.940 --> 2:11:27.100]  the Netherlands she's been over there you know where they have the original
[2:11:27.100 --> 2:11:32.020]  little you know churches of the Pilgrims they were going all over the place
[2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:35.820]  trying to just try to read the Bible and not worship government because
[2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:39.500]  everywhere else you had a government-run church and they spied on you they
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:42.860]  didn't teach the Bible didn't matter whether it was England's fake Protestant
[2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:46.500]  churches and from their perspective the Catholic Church all of it it all
[2:11:46.500 --> 2:11:51.220]  became political and so that happened so I want to explain something to you this
[2:11:51.220 --> 2:11:55.540]  country was founded on religious freedom and they could still never get it in the
[2:11:55.540 --> 2:11:59.180]  colonies because people would take over and try to make you follow their their
[2:11:59.180 --> 2:12:05.100]  version so when you see the churches saying we're 501c3 which just turns
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:09.060]  them into a government charity a government corporation see in the 50s
[2:12:09.060 --> 2:12:12.500]  they all the denominations said side on to this you still get your tax exemption
[2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:16.380]  and they got tricked oh really and it was a contract fraud going from a church
[2:12:16.380 --> 2:12:21.420]  outside jurisdiction into a contract now Pastor Greg Dixon had the biggest
[2:12:21.420 --> 2:12:27.060]  standalone church in the country it was all over 60 minutes you name it anti
[2:12:27.060 --> 2:12:30.780]  globalist anti-New World Order you know just Bible believing biggest church in
[2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:37.500]  Annapolis Baptist temple 8,000 plus member 41 years and his son now pastors
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:42.100]  it but it's it's a you know but they had been 501c3 and he you know tell the
[2:12:42.100 --> 2:12:45.220]  story better than I and then I've got Chuck Baldwin with him to go back and
[2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:49.820]  forth here but the point is is that they they came and took their church now
[2:12:49.820 --> 2:12:53.980]  they said well you've got to pay taxes their church members paid the fake
[2:12:53.980 --> 2:12:58.700]  income tax but it's not the church's job to collect it and run it that's in
[2:12:58.700 --> 2:13:04.460]  Gentry's hermitage and now you see the churches of America starting to say you
[2:13:04.460 --> 2:13:08.780]  know abortions good you know turn our guns in are good they're not even
[2:13:08.780 --> 2:13:12.780]  churches and and in just a decade this has happened and now they have the
[2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:16.780]  clergy response teams mainstream news telling your flocks turn your guns in
[2:13:16.780 --> 2:13:20.980]  it's of the Lord America the National Catholic Review repeal the Second
[2:13:20.980 --> 2:13:25.660]  Amendment this is happening and and whether you're Catholic Protestant
[2:13:25.660 --> 2:13:29.980]  whatever it is and even if you're not a quote Christian you better be concerned
[2:13:29.980 --> 2:13:33.740]  because when the church has become state run you've got authoritarianism now
[2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:36.780]  Chuck Baldwin you want to introduce this topic and because I know you're an
[2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:41.060]  expert on as well and then bring up Pastor Greg Dixon a graduate of the
[2:13:41.060 --> 2:13:45.820]  Baptist Bible College Springs filled Missouri in 1953 and of course I mean
[2:13:45.820 --> 2:13:48.660]  the famous Baptist preacher in his own right I'm not going to go over his whole
[2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:53.300]  his whole bio there was a 91 day quote siege where they wouldn't leave the
[2:13:53.300 --> 2:13:58.420]  church and but the media called it a siege like they were terrorist and we'll
[2:13:58.420 --> 2:14:02.860]  give you their website as well I mean I'm ranting here because this is so
[2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:08.580]  evil and it's just accepted now so so explain what's happening here and did I
[2:14:08.580 --> 2:14:13.220]  break it down correctly Pastor Chuck Baldwin yeah yes you did and Greg and I
[2:14:13.220 --> 2:14:17.900]  go back a long ways he's a dear friend I'm glad you got him on everybody should
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:23.060]  be familiar with this story what you said is exactly right Greg Dixon was
[2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:29.180]  preaching the gospel without the 501c3 tactics in status the tax issue that
[2:14:29.180 --> 2:14:33.740]  you described was was what happened and they came in and by the way people need
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:38.540]  to realize that this took place under the Bush administration and GW Bush in
[2:14:38.540 --> 2:14:44.380]  fact this is one of the first things that the new GW Bush administration did
[2:14:44.380 --> 2:14:51.180]  was seized in anapolis Baptist temple first time in history that a church in
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:56.380]  the United States had been seized by the federal government and that happened
[2:14:56.380 --> 2:15:00.380]  under a Republican presidential administration and we know why because
[2:15:00.380 --> 2:15:03.180]  they were getting ready with the faith-based initiative to buy off the
[2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:07.260]  churches so they had to get rid of the major group that was resisting it I
[2:15:07.260 --> 2:15:13.060]  think they wanted to make Greg an example he was the guy that they saw as
[2:15:13.060 --> 2:15:17.020]  the thorn in their side and and they wanted to make him an example that's
[2:15:17.020 --> 2:15:21.460]  exactly what they did they didn't kill the church his son is still pastoring
[2:15:21.460 --> 2:15:24.980]  they're still growing they're still preaching they're still winning souls
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:29.140]  are doing a great job for the Lord but they definitely seized the church and
[2:15:29.140 --> 2:15:34.260]  they they sent a message to preachers all over America that you better you
[2:15:34.260 --> 2:15:38.620]  know kowtow to the IRS so we're gonna come and get you and again spun in the
[2:15:38.620 --> 2:15:42.420]  media like they stole money and demanded millions every dime had been paid to the
[2:15:42.420 --> 2:15:47.340]  offshore Federal Reserve crime group they just had the members of the church
[2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.980]  individually do it because Congress can make no law respecting an establishment
[2:15:50.980 --> 2:15:53.380]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:58.300]  Pastor Greg Dixon thank you for joining us today I want to get into your story
[2:15:58.300 --> 2:16:02.860]  for people but you you broke it all down or you could say prophesied it wasn't
[2:16:02.860 --> 2:16:06.860]  hard to do that that as you guys went down the church would become a pure
[2:16:06.860 --> 2:16:11.940]  organ of Satan and now by and large it has become that well thank you very
[2:16:11.940 --> 2:16:15.620]  much I appreciate being on the program today and appreciate the great work that
[2:16:15.620 --> 2:16:22.420]  you're doing thank you sir I'm holding in my hands right here the front page of
[2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:28.740]  the Indianapolis Star February at Wednesday February the 14th 2001 the
[2:16:28.740 --> 2:16:36.740]  headline says fed sees Baptist temple and the front page and it has the picture
[2:16:36.740 --> 2:16:44.060]  you have yours 100 federal marshals came in and broke down the doors of the
[2:16:44.060 --> 2:16:48.780]  Indianapolis Baptist temple and it says fed sees Baptist temple well they
[2:16:48.780 --> 2:16:54.220]  didn't thank God they didn't see if they didn't see as the Baptist temple they
[2:16:54.220 --> 2:17:00.500]  did carry some of us out and but we were seeing worshiping together the next
[2:17:00.500 --> 2:17:06.540]  night at the Jonathan birds cafeteria the convention center out there so they
[2:17:06.540 --> 2:17:10.660]  stole the land in the building they did worshiping together ever since yeah so
[2:17:10.660 --> 2:17:17.420]  they did they did sees the buildings and sold off six million dollars worth of
[2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:22.660]  property 22 acres of land right in the middle of Indianapolis and sold it for
[2:17:22.660 --> 2:17:27.380]  a million and a half and there's where we had a Christian school they now have
[2:17:27.380 --> 2:17:30.780]  a charter school we say they have a communist school now where we were
[2:17:30.780 --> 2:17:35.660]  teaching the Bible they're teaching atheism where we were teaching the free
[2:17:35.660 --> 2:17:39.240]  enterprise system they're teaching communism where we were teaching
[2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:43.340]  creationism they're teaching Darwinism so anyway they've got their charter
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:48.820]  school there now but the church is still going right on praise God for that but
[2:17:48.820 --> 2:17:53.020]  nevertheless the church is still there I think it's very important and it's
[2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:59.860]  good to be united with my good friend Chuck Baldwin again it's we've been
[2:17:59.860 --> 2:18:04.060]  good friends for a long long time we were comrades together in arms with more
[2:18:04.060 --> 2:18:09.700]  majority back in the 80s it's always going to be with Chuck again and he's a
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:14.740]  great soldier of the cross I'm gonna show you that but I think it's important
[2:18:14.740 --> 2:18:20.380]  for people to understand that in under under communism in China they had the
[2:18:20.380 --> 2:18:26.100]  three-self movement the three-self movement was this state recognized
[2:18:26.100 --> 2:18:33.860]  churches state finance churches and then the church was to espouse state
[2:18:33.860 --> 2:18:39.460]  propaganda that's exactly what we have in America we have state recognized
[2:18:39.460 --> 2:18:49.740]  churches through incorporation through 501c3 recognition under the IRS then
[2:18:49.740 --> 2:18:55.380]  you've got state finance through churches through the tax deductible gift and
[2:18:55.380 --> 2:19:02.460]  tax exemption and then the churches are to espouse federal public policy now
[2:19:02.460 --> 2:19:06.980]  that's exactly where we are the reason that the churches won't take a stand and
[2:19:06.980 --> 2:19:11.620]  the pastors won't take a stand is because they don't want to give up their
[2:19:11.620 --> 2:19:17.860]  tax exemption and they don't want to give up their tax deductible gifts because
[2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:24.700]  this is all of the all of the religious organizations in America who are not
[2:19:24.700 --> 2:19:29.500]  churches they couldn't exist without the tax deductible they're worshiping the
[2:19:29.500 --> 2:19:34.900]  golden calf that's right and the churches could not exist without the
[2:19:34.900 --> 2:19:39.700]  tax deductible gift the first Baptist Church of Dallas downtown Dallas they
[2:19:39.700 --> 2:19:47.340]  have just built a massive massive new building project right downtown Dallas

[2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:36.740]  info wars news.com and prison planet dot TV Chuck Baldwin's right and shotgun
[2:24:36.740 --> 2:24:40.260]  with us for another 20 minutes or so and then we're gonna go right up to near the
[2:24:40.260 --> 2:24:43.980]  end of the show with dr. Dixon I have a couple special reports I'm gonna air
[2:24:43.980 --> 2:24:48.940]  before the main broadcast ends but here's my bottom line pastor Dixon I
[2:24:48.940 --> 2:24:52.940]  want you to recap your story and the now easy happening with the churches and
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:58.460]  then get pastor Baldwin's take on it but it's simple people that give in to
[2:24:58.460 --> 2:25:03.700]  corrupt governments they get totally overrun because then even more evil
[2:25:03.700 --> 2:25:07.460]  people who will push it further will get into government and then more evil and
[2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:12.320]  more evil so you end up getting kind of a survival of the most evil and that's
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.340]  why you end up with human sacrifice in every culture mass death worship of
[2:25:16.340 --> 2:25:23.420]  government and this worship of government is is is the opposite of what was
[2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:27.540]  you know given to the Israelites by God was the first time you don't worship
[2:25:27.540 --> 2:25:31.380]  government you worship God you know it's like they said that hey Saul you don't
[2:25:31.380 --> 2:25:37.620]  want a king Israel you don't want a king and you follow what God says and so no
[2:25:37.620 --> 2:25:42.260]  one can then dispute that and so we we are the sovereigns here with only God
[2:25:42.260 --> 2:25:46.340]  above us not the state above us because whoever you put above you is God and
[2:25:46.340 --> 2:25:50.780]  we've now made the state God and it's now acting like God and it's now saying
[2:25:50.780 --> 2:25:56.100]  it's God and Chris Rock is saying Obama is our father no El Hefe is not my father
[2:25:56.100 --> 2:26:01.220]  okay okay my physical father's David Jones but my spiritual father is Jesus
[2:26:01.220 --> 2:26:04.980]  Christ what do you say to that well what you're saying is absolutely correct
[2:26:04.980 --> 2:26:11.540]  but we're but see we we're going through the same thing that Daniel went to with
[2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:16.020]  Nebuchadnezzar that the three Hebrew children went through that that the
[2:26:16.020 --> 2:26:20.660]  pastors went through with Hitler and let me read it to you let me let me show
[2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:28.500]  you what I'm talking about in 1998 under Clinton under the Clinton
[2:26:28.500 --> 2:26:35.300]  administration this has all been documented in the the all of the
[2:26:35.300 --> 2:26:45.020]  alphabet soup agencies including the CIA the FBI the IRS under the clan under
[2:26:45.020 --> 2:26:50.340]  the Janet Reno Justice Department came together together in the White
[2:26:50.340 --> 2:27:00.020]  House and the the not-for-profit division of the IRS that controls 750,000
[2:27:00.020 --> 2:27:06.740]  churches in America and their purpose of the meeting was to devise a plan
[2:27:06.740 --> 2:27:14.300]  classified as top secret called Operation D and that to devise a plan to
[2:27:14.300 --> 2:27:21.100]  control all uncooperative churches in America incredible to put together a
[2:27:21.100 --> 2:27:32.420]  plan and they said that their plan was it was a a five pronged plan it included
[2:27:32.420 --> 2:27:36.380]  the financial power of the IRS international pressures using the
[2:27:36.380 --> 2:27:40.660]  treaty powers of the UN the investigative and intelligence forces of
[2:27:40.660 --> 2:27:47.500]  the FBI CIA and NSA the judicial and prosecutorial assets of the US Justice
[2:27:47.500 --> 2:27:53.100]  Department and federal courts and congressional legislations now they
[2:27:53.100 --> 2:27:59.940]  used all five of these against our church to bring us down our church was the
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:08.940]  first church that they used to bring pressure and to muscle us down after a
[2:28:08.940 --> 2:28:12.060]  church this is pure thought this is pure authoritarianism when when when
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:16.660]  reporters get detained in China it's national news but then we get arrested
[2:28:16.660 --> 2:28:20.460]  trying to do interviews we're trying to hand out literature now or get tickets I
[2:28:20.460 --> 2:28:25.780]  mean we have become an authoritarian state now prior to this T can in Texas
[2:28:25.780 --> 2:28:32.380]  and I'm not going to this in great detail but prior to this an organization
[2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:38.540]  called T can in Texas went through thousands and thousands and thousands
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:45.140]  of United Nations documents and came to the conclusion that the goal of the
[2:28:45.140 --> 2:28:55.420]  United Nations is to eliminate every local church on earth to eliminate every
[2:28:55.420 --> 2:29:00.020]  local church on earth now that's what they're that's what this whole issue of
[2:29:00.020 --> 2:29:08.260]  Islam is about right now they're using Islam now to destroy Christianity and
[2:29:08.260 --> 2:29:11.700]  then they'll turn around after they get through with that then they'll get a
[2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:15.980]  better then they'll end up then they'll get then they will destroy Islam but
[2:29:15.980 --> 2:29:19.980]  right now they're using Islam to destroy exactly notice how they can't have
[2:29:19.980 --> 2:29:23.980]  Legos of Jabba the hutch saying it's anti Islam has nothing to do with Islam
[2:29:23.980 --> 2:29:28.620]  they're using it as political correctness to bring in and say you can't
[2:29:28.620 --> 2:29:33.380]  criticize Islam out of the Bible or or you can't criticize homosexuality or you
[2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:37.260]  can't because that you know that violates hate speech to shut down and

[2:33:55.540 --> 2:33:59.660]  out multi-generation Christians from Ukraine who had gone hundreds of miles
[2:33:59.660 --> 2:34:06.620]  into the mountains in Siberia to survive and this is the type of world we're
[2:34:06.620 --> 2:34:13.300]  talking about and I think about my listeners the family the Hakin family
[2:34:13.300 --> 2:34:17.780]  where they claim they were at a tea party event they read of their hotel room
[2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:20.780]  and found a small amount of marijuana they're both engineers he's an Air Force
[2:34:20.780 --> 2:34:25.180]  veteran probably isn't even true and because I grew up in Dallas with the
[2:34:25.180 --> 2:34:29.500]  cops with plant drugs on people and witnessed it and I'm not saying all
[2:34:29.500 --> 2:34:33.780]  police are bad but the state is bad those directing the state from on top are
[2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:41.580]  bad and I got physically it was beyond hatred beyond anger it's more of a
[2:34:41.580 --> 2:34:46.620]  sorrow but just sick of it like why are we so weak why have we let the evil get
[2:34:46.620 --> 2:34:51.460]  so bad and it was the realization last night that it's going to get so much
[2:34:51.460 --> 2:34:56.380]  worse folks because people think by giving into evil that that somehow it
[2:34:56.380 --> 2:35:00.420]  makes everything okay no no no it sinks to the bottom and I wanted to ask
[2:35:00.420 --> 2:35:05.060]  pastor Baldwin before we go back to Patrick Greg Dixon here of Chuck
[2:35:05.060 --> 2:35:08.220]  Baldwin live.com you can go to the biblical law center.com for
[2:35:08.220 --> 2:35:12.260]  pastor Dixon's excellent site and everybody needs to direct their pastors
[2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:15.540]  and preachers to this because I'm not even judging people that are 501c3 and
[2:35:15.540 --> 2:35:19.620]  don't really know or they don't really understand you need to go convict them
[2:35:19.620 --> 2:35:24.380]  you need to give the book Romans 13 to them you need to send them to the Bible
[2:35:24.380 --> 2:35:29.220]  Law Center because it was our churches that led the war against King George and
[2:35:29.220 --> 2:35:32.780]  it's going to be the churches that lead in the forced inoculation of the gun
[2:35:32.780 --> 2:35:37.460]  confiscation I can play newscast where they say we are training for gun
[2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:41.220]  confiscation forced inoculation and to tell the families to go to the FEMA
[2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:45.820]  Center it's of the Lord Romans 13 do it's told and I've played that clip
[2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:49.420]  probably a hundred times just type in clergy response team into YouTube you'll
[2:35:49.420 --> 2:35:56.340]  get the newscast four years after we broke it okay it's so creepy that they've
[2:35:56.340 --> 2:36:00.740]  been training the preachers to tell their flocks just like in red dawn they
[2:36:00.740 --> 2:36:04.500]  use the mayor and the preacher when the Soviets take over to go I mean this is
[2:36:04.500 --> 2:36:09.940]  classic right out of an authoritarian novel that's when I'm getting it it's
[2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:14.580]  got people got to wake up what do you call waking up or being in denial
[2:36:14.580 --> 2:36:18.180]  because the people are given a great delusion I mean the Bible talks about
[2:36:18.180 --> 2:36:22.420]  they were given great delusion you've got to be in a flaming delusion to not
[2:36:22.420 --> 2:36:27.140]  see that evil is just going hog wild and that it's going to persecute good
[2:36:27.140 --> 2:36:31.780]  people even if you go along with the New World Order but secretly love God and
[2:36:31.780 --> 2:36:35.420]  you have a good heart they're coming after you that's what I'm seeing the
[2:36:35.420 --> 2:36:41.180]  system releases criminals pays al-Qaeda murder Christian communities in Syria I
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:47.740]  mean the system hates good people and not all departments are like this but you
[2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:51.500]  can see like the Bible says certain cities get taken over by evil you can see
[2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:55.260]  the evil cities versus the ones that aren't fully taken over but the body
[2:36:55.260 --> 2:37:01.220]  snatcher operation is ongoing in every town now evil is on the offense right
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:05.220]  now and I want to ask who will you know lift up a standard the spirit of the
[2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:10.180]  Lord to lift up a standard of when the enemy comes in like a flood pastor yeah
[2:37:10.180 --> 2:37:16.180]  absolutely and the only ones to do that are the pastors they are the key back
[2:37:16.180 --> 2:37:22.340]  in 1775 and 76 if it were not for the colonial pastors the so-called black
[2:37:22.340 --> 2:37:26.620]  robe regiment there would have been no Bunker Hill that have been no Lexington
[2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:30.660]  Green though there have been no Concord Bridge no declaration of
[2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:35.100]  independence no Constitution there have been no United States of America it was
[2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:39.900]  the pastors of colonial America that literally led the war for independence
[2:37:39.900 --> 2:37:45.140]  they preached they taught they exemplified many of them participated and
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:48.900]  the enemy knows that that's why they're going after him today absolutely that's
[2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:53.380]  why they're they're neutered and that was such a stroke of diabolical genius
[2:37:53.380 --> 2:38:00.460]  back in the 1950s when Lyndon Johnson created the 501c3 taxes in status it
[2:38:00.460 --> 2:38:04.700]  really was from a diabolical point of view it was a stroke of genius because
[2:38:04.700 --> 2:38:10.140]  what it did it allowed the government to control the churches and the preaching
[2:38:10.140 --> 2:38:16.220]  especially the preaching of the churches via the threat of the loss of tax
[2:38:16.220 --> 2:38:23.860]  exempt status with the IRS codes 501c3 so what's happened since and coupled
[2:38:23.860 --> 2:38:29.340]  with the Romans 13 misinterpretation obeyed the government no matter what
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:34.940]  what you have is a double whammy against the pastors and churches and the
[2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:41.540]  result is what we have today a neutered silent scared pitiful pathetic pulpit
[2:38:41.540 --> 2:38:48.460]  until the pastors begin to awaken energize their congregations and have you
[2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:53.300]  heard churches all over the place are being told pull the crosses out I mean
[2:38:53.300 --> 2:38:57.700]  I mean I mean pretty soon there'll be nothing I've heard of that and I you
[2:38:57.700 --> 2:39:02.100]  know I keep hearing more and more of this type of activity taking place and you
[2:39:02.100 --> 2:39:05.420]  gotta ask yourself where's it gonna stop and the fact is it's never gonna stop
[2:39:05.420 --> 2:39:09.260]  but these churches have been indoctrinated also in the universities
[2:39:09.260 --> 2:39:14.100]  and the Christian colleges and the seminaries it's all about success Alex
[2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:19.700]  it's about money it's about 401k retirement it's about insurance plans it's
[2:39:19.700 --> 2:39:23.380]  about getting ahead it's about using the current well they could just turn the
[2:39:23.380 --> 2:39:27.620]  church into a swingers club then maybe that get more people in the door well
[2:39:27.620 --> 2:39:31.260]  unfortunately there's probably too much of that going on too but but the fact is
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:35.700]  that that what they've done is that they've created this this social
[2:39:35.700 --> 2:39:41.580]  organization that is is success oriented it's it's all about climbing the ladder
[2:39:41.580 --> 2:39:47.260]  just like a businessman who wants to you know further his business absolutely I
[2:39:47.260 --> 2:39:50.260]  want to bring you back in a moment to talk about the Second Amendment issue
[2:39:50.260 --> 2:39:55.060]  with Pastor Dixon but let's get Pastor Dixon's take on this how do we reverse
[2:39:55.060 --> 2:39:58.900]  this these points I've made the persecution of good people is accelerating
[2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:06.060]  but not only that many of these men even fundamentalist men are sincere in
[2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:14.660]  believing that soul winning is the most important thing therefore they are
[2:40:14.660 --> 2:40:20.980]  justified in in taking these not-for-profit gifts they are justified
[2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:28.460]  in compromising so to speak as long as they're winning souls and they we've
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:35.420]  got to somehow break through this this malice somehow we have to break through
[2:40:35.420 --> 2:40:40.060]  see for instance the preachers are saying well they're not telling me what
[2:40:40.060 --> 2:40:48.020]  to preach well that's like saying well they're not telling me not to speed well
[2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:54.740]  you drive down the highway and you see a speed limit sign it says 50 miles an
[2:40:54.740 --> 2:41:00.420]  hour speed limit but just because a policeman doesn't come to you personally
[2:41:00.420 --> 2:41:07.700]  and say you're not to speed that doesn't mean you're not supposed to speed well
[2:41:07.700 --> 2:41:12.820]  just because the head of the IRS the not-for-profit division of the IRS
[2:41:12.820 --> 2:41:17.140]  doesn't come to you and say personally to you or you don't get a letter from
[2:41:17.140 --> 2:41:22.860]  them saying you're not to espouse public federal public policy or that you're
[2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:28.700]  not supposed to endorse candidates or specific legislation doesn't mean that
[2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:34.340]  you're not supposed to do those things you you can read the contract you you
[2:41:34.340 --> 2:41:38.620]  can read what the law says now for instance that's right you've signed a
[2:41:38.620 --> 2:41:42.480]  covenant so don't cop out and say you haven't and look what's happened to the
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:47.140]  churches and look at how selectively all the pro-abortion all the anti-gun
[2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:51.620]  churches they can say who to vote for but if you get a constitutional church
[2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:56.340]  out there saying something here comes the IRS what's the IRS doing in a church
[2:41:56.340 --> 2:42:01.260]  the answer is you're not a church now you are a government corporation that's
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:07.380]  exactly correct now let me show you the IRS is keep every single preacher in
[2:42:07.380 --> 2:42:15.740]  America who speaks out on any public policy issue and it gets in the newspapers
[2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:23.980]  it gets on television or radio the IRS is keeping a file on that preacher the
[2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:31.020]  date that they gave that speech or the sermon whether it was on the internet
[2:42:31.020 --> 2:42:34.780]  or wherever it was let me give you an example that's church police that's
[2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:40.220]  absolutely correct I there was a kept a secret file on me that went clear back
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:45.060]  to 1971 I'm just going to give you a few of the headlines that was out of the
[2:42:45.060 --> 2:42:54.340]  Indianapolis Star 1971 Baptist high school to stress Bible 1978 Reverend
[2:42:54.340 --> 2:43:01.100]  Dixon fights daycare license 1978 church plans tech school 1981

[2:43:24.540 --> 2:43:30.340]  governor or and they're putting this in the newspaper because it's as if as if
[2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:34.900]  it's a list of your crimes oh my gosh a church went down and rallied against
[2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:38.900]  pornography they're not allowed to do that I mean what country is this what
[2:43:38.900 --> 2:43:44.980]  we're what's the world coming to a church against pornography now listen to
[2:43:44.980 --> 2:43:50.180]  this one how many churches how many preachers Chuck have you heard say well
[2:43:50.180 --> 2:43:55.060]  but when they tell me they can't I can't preach against homosexuality I'll do
[2:43:55.060 --> 2:44:03.100]  something listen to this one gaze urge panel to include them in anti-bias bill
[2:44:03.100 --> 2:44:10.180]  but guess what old big mouth was there it was opposed by Reverend and Greg Dixon
[2:44:10.180 --> 2:44:17.180]  1990 that was the headlines in the Indianapolis Star now this was just a
[2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:21.060]  few of them I don't I'm not gonna take time on the broadcast today to read all
[2:44:21.060 --> 2:44:28.260]  of them this was in this this was in we got this through discovery this was in
[2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:35.420]  our file we got through discovery they kept a secret file on me since 1971 you
[2:44:35.420 --> 2:44:38.780]  think they don't have a file on Chuck Baldwin you don't think they have a
[2:44:38.780 --> 2:44:43.300]  child file on Jeffers first Baptist Church in Dallas you don't think they
[2:44:43.300 --> 2:44:47.340]  have a file on every preacher in America that's speaking out on these public
[2:44:47.340 --> 2:44:52.500]  issue policy issues listen fusion centers that that term comes directly out
[2:44:52.500 --> 2:44:56.580]  of East Germany they when I first heard this 12 years ago I didn't believe it I
[2:44:56.580 --> 2:45:00.980]  looked up the federal purchase orders they hired Marcus Wolf for three years to
[2:45:00.980 --> 2:45:05.380]  set up Homeland Security the former head of the Stasi this is directly out of
[2:45:05.380 --> 2:45:10.900]  East Germany they actually set up what we're now seeing launch in America
[2:45:10.900 --> 2:45:17.340]  absolutely absolutely and you can say all you want to about well we're gonna
[2:45:17.340 --> 2:45:22.460]  get some Pri at some attorney to help us we're gonna get some some attorney to
[2:45:22.460 --> 2:45:27.500]  fight for us these attorneys will run they'll have their tail between their
[2:45:27.500 --> 2:45:32.540]  legs because in the first place they're gonna the minute you get into court
[2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:36.780]  they're gonna say you signed the contract you signed the contract isn't that the
[2:45:36.780 --> 2:45:41.380]  problem in America is that I mean I don't think of myself as a tough guy or
[2:45:41.380 --> 2:45:44.780]  something but I have no fear of them coming after me what may be in the
[2:45:44.780 --> 2:45:50.020]  newspaper they may set me up I just have peace other than wanting to resist
[2:45:50.020 --> 2:45:53.820]  them I don't have peace there what happened to the spirit in America
[2:45:53.820 --> 2:45:58.180]  because because I'm a pretty wicked devil and I absolutely in my heart want
[2:45:58.180 --> 2:46:02.420]  to resist these people in my soul where are the men today where are the people I
[2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:06.220]  mean they don't even hardly protest abortion anymore in this country where
[2:46:06.220 --> 2:46:11.580]  is it I guess we're just going down that's one of the reasons that see when
[2:46:11.580 --> 2:46:16.420]  we were when we were the Bible says rebellion is worse than witchcraft when
[2:46:16.420 --> 2:46:24.100]  our church was it was a corporation a 501 C3 non-profit corporation we obeyed
[2:46:24.100 --> 2:46:30.820]  all the laws we withheld taxes we did everything we dotted every dot I we
[2:46:30.820 --> 2:46:35.820]  crossed every T we did everything but when we unincorporated when we got out
[2:46:35.820 --> 2:46:43.500]  of the system when we were no longer a 501 C3 we said no more we didn't do any
[2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:47.740]  of those things we stopped being a federal tax collector for the government
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:56.980]  we stopped we stopped paying the collecting federal income tax and our
[2:46:56.980 --> 2:47:02.500]  position was that these people are not employees their ministers they spin it
[2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:07.260]  like it's it's it's it's demonic to resist a corrupt government but but I
[2:47:07.260 --> 2:47:10.900]  mean resisting is one thing I mean obviously we're belling against God is
[2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:15.340]  super evil but but but they they call churches rebellious that don't submit to
[2:47:15.340 --> 2:47:19.340]  the government what do you say to that Romans 13 issue well in the first place
[2:47:19.340 --> 2:47:25.260]  if you've signed the contract you better obey the contract but that's what the
[2:47:25.260 --> 2:47:30.140]  that's what the biblical law center does we help churches to organize and
[2:47:30.140 --> 2:47:35.020]  reorganize so they can get so they can be free from five and they're doing that
[2:47:35.020 --> 2:47:40.780]  successfully by the thousands so well I can't I'm not saying we're doing it by
[2:47:40.780 --> 2:47:43.660]  the thousands there are a lot of churches starting and a lot of the ones
[2:47:43.660 --> 2:47:46.340]  that are I mean I got friends right out here that go to churches that have been
[2:47:46.340 --> 2:47:51.020]  around for decades than our 501 C3 I know but there's more to it than just I
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:56.140]  mean there's you've got to you've got to that's why the biblical law center is
[2:47:56.140 --> 2:48:02.380]  trying to it's more to it than just I'm telling you there's more to it we'll
[2:48:02.380 --> 2:48:05.700]  get you on we'll get you on for a full hour sometime just to get into the law
[2:48:05.700 --> 2:48:08.780]  aspects I know you've been through it yourself you're the experts on it but
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:12.220]  I wanted to get Chuck Baldwin steak here on the state of the Second Amendment and
[2:48:12.220 --> 2:48:17.460]  they get your take Pastor Dixon I mean now the churches well let me ask Dixon
[2:48:17.460 --> 2:48:21.500]  briefly what do you make of the first you know the Southern Baptist and all
[2:48:21.500 --> 2:48:24.580]  the rest of them coming out and saying basically turning your guns to the
[2:48:24.580 --> 2:48:32.660]  government well the first place we're seeing now a a specific line between
[2:48:32.660 --> 2:48:37.300]  fundamentalists and evangelicals and we've been trying to tell them that all
[2:48:37.300 --> 2:48:42.300]  along there's a difference between fundamentalists and evangelicals and so
[2:48:42.300 --> 2:48:48.300]  these wimpy evangelicals now are whipping out and so it's so we're
[2:48:48.300 --> 2:48:53.660]  seeing it now and so the evangelicals they they want to be seen as these nice
[2:48:53.660 --> 2:48:59.740]  guys and go along guys and to get along guys and so they're saying well we can
[2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:03.060]  we can give in and we can give in on it and they're doing the same thing on the
[2:49:03.060 --> 2:49:09.740]  immigration they're saying well I was a stranger and we took them in well I
[2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:15.020]  appreciate that verse but it doesn't mean that you have to take some wicked
[2:49:15.020 --> 2:49:20.020]  people into your home and turn your children over to some predator just
[2:49:20.020 --> 2:49:25.020]  because the Bible says I saw a stranger and we took them in it doesn't mean that
[2:49:25.020 --> 2:49:30.540]  point is it's globalism it's pure UN ecumenical takedown of America and it's
[2:49:30.540 --> 2:49:36.500]  all moving now and it should be an alarm bell if your church is telling you you
[2:49:36.500 --> 2:49:40.780]  should know guns ask why the government has guns we're supposed to be the
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:44.620]  government you say render unto Caesar we are the government the bill of rights is
[2:49:44.620 --> 2:49:49.140]  the government that's what you follow that's the biblical law not the law of
[2:49:49.140 --> 2:49:56.700]  the satanic you in pastor Baldwin yeah it's thanks Alex this this is a new
[2:49:56.700 --> 2:50:00.580]  issue that I'm just really passionate about right now because I think this is
[2:50:00.580 --> 2:50:05.700]  the defining issue for the future liberty and freedom of our country the
[2:50:05.700 --> 2:50:11.340]  the semi-automatic rifle is the most efficient the most effective self-defense
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:16.460]  tool in modern time it is equivalent to the Roman sword of the first century
[2:50:16.460 --> 2:50:22.500]  Jesus commanded the disciples to to buy the Roman sword and to possess the
[2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:26.660]  Roman sword I would remind people that back in the Old Testament in Genesis 14
[2:50:26.660 --> 2:50:31.500]  back before the the law of Moses or anything of that nature when lot was
[2:50:31.500 --> 2:50:37.860]  taken by five heathen kings he armed his servants he Abram they went after them
[2:50:37.860 --> 2:50:44.980]  they they took them to the battlefield they fought he slaughtered the kings he
[2:50:44.980 --> 2:50:52.260]  rescued lot by by the power of the sword the the ability to defend oneself is a
[2:50:52.260 --> 2:50:57.980]  fundamental natural law principle that is given by God whether we're Christian
[2:50:57.980 --> 2:51:02.340]  or non-Christian and no matter what our denomination or lack thereof the right
[2:51:02.340 --> 2:51:08.100]  to self-defense is sacrosanct it is sacrosanct absolutely and it is given
[2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:14.660]  by God and and for preachers to acquiesce on this issue is absolutely in my
[2:51:14.660 --> 2:51:20.100]  opinion blasphemous against the laws of God and unfortunately Greg I think you'd
[2:51:20.100 --> 2:51:25.380]  admit with me that there are many of our brethren in the fundamentalist ranks
[2:51:25.380 --> 2:51:31.780]  that have capitulated on this issue just as evangelicals well I haven't heard I
[2:51:31.780 --> 2:51:36.420]  haven't heard in our unregistered church preachers no maybe not those guys no
[2:51:36.420 --> 2:51:40.500]  not those unregistered guys I'm sure they have it but there's a lot of guys
[2:51:40.500 --> 2:51:43.980]  that would call themselves fundamentalists that teach this asinine
[2:51:43.980 --> 2:51:48.700]  interpretation of Romans 13 that no matter what the government declares that
[2:51:48.700 --> 2:51:52.340]  you are to submit and I've known some of these guys I know some of these guys
[2:51:52.340 --> 2:51:57.020]  personally well I would say that I'd call them I'm putting them over the
[2:51:57.020 --> 2:52:02.340]  evangelical camp well it's just to be clear here across the board guys
[2:52:02.340 --> 2:52:07.940]  undoubtedly what do you call this massive explosion of evil moving on all
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:12.980]  fronts swarming us what do you call that in history and biblically what we're
[2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:19.100]  going into a quickening and acceleration but Jesus said that in the last days many
[2:52:19.100 --> 2:52:27.260]  many will fall away and we're living in that day that many many are falling
[2:52:27.260 --> 2:52:31.700]  away this is in the great falling away that they will not come until they come
[2:52:31.700 --> 2:52:37.020]  a falling away first and that's exactly what we're seeing well I think I think
[2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:46.660]  we're also seeing the age-old principle of self-promotion the idea that I am
[2:52:46.660 --> 2:52:52.220]  going to get ahead I'm going to be prospered I'm not going to endanger
[2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:57.660]  myself I'm not going to risk anything I think that's innate in many people that
[2:52:57.660 --> 2:53:02.180]  it's they don't want to risk they don't want to endanger themselves don't they
[2:53:02.180 --> 2:53:06.660]  know fortune favors the bold and I mean our fortune is liberty yeah no well no
[2:53:06.660 --> 2:53:11.460]  they don't they they you know it's for so long they have been taught and
[2:53:11.460 --> 2:53:16.100]  indoctrinated in this principle of submission to government this has been
[2:53:16.100 --> 2:53:21.420]  going on for nearly a hundred years I mean this you got to go back to the war
[2:53:21.420 --> 2:53:25.180]  between the states probably before you found preachers that were really
[2:53:25.180 --> 2:53:29.100]  talking about this since then the preachers haven't been talking about
[2:53:29.100 --> 2:53:33.420]  this just the opposite Alex they've been talking about some to the government
[2:53:33.420 --> 2:53:38.340]  the government is good the government is of God don't resist do what they this
[2:53:38.340 --> 2:53:43.820]  has been indoctrinated in them for a hundred and fifty years probably I'm not
[2:53:43.820 --> 2:53:46.260]  on some high horse because I'm not a preacher I'm not perfect but I have a
[2:53:46.260 --> 2:53:49.860]  relationship you know with God and I love you know innocent people want to
[2:53:49.860 --> 2:53:53.860]  protect them yeah I don't know how you couldn't have burning in your bones to
[2:53:53.860 --> 2:53:57.580]  resist what's happening and I don't know how these preachers can actually be
[2:53:57.580 --> 2:54:02.100]  saved Christians and sit there and promote all this evil Pastor Dixon what
[2:54:02.100 --> 2:54:10.220]  do you say to that well all I can say is that I'm not gonna say that they're not
[2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:14.940]  saved but I'm gonna say they're sure they're sure deceived and the Bible
[2:54:14.940 --> 2:54:19.660]  says that deceived and being deceived and I'll guarantee you they need to get
[2:54:19.660 --> 2:54:24.140]  back and take a new look at what the scriptures teach but I think it's just
[2:54:24.140 --> 2:54:30.500]  a total misunderstanding of the whole purpose of the Christian life and the
[2:54:30.500 --> 2:54:36.020]  Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you and Paul the Apostle said
[2:54:36.020 --> 2:54:42.420]  ye have not yet resisted under blood and that we're to resist even unto blood
[2:54:42.420 --> 2:54:48.260]  that's what Paul the Apostle said and we're to resist with everything that
[2:54:48.260 --> 2:54:53.860]  was that is within us and we've just become so soft we have everything is so
[2:54:53.860 --> 2:54:57.340]  sure the Bible doesn't say lick the devil's boots and he'll flee from you
[2:54:57.340 --> 2:55:04.660]  that's right that's right and everything we we're everything is so soft today we
[2:55:04.660 --> 2:55:10.020]  have such soft lives every soft man manner soft that's right and we've
[2:55:10.020 --> 2:55:16.700]  become so feminized as men and we've we've just we've we're enjoying we're
[2:55:16.700 --> 2:55:21.460]  at ease and Zion that's that's what the Bible says it says we're at ease and
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:28.540]  Zion and the scripture says that Ephraim turned back in the days of battle and
[2:55:28.540 --> 2:55:34.460]  that's where we are we are not at ease I'm not at ease I mean I just I don't
[2:55:34.460 --> 2:55:39.140]  know how anybody can be at ease when you hear evils rising all around us Alex
[2:55:39.140 --> 2:55:44.460]  let's remember to the let's let's focus again on the importance of standing for
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:48.460]  the Second Amendment I just can't stress this enough oh yeah they get that
[2:55:48.460 --> 2:55:56.140]  they get everything we we must draw our line in the sand on this issue I mean I
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:00.580]  have publicly said and I've publicly written you you've read my stuff and
[2:56:00.580 --> 2:56:07.900]  you see what I I am willing to be a lawbreaker when they tell me that my
[2:56:07.900 --> 2:56:14.060]  semi-automatic rifle to him is against the law I am willing to be a lawbreaker
[2:56:14.060 --> 2:56:21.180]  I will not submit to that law I will not register my rifles I will not surrender
[2:56:21.180 --> 2:56:24.900]  my right that's why they hate Heston so much he said for my cold dead hand it's
[2:56:24.900 --> 2:56:27.740]  that not submitting because they always want a little more a little more we
[2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:34.780]  said no no more you will not pass that's why again I have to say that's why Tim
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:39.220]  and I wrote the book to keep or not to keep why Christians should not give up
[2:56:39.220 --> 2:56:46.180]  their guns if we do not take a stand as a church on the the issue of the right
[2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:52.500]  to keep and bear arms and preach it from a biblical natural law perspective
[2:56:52.500 --> 2:56:57.420]  sure make people understand that they are morally justified they are
[2:56:57.420 --> 2:57:03.580]  spiritually justified in violating any law that requires them to surrender their
[2:57:03.580 --> 2:57:10.820]  guns if we don't take that stand and draw that line now there is no liberty left
[2:57:10.820 --> 2:57:15.340]  in America I cannot stress I want to state something it's so immoral because
[2:57:15.340 --> 2:57:19.980]  we know they want the guns to enslave us we know they're authoritarian so you
[2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:23.780]  were aiding and abetting the enemy and what they're going to do and that's why
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:27.740]  anyone that promotes it knowingly like these police chiefs and stuff that know
[2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:32.420]  they are active collaborators with the enemy they are globalist operatives and
[2:57:32.420 --> 2:57:36.300]  we know who runs the New World Order they are agents of Satan and we and that's
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:41.660]  not a verbal flourish these people are agents consciously of the devil go ahead
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.580]  well I appreciate I appreciate what you're saying but what you have to
[2:57:46.580 --> 2:57:52.020]  understand is and this may sound polyanna but the first amendment was
[2:57:52.020 --> 2:57:58.340]  written before the second amendment and I know they have the right I'm saying
[2:57:58.340 --> 2:58:02.540]  they want our guns to devour us I appreciate what you're saying but I
[2:58:02.540 --> 2:58:11.180]  want you to hear me for just a moment we gave up the first amendment now we
[2:58:11.180 --> 2:58:16.060]  didn't at the church the Bible says judgment must begin at the house of God
[2:58:16.060 --> 2:58:23.340]  that's right and the preachers gave up the first amendment and if we weren't
[2:58:23.340 --> 2:58:27.980]  willing to fight for the first amendment why do you think they're going to be
[2:58:27.980 --> 2:58:31.460]  willing to fight for the second amendment that's right I'm going to fight for the
[2:58:31.460 --> 2:58:35.420]  second amendment and I know that a lot of others that are as well five minutes

[3:01:27.020 --> 3:01:33.860]  Greg two minutes well I appreciate what Chuck said and I'm not talking about him
[3:01:33.860 --> 3:01:41.420]  I just want to reiterate what we were saying that the preachers I'm talking
[3:01:41.420 --> 3:01:46.420]  about the preachers if they if they're not willing to take a stand on the
[3:01:46.420 --> 3:01:52.060]  First Amendment and fight for God and the right to preach the gospel of the
[3:01:52.060 --> 3:01:57.980]  Lord Jesus Christ unfettered free from government why in the world do we think
[3:01:57.980 --> 3:02:00.940]  that they would be willing to fight for the Second Amendment that's the point
[3:02:00.940 --> 3:02:08.340]  that I'm trying to make and once again I rejoice that there are still programs
[3:02:08.340 --> 3:02:17.580]  like this one and we need to support Alex Jones and we need to stand and
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:21.140]  give thanks to the Lord that we still have freedom of the press in this
[3:02:21.140 --> 3:02:26.420]  country that we still have programs of this kind conservative broadcast
[3:02:26.420 --> 3:02:34.180]  conservative television we address that you go to our website the biblical
[3:02:34.180 --> 3:02:39.540]  lawcenter.com I'd like for you to get my book The Trail of Blood revisited how
[3:02:39.540 --> 3:02:45.340]  to be how to be free getting free from 501c3 yeah we need to carry that book
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:47.980]  because I've read excerpts and I'm down to read the whole thing I want to get
[3:02:47.980 --> 3:02:51.620]  you back on in the next month for a full hour on breaking the bonds of
[3:02:51.620 --> 3:02:55.180]  enslavement over the churches we'll talk to you very soon thanks for all the time
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:59.020]  Pastor Dixon thank you very much thanks for having you bet had the biggest
[3:02:59.020 --> 3:03:03.340]  church in the country and found out about all this did the right thing and
[3:03:03.340 --> 3:03:06.740]  it's now trying to bring the church out of bondage and again even if you don't
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:09.260]  believe in God folks when the government takes over the church you're in
[3:03:09.260 --> 3:03:13.780]  trouble final comments such Chuck Baldwin pastor Baldwin yeah Alex thanks a lot
[3:03:13.780 --> 3:03:17.940]  and Greg's a great man and I appreciate you having him on yeah I just think it's
[3:03:17.940 --> 3:03:22.460]  absolutely critical that we regardless of whether we call ourselves Christians
[3:03:22.460 --> 3:03:28.420]  or not whether we go to church or not that we understand the moral biblical
[3:03:28.420 --> 3:03:33.660]  principles that undergirding the Second Amendment that the battle is being
[3:03:33.660 --> 3:03:40.260]  waged right now over the right to keep and bear arms this is where the battle
[3:03:40.260 --> 3:03:45.300]  is raging we must not capitulate compromise or surrender this issue if we
[3:03:45.300 --> 3:03:50.220]  do there is no more freedom of any kind left in the United States and a lot of
[3:03:50.220 --> 3:03:55.500]  times I'm finding that many unsaved unchurched people are more willing to
[3:03:55.500 --> 3:04:00.140]  stand for the Second Amendment than many of my Christian brethren and I find
[3:04:00.140 --> 3:04:05.100]  that really disconcerting because they've got they've got instincts they've
[3:04:05.100 --> 3:04:10.380]  got good and they're good people who probably deep down love God absolutely
[3:04:10.380 --> 3:04:15.020]  right God fearing people I hear in our in our fellowship in the Flathead Valley
[3:04:15.020 --> 3:04:19.180]  of Montana Liberty Fellowship that I started a couple years ago we have
[3:04:19.180 --> 3:04:24.180]  people of all types that come to our fellowship some don't even profess to
[3:04:24.180 --> 3:04:28.860]  be Christian but they appreciate the Biblically based principles of liberty
[3:04:28.860 --> 3:04:33.740]  that we preach every Sunday afternoon from our pulpit that's live streamed at
[3:04:33.740 --> 3:04:38.820]  Liberty Fellowship Montana comm so I'm finding people of all kinds and all
[3:04:38.820 --> 3:04:42.340]  shapes and sizes that are willing to stand and I'm very encouraged by that
[3:04:42.340 --> 3:04:46.460]  what I'm not encouraged about is people like Franklin Graham and Richard Land
[3:04:46.460 --> 3:04:50.900]  and so many of these other preachers across America that are not willing to
[3:04:50.900 --> 3:04:55.460]  stand up in their pulpits for the Second Amendment so I encourage people if
[3:04:55.460 --> 3:04:59.300]  they're attending a church where the pastor is not standing up for the Second
[3:04:59.300 --> 3:05:17.860]  Amendment speak out speak out thank you pastor
