[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:35.320]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I tell you this is a mouthful
[00:35.320 --> 00:52.360]  right here Hillary protesters black transgendered lives matter chanting Hillary for prison that's
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.520]  all our country's about it's not about having privacy rights private property rights sovereignty
[00:57.520 --> 01:07.760]  we live under a fiat currency system but we can have black transgendered protesters saying Hillary
[01:07.760 --> 01:16.040]  for prison well I guess they've got that right Hillary Clinton as I said a few weeks ago really is
[01:16.040 --> 01:23.600]  very close to being destroyed politically in the mantle of her invincibility has certainly worn off
[01:23.600 --> 01:31.160]  in a big big way meanwhile Clinton's turning up her rhetoric and comparing pro-lifers to terrorists
[01:31.160 --> 01:38.000]  but Hillary doesn't care she's gone out on the campaign trail and also sent emails and made phone
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.160]  calls it's being reported by the Associated Press and others and also Bloomberg politics it's big
[01:44.160 --> 01:53.120]  red linked on drudgereport.com today Clinton camp claims it's already secured one fifth of the
[01:53.120 --> 02:01.680]  delegates needed for the nomination and basically says that she's already got the votes and that
[02:01.680 --> 02:08.360]  they're not going to be able to stop her so they better not try to push Joe Biden and of course the
[02:08.360 --> 02:15.880]  big goal there by Hillary is to put down the idea that there's a massive exodus away from her
[02:15.880 --> 02:24.120]  that's already happened if Hillary Clinton can be shot down this is a big big big political
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.080]  victory because she knows where the bodies are buried she runs a lot of the blackmail operations
[02:29.080 --> 02:37.280]  they have been in power now off and on for decades they need to go and as bad as Joe Biden is
[02:37.280 --> 02:47.960]  he can probably be beaten easier by a good Republican candidate than Hillary can because
[02:47.960 --> 02:55.080]  Hillary once she gets the nomination it's just going to become total cult worship get out on
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.840]  your belly bow to the idol of feminism it won't matter how criminal she is what a liar she is
[03:00.840 --> 03:07.440]  all the things she's done it's just going to be she's a woman this gimmick I'd vote for a woman in
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.960]  one second flat if she was like a Rand Paul I'd vote for a black guy one second flat I could
[03:12.960 --> 03:21.120]  care less just give me free market give me lower taxes get out of my life I will literally wash your
[03:21.120 --> 03:29.800]  feet I mean it's just ridiculous how they create identity politics to distract out of the issues I
[03:29.800 --> 03:36.760]  mean Republicans in the early 60s were ready to elect a Jewish guy named Mary Goldwater because he
[03:36.760 --> 03:43.560]  was smart articulate had a good voting record and was basically like Ron Paul and they actually ran
[03:43.560 --> 03:52.320]  campaign stuff claiming the Republicans that year were anti-submitting I went and watched a
[03:52.320 --> 04:02.560]  documentary last night called the best of enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley and I was
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.800]  really good actually and I have mixed feelings about Buckley I think he was good at many levels
[04:06.800 --> 04:14.120]  but kind of sold out on his hardcore libertarianism towards the end but hindsight 2020 it's just
[04:14.120 --> 04:19.080]  really weird to be sitting there in the movie theater and the movie ends with me the movie ends
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.560]  with Alex Jones I just thought it was really weird I mean it's getting to the point when you
[04:24.560 --> 04:31.960]  become like a card in the deck of culture that you turn on television you're on and that happened
[04:31.960 --> 04:37.080]  two days ago I don't watch much TV and you know the movies and you're at the end of it the movie
[04:37.080 --> 04:46.560]  ends with a clip of me ranting appears Morgan just really bizarre that is a very famous interview
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.800]  now they say it's one of the most famous TV moments ever I'm not bragging I'm just saying it's
[04:51.800 --> 04:59.920]  interesting and it shows the effect the info war has had thanks to you since yesterday's early
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.520]  morning Virginia news shooting we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan he exasperated
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.320]  his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter he was
[05:10.320 --> 05:14.720]  also reprimanded for wearing a president Obama badge during an election report in the report
[05:14.720 --> 05:19.320]  his supervisor writes this is a clear violation not only of shirts county policy but of standard
[05:19.320 --> 05:23.920]  journalistic ethics journalists and particularly reporters who appear on television must abide
[05:23.920 --> 05:29.240]  by a different standard president Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism what we know
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.040]  is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around this country worse any
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.320]  deaths that happen through terrorism the president added Trump responded by saying the problem is
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.920]  not guns it's mental illness which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the
[05:41.920 --> 05:46.440]  pier's Morgan show how about Prozac you know the number one that's the big sponsor isn't it don't
[05:46.440 --> 05:51.400]  want to talk about the US number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people

[08:25.760 --> 08:31.840]  and i'm your host alex jones thank you so much for joining us you notice i've been having
[08:32.480 --> 08:40.480]  harry dent i've been having peter shiff i've been having jeryl salente and others on we
[08:40.480 --> 08:46.560]  should get max keiser on he's been accurate in his predictions so far on the broadcast
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.520]  there's so much to cover but yesterday i only mentioned it a few times it really is the biggest
[08:53.520 --> 09:03.360]  news still china is dumping us securities not just bonds but other securities connected
[09:03.360 --> 09:09.360]  predominantly to the united states there's definitely a trade war on definitely a currency war
[09:09.360 --> 09:16.640]  with china but it's uon and japan uh with its yen and the united states with the dollar
[09:16.640 --> 09:24.560]  driving these down quickly there is a massive slowdown in raw material being mined being
[09:24.560 --> 09:32.560]  produced because there isn't a market for it the planet is in cardiac arrest industrially
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.200]  here in the united states in areas of wealthy europe if your middle class are wealthy you're
[09:39.200 --> 09:44.720]  not feeling it yet if you're a blue collar worker you're feeling it if you're a lower
[09:44.720 --> 09:51.600]  middle class person you're feeling it if you are a welfare recipient you're feeling it because the
[09:51.600 --> 09:58.960]  checks aren't growing for what real inflation is so we have deflation in the economy and in human
[09:58.960 --> 10:06.720]  activity there's a slowdown but there's also inflation in the currencies in the price of a pound
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.840]  of hamburger meat i mean anybody goes to the store you can see it and i thought is it just
[10:12.480 --> 10:17.200]  whole paycheck that's getting so it's expensive i'm gonna go to h e b and see if it's gone up in
[10:17.200 --> 10:25.360]  price gone up as well so h e b's a chain here in texas if you don't live here it's happening
[10:25.360 --> 10:34.640]  everything is going up except for commodities like fuel and that's because the economy is
[10:34.640 --> 10:41.680]  basically in a freefall this is a big big deal and it's a harbinger for things to come and if you
[10:41.680 --> 10:49.760]  go to info wars dot com we have reports on the subject but the place that really has the full
[10:49.760 --> 10:55.040]  breakdown on the stories i'm about to cover if you want to follow along with them is drudge report
[10:55.040 --> 11:04.880]  dot com exodus hundreds die just the last day as desperate immigrants head for europe boat packed
[11:04.880 --> 11:13.920]  with refugees smugglers beat migrants who beg for air desperate tide of humanity and there's video
[11:13.920 --> 11:21.680]  of women running into barbwire in turkey uh there's video of the boats capsizing there's video
[11:21.680 --> 11:26.560]  of just hundreds and thousands pouring over fences when i was in england
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.800]  they were trying to have everybody remain calm on bbc but you can see the concern
[11:33.440 --> 11:40.160]  where they've had to shut for months the main fairies and the tunnel because they cannot stop
[11:40.160 --> 11:47.520]  human waves of carjacking truckjacking north african and middle eastern immigrants just
[11:47.520 --> 11:56.800]  power surging through and if you just go to youtube and type in truckjacking uh or
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.960]  immigrants attack drivers in in spain or france i mean there's hundreds of videos shot by the
[12:02.960 --> 12:07.920]  truck drivers i've spent hours in fact we don't make a whole special on this just showing the
[12:07.920 --> 12:15.920]  the highlights of it it's scary and the mayor in the french town ordered the fairies shut a few
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.880]  months ago never time to try to reopen them it just surges again so england even though they want
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.400]  the illegals to get on the backs of the trucks and come in and they legalize them they don't
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.560]  want it to be too obvious because now they're just carjacking throwing the people out driving
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.760]  the trucks in and basically the british government just stands there and lets them do it i mean it
[12:35.760 --> 12:43.680]  is the collapse of society going on we can roll the footage for a tv viewer of just the surging
[12:43.680 --> 12:49.360]  and the carjacking and the and they're robbing each other and listen you can have a say a north
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.160]  african fishing boat that can hold 50 people maximum they'll try to put 200 in it and it'll
[12:54.160 --> 13:01.120]  sink 100 yards offshore that's how desperate these people are i wouldn't get in a boat with my kids
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.400]  if it obviously had water coming up to the edge because the first thing that happens when you
[13:06.400 --> 13:14.560]  hit any high waves you're dead how are you going to deal with people that desperate let me say when
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.280]  you look at these immigrants i'm not demonizing them i'm telling you the facts when you look at
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.560]  these immigrants from collapsing africa the middle east they're skinny folks they are almost look
[13:24.560 --> 13:31.680]  like concentration camp victims they're desperate every military report from the uk the us shows
[13:31.680 --> 13:38.080]  the same thing from world war two and other conflicts within seven days of no food law and
[13:38.080 --> 13:43.760]  order completely breaks down within 10 days almost anyone will kill anyone for food especially if
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.320]  you have kids you just won't want to do it but you'll go kill people and within 15 days 90 plus
[13:50.320 --> 13:57.760]  percent something like 97 depending on the study be resort to cannibalism let's say we got 49 people
[13:57.760 --> 14:04.000]  working in my office right now here at the info wars news center customer service writers camera
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  people anchors researchers producers video editors graphics people the shipping department it's all
[14:12.000 --> 14:26.320]  here in one place statistically something like 45 or 49 would end up eating each other and that's
[14:26.320 --> 14:34.160]  the same in your office and the same everywhere else and i don't know what the elites are thinking
[14:34.160 --> 14:40.560]  and i don't know about my office so we can all think about how barbarous humans are you know when
[14:40.560 --> 14:45.280]  they study humans they study rats rat colonies when they get up to a large enough number start
[14:45.280 --> 14:53.040]  having wars and then when they start starving they start first eating the other colony of rats
[14:53.040 --> 14:59.200]  and when they've eaten that colony they then turn on each other now rats will do something humans
[14:59.200 --> 15:04.800]  won't do though a mother rat will be the last one living knowing that she's got to get to a new
[15:04.800 --> 15:12.720]  place she will eat her babies and then find a male have sex and then flee in a random direction
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.360]  hoping to go have babies and survive so rats are even tougher than we are but not much
[15:17.360 --> 15:26.080]  you think elephants act like that no they don't lions don't act like that they won't eat each other
[15:26.080 --> 15:33.600]  they'll starve to death humans will eat each other and i'm here to tell you right now ladies and
[15:33.600 --> 15:41.360]  gentlemen the globalists did this on purpose they know if they continue to allow food and continue
[15:41.360 --> 15:47.440]  to allow the quote development of the third world that there'll be 20 billion people in 30 40 years
[15:48.720 --> 15:55.600]  so they have a plan to stop it at about 9 to 10 billion and out of the total insane crisis that
[15:55.600 --> 16:02.720]  comes they will bring in the total technological police state and so they're going to allow giant
[16:02.720 --> 16:08.000]  waves of immigrants in with the welfare with the incentives with the free housing oh they give the
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.480]  north african and islamic immigrants free housing in canada and other areas i have a news article
[16:14.480 --> 16:19.200]  today but if you're christian you are denied that is actually in the canadian newspapers
[16:20.800 --> 16:27.440]  you're a christian you don't get a free house you're an islamist you do you ask why is that
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.040]  because there's select groups they want to bring in for the culture war
[16:31.040 --> 16:38.080]  war i mean this is so diabolical
[16:41.040 --> 16:45.920]  and when they're done flooding the west with illegal invasions they'll use those people to
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.400]  divide and conquer politically conquer in a coalition government fractured government
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.240]  broken government system that larry nickles talks about the clinton strategy and the clinton
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.840]  chronicles divide and conquer and then they're going to shut the borders down totally fortress
[16:59.840 --> 17:05.200]  them and then that's when the bio weapons get released on the third world for those of you
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.760]  out there that are racist and don't like third world people they're going to kill all of them
[17:10.480 --> 17:15.680]  they're going to hit them with bio weapons and they've already been testing bio weapons like hiv
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.920]  and other things on them they've caught the un adding all sorts of sterilants to the vaccines
[17:19.920 --> 17:26.560]  that's been mainstream news but that's all just beta testing for the clash of civilizations
[17:26.560 --> 17:33.280]  they're going to clash the third world six and a half billion plus people about to be
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.960]  eight billion in just a few years and then ten billion in the third world they're going to allow
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.400]  controlled you can have a whole lake of water with strip mining with big fire hoses hitting the
[17:44.400 --> 17:51.200]  rocks to wash out the gold so they got a whole lake of six plus billion people you think it's
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.640]  bad them firing millions in a year that's a controlled stream out of the lake they're going to drain
[17:56.640 --> 18:01.920]  the lake and kill all those people i'm giving you their master plan right now but first they're
[18:01.920 --> 18:08.160]  going to fire them into the west to take the west down and i want to be clear i care about these
[18:08.160 --> 18:14.720]  people i have empathy it makes me sick watching the footage that comes out of africa as hundreds of
[18:14.720 --> 18:23.040]  people piling boats that can't carry half of them and hundreds died a day but what incentivized it
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.320]  was the west saying you get free welfare free housing come to germany come to idli come to spain
[18:29.040 --> 18:37.440]  come to france and yes it's true the globalists went into every country that tried to stabilize
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.280]  you can see what you want about south africa under apartheid it was building up all of africa
[18:41.280 --> 18:47.280]  not defending it not defending qaddafi and his socialism but he really lived in a tent
[18:47.280 --> 18:52.880]  had a small compound with a swimming pool and gave almost all of the country's money to the poor
[18:52.880 --> 18:59.120]  women in college real jobs highways aquifers jet aircraft jobs and that place was nice
[18:59.920 --> 19:05.840]  it's gone they admit it's totally destroyed he was giving loans and building up africa and
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.200]  building roads because he was a cocky peacock i don't think he was a bad guy i mean he he
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.760]  overall compared to the globalist he wanted to build up africa he wanted old-fashioned prosperity
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.280]  and i don't endorse socialism the only way it works is a philosopher king that has a bunch of
[19:23.280 --> 19:31.440]  resources like in the old days gold or water or you know his case oil and water big aquifer
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.000]  and he was just giving it all away he really was and they weren't going to allow that they
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.200]  went in there and killed him turned the jihadi's loose and that place is a hell all now and so
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.080]  yes africa is collapsing because the west has tried to keep it in squalor to politically
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.720]  control it it's clowered and pivot they want you poor they want you dumb they're doing the same
[19:50.720 --> 19:56.240]  thing here and they're going to bring in these populations now to basically set that up in the

[24:33.920 --> 24:38.640]  right now from virginia they ran out there to cover the press conferences in the event of course
[24:38.640 --> 24:45.280]  that happened a few days ago coming up again peter schiff will be joining us to take your phone
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.400]  calls and break down the ongoing financial unraveling and what china's doing announcing
[24:50.400 --> 24:58.480]  when it's starting to dump us treasury notes bonds as well we've got a lot on donald trump
[24:58.480 --> 25:06.800]  hillary clinton the pope coming but really the big issue the front and center at least for me
[25:06.800 --> 25:12.960]  and i want to get your take on this is the fact that whether it's the united states whether it's
[25:12.960 --> 25:24.240]  canada whether it is uh europe it's the exact same policy the most unskilled desperate immigrants
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.680]  are told if you can get here you can get put on welfare have your babies for free get housing
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.960]  and you can go run a little shop or something and make money on the side and get welfare
[25:34.960 --> 25:41.680]  and i don't blame these people trying to get here but it's caused such a flood that we have
[25:41.680 --> 25:48.560]  giant train loads of people hanging off from guatemala nicaragua el salvador coming up to texas
[25:50.480 --> 25:54.240]  and then the border patrols there to give them vouchers to put them on buses
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.280]  to bust in the democratic party headquarters and to the catholic church and to other churches
[25:59.280 --> 26:06.320]  to then bust them deeply into democrat controlled areas where democrats house them in their homes
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.160]  and get upwards of seven thousand dollars a month for three people i mean we broke all that we
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.480]  showed it in the news we showed the ads in the paper we showed them being loaded on the buses
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.840]  we showed the border patrol giving them the vouchers because the border patrol was ordered
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.880]  to do it they called us in to show it we broke that i'm not bragging i'm just saying the media knows
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.640]  about this remember the border patrol went on fox and said yes we complete the smuggling process
[26:32.640 --> 26:40.800]  it's illegal it's smuggling it's a felony if you or i got caught coyoteing 10 mexicans or 10 chinese
[26:40.800 --> 26:48.080]  in or 10 eastern europeans or 10 uh you know whatever if we did something like that it is
[26:48.080 --> 26:57.120]  a serious felony crime but when they do it because the president said so it's supposedly all right
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.160]  and there's wave after wave they made it about migrant children to manipulate your hearts
[27:02.800 --> 27:09.520]  that was only 17 of the immigrants coming in in the last year look it up they said look it's
[27:09.520 --> 27:19.840]  children obama says open your heart it's purely a manipulation there are so many people being born
[27:19.840 --> 27:26.800]  in the third world that the population basically doubles every 30 years i mean are we gonna have
[27:26.800 --> 27:33.040]  20 billion people come here and pay for it it's slavery you can't go there and do that
[27:33.040 --> 27:39.840]  if we would have just let the third world industrialized stayed out of it their population
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.560]  would have already started going down all the different metrics show that the royal commission
[27:44.560 --> 27:50.320]  on population by his royal highness 1949 the mother of queen elizabeth the father of queen
[27:50.320 --> 27:57.840]  elizabeth they both commissioned a 300-plus page report i've read it admitting that if they industrialized
[27:57.840 --> 28:04.160]  the third world that would cap world population at about five billion by the mid 1990s and their
[28:04.160 --> 28:09.760]  actuaries but that that would then make the third world independent and wealthy and not part of the
[28:09.760 --> 28:16.480]  central control so the decision was made to let population bloom to create even more cheap labor
[28:16.480 --> 28:34.240]  and squalor to control those populations so we sit here watching all of this unfold
[28:36.800 --> 28:43.440]  and you can say well be nice you're in a lifeboat it can hold 10 people safely maybe it can hold 15
[28:43.440 --> 28:49.040]  but if you hit really big waves you're going to swamp and go under if you put 20 in little waves
[28:49.040 --> 28:55.760]  will sink you the globalists are trying to put 30 people in a lifeboat that holds 10 they're trying
[28:55.760 --> 29:03.440]  to put 200 in a lifeboat that holds 100 we can show you the photos show you the videos of lifeboats
[29:03.440 --> 29:15.840]  absolutely jam packed with 200 300 people where they can't even breathe they're so sardined in
[29:18.480 --> 29:26.720]  150 plus thousand illegals on one greece island in the last two months lesbos
[29:26.720 --> 29:36.560]  this is what's happening and it's being incentivized and it's getting worse
[29:37.120 --> 29:45.600]  and it's going to absolutely devastate western civilization and it's not going to help anybody
[29:45.600 --> 29:49.440]  in these third world countries and they're going to be used as leftist operas here in the march
[29:49.440 --> 29:57.360]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.880 --> 30:03.200]  since yesterday's early morning virginia news shooting we now know more about the shooter
[30:03.200 --> 30:08.480]  fester lee flanagan he exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his
[30:08.480 --> 30:13.200]  inability to use a teleprompter he was also reprimanded for wearing a president obama badge
[30:13.200 --> 30:17.040]  during an election report in the report his supervisor writes this is a clear violation
[30:17.040 --> 30:21.840]  not only of shirts county policy but of standard journalistic ethics journalists and particularly
[30:21.840 --> 30:26.480]  reporters who appear on television must abide by a different standard president obama responded
[30:26.480 --> 30:30.880]  saying guns are worse than terrorism what we know is that the number of people who die from gun
[30:30.880 --> 30:35.200]  related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism the president
[30:35.200 --> 30:39.920]  added trump responded by saying the problem is not guns it's mental illness which echoes the
[30:39.920 --> 30:44.640]  infamous appearance alex jones made on the pierce morgan show how about prozac you know the number
[30:44.640 --> 30:49.120]  oh that's the big sponsor isn't it don't want to talk about the us number one cause of death is

[34:17.120 --> 34:26.640]  before i forget coming in to the office this morning actually hiking with my cousin buckley
[34:26.640 --> 34:33.360]  i do that a few days a week over some of the hills and little mountains around town outside town
[34:34.160 --> 34:39.520]  it just hit me that i need to put a message out to Rand Paul and that i could just see
[34:39.520 --> 34:47.200]  his strategy in my mind i could see his advisors when the miles go by there ain't too much that
[34:47.200 --> 34:54.320]  i'm missing some of which i know but i got a wife with a frying pan and when she talks i listen
[34:55.120 --> 35:03.280]  i love that part i got a wife with a frying pan and it may not be a palace but i'm broke down
[35:03.280 --> 35:11.840]  oh we got to shut it down please it's just too good of a song all of his songs i don't think
[35:11.840 --> 35:17.440]  junior brown has one bad song i listen to him back in high school and college the great thing
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.840]  about spotify is about a few months ago i said you know junior brown i've listened to him forever
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.040]  and his steel guitar pulled it up there's like all these new albums in the last 20 years that i
[35:27.040 --> 35:30.960]  hadn't been listening to him all these new great albums and i've just been listening to him for
[35:30.960 --> 35:35.440]  about two months straight so i thought i think it's time to actually play some of that on air
[35:36.960 --> 35:38.400]  i wonder what his politics are
[35:41.120 --> 35:45.360]  i don't know though the older you get all i know is when i was 18 that sounded good but i
[35:45.360 --> 35:51.360]  didn't get a lot of it but when you're 41 you get a lot more of it and i guess as you get older
[35:51.360 --> 35:57.920]  get where you get all of it huh i got a wife with a frying pan when she talks i listen
[35:57.920 --> 36:08.640]  it's country comedy folks or maybe it's a rolling pin info wars dot com prison planet dot tv thank
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.200]  you for joining us i like to have a good time i like to be happy i'm a happy guy what i'm not on
[36:13.200 --> 36:21.680]  air but uh when i get on air it's serious time and i want to illustrate what's happening with
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.800]  the collapsing borders and where the end game of this goes then helary then trump then the economy
[36:26.800 --> 36:33.920]  your phone calls but before i forget to go there i could just see the rand paul strategy as i was
[36:33.920 --> 36:44.400]  hiking up this this hill and i haven't really criticized rand paul and i've tried to be friendly
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.800]  about it but i want him to win and i know that uh you know ron paul's a great patriot and i'd love
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.120]  it if he was president and rand paul is the clear best person he was the front runner until a few
[36:55.120 --> 37:02.080]  months ago with donald trump i can't find a fault what donald trump says i really like it i want to
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.840]  believe in him but he's got a checkered past and so you got to really have some reservations but he's
[37:07.840 --> 37:14.000]  a lot better than helary clinton obviously on the surface or jeb bush but i realized i was like
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.040]  you know i ought to shoot a video alex jones's message to rand paul and i could call him up at
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.600]  home got his home number in the kentucky but i gotta do that when he's back at home i don't know
[37:23.600 --> 37:30.080]  his number in dc to get around his gatekeepers but i'm not going to do that last time he was on
[37:30.080 --> 37:35.920]  you know he called up wanted to come on i guess just to show his staffers he could do what he wanted
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.360]  but it's not like there's some falling out here i really don't care at the end of the day about
[37:41.360 --> 37:48.080]  my relationship with rand paul doesn't affect the show one way or the other it's just i want him to
[37:48.080 --> 37:55.280]  win and i know he's a better candidate than somebody like donald trump but they're waiting
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.800]  for donald trump to fall on his face and burn out and go away and i don't think donald trump's
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.840]  going to do that or if he does it's going to be in the 11th hour and the 58th minute
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.360]  it's going to be two minutes to midnight it's not going to be now if he is a foil a shell
[38:13.360 --> 38:22.240]  a fall guy a um ringer i guess is the word i'm looking for then he's going to do it at the best
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.200]  time for jeb bush or hillary or whoever he's working for if that's the case and i'm not saying that
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.080]  because the older i get i don't like to say things about people unless i'm totally sure and i'm not
[38:32.080 --> 38:40.400]  sure i'm like in trot more every day i mean he's so sincere sounding he's so smart america needs a
[38:40.400 --> 38:47.920]  good unifier like him a smart businessman uh quick on his feet yankee it'd be great to have a quick
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.240]  on his feet smart southerner whatever i don't care it's just good to have americana donald trump's
[38:52.240 --> 39:03.520]  the american dream but that said i know ran polls for real running 20 years and i didn't know if i
[39:03.520 --> 39:09.280]  was going to talk about it today but then i get this washington post article that's there to
[39:09.280 --> 39:16.160]  make paul sit around while he falls in the polls think he's got some smart strategy and this is
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.760]  how washington controls politicians it's how it controls statesmen it's how they get the media to
[39:21.760 --> 39:26.800]  drink the kool-aid and make people think they're really going to win and they're seen as a serious
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.520]  candidate even though they're not doing well in the polls now because the intelligentsia is buying
[39:31.520 --> 39:39.440]  into them and they're totally roping a dope so what i envisioned brainstorming is when you're pumping
[39:39.440 --> 39:44.400]  blood through your brain when you think the best i saw exactly what was happening to paul and then
[39:44.400 --> 39:52.000]  i opened up the washington post and here it is and i couldn't even read the whole thing it is a
[39:52.000 --> 40:01.760]  it is a long article by david weagle and all i'd say is ran don't let the weagles eat your brain
[40:03.120 --> 40:10.240]  don't let the worms into your brain ran paul was 2004 and 87 miles away from beltway journalists
[40:10.240 --> 40:16.960]  who had written office campaign and he was loving it and then it just goes into the strategy he's got
[40:16.960 --> 40:22.560]  and i could just see his advisors telling him this exact stuff
[40:28.080 --> 40:35.440]  and him buying into it and waiting for trump to go away and telling him to attack trump no
[40:35.440 --> 40:42.400]  that's not a good move you need to out trump trump and get aggressive the same thing i told your dad
[40:42.400 --> 40:48.400]  that's all ron paul needed was to get a little more aggressive i get he's a doctor a statesman
[40:48.400 --> 40:56.240]  a classic guy i'll vote for him i don't need all the slick flim flam but the whole world's a stage
[40:56.240 --> 41:05.680]  each of us players upon it and they're in there telling him don't worry trump's gonna blow himself
[41:05.680 --> 41:13.520]  up no he's not not until it's too late you were the frontrunner for a year because you were smart
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.360]  and declared yourself first and got out there with popular pro-liberty ideas
[41:20.080 --> 41:24.960]  then you tried to get too close to the left to triangulate to beat hillary down the road
[41:24.960 --> 41:31.520]  that's not the fight you're having right now you need to be the libertarian firebrand you are
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.800]  for real you and your father i know you are what donald trump says he is
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.360]  donald trump looks like a real steak looks like a real ribeye medium rare juicy it might be wax
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.040]  it might be plastic i've bitten in to the paul's i know they're for real
[41:51.120 --> 41:58.640]  so you need to act like the red meat you are right now and the people advising you are just
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.640]  looking to be politicos and have a job down the road in that festering rotten possum that is washington
[42:04.640 --> 42:13.840]  dc there's two different schools here there's people that say william f buckley lost the debates
[42:13.840 --> 42:24.080]  with gore vidal because he told him i'll shock you in your face you gd queer if you keep saying
[42:24.080 --> 42:31.840]  that i'm a crypto nazi but the truth is at the end of the day historians believe that he won the
[42:31.840 --> 42:37.760]  debate because he was for real and i'm not here bashing gay people or anything i'm quoting historical
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.280]  context of him accusing a world war two combat vet who lost friends to the nazis of being a nazi
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.600]  and william buckley got mad and said i will kick your butt right now and clearly got mad and almost
[42:49.600 --> 42:58.320]  punched him so who really won that debate the pundits could say who won but we all know who really
[42:58.320 --> 43:06.000]  won and the numbers show that today same thing with pierce morgan they all declared that i was
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.240]  annihilated on pierce morgan and discredited it's one of the most famous clips in tv pierce morgan's
[43:10.240 --> 43:19.200]  ratings started skydiving after that with no parachute his ratings were the highest they
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.440]  ever were when i was on and for two days they were high but that was him exploding that's you
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.000]  know that's a vampire at high noon burning up it looks pretty spectacular when fires shooting out
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.920]  of their eyeballs when they're falling but that was it i went in there to break the trance to say
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.440]  i'm not putting up with this that's what donald trump's doing is getting outside the box everything
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.240]  is about keeping us in the box saying be mild mannered be nice that's how you win that's how you
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.920]  get attention but that's not how you win that's not how you get attention they want you to act
[43:51.920 --> 43:57.440]  like that thinking the fake candidates hillary and jeb you're running against her acting like that too
[43:57.440 --> 44:00.480]  that's why they're the front runners those are the front runners because of the money and the
[44:00.480 --> 44:08.960]  media saying they are or they were till trump came along so it's all about this con game and i
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.560]  likened it telling my cousin hiking buckley no relation to william buckley but named after him
[44:14.560 --> 44:22.240]  hiking up this hill i said it's like chinese royalty was controlled by saying you gotta live
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.320]  in a forbidden city you can't feed yourself we gotta bind your feet you gotta have foot long
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.800]  fingernails that's the style you've gotta speak in an affected wimpy axe accent that's what people
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.600]  behind the throne do in every dynasty by the fifth sixth seventh eighth dynasty i don't care if it's
[44:37.600 --> 44:45.200]  russian royalty german royalty japanese royalty french royalty chinese royalty aztec royalty
[44:45.200 --> 44:51.680]  they end up being these imprisoned cloistered creatures up in their tower
[44:56.960 --> 45:01.840]  for their protection that's what the nanny state is too we're all being put into a prison for our
[45:01.840 --> 45:07.200]  own safety and and rand paul's been put in his little political prison with his bound feet
[45:07.200 --> 45:14.000]  isn't he pretty and his little chinese bow and his long fingernails and he he walks around like this
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.920]  and they sit there and they feed him his little attendance like a bunch of bugs carrying the
[45:17.920 --> 45:27.040]  brain bug in uh in uh we take you now live to clandestine star trek starship troopers i mean
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.600]  it's just unbelievable star trek troopers that's teleprompter free baby there's no teleprompter in
[45:33.600 --> 45:42.160]  here so it's just frustrating i mean rand paul will go to the head of the pack when he starts
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.200]  telling people to shut up they get in his face when he starts talking about the traders in government
[45:47.200 --> 45:56.160]  people don't want a feat gentlemanliness anymore they want leaders that are going to take action
[45:57.120 --> 46:03.040]  and that didn't mean you can't do it in a gentlemanly way but rand paul you're going to lose
[46:03.040 --> 46:12.000]  if you don't get aggressive do it and do it now i mean rand paul thanks me on air i remember
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.680]  after he won the election he told me proud on the phone he goes no i got to hand it to you
[46:15.680 --> 46:21.120]  you my dad and a few others saying you'd support me help me go ahead and decide to run i really
[46:21.120 --> 46:26.400]  didn't think i'd win i thought we'd educate people about policies like my dad's done i
[46:26.400 --> 46:30.720]  remember telling him i go you will win we can help you raise millions it's gonna happen
[46:30.720 --> 46:39.280]  just be hardcore the establishment's gonna attack you that's what'll make people vote for you
[46:39.280 --> 46:44.480]  when they come after you don't let it intimidate you i gave him real hardcore political advice
[46:45.280 --> 46:51.920]  from the street from the gutter from the gut from the real world where i come from there were no
[46:51.920 --> 46:58.160]  advisors telling me how to set all this up there was nobody there no staffers to run around following
[46:58.160 --> 47:07.040]  me and i know what i'm talking about but look at it i've been telling rand paul for a year to
[47:07.040 --> 47:13.920]  act aggressive and now trump has shown you that i'm right it's sitting right there in front of you
[47:13.920 --> 47:23.040]  and don't be above adopting strategies and i know full well rand paul is a guy's guy and drinks beer
[47:23.040 --> 47:31.280]  and whatever but he's got the doctor's effect of acting real gentlemanly and calming his patients
[47:31.280 --> 47:36.560]  the patients don't need to be calmed doctor let your hair down show people who you really are
[47:36.560 --> 47:44.000]  get in there and kick trump's ass if you want to win this thing that's all i'm saying i'm done
[47:44.000 --> 47:52.320]  ranting about rand paul that's my message to him but the the coup de grace the cherry on top
[47:52.320 --> 47:56.720]  would push me over the edge to say all that was coming in here and reading the washington post
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.920]  praising you what a smarty's pants you are the washington post is your friend right
[48:06.080 --> 48:07.920]  they were attacking you when you were the leader
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.440]  now they're going that's right you tie the bowling balls to your legs and you jump in the north
[48:15.440 --> 48:20.640]  atlantic that's how you swim never mind this life jacket yes who put the bowling balls on now
[48:20.640 --> 48:24.880]  now padlock them throw the key away yeah just that plank right over there just go go into that
[48:24.880 --> 48:32.000]  just get on it and then jump off right in there and and then that's how you're gonna win
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.640]  oh you help carry the bowling balls here let us help you oh where your friend see
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.200]  telling good fellas where he's telling me once the killer he goes just go in there
[48:41.200 --> 48:53.600]  that's some free fur coats yeah yeah just right right in the door right there it's uh
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.440]  i'm sorry they have like the sword all sharpened and aimed at his heart
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.320]  sir we just fall forward right on this it'll fix all your problems and you'll be president of the
[49:02.320 --> 49:11.840]  united states uh all those people up there in dc are there to try to keep their job and get hired
[49:11.840 --> 49:20.320]  by the next politician we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back uh swedish mp he says make
[49:20.320 --> 49:26.480]  people's garages into immigrant housing and make them keep them germany small towns fill the cost
[49:26.480 --> 49:33.200]  of europe's migrant crisis and if you don't like it you're racist you're going to pay and that's in
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.000]  the new york times so we're going to be going over all of that after the break uh briefly i mean i

[54:20.560 --> 54:26.720]  to call for hillary's indictment he needs to come out and out trump trump and be more hardcore and
[54:26.720 --> 54:33.760]  basically make the same statements because that's what he really stands for we know he's the bona fide
[54:33.760 --> 54:41.600]  we know senator you're a for real constitutionalist paleo conservative libertarian but you've got to
[54:41.600 --> 54:49.280]  get down in the arena with trump and and not attack him because just like i told politico i said you
[54:49.280 --> 54:55.040]  should have attacked ram paul by endorsing him but you're too arrogant to do that
[54:56.800 --> 55:03.840]  see if you attack trump that only makes him more popular you don't attack him you obscure him by
[55:04.880 --> 55:12.720]  being more populist more red meat more hardcore you come out
[55:12.720 --> 55:21.440]  and you steal his thunder now i'm done talking about it we'll put this video up on youtube tonight
[55:21.440 --> 55:26.640]  we'll put it on info wars i'ma send it to ram paul's office and lord knows his gatekeepers will
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.320]  try to keep him from seeing it and i don't think against the people in his office some of them are
[55:30.320 --> 55:36.400]  good i know some of them a lot of them you know work for tucker carlson uh and i'm not saying he's
[55:36.400 --> 55:41.280]  a bad guy he overalls a good libertarian guy but he's tried to work with the system and he understands
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.720]  the whole system's coming down folks this is the time for hardcore rhetoric this is the time people
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.080]  are ready for the truth you're not going to counter the authoritarian left that wants to ban the term
[55:52.080 --> 55:58.640]  mother and father and that is shipping illegals in illegally by talking about how much you love
[55:58.640 --> 56:02.960]  the immigrants so you get their vote they're not going to vote for you rand because you're a libertarian
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.080]  and don't want to give them big welfare checks they're going to vote for the democratic party
[56:08.080 --> 56:13.680]  because that's whose houses they live at when they first get here for six months the democrats get
[56:13.680 --> 56:19.360]  them id cards get them on welfare peel off part of the money and put it back into the machine
[56:19.360 --> 56:26.880]  it's a mafia it's acorn it's battleground texas caught on video openly admitting all this
[56:28.240 --> 56:35.520]  the illegals live with the democrats and are made their slaves the democrats are basically
[56:35.520 --> 56:43.760]  farming them milking them using them as cutouts to get tax refund checks you can't counter that
[56:44.320 --> 56:48.080]  you have to defeat it or the whole country goes down
[56:51.200 --> 56:57.680]  and speaking of that hundreds of migrants a day illegal aliens coming into europe are
[56:57.680 --> 57:02.080]  dying when their boats capsized because they're so desperate that they'll put 200 people in a
[57:02.080 --> 57:08.080]  boat that should have 50 or 100 in it and europe's giving them free housing free welfare you name it
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.520]  and almost every case that's what's drawing them there and our media just keeps saying there's no
[57:13.520 --> 57:22.320]  worldwide collapse even as this happens and here it is out of mainstream news television in sweden
[57:22.320 --> 57:33.760]  swedish mp make people's garages into immigrant housing mp frederick schulte said in parliament
[57:33.760 --> 57:42.400]  last friday make people house them here is the new york times germany small towns feel the cost of
[57:42.400 --> 57:49.760]  europe's migrant crisis but you try to act like donald trump is a kook for not wanting every felon
[57:49.760 --> 57:53.840]  on the planet trying to come here germany even as european official struggle with an
[57:53.840 --> 57:57.440]  unrelenting tide of migrants not illegals they're migrants they're just migrating
[57:58.800 --> 58:04.080]  they're going to migrate right into your house trying to get your paycheck to enter the continent
[58:04.080 --> 58:10.000]  tranquil villages like this one there's a photo a picture book valley in northern rivaria are coping
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.520]  with the legions who have already arrived and you get to pay for it

[59:48.000 --> 01:00:00.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:11.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:33.440]  you can look this up but about 10 years ago spain beautiful country a lot of resources smart
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:46.080]  people amazing culture spain adopted carbon taxes and shut down more than half its cold
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.560]  power plants and put in windmills i guess so don key hody could try to chop them down
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.920]  there was a boondoggle to select interest and now spain has 45 unemployment and people under 30
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.760]  spain is except in a few areas like barcelona collapsing and that's admitted and they're
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.560]  outlawing free speech or outlawing any criticism of government you name it they're arresting people
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:21.440]  even mainstream news says it's now orwellian but it's leftist but notice it's fascist
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.080]  and i was in spain and we have footage of this we haven't put it out yet we're making a documentary
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.640]  but it'll be out very soon and they would just march over and threaten to arrest rob do
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.880]  in barcelona because the police were like 60 70 yards away in the shot with their sub machine
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.520]  guns at a famous cathedral we were actually shooting the cathedral not them they said under
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.480]  the new rules we can do this but they bring the people in
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:02:00.880]  and now migrant target fairies of the uk hundreds cause mile-long traffic jam before riot police
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.080]  surround jungle and block access to the terminal
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.800]  and you watch these footage i mean there are countless videos of people having their trucks
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:22.960]  carjacked or trucks broken into and the police will do nothing because it's politically incorrect
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.520]  to stop a quote migrant a migrant has a right to come into your country a migrant has a right
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  to come into your house and again according to the leftist communist ideology and even though
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.440]  the globalists are mega banks and even though hillary's now in control they haven't forgotten
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:46.880]  their sds roots from the 60s the founder of black lives matter the the inspiration is on the fbi's
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.840]  most wanted list for killing a cop and being part of organizing the killing of other police
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.840]  in random murders inspiration by black lives matter is on the fbi's most wanted list terror list
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:08.160]  convicted cop killer is bom's ideological guru they say and again even when these hardcore
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.000]  communists get control they just want to wreck everything they don't even want to maintain
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.520]  their control of the country they just want to run it over the edge of a cliff
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.080]  and that's why the elites themselves are having to run to out of the way places and build armored
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:32.000]  fortresses to fight the policies they themselves schizophrenically brought in and i'm not against
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.920]  the immigrants themselves but i have no responsibility when somebody in north africa or
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:48.800]  somebody in nicaragua or somebody in saudi arabia or turkey or wherever they're from
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.320]  wants to have seven kids and then they want to bring them here and then i'm supposed to go oh
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.760]  you're a foreign culture i mean i'm actually a worldly guy i'm not proud of that i am worldly i
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.560]  kind of like other cultures and weird stuff and interesting people i don't like run-of-the-mill
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.800]  basic you know vanilla ice cream one flavor but man i want to be able to do what i want
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.040]  and i don't want you telling me what to do and this whole leftist garbage is about saying i'm bad
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.400]  because i'm attracted to women of every color and creed but i mean i'll just be honest with you
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:28.640]  i'm probably the most attractive on average to white women and it's not because i'm racist all
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.880]  the genetic studies show black people are more attracted on average to other black people it's
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:41.680]  genetic i can't say if it's blondes or brunettes i mean i can't really tell you i just know that
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.360]  that's what i'm most attracted to i see asian women that are black women that are hispanic
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:56.240]  women that are incredibly gorgeous but at the deep down i click and abs is that am i bad for being
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:03.920]  white okay daniels info wars dot com the financial times is published an anonymous article which
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.400]  calls for the abolition of cash to give central banks and governments more power entitled the
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.360]  case for tiring another barbarous relic the article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.920]  in anticipation for another economic collapse they're causing distortion to the economic system
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.880]  complaining that cash cannot be tracked and traced the writer argues that abolition would make life
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.680]  easier for governments set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence this will only
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.000]  enslave the public by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to compensate
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.560]  money whenever they want through taxes and bail ins think about this it will allow them to control
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.720]  you by owning your paycheck you know they'll be able to prevent you from spending money whenever
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.640]  they want and when it comes to so-called bail ins just look at cypress for example in 2013 when
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.520]  cypress's largest bank was sunk from exposure to debt crippled greece the cypress government looted
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.320]  people's bank accounts as part of the bail in program you can find more reports at info wars

[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:42.000]  on air that by the fall he expected to see a major unraveling but he said look they can keep these
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.120]  you know plates in the air or these balls they're juggling for a long time it might go further but
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.200]  he said it's it's really starting to unravel well now the chinese have started dumping u.s
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.400]  treasuries they're continuing to drop their currency we know they're propping up the u.s stock

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.520]  two thousand three thousand immigrants uh governments in europe like sweden saying we're
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:33.920]  going to start housing them in your house i mean you talk about political correctness that will only
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.680]  bring more people but people are so politically correct they might even say here's my wife here's
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:47.920]  my daughter to prove that you're not racist uh this is over the top in saying i have another
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.440]  article here in the stack out of canada where they're saying free housing for muslims but not for
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:59.920]  christians i'm not kidding because in the political correctness muslims are downtrodden so they get
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.400]  free stuff this is all the hate speech political correctness stuff is really a way for communists
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.760]  and socialists to unevenly distribute socialist booty and that always happens in collectivist
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:20.240]  regimes it's selectively delivered and they want the giant immigrant populations here the good the
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.320]  bad the ugly a lot of these immigrants are great people i don't care if they're muslim i don't care

[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.600]  our kids i'm not against immigration but you can't just have it wide open and say come up here we'll
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.800]  give you something free look at these headlines swedish mp make people's garages into immigrant

[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.880]  what are the socialist thinking they're going to cause a revolution they're going to bring in folks
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.320]  that are going to run the revolution for them to take over i mean it's the cloward and piven plan
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:39.200]  this isn't a game so that's what we've got going on absolute treason taking place
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:46.160]  fairies being shut down in england trains being shut down because the illegals are now not just
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.880]  riding on the trains they're now robbing the trains robbing the fairies robbing the trucks
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.320]  and the police will do nothing but it got so out of hand you can go onto youtube and just type in
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:04.720]  uh immigrants rob trucks in france getting on ferry and it's just hundreds of videos of the
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.760]  robbing the stealing this is the collapse of society and i know peter will say oh well
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.360]  it's the benign neglect the elites don't care they're in their ivory towers they're stupid but
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.640]  the ford foundation acorn battleground texas i got videos of them saying they're going to
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.360]  bring in these immigrant populations put them in democratic and liberal party homes get them on
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.400]  welfare get them drivers license get them voting and then it's game over they're taking our guns
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.400]  they're raising taxes to 80 like france because the elites are exempt and get away with it
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:44.080]  just like the french socialist then we'll look at hillary clinton in deep trouble the latest on
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.480]  what's happening with donald trump uh i got a clip of obama coming out and and saying that guns
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.640]  are worse than terrorism what about all the isis you've been funding that have killed 300,000
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:02.160]  people obama that's all coming up now before we go any further i want to tell you about our gas
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.080]  peter schiff euro pack dot com he's an american businessman investment broker author and financial
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.400]  commentator of course you see him on a lot of the big shows usually is the guy they're attacking
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.800]  uh he uh also of course is the bestselling author in euro pack dot com billions under
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.840]  management and he's got a really accurate track record i give him about a 95 accuracy
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.720]  in his predictions uh and he has now accurately predicted some of the problems we'd see start
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.320]  unraveling so we'll cover the waterfront with him in the next 50 minutes or so uh but i've thrown a
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.200]  lot out there in the last five minutes peter schiff what do you want to tackle first well you
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.960]  know i'm out here in jackson hall right now you know the fed reserve has its annual conference here
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.200]  and i am taking part in a kind of like a protest conference you know there's a left wing group
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.680]  that's here too called fed up and they're they basically think the fed has to print even more
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:02.960]  money that they haven't done enough they want even higher inflation well i'm part of a conference
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.920]  that's criticizing the fed from from the other perspective from the right uh talking about all
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:14.160]  the damage that the fed reserve has already done uh to the us economy in fact the declines that we're
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.920]  seeing now in the stock market are not the result of what's happening in china it's that we're coming
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:26.640]  closer to the time where everybody believed the fed was about to raise interest rates and so the phony
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.400]  bubble economy that was inflated with cheap money uh the fed was threatening to prick that bubble
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.880]  and so that's why the market was coming down but now we're starting to hear rumblings here out of
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.080]  jackson hall that maybe some more qe is coming after all that maybe the fed isn't going to be
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.840]  raising rates which is what i've been saying the entire time that the fed is too committed to keep
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.960]  yeah you said two years ago they're never going to stop qe because it's it's the lesser of two evils
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.800]  in their view well in their view it's actually the greater of the evils but from their perspective
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.360]  it keeps the bubble from collapsing now it pushes the pain uh into the future but in the present
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:11.680]  the pain is still being felt on main street even as its monetary policy keeps people on wall street
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.960]  immune but i'm going to really be criticizing i'm giving a keynote speech at this conference here
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:22.080]  and if in a couple of hours and i'm really going to be talking about the damage that the fed has
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:28.560]  done and i'm also going to be criticizing janet yellen and you know i would encourage your listeners
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:36.160]  to go to my youtube channel uh a shift report and look at the video janet yellen exposed
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.520]  i did this 40 minute video when they first appointed her to chair the federal reserve and if you
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:48.240]  remember at that time uh president obama introduced her as the woman who warned about the financial
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:54.160]  crisis right she warned about the housing bubble uh in advance and and nobody listened to her and
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.360]  that's why we need her at the helm because you know if she was there then we wouldn't have the crisis
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:06.480]  the media bought that it was a complete and total lie i take that lie apart in my video janet yellen
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:14.240]  exposed because i go back to the very speeches that she was giving in 2005 and 2006 where everybody
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:20.080]  says she was warning about the problems and she did no such thing the only time janet yellen
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:25.360]  ever mentioned the housing bubble was to say that we didn't have one to criticize people who thought
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.280]  there was a housing bubble janet yellen in 2005 said she thought housing prices would keep going up
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.000]  she thought that they might go up more slowly than they had in the past sure she's part of the whole
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.160]  inner circle that pushed this whole thing what about this there's a major split for the first
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.840]  time in modern history from what i've seen in the federal reserve with the kansas city and the
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.360]  dalas fed pretty much sounding like you uh and warning this is going to bring the entire country
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:55.200]  and the economy down so maybe that's why janet yellen and a few of the new york fed kingpins
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:01.680]  didn't show up us today as reporting yeah well janet yellen is not here and normally she is here
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.080]  i don't know why she skipped it uh this year but look there are some people who think that the fed
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:14.160]  should raise rates that it's time and the economy can can do well with higher rates there are those
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.640]  that think that the fed needs more you know to keep rates at zero because the economy needs more
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:25.040]  support both camps are wrong they're both wrong we need to raise interest rates but that's going to
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:32.080]  cause the economy to implode but we have to implode it anyway because it's a bubble until we let this
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:38.400]  bubble pop and until we finish the financial crisis that we started in 2008 we're never
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.320]  going to have a real recovery that's right but they want to keep picking the winners
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.400]  so they want to keep the bubble going forever even though the bubble is eating the world
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:53.360]  yes the bubble is the problem so we have to end the stimulus so the market can solve the problems
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:59.120]  that the fed is continuing to cause with its reckless monetary policy unfortunately though
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.800]  i think this policy is going to continue uh and ultimately it's going to destroy the dollar and
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.280]  you know the chinese you talked about hey they're starting to sell some treasuries well they got a
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.400]  lot more treasuries to sell the whole world has got treasuries to sell who's going to buy them and
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.120]  you've always said when they start selling the treasuries and everybody else jumps on the bandwagon
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.920]  that could be the end of the dollar well look who's going to buy all these treasuries that
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:29.280]  everybody wants to unload the fed is the only buyer in town and where are they going to get the money
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.840]  they're going to print it and so what's that money going to be worth after they print it by you know
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.280]  the truckload not very much which is why people have to do something i talked about on your show
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.680]  before take advantage of this sucker's rally in the dollar and sell your dollars to the suckers
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.360]  you know that's what we're doing it with my clients at europe pacific capital we're
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.080]  helping to buy assets in switzerland and new zealand and singapore and other countries that
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.600]  are in much better shape but their assets are on sale because the dollar's gone up because a bunch
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.600]  of idiot currency speculators have no idea what's about to happen and take advantage of their ignorance
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.760]  uh by buying these foreign assets and precious metals the gold is just starting to rise now
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:18.240]  it's up back above you know 11 30 11 40 was down at about 1080 so it's just starting to go up but
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.960]  this is just the beginning when people realize that the fed isn't finished printing money
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.920]  that it's just getting warmed up that the real printing is yet to come gold prices are going
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.720]  to be much much higher and people should be buying their gold now before i mean is it we're
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.440]  going to go to break but here's the question answer when we come back here shifts our guests
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.600]  europe pacific capital i'm alex jones we're talking about the worldwide meltdown that's
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:46.720]  happening if this signals people starting to move away from the dollar then will it get

[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.440]  one of them i'm gonna ask peter shift about in a moment the financial times of london calls for
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:37.920]  abolishing cash and we see huge pushes by the private central banks by the big five banks
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.000]  to get rid of cash because then they can take whatever they want of our bank accounts they
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.560]  can track everything we do it is such a bad idea and it ties into these banker bail ins
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:55.360]  the grabbing of people's money in greece and cyprus and other areas they're starting to talk
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:01.760]  about doing this here so we should go over with peter shift historically what happens
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:09.360]  once currency start really being devalued because it's it's going to happen the question is how is
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.840]  it going to happen what will it look like so that's a segue into my question this sounds like
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.520]  that we're going to at least have devaluations the dollar down the road similar to what we've seen
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:29.280]  with mexican peso could it go as bad as weimar germany or zimbabwe situation because the numbers
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.640]  correct me if i'm wrong historically we've already devalued the dollar more than they have
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.960]  have their currencies historically it's just that people are still accepting it on our faith and
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.840]  credit yeah you know a walmart republic situation that's always a worst case scenario i mean i
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.880]  don't know if it's the most probable in fact i don't think it's the most likely scenario i don't
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.320]  think the dollar is going to be worthless but i do believe it's going to be worth a lot less than
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.120]  it is now you know uh there was an expression around you know after the revolution not worth
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.320]  the continental a lot of people don't know that you know we experimented with paper money before
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.040]  the founding fathers put us on the gold standard and the reason they said not worth the continental
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.560]  was because continental currency which was not backed by gold and silver collapsed and people
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.480]  eventually lost about 90 percent of their value in in the in the continentals and so the founding
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.160]  fathers had a bad taste in their mouth from paper money you know as bad as paper money is you know
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.880]  so it's better to at least have cash than the computer entries that the government wants us
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.960]  to have because then they can track our every movement then it makes it easier for them to
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.240]  control the economy if they know every time that you have in every place that you spend it at least
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.880]  once you have their cash it's kind of an anonymous transaction sure it's designed to knock out
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.000]  underground economies that are key during tyranny yeah and and so you know that's what i tell people
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.720]  if you know forget about even keep gold and silver you know instead instead of instead of then they're
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.400]  not going to be able to do anything about that you know and the price is ultimately going to go a
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:09.520]  lot higher but look the dollar has risen recently because everybody believes that the economy is
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.480]  down and we're going to raise rates they haven't figured out reality yet they never do they never
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.480]  see these bubbles until after they pass they after they pop but the dollar is going to go down
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.400]  substantially in fact it peaked if you go back to march that was the low for the euro so the dollar
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.800]  has actually been falling against the beleaguered euro ever since march so the dollar is rising
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.520]  though against some emerging market currencies and some commodity-based currencies but this
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:43.920]  i believe is the dollar's last fan it is going to turn as people realize that we're not going to get
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.920]  the right hicks hikes that we're going to get a more quantitative easing and then if china selling
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.840]  its treasuries is this is just the beginning of a snowball that's going to get bigger and bigger
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.960]  because once that china starts selling what do you do if you're another country and you own
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.680]  us treasuries and you know china's selling sure you want to get out quick you don't want to wait
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.120]  till china's finished selling so i'm not wrong this this is a big big deal that china's starting
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.360]  to dump treasuries yeah and people are dismissing this people are laughing oh you see china's selling
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.560]  their treasuries and it's no big deal it is premature to say it's no big deal it just started
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.800]  and look if china's not going to be buying our treasuries if they're going to be selling our
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.160]  treasuries who is going to step up to the plate who is going to take over for china can anybody
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:42.160]  figure that out now obviously behind all of this is the fact there is a global slowdown uh how bad
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.560]  do you think the slowdown is going to get we've got africa in the middle east just emptying out
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.480]  into europe it is getting crazy how does that compound the situation well i think the slowdown
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:57.120]  is being compounded by the belief that the fed is going to be tightening monetary policy after
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.480]  seven years is zero this impacts the entire world because the dollar is a reserve currency but i
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.600]  think people are preparing for a tightening cycle that's not going to take place all those capitalists
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.000]  being sucked out of the emerging economies and out of commodities uh that's moving into the
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.920]  u.s financial markets because it's ready for uh you know higher interest rates that's flowing
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.440]  down the global economy when people realize that that's a mistake and the dollar starts to tank
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:28.400]  and commodity prices start to go back up and money is repatriated back to the countries that
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:34.400]  it left uh you know chasing dollars that is going to be a relief for the global economy but there
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.760]  are certainly parts of the world parts of europe japan united states that have too much government
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.960]  too much regulation too much money printing too much interference these countries are never
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.720]  going to truly recover let's talk about it we are going to be right here in march the empires on the
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.720]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.920]  hit daniels info wars dot com the financial times is published an anonymous article which
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.560]  calls for the abolition of cash to get central banks and governments more power entitled the case
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:13.360]  for tiring another barbarous relic the article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.920]  in anticipation for another economic collapse they're causing distortion to the economic system
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.880]  complaining that cash cannot be tracked in trace the writer argues that abolition would make life
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:27.680]  easier for governments set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence this will only
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.000]  enslave the public by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to compensate

[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:58.720]  here in a moment where he thinks the third world is going uh what he predicts the fed will do
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.240]  because they are now hinting saying they may not raise rates or maybe a tiny raise or they may go
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:10.640]  down and larry summers is running around saying that's the answer and criticizing yellen uh so
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.840]  they want to have their cake and eat it too have people believe that interest rates are going up and

[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.640]  it's what i use it for uh topically uh you name it it's it's been known for thousands of years and
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.040]  the scientists and doctors we've had on believe 30 parts per million is the best any uh more than
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.080]  that it's just too small and becomes toxic ladies and gentlemen and that's our view talk to your
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:14.320]  physician do your own research 30 off a single bottle 50 off when you get two bottles basically
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:20.640]  you get two bottles you get two free to be technical so 30 off one bottle or buy two get two free
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:30.320]  infowarslife.com and we do have our amazing medical grade methylcobalamin vitamin b12 that's true
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:38.000]  organic vitamin b12 you will not find it basically anywhere especially in this dose this is the same
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.920]  stuff that i went to a medical doctor to get because i wanted to experience that injectable into the
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.200]  fat same color same stuff same thing this is a pharmaceutical grade when you take under your
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.840]  tongue you do not inject it and it is simply amazing the natural clean energy you get from it
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:05.360]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and when you purchase the products at infowarslife.com or
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.640]  infowarsstore.com for that matter the water filtration the non-gmo seeds the source of radios
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.160]  the high quality storeable foods from my patriot supply a portion of that again goes to fund this
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:21.200]  operation even when we drop chip stuff like the water filters or the high quality storeable foods
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:29.200]  you're directly helping fund infowars and the entire operation that's reaching people exponentially
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.840]  so thank you so much for supporting the operation but you are getting high quality products that we
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.880]  vetted that we've researched at the very lowest prices that we can competitively put them out
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:45.360]  i mean i have to sign special contracts to be able to give 10 off the pro pure water filters that
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:50.800]  cut out the glyphosates the fluoride and the rest of it because we do sell it at the lowest price
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:57.120]  because we are the biggest distributor in the world of a major company because when i started
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.840]  promoting them three years ago four years ago i said i'm not going to carry it unless i get lower
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:09.040]  prices than basically anybody else that's just a free market tactic and i went out and research
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.800]  filters and and because i had a few other companies and they just weren't as good as they used to be
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.840]  so i in my view my opinion and i went and saw the side by side studies on pro pure g2 and other
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:26.640]  systems they sell and it's just the best for the price infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.800]  okay going back to our guest peter schiff uh you can read all of his analysis and more at
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:41.600]  europack.com uh he joins us how concerned should i be obviously things are unraveling quickly
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:51.120]  our recession here is just painful but when you see what's happening over in the middle east
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:56.160]  africa areas of asia latin america seems like the whole world's imploding but meanwhile they
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.960]  go on the news and make fun of you and others and say there's no problem anywhere everything's fine
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.600]  what's the reality well there are problems everywhere but unfortunately a lot of those
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:11.360]  problems emanate from here the problem is that the dollar is acting as the reserve currency
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.480]  for the world and it's visiting the monetary systems around the world because the dollar cannot
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:23.280]  be the reserve currency it could initially when america was the world's largest you know creditor
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:28.160]  when we were exporting manufactured goods around the world when we were loaning money to everybody
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.200]  because we had enormous surpluses we had small government we had productive people we had a
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:39.040]  free market economy we were on the gold standard you know that was fine back then but america has
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.240]  nothing in common with its former self you know we're you know we're a basket case now well all
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.680]  these debts all these taxes and regulations we're not on a gold standard the dollar can't act as a
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.880]  reserve currency and so that system has to come to an end and i think what we're seeing now we're
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.640]  witnessing the death throes of that system as the world is going to ultimately be moving away
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.240]  and i think china you know moving to allow its currency to trade more freely start and to sell
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:13.360]  off its huge cache of us treasuries is a big step a first step in that direction and at the end
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.960]  it's going to be very painful for americans and if you think this recovery was bad wait till you see
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:26.080]  how bad the next recession is going to be peter schiff is our guest i've been asking a lot of
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.720]  the questions here and i want to go to some phone calls so they can ask questions but
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:35.280]  what else are you looking at what else is on your front burner right now well i i think it's
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:41.840]  right now it's what's going to happen with uh the monetary policy and are people going to final
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.520]  figure out what i've been saying that the fed's been bluffing and even if fed ultimately says
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.760]  it's not going to raise rates they're not going to admit that they never intended to people have to
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.320]  figure that out people have to connect these dots and you know they're actually pretty easy to connect
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:03.120]  if you bother to look at it and so i just look at this window of opportunity here for my clients
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.400]  and for prospective clients to get out now right to get out of dodge before the shooting really
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.840]  starts getting rid of dollars and buying these foreign assets and taking advantage of other
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.720]  people's ignorance of what's really going on to buy the things that they're selling
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.520]  what's the next shoe to drop because you were on a few months ago you're on of course six seven
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.920]  eight nine years ago but i mean been coming on four or five times a year forever now just
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:34.080]  intensifying because things are building towards the head but if you i mean if we go back to just
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:42.160]  a month ago two months ago you basically called what we now see happening um people like uh harry
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.120]  dent has called it accurately in many ways but he thought gold would be going down more by now
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.320]  you've been proven correct it's gone up some he thinks uh in the next you know six months or so
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:58.480]  it'll start going down uh but overall you've been pretty much dead on what factors are you looking at
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:05.120]  now that signal how fast this this bubble collapse could go i mean are we just seeing the beginnings
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.320]  of the end of the dollar or does it take a month six months five years well what's happened more
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:16.560]  recently since the last time i was on your show is we've decisively broken the uptrend in the US
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.840]  stock market that began on the lows back in 2009 and we've had a bounce back in the last few days
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.560]  you know we had the biggest drop point wise ever in several days in the biggest rally
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.400]  but that rally didn't change the technical damage that was done in the selloff so i think we've
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.920]  broken uh that bull and this market is in correction it's going to continue to correct
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:45.200]  it's probably going to go into a bear market unless the fed can rescue it unless the fed
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:52.560]  throws it the life preserver that it needs which is no rate hikes and qe instead of dangling an
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.400]  anchor in front of it in the form of suggesting that maybe rates are going to go higher and even
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:05.680]  though the dow itself is in correction territory uh there's about a third of the s and p 500 that's
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:11.600]  already in a bear market these stocks have already dropped by 20 or more but this is being masked
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.360]  by the averages and the averages of course are going to be influenced by some of these high
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:24.000]  profile names that in many cases are extremely overvalued and vulnerable to big declines if the
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.280]  fed were to actually follow through with its threats to raise interest rates so this decline
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:35.200]  in the stock market of course is putting added pressure on the fed because they work so hard
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.680]  to inflate this bubble and now they're watching the air come out and they haven't even pricked it
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:45.840]  yet so i think they're going to try to stop the air from coming out and blow more back in uh by
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.280]  softening their talk about rate hikes and then ultimately coming clean about the fact that
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:57.520]  we're going to get another uh injection of quantitative easing and i think this next round
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.320]  is going to be the fatal dose it's going to be bigger than what you know one two and three combined
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:08.080]  and you can't wait for the fed to announce that uh to make your investments because by then
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.160]  it's going to be a stampede to get out of the dollar and you want to get out before the crowd
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:19.520]  out i tell you uh the fundamentals of the economy are not in good shape i don't have to be a rocket
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.920]  scientist or an economist to see that then i just don't think the public is ready for the type of
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.080]  downturn we're obviously going to be seeing here in the next few months the next few years what do
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.080]  you expect to see socially out of this with all the turmoil government is helping stir up why would
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:44.560]  government want to stir up turmoil when when that only hurts the situation more well you know they
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.840]  they don't want to waste a crisis i mean they thrive on this because they create turmoil and then
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.200]  government holds itself up as the solution right that's how they usurp more power by
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.920]  scaring the public into thinking that government is going to protect them from all the problems
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.160]  but you know hopefully at some point people will recognize that government is the problem
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.600]  not the solution but that's why guys like donald trump and bernie sanders they can tap into this
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.800]  dissatisfaction people are looking for scapegoats right donald trump could talk about the immigrants
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.200]  and try to blame our problems on them uh and there are a lot of people that want to accept that
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.560]  because it seems like an easy scapegoat and yes we can just solve our problems by building a wall
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:29.680]  or deporting people but that's not even going to scratch the surface of what our real problems are
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.760]  of course you got bernie sanders just say well let's just redistribute the wealth there's not
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:40.160]  going to be any wealth left to redistribute exactly we need to create wealth yeah i mean as you said
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.240]  deporting a bunch of illegals isn't going to fix anything but at the same time it's outrageous
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.760]  to ship them in let them have babies for free when i can't go to their country and do that
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.520]  and then the democrats are creating a new socialist underclass to kind of be used for
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:03.200]  low level jobs but also get welfare that you know the new model like walmart has is you get a low
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.440]  paying job but also government assistance that's exactly what they want so they're definitely
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.680]  exploiting the immigrants but they want to exploit them politically to basically go to the uh yeah
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:18.880]  but alex you know when my grandparents came here all four of my grandparents immigrated legally and
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:23.440]  of course it was a lot easier to immigrate legally back then uh but there was no welfare
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.200]  there was no there was no nothing there were no government programs at all there were no food
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.160]  stamps there was no housing vouchers my parents my grandparents came here in search of freedom
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.920]  that's what we want so let's turn off the magnets let's agree welfare get rid of these programs
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.040]  i and i don't just object to illegal immigrants getting welfare i don't want legal immigrants
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.960]  corporations get rid of it i'm well i mean there shouldn't be federal welfare you're supposed
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.560]  to have local welfare and the churches yeah we don't want it for anybody i want people to come
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:00.240]  to this country to work not not not not to not to live off the government but i'm upset when
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.400]  native-born americans live off the government like we can't just blame these problems on the
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.880]  immigrants and even if we got all the illegal immigrants out of this country we would be in
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.840]  just as bad a shape you are now in fact it might even be worse it probably worse because most of
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.560]  them work most of them are working hard huh a lot of them are working hard it's true it's just
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.640]  it's just they're being turned into a political army to vote to take the guns that's why i'm so
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:28.160]  against them but they do contribute in many ways it's a political bent i want to go to calls here
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:34.400]  but but since you raise these points about policies and where things are going
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.480]  what do you think about the hillary clinton situation in your gut uh i think trump's for
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.840]  real now i mean i've been watching this enough i where do you think that's going well you know
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:51.280]  trump is for real when we have a big field i think if the field of establishment candidates
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.000]  narrows down uh you know i don't know how much greater his support is going to rise i mean he
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.520]  might be near a ceiling and so when it whittles down i think that you know he won't necessarily
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.960]  have the majority uh in order to get that that nomination but who knows like anything is possible
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:13.520]  right this the situation is pretty bad but hillary clinton you know she is a very flawed candidate if
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:19.120]  she gets this nomination and i think she's very beatable because of all of her baggage i mean she
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.440]  should be in jail she should be running for president and if she was a normal person she
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.400]  probably would already be uh you know charged with the crime whether it's a obstruction of
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:34.080]  justice or uh perjury or any of the other things that she's done that are better illegal she told
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.920]  her minions lies supporting perjury yeah i mean look you know she is a very beatable candidate
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.360]  so if the democrats were smart they would do something i mean joe biden is probably i bet
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:49.760]  that the republicans would rather run against hillary than a joe biden i mean people make
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.000]  kind of make fun of biden but you know you know there's a lot of sympathy for him now his son bo
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  died i mean i you know you know i i think biden biden is probably a bigger threat to whoever the
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.480]  republicans nominate i mean bernie sanders would be would be a gift i mean if we can run against
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.360]  bernie sanders but i i don't know if uh even the democrats are dumb enough i don't know if i agree
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:15.440]  with you though i mean i agree biden is slicker has less baggage and kind of gets to the blue collar
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:23.600]  workers and people but hillary is a woman and they can just hype she's a woman vote for a woman
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.720]  i think that really is a trump card well maybe the best thing we could do then you know carly
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.280]  fiorina i don't know if she's been on your show she was on my show i like her i mean she's a
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:40.000]  smile i like her too yeah you know and so i mean any who i mean if you had her against hillary i mean
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.640]  you know she dare you take away the woman advantage and and now you know it's going to be a woman
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.760]  president no matter who you vote for so now it's who's more competent and i think if it's a if it's
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:56.560]  a race about competence and intelligence and real resumes you know i think carly beats out of hillary
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.640]  any day sure she's run major companies and hired tens of thousands of people and made billions of
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.880]  dollars all hillary clinton's done is going around and commit crimes we're going to go to break and

[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:48.160]  holding sherry in texas you're on the air go ahead thanks for calling thanks alex yeah i have on the
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:54.800]  economy i have a comment and a question go ahead man um what i what i'm seeing is like a guy on a
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:01.040]  buckboard holding back these horses and so for for september october and even into november he
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:07.600]  pulls up on those rings and he circles the the the buckboards headed towards his cliff and he
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.920]  turns it around and then he turns it around again but come november and in and past november
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:21.440]  he can't pull back anymore that thing is going to go down freefall and then break apart and go down
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.960]  again break apart a little on a ledge go down again and but i do think it'll come back i'm not
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:33.200]  going to buy anymore silver until it goes to single digits but that would be for me focusing
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.040]  just on my silver uh i shares that's going to be november or just beyond sure you have a question
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:45.840]  for peter yeah here's the question in in 2019 220 i think there'll be a turnaround see what he
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.000]  thinks of this i got a validation from the social security okay okay listen i'm going to jump to the
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.280]  next person that's an important question go ahead yeah well first of all i mean it's too hard to know
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:01.200]  when the situation is going to turn around when you're talking about 2020 but my advice to the caller
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.800]  she says she wants to wait for single digits to buy more silver silver hasn't been a single digits
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:12.320]  in a long time it's about 14 and a half dollars an ounce now you know what are you going to do if
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:17.280]  it goes above 20 are you still going to wait for single digits you know i think there's far more
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.640]  upside in the price of silver we've come down from 50 which is where we were on the highs a few
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:27.440]  years ago so i think you know there's a good chance while you're waiting for it to go down to single
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.240]  digits it might go above 50 so i would suggest that the people who are interested in silver
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.520]  buy some now i mean if you get lucky enough to buy more in the single digits well i guess you can do
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.080]  so but i wouldn't hold my breath and i wouldn't wait for that because you may be waiting for an
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.880]  indefinite period of time and you may end up chasing the market and buying much much higher
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.480]  and so the money you're trying to save you might end up losing a lot more
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.440]  sure peter do you expect more big fireworks in september and october because that's usually
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.640]  when we see the big crashes this time we're seeing them in late summer early fall what's that mean
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.800]  no we're just getting started i mean you know the market the technicals are breaking down now here
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.880]  in august and i think as we go into september uh the technical picture is is is not right for the
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.880]  u.s stock market and i think that the market could continue to fall especially if the if people still
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:23.600]  think that the fed's going to raise rates maybe not in september but we october now they're talking
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.480]  about and so as long as that threat is dangling out there that is going to put pressure on the
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:33.760]  u.s stock market which is already very expensive and remember for a while people were thinking
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.640]  hey it's okay if the fed raises rates because if the economy will be strong when they're raising
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.040]  rates and normally when the fed raises rates you know the the market goes up for a few years
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.440]  before it goes down but that's because the economy normally is strong when the fed raises rates
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.520]  that's right right now the economy is weakening all right let's jam in one more before we go to
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:54.880]  right come back with more peter in washington you're on the air with peter schiff go ahead
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.680]  uh hello mr schiff can you hear me yes he can hear you what's your what's your question okay okay
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:09.680]  the question i have is uh uh what do you think of jim rickards uh advice that one temporarily
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:19.360]  uh has uh dollars but buys gold kind of slowly well you know i i think the dollar is already
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.080]  rally you know as much as it's going to do in general i mean there might be a little bit more
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:29.280]  uh jim's vice probably was pretty good if you followed it a couple years ago uh but i don't
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.120]  think following it now and i know i talked to jim quite a bit he lives not too far from me in

[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:03.600]  you know gold did they have a hard time at 1140 goal too and and of course you know there's no
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.320]  money to fund exploration uh so those companies have had terrible terrible problems in the last
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.040]  several years i don't know how much worse it's going to get but i do believe that ultimately
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.240]  it's going to end up being a bonanza for the guys that remain and of course we've invested such a
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:22.960]  little amount in in exploration and development projects over the years that when gold prices
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:28.640]  take off it's going to be a long time before the extra supply comes on stream so i think it's going
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.960]  to be very good for the ones that survive and of course you know we've been buying mainly the
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:39.600]  major mining companies that are well positioned to ride this bear market out and to really profit
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:45.600]  when both the gold price and the sentiment around the future gold price turns all right great
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:54.880]  question thank you uh rob in vancouver let's go to erin in washington dc go ahead thank you alex
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:01.760]  mr schiff all of your europe pack funds are losing double digit in one year rate of returns with
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:08.160]  your precious metal gold fund losing negative 44.48 percent according to bloomberg this morning
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.200]  how do you account for this sort of losses that you're being touted as some sort of an
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.240]  accurate expert well he's had huge profits before and he says they're riding out a bear market i mean
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:25.120]  i'm answering his question for him yeah so our the funds that we manage are down along with all
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:30.400]  of the foreign markets i mean our gold fund is faring about the same maybe a little bit better
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:35.680]  than your typical gold fund during this period of time i mean gold stocks have gone down dramatically
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.560]  we are not short-term investors we're positioning ourselves for the long run i'm not trying to be
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:45.680]  a short-term market timer nor do i claim to be one you in fact you answered his question before he
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.840]  before he went to him you were just talking about that about this is a long-term deal
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.760]  and many of our funds you know if you compare them to our benchmarks we are doing very well
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:01.040]  relative to the funds the the benchmarks that we compete with it's just that we are working
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.720]  in a in a strong dollar environment when i invest in foreign markets i'm investing in foreign
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:12.880]  currencies look i have a company in canada europe pacific canada and those clients are making money
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.440]  on the same stocks that my american clients are losing money in because they're measuring their
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:22.880]  stocks in canadian dollars and there they're going up and my american clients are measuring in us
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.880]  dollars where they're going sure well where you've really been right is predicting this downturn
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:33.280]  accurately that's the whole point uh thank you and you know we had a bubble my clients were all
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:39.840]  losing money between 1996 and 2000 during the dot com bubble and the dollar bubble i was positioning
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:46.080]  myself for for the aftermath of that bubble the returns that my clients made were from 2001
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:52.000]  to 2008 and the returns dwarf the losses and basically all the stocks that i owned that were
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.480]  going down and the dollar was going up they all skyrocketed when the dollar went down that's how
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.840]  you generated billions of dollars real quick and i think the money that we're losing now is a down
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:06.480]  payment on the profits that we're going to make and i think it's an opportunity many of my clients
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.640]  of course will simply add to their accounts to take advantage of the fact that their foreign
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.360]  stocks have gone down because the dollars got up and it's a great opportunity for people to come on
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.960]  board who haven't had accounts with me before to buy into the foreign markets while the dollar
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:26.000]  gives them a great entry point because this dollar strength is not going to last i think it's a bubble
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.800]  that's going to pop and i think you know those losses are going to disappear very quickly well
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.080]  you've been proven right before and you're certainly right about what was going to happen so
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.800]  we'll continue to watch peter chef thank you so much for the time thanks for coming on have a good
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.920]  day good luck with your speech today all right we're going to go to break come back i can finish

[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:59.680]  bunch of news on uh what's happening geopolitically the election hillary clinton get daniels info
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.800]  wars dot com the financial times has published an anonymous article which calls for the abolition
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:09.360]  of cash the gift central banks and governments more power entitled the case for tyring another
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:14.160]  barbarous relic the article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash in anticipation for
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:18.880]  another economic collapse they're causing distortion to the economic system complaining that cash
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.000]  cannot be tracked in trace the writer argues that abolition would make life easier for governments
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.560]  set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence this will only enslave the public
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.560]  by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to compensate money whenever
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:37.200]  they want through taxes and bail ins think about this it will allow them to control you by owning

[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:47.200]  when it comes to so-called bail ins just look at cypress for example in 2013 when cypress's
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:51.440]  largest bank was sunk from exposure to debt crippled greece the cypress government looted

[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:34.240]  vehicles to local police departments to fight the tea party and the gun owners because we
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:39.920]  had the army training manuals seven eight years ago even before obama got in that was going on
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.840]  in government we told you that the number one enemy would be the gun owners the patriots the
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.320]  veterans that's now public we told you they were going to try to push force inoculations
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:52.960]  we told you that if you didn't have obama care they start taking money out of your bank account
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:59.200]  or garnishing your wages that's now starting we told you basically everything remember matt
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:03.680]  drudge two years ago said they're going to start taking money out of your bank account and there's
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:07.920]  going to be a penalty he was just reading out of the bill they said matt drudge is insane he's a liar

[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:20.320]  fluorosilic acid fluoride isn't good for you everybody knows it's good for you really the major
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:25.520]  medical journals like the american medical association american dental association because
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.160]  the lawsuits the last three years came out and said okay under five year old shouldn't brush
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:36.960]  with fluoride toothpaste it causes genophorosis and fracturing of the bones in the body now the
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.320]  federal governments come out and said take the fluoride out of the water take it out of the
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:47.840]  pesticide we're winning you're losing yes obama care had penalties that started kicking in on
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:54.320]  business owners this year next year they've announced that the irs hired seven thousand then
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:10:01.120]  another eleven thousand agents to carry out obama care and start garnishing your wages get ready

[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:24.000]  hillary and i love how it's nonpartisan it isn't even attacking her it actually looks like a cross
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.760]  between her and uh i guess kind of like a rachel matt owl and you press the button and then she
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:44.480]  laughs that's her when she does that laugh i mean she's so witchlike it's not that she's a corrupt
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:55.280]  globalist you guys are going to bring something in man i tell you she's creepy we don't sell this
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:04.400]  an info or store.com but i think we should because it's really important shut up really important
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.120]  to uh denigrate these these people because they say she's a woman you can't criticize her i'll
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:16.240]  criticize anybody i want the answer to political correctness is to tell them to shut up right back
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.360]  in their face you want me to shut up you go ahead and keep spouting all your bullets embarrassing
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.480]  we'll say boy and girl we'll have separate bathrooms we'll have private property we're
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.560]  not taking your vaccines we're going to label the foods we're not going to eat your gmo
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.040]  you're all going to go bankrupt because people are going to start voting with their dollars
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:45.040]  and not be left or right but be common sense
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:12:01.040]  do you guys document camera on her it's like a blonde haired rachel matt owl it does
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:08.560]  can you imagine having her as president let me ask you a question anthony goodshard they're
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:13.280]  going to give the number out cover news and take calls what do you think's really going on election
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.720]  2016 with all the players the the different groups that are involved donald trump hillary clinton
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.520]  i think larry nickles is right he said this about three weeks ago and then right after that it came
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:28.640]  out in the news that the obamas are getting when he said it kind of rolled my eyes but really it's
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:34.240]  true they're flushing the toilet on hillary because they want to be their own new dynasty
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:42.240]  and stay in control and and and even run uh mrs obama or his beard run obama's beard uh for the
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:47.360]  senate or something so it's dynasties fighting with each other like roman emperors i kind of love
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:52.400]  it it's that separation of powers that's actually keeping us safe because this is an evil dynasty
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.880]  and needs to go down in my view i think we're seeing the beginning of the end of hillary clinton
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:03.280]  if we just put the heat to her i think just when things get as crazy as possible is is when it really
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.960]  comes to fruition and it's super dynastic i mean just listen to that laugh but imagine this for a
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:16.320]  minute for dynastic imagine hillary clinton runs and tries to get bill as her vp and then jeb
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:23.600]  tries to get george as his vp and then biden does something like uh gets michelle obama as he his vp
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:29.520]  or he could get jenner as his vp they could get jenner i think jenner would win by a landslide
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:36.800]  i would rather have katlyn jenner as our president than hillary clinton i would too easy let's draft
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.920]  katlyn jenner and then we can get uh bradley manning out he has a new name what is it buffy
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:49.280]  manning or i think it's uh chelsea manning i'm serious i think we should have both of them run
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:56.960]  jenner 2016 hashtag jenner 2016 i'm on it right now i'm all over it it'd be jenner manning jenner
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:07.520]  manning well but man is kind of sexist so jenner pink penguin hashtag jenner pink penguin 2016
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:13.600]  that's it the winning bit is in purple penguin i'm sorry go home i didn't say the right political
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:18.320]  correct cult word today i need to can you believe how cultic it's getting how bizarre when there's
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.640]  the biggest gay lesbian group the country says ban boy and girl i mean this is just fruit level
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.800]  like like like they're god down they go you will no longer say boy or girl you will no longer have
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:34.560]  boy and girls bathrooms we you know i mean it's just like who are you people bunch of cult leaders
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.720]  well they say we're unaccepting i'm i'm pretty accepting i really don't care what they do
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:43.600]  at all it's them not accepting anything else besides their limited scope of what they want
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:52.320]  yeah they are the intolerant control freaks yeah let's just listen to that they are crazy it's like
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.480]  we're gonna tell them we're banning husband and wife father and mother boy and girl
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:03.840]  and they'll do what we say how we're liberal we rule everything
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:10.880]  i'm gonna start laughing like our priest what difference does it make

[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:38.720]  and if no one else marries it they're bad it's not exactly they had to be accepting yeah now we
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.960]  have to ban any other form of marriage but marrying a hillary laughing pin yeah because any other type
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:47.200]  of marriage hurts me like the name boy or girl that would be bigotry if other people don't marry
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:50.640]  because if you say boys and girls that hurts people that are purple penguins yeah that's
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.560]  bad biologically that's not allowed well now you hear they're banning all flags in school because
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:58.640]  they should yeah yeah ban everything they should ban schools ban blow the planet up then there'll be
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:03.680]  no more racism that's the only way to solve it i think they should ban the word racism actually
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:09.120]  ban ban everything ban the word ban we could all marry our hillary clinton dolls and just listen
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:14.080]  to her beautiful voice for the rest of our lives that's that's actually an idea it's a utopia of
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:21.680]  sorts isn't it i wonder if racial madow has a hillary blow-up doll he's only imagined we should
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:28.960]  ask her when katlyn jenner is president that'll be a first question that she asked i'm sorry i'm
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:34.800]  not trying to be mourning shock jock here i'm just sick of these cultural tyrants these people are
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:43.120]  unbelievably ridiculous and pompous and over the top lecturing everyone and all these culturalist
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:48.160]  people brought up on tv are just supposed to accept whatever the new monthly flavor of
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:54.320]  political correctness is and i just reject all of you do you people realize what jokes you are
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:01.840]  i mean you are uh no one's buying it people like this kind of stuff that's why people are so dying
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.760]  to hear donald trump because he has he's not going to be completely political correct people love
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:09.280]  this kind of stuff this is what people want to hear no donald trump is arrogant enough that he may
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.960]  just be for real once be president now even mainline people are saying okay you may be president
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:17.360]  yeah i was just thinking about oh he won't get the vote so he's not popular now there's all these
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:21.680]  Hispanic groups that like him it's just common sense hey i can't come there and get stuff for free
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.080]  you can't come here you're hard working we'll make the process really easy uh if you don't have a
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.480]  criminal record and you you know have something to offer seems like hispanics love him actually
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.680]  pretty much everyone i talk to loves donald trump they try to push him on me they're like hey we hate
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.600]  illegal immigrants they're ruining everything for us and it's true it's all just common sense
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.440]  none of this is fanatical none of this is crazy it's all just reality and we're sitting here
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:49.600]  then the media pretends that no one supports take a take a north african town do you think of north
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:54.320]  african town of a thousand people if two thousand germans show up homeless with no money and say take

[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.880]  house and it's like no you're a racist you're a racist i mean you know at a certain point that will
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:17.920]  make people go hitler which is part of this larger planet entity i i broke this down earlier

[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:14.720]  by the way uh nico one of our uh producers well the head producer on the radio side came in here
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:20.640]  and said uh i know you have anthony in here why is he here because they don't really run the show
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:24.080]  but they help me when i get off the rails a little bit and that's probably a good idea to explain
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:32.480]  why you're here why i should come in today uh drudgereport.com ran our story video mcdonald's
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:38.160]  chicken supplier caught stabbing chickens with spikes and you link to the activist video and
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:44.800]  the other reports we're not the progenitor of this report but tyson foods is tweeting at us and
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:51.120]  responding to this and saying they're firing the subcontractor that did this so that's good but
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:57.760]  we'll talk about this report when we come back in the next segment but since i was mentioning
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.240]  hillary clinton that is why anthony's here with some other consumer news and interesting things
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.560]  have to be covered but before we get there let's cover hillary clinton right now since we were
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:09.920]  talking about her that's why i had the pin out and then i forgot to actually get to the
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:14.880]  reason i had the pin out because i got so enamored by her siren song she's so beautiful
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.920]  clinton compares pro-lifers to terrorist they are dead wrong for 21st century america we're going
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:26.800]  forward and i guess that means with harvesting babies and okay hillary but you might as well pay
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.120]  the women a few hundred thousand dollars for the baby parts because that's what some of these clinics
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:38.240]  are getting for late term abortions so we understand you're a ghoulish promoter and a representative
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:45.360]  of of a organ harvesting factory farm system so if you're upset about chickens can we be a little
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:50.400]  upset about the humans oh but there's no empathy for humans from pita because they're peter singer
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:57.280]  run it's an anti-human exterminous worldview to take our human empathy and project it onto bunny
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:03.680]  rabbits but not onto humans how about we treat animals well and humans well as well you witch
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:11.440]  but you see us as cattle don't you so let's go to this clip extreme views about women we expect
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:19.120]  that from some of the terrorist groups this she finds that from people who don't want to live in
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:28.800]  the modern world but it's a little hard to take common from republicans who want to be the president
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:35.920]  of the united states yet they espouse out of date and out of touch policies they are dead wrong for
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:44.640]  21st century america we're going forward we're not going back she's the future everybody else is the
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:50.320]  past nobody you're the past they ran with confederate flags for governor every time now she wants
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:57.040]  some band these people are nothing but psychopath manipulators i mean it's so obvious she is a monster
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:05.520]  she is an absolute gangster and she wants to play women off against men and i mean she is
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:11.200]  funding al qaeda now known as isa she ran that operation we broke that that's now admitted
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.520]  Anthony pop it anytime i'm here ranting though i do kind of like he's just sitting over there is
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:20.880]  actually a animatronic mannequin this is not real it's actually not real i'm one of those
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:25.360]  chucky cheese type robots they can just sit here and kind of listen and nod and agree and i also
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:28.960]  do have a purpose as you said earlier i do have a purpose we are going to talk about health is
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.040]  the stuff too we are going to do that the next segment but right now another clip this is a

[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:19.760]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jill show by the way we actually have this
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:33.040]  song breaking the law cut to obama and hillary breaking the law is one of our intros so we might
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:38.640]  as well play that as the intro to the final segment coming up but for just a second crank it up
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:48.960]  it's congress's theme song well the texas attorney general is pled not guilty to fraud for telling
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:54.000]  two people at dinner they ought to invest in something when he was investing in the company
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:00.160]  himself this is what they indict you for if you're a conservative that actually fights obama
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:05.120]  meanwhile hillary just openly takes billions of dollars from foreign countries and dictators
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:12.480]  to then lift bans on weapons to their corrupt nations open and shut criminal activity and the
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:19.120]  reason i'm on a hillary jag here is that she's been caught red-handed committing a bunch of crimes
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:24.240]  and she needs to go to president she needs to get in trouble these are the people that are
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.440]  persecuting libertarians and conservatives all over the u.s the republicans don't do this type
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:34.320]  of political prosecution i've been doing this 20 years nixon did a little bit of it and they put
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:42.400]  him out of office and people went to jail like his vice president and good good send them to jail i mean
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:49.840]  oh it makes me sick and and for funding al-qaeda send them to jail send hillary to jail and by
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:55.760]  the way the bushes clearly worked with the bin laden's at the carlaw group they clearly were
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.560]  involved with saudi arabia they were involved in all this and then to jail too i mean it's time to
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:07.360]  empty out the presence of political prisoners and put these political people in jail and believe me
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:13.440]  the corruption will stop real fast then i mean i've had enough of it now i want to go to cash
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.240]  and andrew and jason and steve and adam and others that are patiently holding
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:23.360]  anthony gutiarty is here in studio with us but when you've got the black lives matter groups
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:27.680]  saying hillary for president it shows that they're not fully controlled by the democrats
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:33.680]  they i mean the democrats created occupy wall street but when they couldn't control it anymore and
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:38.800]  it got out of their hands they then had the feds member swat team it shut it down that was obama
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.960]  and it's the same thing here uh black lives matter is getting off the plantation getting off
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:50.240]  the reservation here in your gut anthony gutiarty where do you see all this politically going because
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:54.400]  the awakening that's happening is undoubted you know i started screwing around joking around earlier
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.320]  because by the third hour sometimes on a friday choose the third hour i kind of get a little
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:03.680]  bit goofy because it's depressing covering some of this negative stuff but it's overall positive
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:10.960]  because knowing this stuff's going on will bring sunshine to the situation i say i think we're
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:15.840]  seeing a lot of victories across a number of spectrums in a really tangible way now those
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.240]  black lives matter girls you said they were also transgender too i think that's awesome that's great
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:24.320]  let them go up against clinton that's the best thing because once you go up against them
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:28.160]  with this fake political correctness system it's like well what what are they going to say that
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:33.280]  turns on itself exactly i think it's great all these uh black transgendered people are awesome
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.360]  if they're going to go against evil things like hillary clinton that's awesome in the food realm
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:42.800]  we are seeing what a purple penguins do it that's great i love them too we're seeing tangible real
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:48.080]  results because as we're going to talk about yeah i wanted them to print that off did they print off
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:53.840]  the uh tweets that tyson's tweeting back at us okay they're running it in right now thank you yeah
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:57.680]  i would like to see those let's talk about that first get into your mcdonald's story and then
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:02.720]  end all the other news go ahead sure so i saw this yesterday and the headline on info wars is video
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:08.880]  mcdonald's chicken supplier caught stabbing chickens with spikes correct graphic farm abuse
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:14.240]  uncovered and when i saw this it was really really weird and i couldn't believe it at first because
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.720]  i read a different article title that was about how they broke their necks by stomping on their heads
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:23.120]  and stabbed them with spikes and i'm thinking why would they even do this here's fox business
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:28.000]  graphic video shows mcdonald's tyson supplier stabbing chickens mcdonald's and tyson foods are
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.320]  under fire after an undercover video shows factory farmers at one of their suppliers beating chickens
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:37.840]  with spikes and stepping on their heads to break their necks it's from an animal rights group
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:44.560]  so i looked into this and it's it's real it appears uh based on the video and tyson foods and mcdonald's
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:49.680]  dropped the supplier right after it happened now for those of you who are not aware mcdonald's is
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.840]  losing i don't want to see this turn it off disturbing we shouldn't look at it but mcdonald's
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.440]  is losing so much money they stopped reporting how much they're losing every month that's how
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:04.160]  bad they are in and already we have business insider and others saying things like is mcdonald's
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:09.840]  doomed and mcdonald's is losing american customers because people just aren't eating their crap anymore
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:13.680]  and i remember i think it was a year that shows voting with our dollars this is something liberals
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:20.400]  have done that's good yeah the foodies demanding high quality food demanding tasty food all the
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:26.240]  industrial crap stuff is totally going on a style and i have to hand it to the actual liberal trendies
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:32.480]  they have actually done a really good job culturally they're one of the main groups
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:37.760]  that have actually brought us higher quality food anti-gmo stuff like that and so i can hand it to
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:41.840]  them on that front i think it's a humanity issue none of us want to eat junk in our food want to
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:47.600]  eat roundup in our food glyphosate based junk but here's tyson foods response to you by the way who
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:52.400]  launched the the clintons tyson just wanted to add that sorry go ahead well here's their loving
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:56.720]  response to you it says at real alex jones we do not tolerate animal treatment shown in the video
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:01.360]  we're terminating our contract with this farm so they've been directly responding to you well i
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.640]  want to say good job tyson foods we just simply showed it because there are more humane ways to
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:10.880]  kill the chickens that are more industrial and yeah i mean not to mention you don't want to eat
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:14.800]  chicken that's sitting in its own feces and given antibiotics in the hopes that it'll survive one
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:18.720]  day longer so it can be killed and it was info wars and the food babe launching the initiative to
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:22.400]  get them to start phasing out antibiotics chicken that they announced within two years it'll be
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:26.880]  totally phased out that's good then people might actually eat your food if mcdonald's didn't make
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:31.520]  me feel bad and feel sick when i ate it i would go there because sometimes i'm in the middle of
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:37.120]  nowhere that's all there is is a mcdonald's at an airport i just just go without all they had to do
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.840]  it in five to five to ten years ago all they had to do was phase out their toxic compounds and put
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.000]  in real food and they would be big today people would still go there if they had organic options
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:51.360]  and it wasn't total total junk people would still go there but now instead we have things like
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:58.480]  indian soybean imports to us jump as shoppers seek organic food we won't buy gmo junk here so india
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  and romania have to put we have to import organic produce from india and romania here's one suddenly
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:09.040]  we like organic corn so much we have to go to romania to get it so we're importing organic food
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.280]  because we can't even keep up with the demand in the united states and meanwhile they're like
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:18.720]  we need to have more gmo farms pop up to feed everybody we can't even we can't and the farmers
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.600]  are so controlled by monsanto and archdandals midland they're in their own bubble a lot of them
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:29.840]  not even knowing that there's this huge market and demand for non-gmo and then you think about it
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.640]  this way too as i said we're importing organic soybeans from india india is where a farmer
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:39.680]  suicide happens on average every 30 minutes a lot of it's tied into monsanto having contracts with
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:43.600]  them and then the farmers killing themselves because they go into financial ruin according to a
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:47.600]  lot of sources and they kill themselves by drinking the pesticide yes exactly in a very
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:54.480]  darkly poetic way and then we have a oregon county has completely banned gmo's the growing
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.200]  of gmo crops and they've said if monsanto and others don't get their crops out of there they're
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.600]  going to destroy them so i mean people are taking action things are really happening in a tangible
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:10.480]  concrete way that is victory and it reminds me also i mean how many what three years ago we talked
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:14.880]  about how mcdonald's is on the way out junk food is on the way out people are eating real
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:18.480]  organic let's find the videos where we were right again and we're not bragging we're just
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:22.480]  letting you know we really know what we're talking about yeah i mean we do research we
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:26.160]  when we you know have meetings here at the office or we go out to dinner with the crew
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.960]  we're talking about these issues we're we're passionate you go hang around with the anchors
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.720]  from abc nbc cbs i've done it i mean nightly news anchors they're all about oh we know a lot of
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.280]  this stuff's true alex big deal it's all just live and they're talking about women i mean
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:48.080]  they're just mercenaries folks we're not mercenaries we 100 believe this yeah we foam at the mouth for
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:53.920]  freedom well that's why these products at info wars life.com are created yeah let's do a plug
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:57.520]  because i was already about to do this during the break i already put my super mail vitality in
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:01.280]  there this falls in line with all of this it's all about super high quality organic products
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:04.880]  that matter instead of producing tell them about this article because i'm about to put
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:10.160]  uh some of the secret 12 mythical bobleman vitamin b12 from info wars life.com in this water
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:13.680]  and then you're supposed to take it sublingually to get the full effect i just drink it like it's
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:22.480]  soda pop or coke uh and then i mix in the x2 nascent iodine all of it in there together
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.560]  into a cocktail i know some folks actually put this into their mixed drinks but i don't really
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:30.720]  yeah but in my protein shake every morning i have every single product into the and then
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:35.280]  there you go ladies and gentlemen i tell you it is dynamite to mix these three things together
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:40.080]  and then you just drink it down and i tell you the energy i get i used to have coffee
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:45.440]  about this time of day now i just have this and i tell you it gives me more energy clean energy
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:54.720]  super male x2 and the vitamin b12 mythical bobleman than the coke would or having
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:59.600]  something like a tea or a coffee yeah i've probably had two cups of coffee in the last six
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.000]  eight months i used to either have a coca-cola even though i know it's fattening and bad
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:09.840]  or i would have a coffee or i'd have a tea yeah very rarely do i do that anymore well it's the
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:14.000]  mythical bobleman and the adenis oak bobleman the mythical bobleman is the pharmaceutical grade
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.680]  medical grade stuff that people actually inject on their bodies obviously you don't inject this
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.240]  but then the adenis oak bobleman is super bioavailable so you pick the two most bioavailable
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:25.840]  sources because you go to like a pharmacy you can get mythical bobleman sometimes it's super
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:30.000]  expensive sometimes like a hundred bucks but the adenis oak bobleman i can't find that anywhere
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.720]  else so this is the two most bioactive bioavailable form we went to the chemist and said what is the
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:39.120]  most organic what is the most organically produced and what fuses it together and allows your body
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:44.160]  to uptake it and so it's 80 percent mythical bobleman and explain the other that's 20 percent adenis
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:49.040]  oak bobleman so they're both bioactive forms and i went online today by the way looking at other
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:53.280]  stuff and i couldn't just help but have b12 pop up on google news over and over again so i'm going
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:58.000]  to go through a couple of them dr os did a whole segment on end your energy crisis with vitamin
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:05.840]  b12 he has this like five page long report about b12 deficiency lack of energy mood changes difficulty
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:12.560]  concentrating tingling numbness numbness inflammation cracked tongue and how he thinks b12 is one of
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:18.720]  the best ways to fix all that five ways b12 helps joint pain and arthritis suffers this is from
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:23.120]  newsmax and it goes into arthritis everything like that and we're not making claims here but this
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:28.320]  is some of the news going on and then i wanted to read two reviews that really stood out on b12
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:33.920]  because i'm trying to highlight a lot of this is for secret 12 our our variety of b12 that we
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:38.880]  believe is the best available yes this is the methylcobalamin meets the adenosilcobalamin at
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:46.160]  nymphowarslife.com and this is from citizen 1984 and it says as a postman i regularly
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:51.200]  walk 10 miles a day before using secret 12 i would rely heavily on energy shots to get me
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.840]  through my week secret 12 has changed all that for me it provided sustained energy throughout
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:01.120]  the entire day without any jitters i will definitely be purchasing more and recommending it to my family
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:05.040]  friends and co-workers and just take one drop around to the tongue or drink it in water like
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.680]  i do then it isn't as effective but that's just how i do it because i like the flavor
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:13.600]  i like to enjoy it and my kids take it and think it's sugar there's no sugar in it
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.000]  real vitamin b12 tastes sweet yeah but but unlike anything sweet we've ever tasted
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.360]  and again i went to a medical doctor a year ago to have my blood tested everything checked
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.800]  i had low blood pressure overall i had a little bit high blood sugar it wasn't pre-diabetic it was
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.920]  pre-pre like getting into that range now it's gone back down and i got the injections of
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.640]  methylcobalamin right as we were developing this and getting ready and it's just amazing
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:41.440]  the energy that gives you this gives me the same effect as injectable vitamin b12 to where i haven't
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:46.240]  even renewed my prescription because i don't like needles yeah you know they're tiny i just drink it
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:51.920]  now and it works just as good i mean it's amazing yeah the injectables are great i've tried that
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.560]  before the doctor always i mean he's just insane just jabs it in there it always is super painful
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:02.000]  i like to just take this secret 12 instead and i do have another review too this is from infowarslife.com
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.960]  this is by far the best vitamin b supplement i have ever tried my mood and metabolism improved
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:12.480]  markedly when i take it in my opinion this winter sun and survival shield x2 are the holy trinity
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:17.280]  for health supplements on a daily regimen i have tried many products many different supplements and
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:21.680]  combos thereof in the past and these are the only products that truly deliver what they claim to
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:25.920]  it's it's true and see folks notice how we're into all sorts of weird stuff and how we research
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:32.640]  everything i wanted to come out with the most game-changing hardcore stuff out there and that's
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:37.680]  what we've done that's why it's taken us three plus years to come out with a handful of products
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:42.000]  because we've probably got what 10 different products and development that we just can't put
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.880]  out because we can't put it out perfectly and all our competitors are putting out stuff that's pretty
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:52.640]  good but not perfect or really bad yeah and and then i'm just like sitting here going do we just
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:57.440]  put out something that isn't perfect because it's better than nothing and you always i mean are we
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:01.440]  too good but then we always end up putting out something that's perfect every time it's always
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:04.960]  it's always it's always like well it'll take six months to do it but it this is so much better
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:09.040]  we just have to do it which is what we have to do but then we can't keep it in stock because it's
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.360]  so hard to manufacture because you can't get absolutely perfect clean i mean we've got the
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:18.880]  lab studies they're on m4slife.com from the biggest firms out there and they they call us and they go
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:23.920]  it's one thing to have one deal that's above california standards non-detectable nothing
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:28.320]  but you've got like 10 ingredients they're all clean they say this is like twilight zone
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:33.520]  i mean we've had them say that this is twilight zone the ingredients that we pay for that are then
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:39.520]  put together at these laboratories i actually remember the chemist said i'm freaked out he was
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:44.080]  freaked out because it was so clean he didn't even understand how it could possibly be done but it's
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.720]  because we're neurotic about it and obsessive about it and crazy about it let's just say group even though
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:53.040]  we use two other manufacturers group got involved with us from the beginning and he's neurotic yes
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:58.160]  i mean he's really obsessed like we had to go with other people because sometimes he just couldn't
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.160]  even find the stuff that we needed you know for some of the products he makes most of the products
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:06.480]  yes and he always looks at them and make sure they're good and everything like that but he triple
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:10.720]  test them after they've already been tested by the companies and then we plus we know we have
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:14.800]  enemies that are out to get us that are testing our stuff we have all our batches saved in a big
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:18.960]  safe for anybody that ever tries to do a fake test and claim something we have you just just know
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.280]  that because we know we have enemies we go to an even higher level of testing independent third
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:30.720]  party because no weapon against us shall prosper you see we use the attacks to make us even stronger
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:37.040]  thank you it's like training at altitude it basically being under attack all the time i've
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:42.400]  gotten where i enjoy it it makes my life fun i like it don't you not being attacked by 10 000 people
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:45.920]  a day is like walking around after being on the Himalayan's for a couple years and you go down

[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.440]  minutes or so most talk show hosts plug coming into a break coming out of a break and then they
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:44.400]  plug in the middle and i get it radio is in trouble the whole economy's in trouble advertising's
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:50.000]  in trouble with our great glorious new older leader under clowered and pivot we just do you
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.720]  know actually less advertising than most people but i want to thank you all for your support you
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:50:00.080]  make it all possible and i also want to thank our AM and FM affiliates it is essential that you
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:03.920]  spread the word about all these affiliates it is essential that you call them and thinking for
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:12.080]  carrying the show it is essential that you do things like call them and become a sponsor or pay
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:18.080]  to put a billboard up plugging their station that won't save the world but all of us together will
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:26.400]  and finally we lost Orlando affiliate for about a year because ESPN came in and and you know they
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.320]  had to make money and offered them so much they did it but then they found the ratings and things
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:35.920]  went down so they picked us back up we have Corpus Christi had us on for like five six years
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:41.520]  ESPN again came in that's gone they're putting us back on so what happens is even affiliates
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:46.960]  that leave us come back so we're gaining more stations it's about 185 right now and i want to
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:53.200]  salute and thank all those affiliates but folks put 50 bucks in an envelope mail it to them because
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:51:01.040]  we need to not just have our station survive but thrive and pray for them many are in disbelief today

[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:08.720]  case american journalists at a media event have criticized the u.s administration over
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:15.120]  transparency issues we cover what we are allowed to cover lack of transparency is a huge political
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:20.960]  advantage information management has become so sophisticated every administration learns from
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:26.640]  the previous i've got a parent and i've got a phone there are actions i have the legal authority
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:31.840]  to take as president what do you say to someone who believes the president took action to change
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:36.560]  the law we did not change the law we acted within the law what you're not paying attention to
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:51.040]  is the fact that i just took an action to change the law
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:55:05.680]  breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law from the front lines of the information

[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:30.160]  war drills i'm just like you know what gucciardi biggs just got back off a plane david night's
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.440]  going on vacation for a week uh well deserved so both these guys are going to be in here taking
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:41.520]  your phone calls and more but right now speaking of our article at drudge report dot com financial
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:48.640]  times calls for abolishing cash well that doesn't mean johnny cash songs uh but you're on the air
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:56.320]  mr cash calling from missouri go ahead thank you alex uh i've got a question in two statements
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:02.480]  if you have time yes sir uh the question is uh the government cia is the biggest drug dealer
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:08.400]  and it uses it to fund the black budget well if the drug dealers don't take credit cards
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:15.280]  so if they abolish cash uh that would kill their cash cow and how are the big banks going to
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:20.880]  longer the drug cash if there is no cash i've always said that why would the big five banks was six
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:27.440]  be trying to ban cash or restrict cash everywhere when they wander let's be conservative the cia
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:33.760]  inspector general said 300 billion a year in 97 now it's about 500 billion a year just in north
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:40.400]  america alone i don't i thought about that so much it makes my head spin it's just like when
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:45.760]  they bring in driverless cars how are they going to make money on insurance well as they phase humans
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:51.040]  out driving they're just going to jack it up on us and then have some type of safety fee you know the
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:55.840]  driverless cars are still going to be having crashes and having problems and having malfunctions or
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:01.200]  it'll go to some innovation fee i mean believe me they got ways to screw us over and i believe
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:06.640]  they're just going to quasi outlaw cash but still have that operating and still have debit cards but
[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:12.000]  the big banks are so above the law now they're getting to a point where they'll just take credit
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:16.480]  cards and let drug dealers operate openly and then they they'll selectively not get in trouble i
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:20.400]  mean the big banks already laundered the drug money and don't get in trouble so i think that's
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:24.160]  what's happening let me ask you this question what do you think how do you think you're going to do
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:31.040]  that cash well i'm not real sure but i think when you talk about driving with cars i think you're
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:35.520]  stay there cash you held a long time i want to give you some time straight ahead back in 70
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:39.680]  seconds some stations don't carry the fourth hour because i quit doing it for a while but it's back

[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:39.920]  uh but it is available they are producing it i'll have to i'll have to look into that that's very
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:46.320]  interesting what's your take on what's your take on driverless cars well uh that is another one
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:53.200]  of their technology they've also are planning to have developed cars that uh not only uh
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:02:04.160]  uh are driverless uh but they are um they don't need roads they fly with technology well they
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:09.440]  have come out actually in the last 50 years with flying cars that are under $80,000 and
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:14.400]  australia is looking at actually legalizing them in some areas and that sounds pretty darn fine
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:21.040]  well you said before that you know the current technology that we have today they had 45 years
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:27.040]  oh yeah they had cars 60 years ago they got 50 miles the gallon and didn't have any electronics
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:33.920]  in them now they've got a lot of electronics you can't even do that well what he's taking is is the uh
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:43.920]  the uh you know tesla has the power cell too which is a really cool thing you can plug it
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:48.560]  into your house and it basically generates massive amounts of power and the preparedness type way
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.800]  and uh elon musk presented it a while back it's pretty interesting and apparently you can have
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:57.040]  massive pay we should send out a crew to the elon musk factory they'll let us look at it and then
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:01.040]  send one to this guy and investigate see if it's legitimate thank you sir god bless you good to

[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:50.400]  support what you're doing to stop people getting killed but you need to go about it better that's
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:56.320]  too nice when a group is racist out of control blocking people's cars just because they're white
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:04:00.640]  i mean i think the answer to them without getting into fights just like hey i haven't done anything
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:04.720]  stop pushing this you're funded by the globalist to create divide and conquer
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:09.040]  you want to go get in somebody's face go find a clan rally quit treating me like i've done something
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:14.400]  because of my skin color and and i mean you know personally i need to seek out black lives matter
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:18.960]  because i want to get in their face i think it's very arrogant very idiotic uh but i mean that's
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:24.960]  what i think i think you should go out there with some friends and videotape it exactly i mean that's
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:30.000]  the way i feel i mean someone even drove them over when they were blocking the road here i don't
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:34.720]  know if you've seen that on the news but you know they ran them over they're they're they're disruptive
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:41.040]  they're really arrogant well because because they're barring into the msnbc they're buying the msnbc

[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:03.520]  visit and investigate the new shooter yeah so i went out to virginia to uh find out what's going on
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:08.960]  with this new shooting because immediately this tragedy happens and what happens the mainstream
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:15.280]  media the government everyone is jumping on this gun control bandwagon anti gun let's get it let's
[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:20.080]  get rid of guns let's not hold individuals accountable for what's going on but now you also
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:24.320]  have a lot of these people out here saying that it's all a hoax i went out there i saw the boards
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:28.160]  that they had to cut around the bodies the blood that spewed from the second floor down to the
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:32.560]  first floor it was not a hoax there's a lot of people saying that there's time stamps different
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:38.400]  on these twitters it's so easy to go into twitter and manipulate a time and then take a screenshot
[03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:43.520]  and then post it and make a video and sit back and watch people just nitpick at it or the fact that
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:48.480]  in one video this guy has a long black sleeve thing on but then when you see his arm extended you see
[03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:55.360]  blue well that's going to happen whenever with your suit extend your arm exactly i can see another
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:01.280]  color under there wallah it's magic no that's what happens when you wear two layers of shirts or clothing
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:08.480]  so people are just trying to nitpick the horrendous thing is the hoax of it all is the fact that
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:13.120]  people are jumping on this like they say never let a bad situation go to waste and people are
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:17.120]  jumping on it they're using it they got to the family while they're emotional and they're trying
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:21.680]  to push for gun control now jacari i don't know if you found the video yet but he was telling me
[03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:26.000]  earlier right when i got in that uh there's footage of the father saying that yeah he's
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.880]  going to go out and buy a gun he's a gun supporter but you have the people that you have the government
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:35.360]  you have the mainstream media msnbc i was up late last night watching and they're sitting there going
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:40.320]  oh you know guns are bad and you got pierce morgan tweed uh it's another senseless act of violence
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:45.280]  gun violence in america how many more do we have to have before we get rid of guns and in this
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:49.200]  you know right it's the same narrative every single time and you talk about those who think
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:53.520]  it was a staged event which we have two things that happen every single time during the shooting
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:59.440]  right so first and foremost we have the gun control pushers and it's so funny to me that we even
[03:10:59.440 --> 03:11:03.760]  continue to debate gun control if you look at the fbi statistics and again this isn't even an area
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:08.720]  that i'm super into at this moment but i've done time and time again videos on this just i remember
[03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:15.680]  the fb fbi statistics is 980 000 potential deaths so it's it's crimes that could relate to death
[03:11:15.680 --> 03:11:21.600]  or stopped every single year from gun use like a you know brandishing a firearm or something like
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:28.080]  that it's stopping so many deaths over and over again and there's less than what 900 overall deaths
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:32.240]  from pistols every single year in the united states and of those you know how many are criminals
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:38.480]  it's such a lame debate to even have i mean look at go back to biblical times they didn't have guns
[03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:43.440]  what did they use can enable rocks and you really think that guy was going to not kill the woman and
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:48.000]  the cameraman if he didn't have a gun he'd been planning he was overly mentally ill this guy
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:52.640]  was out of control out of his mind he had been sitting there methodically planning this entire
[03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:57.120]  thing out for so long if he could have got his hand on a gun he would have figured something out
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:01.120]  he would have ran him off the road he could have ran up and stabbed the camera guy first because
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:06.080]  that's a bigger threat a bigger guy and then went after the lady you know there's all kinds of ways
[03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:10.960]  if somebody intends to do harm and they have that hate in their heart they will figure out a way
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:16.080]  to carry out that attack well remember the school stabbing too i believe the kid killed or at least
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:21.520]  stabbed seven or eight or nine seven eight nine people and he didn't have a gun he had a box cutter
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:25.520]  or something like that i really want to go on do a social experiment while i lay a pistol down
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:31.120]  somewhere out in public you know and just watch how many people walk by and get footage of that
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:36.480]  and show that the gun is not going to grow arms and legs stand up and go on a shooting rampage
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:41.040]  it's not going to happen it takes a sick individual to get behind that and use that tool
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:48.640]  for the wrong reasons but just because a bad accident happened because a crime happens we
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:54.880]  shouldn't have to demonize and or strip liberties away from people the right to protect themselves
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:59.600]  shall not be infringed you know yes go ahead i would i do want to take calls but at the same
[03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:03.520]  time i also want to relate what you're saying to the internet because you could say that the
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:07.600]  internet oh it's a tool of horrible things it's made people kill themselves you know children
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:11.920]  have killed themselves defamation has happened all these horrible things have happened the internet
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:16.960]  is an open source tool for those to do good and spread the word like we do or ruin people's lives
[03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:21.680]  in a great example of that is a san antonio police officer his email popped up on the ashi madison
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:26.240]  account you can go and check to see if your email pops on there he committed suicide he thought that
[03:13:26.240 --> 03:13:31.360]  his family was going to hate him this and that and it come come to find out it was a cop block guy
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:37.200]  who wrote this made up a lie and put that in there ban the internet ban the internet i think we
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:43.120]  should probably ban the internet but let's take a couple calls let's talk to jason on black lives
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:48.720]  matter because i know joe wants to speak on this specifically jason what's up hey guys how you're
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:55.920]  doing um yeah i was just you know i'm just i'm i guess i'm just frustrated that black lives matter
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:03.200]  would have the audacity to go to a state fair where there's family children kids trying to enjoy
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:09.120]  you know a day to celebrate minnesota its culture and all that stuff and you're gonna have these
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:14.720]  people protesting and you know they're not peaceful protesters either you know they're
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:22.080]  they're you know they they block people they they do stuff it's artificial capital or a police
[03:14:22.080 --> 03:14:27.040]  department they should you know i just don't understand it and i'm you know i'm gonna have to
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:34.640]  be in that mix i don't know how far into it i'm gonna be or you know what's gonna happen but i
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:40.480]  mean i'm i'm sure verbally i'm gonna be a little you know a little loud at them right and joe i want
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:46.080]  your take on this but my my view on this is its artificial form of protesting because if you really
[03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:50.000]  want to protest something like march against monsanto is a real protest movement they go to
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:55.040]  capitals they get permits they speak about facts they speak about roundup being linked to cancer
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:59.520]  by the world health organization i've spoken out it's real it's a real thing and also at the same
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:04.720]  time i support awesome black people transgender people like the ones earlier who were saying
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:08.960]  arrest hillier clinton they're awesome i don't care you can be transgender do whatever you want
[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:14.560]  i have no ill will to these people but at the same time if it's artificially inflated that oh you
[03:15:14.560 --> 03:15:19.120]  hate black people you hate transgender people no i don't know at all you're gonna go and and block
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:23.760]  the highway and tell me that i'm a bad person for no reason other than me literally being white
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:28.720]  that is the most racist thing you could possibly do and you have firsthand experience with all this
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:33.760]  stuff yeah see there's a lot of people out there in the black lives matter movement i've met personally
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:38.480]  in furgusson great people and and they're there for pure reasons but you have people like darae
[03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:45.040]  mckesson the the so-called head of black lives matter who uses racism to so-called defeat racism
[03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:49.760]  he calls people out on their whiteness and you know i i try to confront them a couple of times
[03:15:49.760 --> 03:15:53.520]  and i talk to him he's like oh just excuse your whiteness get your whiteness away from me that's
[03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:59.840]  extremely racist how are you going to beat racism by being blatantly racist and his tweets all the
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:04.800]  time all it does is stir up young people who are emotional who have maybe had something happen in
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:10.000]  their lifetime and they use that that hate and then you have the revcom come in and they boost
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.600]  them up even more the revolutionary communist party these guys show up at these events and they
[03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:19.280]  help stir the pot and it it takes something that could be pure and it turns it into this high jack
[03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:24.720]  protest that's really pointless where the caller said people are showing up they're harassing people
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:29.040]  that takes away from what's really going on and my advice to you right now if you're going to go to
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:34.720]  this event tomorrow sir is to just be careful as to what you say in a sense because they're all
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:39.280]  filming and you don't want to be that next guy that they try to post up everywhere and it can
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:44.160]  completely lose they'll make you look yeah i mean the good the ground but just don't
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:49.280]  don't lose your cool or your temper yeah they will try to egg you on but no no i don't want to do
[03:16:49.280 --> 03:16:53.760]  that i mean these people i mean they told them not to come to the mall of america what do they do
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:17:00.800]  they come to the mall of america wow congratulations you crashed a diner in some mall you know i mean
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:05.280]  that's such an absurd form of protest but the good news is all my black friends and i'd like to hear
[03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:11.120]  your take jason and joe all my black friends are legitimately concerned about real things and know
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:17.280]  that these black lives matter people are just completely artificial oh you're absolutely right
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:21.680]  i i mean i got a friend that's gonna pick me up in an hour to bring me to work he's black
[03:17:21.680 --> 03:17:26.640]  he's totally he listens to alex jones he's all about freedom he there's no color barrier
[03:17:26.640 --> 03:17:30.240]  we're racist right now for mentioning that we have black friends jason here's how they're winning
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:34.320]  though we have to make that differentiation my friends coming to pick me up he's black purple
[03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:39.600]  we wouldn't even have to talk about that purple penguin picking me up i'm sorry no yes obviously
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:43.440]  but i'm saying we wouldn't we wouldn't have to make that distinction if they weren't forcing us to
[03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:47.440]  like i wouldn't have to say my black friends know this is crazy i would just say my friends know
[03:17:47.440 --> 03:17:52.400]  this is crazy but they're making it about race and that is their objective that is the point
[03:17:52.400 --> 03:17:56.480]  that's why they are beating us and succeeding in some ways they're making it about race they're
[03:17:56.480 --> 03:18:00.880]  claiming they're fighting racism but all they're doing is bringing it down to the lowest common
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:06.000]  denominator of separation which is racial divide it's a total joke would you agree oh of course i
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:10.560]  mean like i said i've i've got a lot of my friends in charlotte right now they uh there was a cop in
[03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:17.840]  2013 i believe it was uh stop to help a young man shot and killed him there was a mistrial
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:21.680]  last week and then north carolina just came out and said that they're not going to hold another
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:25.200]  trial in this officer he essentially is going to be let go so people have taken to the streets
[03:18:25.200 --> 03:18:30.320]  that's a good reason go out and protest that you stop you ask for a cop to help you and you get
[03:18:30.320 --> 03:18:37.200]  murdered that's a reason to go out and protest that's what protesting is for but then when you go out
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:42.080]  and you start stopping traffic or there's a pregnant person out there there's a miscarriage
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:46.560]  that happens because of that now this is turning into something bad it was just like when i was in
[03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:52.000]  a Cincinnati i believe the the black lives matter protesters were out there outside of the stadium
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:56.800]  during the NBA playoffs and they threw a chair through a window and then started pepper spraying
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:19:03.120]  people how does that help your cause it all it does is obviously show the true intentions jason

[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:20.480]  anthony gucci already sitting in for alex jones with joe bigs we're talking about a number of
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:25.440]  topics we're going to take more calls throughout this final hour of the show we're going to talk
[03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:30.160]  about how this day trader made 34 million dollars while the economy was collapsing we're going to
[03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:35.040]  talk about the pope aligning with obama and what that means we're going to talk a little bit more
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:40.000]  about black lives matter some things that are going on throughout this weekend and the financial
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:44.960]  times calling for the abolishment of cash we're talking to barbara a caller and she was talking
[03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:50.240]  about holding hard assets i want to let her finish and i want to precursor that with a statement that
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:24:55.440]  in all of these collapse scenarios and i want to talk about the abolishment of cash and what
[03:24:55.440 --> 03:25:00.640]  that would mean for us and what that would mean for the wealthy elite it's always the case that
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:06.560]  someone is making cash someone is making money big time and i believe there is a secretive way
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:11.520]  with the abolishment of cash that would as alex was talking about earlier fix the issue where
[03:25:11.520 --> 03:25:15.360]  we were saying the banks are laundering so much cash they're running the drugs how could they make
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:20.480]  money if cash was abolished i have an idea that i want to throw out on that but barbara finishing
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:28.240]  up you were talking about an economic collapse what were you saying okay okay what i i came to
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:36.560]  think about was once when a friend of mine a friend and i went to cancun she brought back
[03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:43.760]  some of their colorful dollars and they had said she couldn't cash it in because that money was
[03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:51.120]  already taken off of the market then you know i had a little bit of money stored and i went to
[03:25:51.120 --> 03:25:58.720]  look and a lot of the bills didn't have the color on them so if they were going to really upset
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:04.720]  people that could be one of the scenarios that they pulled that automatically they say
[03:26:04.720 --> 03:26:11.840]  that the money without the color is not any good anymore oh i get what you're saying so they can
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:17.120]  change the standard of the dollar bill and then say everyone with the old dollar bill is no longer
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:21.840]  allowed to use that cash that's an interesting concept i definitely not heard of that before barbara
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:27.680]  thank you for your call let's start to interrupt you barbara that's very interesting let's go to
[03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:34.720]  gary and phoenix what's going on gary hey how's it going guys you might know me better as uh
[03:26:34.720 --> 03:26:39.680]  experimental on facebook and stuff awesome and what's on your mind we're a long time listener
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:46.960]  two quick points the gmo battle uh you know this is just showing that the little guy does have a
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:53.520]  voice and that we just need to keep on the pressure i mean a lot of these uh movements you know with
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:59.840]  organ you know getting rid of gmo's is because of the little guy no that's right small acts
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:05.760]  multiplied by millions can change the world well it's interesting as a child i remember my father
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:08.880]  you know hey man you want to go to burger king you want to get like a sausage biscuit or something
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:12.400]  like that and you would drive by and you would see burger king completely full the parking lot
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:17.440]  mcdonald's completely full people waiting around the line now it looks like a ghost parking lot
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:22.800]  where there's nothing going on that is the most amazing thing in the world you know what was
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:27.200]  it back during south by southwest i dress up as donald mcdonald oh yeah we got kicked out of my
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:31.760]  dollar together and and and we talked to some people and people were like yeah i eat here anyways
[03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:35.680]  but i always feel like crap the next day or i i currently don't feel good right now but i'm
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:40.720]  still going to go in anyways that that's what i i don't understand why would you purposely hurt
[03:27:40.720 --> 03:27:44.400]  yourself but the great thing is though is like you said a lot of these people are standing up a
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:48.560]  lot of these marches going on people are standing up against gmo they're saying you know what i'm
[03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:54.160]  done and people are speaking with their dollars it is awesome to see these guys get shut down voting
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:58.400]  with your dollar is my favorite way of activism i think it really really works and it reminds me
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:03.360]  you know he brought up donald ron whatever it was donald ronald's it's a puzzle in my mind
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:07.600]  and how we went to mcdonald's i remember getting kicked out i mean the security guard literally
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:14.000]  dragged me out pushed me out because i said what is in your mcnuggets i i went into the line into
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:17.760]  the well there's silicone breast implant fillers inside of course well i know what's in that one to
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:22.000]  see if they knew what's in it i wasn't even actually on i wasn't like being i wasn't on the
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:26.400]  camera piece i was like hey what's in your mcnuggets and they're like oh oh my god oh my god and they
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:30.960]  got the security goes you need to leave and push me out of there that's why we came back with you
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:35.120]  in costume and we asked them hey what's going on do you know what's in your food and everyone we
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:39.680]  asked was like yeah we know what's in our food we know it's gmo's we know it's toxic compounds
[03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:44.000]  we know it's silicon fillers we know it's total junk but you know that's fine we don't care it
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:47.040]  tastes good there's still people out there who don't know that and that's fine if you make a
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:51.920]  conscious decision to make that choice and put that in your body by all means you have that freedom
[03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:56.800]  to do so but our job is to try to at least wake enough to people who don't know that and maybe
[03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:00.560]  they aren't comfortable with that and that's kind of why they're feeling bad and they see that and
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:03.520]  they're like well maybe that's why i don't feel good after i eat this maybe i need to make a change
[03:29:03.520 --> 03:29:06.960]  yeah that's true the ones i've talked to you seem to know but the one every single person you asked
[03:29:06.960 --> 03:29:10.320]  they were like oh i have no idea what you're talking about i don't care i love mcdonalds and some of
[03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:13.840]  them though actually were freaked out and they said i'm not eating this ever again because once
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:18.720]  people realize the truth of what's really going on with their food they do stop eating it it actually
[03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:24.480]  does work activism does work and gary i agree with you we're making tangible real results that
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:29.680]  matter and we're defunding them with our dollar and coming up we're going to talk about some other
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:33.920]  ways we're beating gmo's monsanto we are going to get into the pope thing and we're going to talk
[03:29:33.920 --> 03:29:38.640]  about some action that you can take and some real solutions thanks again for watching the alex jones

[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:36.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm anthony gucciardi sitting in as we lead in
[03:33:36.080 --> 03:33:41.680]  to this long segment of the hour with some motley crew to get everyone upset about this new
[03:33:41.680 --> 03:33:48.560]  breaking headline court overturns ruling against nsa this is from the hill a federal appeals appeals
[03:33:48.560 --> 03:33:55.120]  court on friday overturned a lower court ruling against the nsa controversial collection method
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:34:00.000]  so they're saying it's totally fine that the nsa collects every single thing that you do
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:04.160]  and you can't do anything about it because joe that's what freedom is all about collecting
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:08.640]  everything you do even though you've done nothing wrong and storing it in massive databases which by
[03:34:08.640 --> 03:34:14.320]  the way i personally went to and was kicked out of you remember that yeah i we went to the nsa
[03:34:14.320 --> 03:34:19.440]  because we know that's how long how long ago was that about two years ago up there in utah
[03:34:19.440 --> 03:34:27.600]  in your park city area and we went up to the nsa data center and i had a simple request i wanted
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:32.640]  to know some id i wanted id from one of the nsa workers there i wanted to see their id and i
[03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:36.000]  wanted to look through their phone history and just look at everything they've ever done
[03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:41.520]  because that's what they do to me and i get to do that to them too now my plan was to actually go
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:46.800]  into the nsa center park my vehicle and go up and ask them for their information and just kind of
[03:34:46.800 --> 03:34:50.320]  talk to them and say hey why can't i look at your internet browsing history i want i want to check
[03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:57.120]  that out but i actually didn't get even farther than the parking lot because a bunch of nsa security
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:04.000]  trooper people next to the military base that's on swarmed out in their huge chevies with a dog
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:09.200]  that is trained to murder people a massive german shepherd and i was told that i was lucky the dog
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:16.480]  wasn't hungry that day because he was going to bite my testicles off and i was totally escorted off
[03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:21.280]  and i was arrested by these nsa agents under what authority i'm not sure and told that if i ever come
[03:35:21.280 --> 03:35:26.320]  back i'm going to military prison so that was not very friendly of them that was not a very friendly
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:31.440]  encounter the ns the articles on screen from info wars dot com they're all good though nsa
[03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:37.200]  goons threaten reporters with attack dogs unless exactly what happened that they said i was lucky
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:42.080]  the dogs weren't hungry and insinuated that uh they were going to bite my testicles off which
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:46.640]  probably would not have been a very fun experience that's the nsa that's fine that's fine the the
[03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:49.920]  federal appeals court said that's great they're awesome and we're going to we're showing the video
[03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:53.920]  on screen right now as they're there for your protection though they're there for my protection
[03:35:53.920 --> 03:35:59.600]  and they i forgot to mention the key point they took they took our cameras away and started to rip
[03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:05.200]  out the cards the um you know the the memory cards as the cards and sd cards rip them out
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:11.040]  but thankfully we're able to capture the footage but that's totally legal let's go talk about this
[03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:15.600]  pope story then we're going to get back to the calls because i kept saying i would cover it this
[03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:25.360]  is from ap pope shifts to shared goals with obama as papal visit nears sweeping into office in 2009
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:30.080]  president barack obama captured near rock star status around the world among millions who saw
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:35.680]  him as the embodiment of a new sense of social purpose oh how sweet now that baton has largely
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:40.640]  been passed to pope francis whose visit to the white house next month will put his common cause
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:47.360]  with obama on vivid display a common cause of destroying the country and destroying its economic
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:52.960]  ability while also siphoning all of its riches and wealth to the same quote unquote democrats who
[03:36:52.960 --> 03:36:58.000]  are looting it blind that sounds like an amazing pope doesn't it yeah that sounds awesome i mean
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:02.320]  religion hey hey that's very catholic right steal everything loot everything and destroy it i'm
[03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:06.720]  being sarcastic obviously catholics are real true catholics are against that and i know
[03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:12.960]  that very well many people in my family understand that and are true christians let's go to
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:18.640]  adam who wants to talk about the notorious donald trump which is on everyone's mind and it seems
[03:37:18.640 --> 03:37:21.760]  like we've talked about it but everyone just wants to keep getting into it and i understand why
[03:37:21.760 --> 03:37:27.600]  because it's an attractive subject adam what's on your mind well since i've been on hold so long
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:31.120]  i'm listening you guys i have some other points i could all right throw them out let's hear them
[03:37:31.120 --> 03:37:36.000]  let's do it well basically i got two i got one for you joe and one for you anthony with the joe
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:41.360]  the point for you joe is about basically how i feel if they take away guns it's just going to get
[03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:48.080]  worse humans as a species are so successful because of how inventive we are and how creative we are
[03:37:48.080 --> 03:37:53.760]  and if a human has ill will they're still going to get the job done with the boston bombing or the
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:57.600]  trade you know the trade center being taken down with planes they're just going to figure out an
[03:37:57.600 --> 03:38:04.240]  even more sinister way to kill people so guns is not you know taking away guns as you know is not
[03:38:04.240 --> 03:38:11.440]  going to stop human beings we are a successful creative species it's all about controlling
[03:38:11.440 --> 03:38:17.680]  people's minds and technology it's keeping you in the dark because your knowledge is power and if
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:23.200]  you want to use knowledge for a bad thing it's powerful you know so and then the other thing
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:30.240]  i want to make a point for the gmo is is basically i'm in the business of selling rare fruit and i've
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:37.920]  on a everyday basis have to kind of keep my feelings out so i am aware of what i'm selling
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:42.960]  and who's getting it and what they're doing with it because i sell rare seeds and you know i feel
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.360]  like i'm in a in a special position where i have to be responsible well that's good that you are
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:52.560]  responsible because you know most of the seed out there is at risk of being contaminated by gmo's on
[03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:58.560]  a major major scale to the point where organic farms are forced to sue neighboring gmo farms
[03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:04.960]  because just the wind can blow the gmo seed into the organic farms and it kind of reminds me of a
[03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:11.520]  2007 report about gmo alfalfa where monsanto had these testing grounds for gmo alfalfa before the
[03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:16.720]  usda approved them and the alfalfa was being spread to nearby farms and they didn't think
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:21.440]  to test for it because why would they there's no such thing at this point as approved gmo alfalfa
[03:39:21.440 --> 03:39:26.000]  and they were organic barrels and they were tested and they had gmo's inside of them from
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:31.520]  this gmo alfalfa seed so there is a huge risk with gmo contamination that it could spread it could be
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:36.480]  out of control and i would i would i would push to those people that say gmo's are safe at least
[03:39:36.480 --> 03:39:40.320]  they're oh we think they're safe right now well what about in a hundred years of our entire food
[03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:46.240]  supply is contaminated with genetically modified organisms what then we know the risks are untold
[03:39:46.240 --> 03:39:50.480]  they're truly untold and the round up alone in the part in the crops is killing people
[03:39:51.040 --> 03:39:54.800]  and joe if you have any comments on that before we go to the next caller well it always reminds me
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:59.360]  of that scene from the matrix when the guy the the maryl vingy or whatever sitting there and he's
[03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:04.160]  eating the steak and he's like i see the steak i smell it my brain tells me it's there it tastes
[03:40:04.160 --> 03:40:09.200]  good but i know it's not there you know and i think that a lot now when i go out and i i get
[03:40:09.200 --> 03:40:14.000]  vegetables or i i get food i'm sitting there thinking like is this an actual chicken or is
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:18.400]  this a chicken that's been beefed up so big on steroids because really one's the last time we
[03:40:18.400 --> 03:40:22.320]  probably actually had a real chicken that's you know chickens aren't that big but now you see them
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:27.360]  at these farms see these those footage of them they're giant they're like hulk ogans with feathers
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:32.320]  right you see these giant large tomatoes it could literally be like a melon of some sort
[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:38.000]  and it's funny because i watch movies and they're supposed to be set in like roman times or even
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:43.440]  you know the 1600s or something and they have bananas modern day bananas or they have modern
[03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:48.560]  day oranges and stuff like that our food supply outside of the genic modification which is a whole
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:54.640]  another dimension has been selectively bred into this sugar laden weird fruit that actually didn't
[03:40:54.640 --> 03:41:01.600]  exist hundreds of years ago at all i mean bananas were kind of like short stubby brownish type things
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:07.440]  that weren't nearly as sweet now the idea of a banana is this like sweet super yellow thing
[03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:13.040]  that everyone loves our food supply has completely warped it's been completely selectively bred
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:16.400]  that's not to say that it's the same as gmo though because that just means you know it's
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:20.960]  like a dog you get a german shepherd from breeding certain type of dogs you get a yorki from another
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:26.560]  one a pit bull from another one blah blah blah as opposed to splicing the gene of a scorpion into
[03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:31.440]  the dog which is genic modification so it's a world of difference but our food supply is is changed
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:37.360]  completely and i call it the new health paradigm versus the old health paradigm let's say pre 1900s
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:43.760]  is the is the old paradigm in which an apple is an apple you're not going to have pesticides
[03:41:43.760 --> 03:41:46.880]  and herbicides killing you when you eat an apple you're not going to have genetic modification
[03:41:46.880 --> 03:41:50.960]  of any kind you're going to have a pretty balanced diet even if you just eat whatever is out there
[03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:54.960]  in the new health paradigm when you go out to the grocery store in apple is no longer just an apple
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:59.200]  it has a film outside of it it has herbicides pesticides fungicides you name it it could even
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:03.840]  be gmo now with a new arctic apple so we're living in a new health paradigm where we don't even know
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:10.560]  what we're eating unless we super investigate our food let's go to dany in texas he wants to talk
[03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:20.640]  about the economy and a potential economic crash what's up dany i'm doing great awesome okay let
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:25.920]  me get y'all speaker here all right so what's on your mind dany what do you want to talk about
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:30.320]  about the economic crash that's okay for a minute there to get y'all speaker but i find you to be
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:38.640]  better listen uh i've been going to try to get in uh about a book that's written by jonathan con
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:46.240]  and you know i on the one hand i think alex has probably read it but i don't know it what's in
[03:42:46.240 --> 03:42:52.640]  this book what's what's this book about it's it's the name of it's the harbinger and it's say
[03:42:52.640 --> 03:43:03.120]  it's written in story formed by a guy that puts together all of the uh jewish uh traditions and
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:13.840]  and uh warnings from god uh and i would say at sector nine uh first hand uh and what he does
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:23.920]  he ties it all together into the from the fall of israel uh directly uh across to nine eleven and
[03:43:23.920 --> 03:43:31.040]  then he uh and he states that the reason for this is uh is because the shimata are you familiar
[03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:36.000]  with the shimata that's interesting that's definitely not my area of expertise but apparently
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:40.880]  the producers just said that alex has had this guy that you're i guess the author on the nightly
[03:43:40.880 --> 03:43:45.280]  news and he's talked at length about it uh joe if you're familiar with any of this no but i mean
[03:43:45.280 --> 03:43:49.760]  i've heard leigh ann talk about the the shimata thing before uh i think it was a couple months
[03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:54.240]  ago she did a story in here with a guy about that but yeah i'm not really that well are you
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:43:59.840]  saying there's an economic crash prediction you'd like to make well well yeah what what it comes
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:07.040]  down to is he doesn't exactly say this in the book but the end of this this uh this period of seven
[03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:12.960]  years is what you which is what the shimata is about when debts are supposed to be forgiven
[03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:21.040]  on the last day of the seventh year and that's in the uh the uh the jewish month of ilah
[03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:29.920]  and that happens to coincide with september in fact september the 29th and so uh it the book
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:36.880]  itself is a is an outstanding piece but it will just blow you away how everything ties
[03:44:36.880 --> 03:44:46.800]  into uh the bible and jewish tradition and and uh and and so what uh the last uh you know that is
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:51.920]  very interesting my my my i've heard a lot about september some of the most insane things you
[03:44:51.920 --> 03:44:56.480]  could possibly hear at some of the most rational things yeah i've heard about asteroids blowing
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:45:01.600]  the planet up i've heard about bank holidays i've heard i've heard about insider stock trading
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:04.720]  that's going on that's going to mess everything up i've heard about china collapsing in different
[03:45:04.720 --> 03:45:09.680]  ways i've heard everything you could possibly imagine about september and october from people
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:14.000]  that i think are way out there and also people that i think are super sound of mind and super
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:18.320]  intelligence know what they're talking about so i have i have no clue really what's going to go on
[03:45:18.320 --> 03:45:22.720]  all i know is it's important to secure yourself no matter what is i mean at the end of the day
[03:45:23.280 --> 03:45:27.680]  are you going to sit around and worry about something that might happen or just go ahead and

[03:46:00.800 --> 03:46:04.640]  in those times let's go to another call but first and foremost i also want to say you know
[03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:07.840]  if there is something catastrophic like an asteroid destroying the earth i mean
[03:46:09.280 --> 03:46:12.400]  it's gonna happen or it's not i mean you know there's nothing we're gonna die or we're not
[03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:15.280]  gonna die i could die right now i could die tomorrow i could have a heart attack tomorrow

[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:26.320]  and figure out your take on it all right let's talk about matt when we go to matt in washington
[03:46:26.320 --> 03:46:33.200]  yeah matt in washington was sheriff ozzy what's going on matt hey you guys uh i was up at the
[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:37.280]  rally with joe and those guys we had a lot we had a real good time it's nice to hear you guys on the
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:44.960]  fourth hour today thanks a lot i uh have you guys seen ozzy's two hour presentation on the myth of
[03:46:44.960 --> 03:46:50.560]  police militarization um i actually haven't seen it yet but i've heard about it uh tell me more about
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:58.400]  it well um it's it's just a it's a two hour presentation he did here back in june and so i
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:03.600]  saw i watched most of it and i hit him up on facebook and i said hey you know alex jones wants to
[03:47:03.600 --> 03:47:10.080]  debate you uh what are your thoughts on that and his response was that alex jones doesn't have the
[03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:16.160]  courage to debate him and neither did matt shea well that's funny because uh we went up there
[03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:22.560]  almost a year ago and specifically to debate this guy especially after those comments came out
[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:28.400]  from one of their uh officers about the m-rap being used for constitutionalists and how they
[03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:33.680]  stockpile weapons and ammo and how we're you know we're these evil bad people and we showed up there
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:41.600]  was myself darin Mcbrane uh travis tonight and we went out there we went to confront this guy and
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:46.880]  then all of a sudden he goes on this unexpected vacation tuxas tell between his legs and runs off
[03:47:46.880 --> 03:47:50.880]  and the whole time we're out there for four or five days everyone's like there's these ozzy
[03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:56.160]  spottings where people saw the sheriff like in civilian attire at a restaurant somewhere ducking
[03:47:56.160 --> 03:48:03.200]  and dodging he that's what he does this guy is a puppet for the splc the that's a complete and
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:10.080]  total dirt bag garbage group anyways but i mean it's almost like having at the end of the day
[03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:15.120]  sheriff ozzy nezaviz should bring in snopes to investigate their uh the the crimes they have
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:20.480]  and spoke in because i mean that's how out of this world this guy is well i'm sure alex is
[03:48:20.480 --> 03:48:25.200]  cowering in fear and totally uh unwilling to debate him right i'm pretty sure it's been
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:30.560]  opened up before i think he had the ability to uh contact the producers of the show yeah he uh
[03:48:30.560 --> 03:48:36.160]  he backed out before i mean uh he's wrote me on or written me on uh facebook as well the entire
[03:48:36.160 --> 03:48:40.640]  spokane sheriff's department has written me as well saying that uh they're they're not afraid
[03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:46.000]  that anytime they're willing to uh debate alex and the info wars crew and you know i just see
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:50.800]  it being another he's gonna tuck his tail and run and come up with an excuse and then you know call
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:56.080]  us uh constitutionalist and compare us to isis again interesting well let's we'll see how that
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:49:02.000]  pans out maybe joe you can uh go hang out with that loving man let's yeah let's talk to richard
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:09.200]  from Missouri he wants to talk about economic news what's going on richard hey my question is
[03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:15.120]  is that you know i believe wholeheartedly in uh owning uh currency in the form of gold silver
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:22.080]  there's companies out there that offer 401k rollovers and ira's in which that they hold precious
[03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:28.880]  metal at a depository um and i'm not sure there's there's numerous countries for a company companies
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:34.400]  around the country that offer this um what's your thoughts on on rolling your 401k over into
[03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:41.200]  uh gold or silver that's held in in one of these depositories that uh uh what's your thoughts on
[03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:45.520]  my thoughts so i could give you the perspective based on the economic experts that i've spoken to
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:50.560]  and personally i hold physical gold and silver but the perspective of this is dependent upon
[03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:54.800]  how much of a preparedness you know lands you want to look through i mean specifically you're
[03:49:54.800 --> 03:49:59.360]  buying essentially paper slips that guarantee you to a certain amount of gold and silver in a vault
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:05.600]  somewhere in the known universe so in a theoretical complete collapse scenario that piece of paper
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:10.640]  is not exactly going to get you very far right so you also have a 401k system that's built into
[03:50:10.640 --> 03:50:16.640]  catlast at least you know several years before you turn that age now from a balanced perspective
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:22.560]  if you're thinking that the economy obviously you know is is not going to completely turn over and
[03:50:22.560 --> 03:50:27.280]  it's not going to go out within the next several years and you're at a certain age to where you
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:33.760]  can cash out a new 401k it's probably better than holding physical uh non-physical cash holding digits
[03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:38.960]  into space at least a piece of paper guaranteeing you gold and silver would invest in guns and ammo
[03:50:38.960 --> 03:50:44.480]  yeah i'm personally a physical investor as well but there's numerous ways to look at it i'm anthony

[03:54:38.720 --> 03:54:46.000]  where you guys busted le targets the same website uh usa spending dot go it shows on there if you
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:56.800]  search um stratospheric aerosols a litany of universities and private corporations come up
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:55:02.160]  where they're doing different tests and i just thought that was would be some good news to
[03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:07.200]  to maybe get out there because you know they always say that kim trills aren't real but
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:12.400]  here you go stratospheric aerosols so what do you make of that so there's three i believe that
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:20.000]  uh it's definitely going on absolutely what do you think joe the controls i definitely
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:26.320]  hear a question the chemtrails to me is definitely it's it has been pushed to the cd underbelly
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:30.720]  of the alternative news world hasn't it yeah it really has been pushed to the cd underbelly
[03:55:30.720 --> 03:55:34.000]  and there's a lot of information out there there really is there's a lot of information there's
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:39.680]  a lot of disinformation there is a lot to merit research there's a lot to merit the cd underbelly
[03:55:39.680 --> 03:55:43.040]  that's funny though as soon as you bring it up everyone's like whoa you're crazy you just went
[03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:47.280]  there oh my god it's definitely it's definitely been put it's like bringing up a religion or
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:51.680]  politics at a boss it's it's it's been pushed to the cd underbelly but what what were you going to
[03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:59.360]  say richard well i live outside of oak ridge and i've seen this in southwest uh virginia as well
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:06.240]  but i see uh some drones quite a bit uh white aircraft it just moved very slowly some without
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:11.200]  wings you guys ever seen anything like this i have not seen anything like that that's a negative
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:16.000]  here you should take a video of it put it on youtube all right let's go to brent real quick
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:21.200]  we're going to wrap up the show here brent what's going on hey guys thanks for taking my call and
[03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:26.000]  i appreciate listening to your excellent investigative journalism uh i just wanted to
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:31.440]  call today to see that i've pulled across a news article i believe those from the wall street journal
[03:56:31.440 --> 03:56:41.120]  or four but basically it just says that on october the 21st 2015 the imf is scheduled uh to announce
[03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:48.400]  a currency uh change basically that it said to move hundreds of billions of dollars overnight
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:53.440]  and i just wanted to let you guys know about that and if it's interesting you can look into it
[03:56:53.440 --> 03:56:57.520]  that is interesting i'm definitely going to have to look at look that up and it seems like
[03:56:57.520 --> 03:57:02.480]  it's almost like the major banking institutions and world currency institutions are feeding into
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:06.080]  the idea that something crazy is going to happen in october just because they're making so many
[03:57:06.080 --> 03:57:10.560]  actions they're doing so many weird things in september and october and once again i'm not
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:14.240]  sitting here saying anything it's going to happen it is interesting though that all of these movements
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:20.640]  are happening at one time pushing together joe begs your take on this i mean i agree with what
[03:57:20.640 --> 03:57:27.120]  you just said i mean that their actions alone are going to spark people's reactions on the
[03:57:27.120 --> 03:57:30.160]  opposite end as well like all right they're doing they're begging for it so that means something's
[03:57:30.160 --> 03:57:33.280]  happening that means something happening and that sends everybody into a panic
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:37.600]  end of the day do i know what's going to happen no but like i said before to the last caller
[03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:42.720]  i'm going to be prepared i've got my guns i'm ready to go you know yeah you need to get everything
