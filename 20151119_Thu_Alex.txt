[09:48.400 --> 09:54.560]  opening our borders up and bringing in 100 000 first it was 10 000 now it's 100 000 now they're
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.480]  talking about 300 000 and if we accept that will be 3 million that is the same formula they've used
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.880]  in europe so that's all coming up today and then anthony gucciardi will be able to hosting the fourth
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.680]  hour and has a lot of breaking news and analysis that we'll be telling you about later when he when
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.320]  he hosts the fourth hour that we've added to the transmission because there's so much news
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.840]  that said just look at some of these headlines i've got in front of me
[10:21.840 --> 10:32.560]  exclusive six men from pakistan afghanistan bus city legally entering arizona from
[10:33.280 --> 10:40.480]  mexico and that is from bright bart texas brandon darby now remember supposedly theories that any
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.320]  islamics are coming across no other than mexicans is what it's called by the board patrol come in by
[10:46.320 --> 10:55.440]  the thousands per border state with mexico per month if you go and look at the numbers released
[10:55.440 --> 11:03.840]  by them it will tell you the countries pakistan syria saudi arabia jordan lebanon and a lot of
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.840]  them are just looking for work trying to their families but some of them are radical some of
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.240]  them are planning terror attacks and isis and others have planned to do that so there's that report
[11:12.240 --> 11:21.040]  six syrian with fake passport captured in honduras on way to the united states
[11:21.920 --> 11:27.120]  there is a another report from gateway pundit here's another report
[11:32.320 --> 11:39.440]  throngs of children are trying to cross the texas border again and notice the strategy
[11:39.440 --> 11:46.480]  obama a few days ago said oh you're scared of women and widows and children blowing you up and then
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.080]  a woman suicide bomber blew herself up in a police dog in paris yesterday and our reporters were on
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.720]  scene you know just a minutes after it happened but see that's how they bill it 17 percent of the
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.920]  people coming in this year and last year according to border patrol they have the numbers are below
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.920]  the age of 18 18 or younger but see it's always children and it doesn't matter that upwards of
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.680]  80 percent of the quote immigrants to the u.s and to europe these migrants are military age men
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.840]  and our wahhabist who failed in the takeover they were there to get their own land takeover people's
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.280]  houses that's what the jihadis do they come in they colonize they run you out of your home
[12:28.400 --> 12:33.040]  and they take it over that's what's done in the middle east they usurp each other back and forth
[12:33.040 --> 12:39.680]  and it is the sunnis traditionally that of the main usurpers because they are the majority of islam
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.680]  79 percent i'm not demonizing sunnis a lot of sunnis aren't radical and are great people
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.280]  it's a fact though that they're the ones quarterbacking the radical islamic takeover
[12:51.280 --> 12:58.160]  worldwide so there is that report syrian community leader says isis is already in america new york
[12:58.160 --> 13:05.440]  post uh yeah no kidding it's not uh already in america it is in america it's been allowed into
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.480]  america and now isis is threatening new york city in a new propaganda video
[13:13.840 --> 13:19.680]  now before i get into all of that i want to tie it in to the fact that
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.920]  that obama thinks we're stupid and thinks that he can get away
[13:28.720 --> 13:35.920]  with bringing in unlimited radical islamists and then when they attack military recruiting
[13:35.920 --> 13:44.720]  centers when they attack community centers when they attack government facilities they will just
[13:44.720 --> 13:54.160]  spend it and say it's not islamic and the dutiful cbs nbc abc cnn msnbc will all dutifully report
[13:54.160 --> 14:00.160]  that it's not islamic period just like the ford hood shooting they said was not uh radical islamic
[14:00.160 --> 14:09.920]  behavior when you kill 14 people screaming a lot bar it is but what they don't seem to take into
[14:09.920 --> 14:16.640]  account is the alternative media that is the real media already has bigger numbers put together
[14:16.640 --> 14:23.120]  in the overall aggregate in the final sum the dinosaur media dinosaur media is beyond its
[14:23.120 --> 14:30.160]  last legs it is laying in the desert with labored breath about to go into history
[14:31.520 --> 14:38.800]  and that brings me to this next outrage info wars dot com obama plans to veto refugee screening
[14:38.800 --> 14:48.240]  bill despite terrorists having entered u.s as refugees the fbi in more than a dozen states as
[14:48.240 --> 14:55.280]  you know in the last two days has arrested 69 people with ties to isis who they report were
[14:55.280 --> 15:05.600]  planning attacks in this country but obama is coming out and and has now ordered the fbi to come
[15:05.600 --> 15:13.200]  out today and say that there are no islamic isis connected cells in the united states well we know
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.440]  their isis training camps in the united states that were allowed to operate to train jihadis to
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.000]  send them to syria to libya and to egypt and iraq that is on record that they were allowed to
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.240]  recruit and do this now they've just flipped against the west and i don't know who's double
[15:32.240 --> 15:40.800]  cross and who but it is a mess and if they ever act like borders could bring security if they ever
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.800]  act like we deserve to have any screening process at all then their whole fraud that borders don't
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.920]  matter collapses so that's why they have to double down again and double down on top of that and then
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.800]  double down and double down again and say there are no islamic terrorist there are no islamic
[15:56.800 --> 16:03.360]  terror attacks no one's gonna hurt you nothing's happening and why they've had democrat congress
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.640]  women we talked about it yesterday come out and say we need to restrict guns because of paris
[16:09.200 --> 16:16.160]  see it's the suspension of common sense paris has a gun ban like new york or chicago or dc
[16:17.360 --> 16:22.240]  paris is one of the most restrictive gun-free zones in the world and it's a hotbed of terror
[16:22.240 --> 16:28.720]  attacks because it's wide open so how do you counter the answer to a threat like the head
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.280]  of interpol said a few years ago when the kenya chopping malls got attacked he said arm the
[16:33.280 --> 16:40.000]  citizens like they do in texas or colorada that is the answer that's the quote abc news so when
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.840]  you've got common sense like that gaining ground you just come out and say the answer's take everybody's
[16:45.840 --> 16:53.040]  guns away because an ices terrorist is going to follow the law and they're not going to attack
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.160]  anybody because there's a sign on the door saying it's a gun-free zone and if you believe that you
[16:58.160 --> 17:04.080]  believe the frosty weather that's hit part of the us came from a little elf named jack frost
[17:07.520 --> 17:12.560]  that we come back from break i'm going to play this congresswoman but here is the outrage obama
[17:12.560 --> 17:19.440]  plans to veto refugee screening bill despite terrorists having entered us as refugees president
[17:19.440 --> 17:28.640]  says legislation would create unnecessary and impractical requirements and all it's saying is
[17:28.640 --> 17:32.480]  they've got to be vetted to screened and prove their passports are accurate and they don't have
[17:32.480 --> 17:41.280]  affiliations with dome terror groups it's not even proper screening i mean why would a country
[17:41.280 --> 17:46.000]  that's already got 40 million illegals in it why would a country that's already going bankrupt
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.960]  want to take on people from a war-torn nation brimming with jihadis and military age men
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.200]  and then not screen them when almost all the passports they say five out of six
[17:59.200 --> 18:10.000]  is the EU's own statement a month ago five out of six syrian passports are fake fake five
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.080]  you've got a fake passport you're not coming in if i showed up born in this country born in
[18:16.080 --> 18:23.200]  dallas texas 41 almost 42 years ago if i showed up to the united states border flew in say to
[18:23.200 --> 18:30.400]  austin texas and i had a fake passport saying my name was john brown or my name was david thompson
[18:30.400 --> 18:40.880]  or my name was bill sanchez whatever john doe they would arrest me for fraud and they should
[18:42.640 --> 18:46.480]  but not if i'm an illegal alien from latin america or africa or the middle east
[18:49.040 --> 18:52.880]  it's bizarre ladies and gentlemen because they have all the security theater how they've got to
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.920]  keep us safe take all our rights away because al-qaeda is hiding under every you know bench
[18:57.920 --> 19:03.920]  every bed every closet the boogie man meanwhile you've got a real jihad army taking over part of
[19:03.920 --> 19:11.040]  iraq syria libya overthrew for a full year egypt our ally our government backed these people
[19:12.880 --> 19:19.120]  and now we're told we're gonna bring them in it just shows the incredible boldness of this
[19:19.120 --> 19:23.040]  administration i think they've gone too far obviously they've gone too far legally and
[19:23.040 --> 19:28.960]  lawfully this is treason this is sedition this is a military act against this country by classical
[19:28.960 --> 19:35.440]  definitions again that's not rhetoric i don't have words that rise to the level of this outrageous
[19:36.640 --> 19:45.840]  miscarriage of sanity but it's gone too far even in the system even in this horde out corrupt system
[19:45.840 --> 19:56.320]  this blasted ragged out system this pothold rotting shot system this is too much because you
[19:56.320 --> 20:02.960]  push the whole security theater on trial my name is bill bonner and i have an important message
[20:02.960 --> 20:08.400]  right now the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis
[20:08.400 --> 20:14.640]  but they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways
[20:14.640 --> 20:20.560]  you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.760]  look i've made predictions like this before a few years ago i warned that the housing prices

[24:30.560 --> 24:38.000]  folks ask why i have such high energy why i tend to get on the edge of hysteria it's crazy to have
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.360]  the president of the united states saying they're going to bring in a hundred thousand now quote
[24:45.360 --> 24:52.640]  refugees from an al-qaeda offensive area and almost all of them it turns out are sunnis
[24:52.640 --> 24:57.360]  that came into syria to take over and have now failed and have nowhere to go
[25:00.720 --> 25:07.040]  these are like pilgrims you know on the wagon trains going west wanting to take over land basically
[25:07.040 --> 25:15.040]  and they're almost all military age men that is admitted and i just cannot believe
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.440]  how bold this illegitimate government is at the top pulling stuff like this i mean i can't even
[25:23.440 --> 25:30.960]  believe it and they just caught six men from pakistan afghanistan busted illegally entering
[25:30.960 --> 25:41.120]  arizona from mexico and right bark texas does have a lot of really good sources we have sources
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.520]  inside the border patrol that told us to go down obviously last year and show where they
[25:45.520 --> 25:52.400]  bring the illegals in give them the vouchers and then bust them into the country but at
[25:52.400 --> 25:59.920]  least that's latin americans most of them aren't criminals or terrorists a highly trusted federal
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.480]  agent working under the umbrella of us customs and border protection has confirmed to bright
[26:04.480 --> 26:10.000]  bark texas that a group comprised of five pakistan men and one from afghanistan was captured by us
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.240]  border patrol agents after having illegally crossed the poorest us mexico border in the tucson sector
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.560]  of arizona the six men traveling in a group were captured roughly 16 miles into the state of arizona
[26:22.560 --> 26:29.440]  specifically near the small picturesque town of patagonia arizona the apprehension of the group
[26:29.440 --> 26:36.880]  occurred late on monday night november 16th 2015 border patrol agents were unable to do extensive
[26:36.880 --> 26:40.720]  interviews with the six militant men because the federal rear of investigation took over the matter
[26:40.720 --> 26:45.360]  the aliens were immediately transferred to tucson where the FBI took custody and there's just nothing
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.480]  else really known about that and this is ongoing if you look because they only released it every
[26:50.480 --> 26:56.320]  few months the latest numbers on what's who's been apprehended and what it'll say you know
[26:56.320 --> 27:03.520]  27 000 mexicans in this sector uh 3000 i mean i'm going from just just stalt memory
[27:03.520 --> 27:12.800]  guatemalan's uh 1200 uh venezuelans it'll it'll say and then it'll say 127 pakistanis you know
[27:12.800 --> 27:22.160]  24 syrians it just it says the numbers john carrey again is in mbc news saying except 85 000
[27:22.160 --> 27:29.920]  refugees in 2016 100 000 in 2017 so the number is always growing now they're talking about 300 000 see
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.560]  but then they keep using this 10 000 number in the news to confuse everybody
[27:36.560 --> 27:40.880]  that's how they started four or five years ago in germany they go we're gonna take 10 000 refugees
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.640]  next it's 100 000 300 000 a million two million three million plus now in germany
[27:46.640 --> 27:53.040]  three million in the last four years now they're talking about three million in the next two years
[27:54.080 --> 28:00.560]  in germany there's only 60 million people in both countries when it was east and west
[28:02.960 --> 28:09.920]  so it really is incredible and i just asked her by the question how will the establishment get
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.000]  away with this when there are terror attacks in this country what are they planning well they're
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.600]  going to use the threat to build up this big apparatus of security that's then focused on
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.960]  the american people and i said i'd play the clip uh we do have the clip of this congresswoman
[28:25.920 --> 28:31.040]  yesterday coming out and saying that we need to restrict the second amendment
[28:33.600 --> 28:41.920]  because of what happened in paris here it is but i do want to remind you that before we killed a
[28:41.920 --> 28:52.480]  jihadist named alaki he did a video that said to americans join the jihad and get guns because it's
[28:52.480 --> 29:01.680]  so easy in the united states of america to get a weapon and that ought to be a chilling reminder
[29:01.680 --> 29:09.920]  because aside from blowing themselves up which is uh of course not about small weapons these
[29:09.920 --> 29:16.320]  people use the kinds of weapons that are still available in the united states of of america
[29:16.320 --> 29:24.960]  and i think it ought to cause us to have another consideration of sensible gun safety laws well
[29:24.960 --> 29:31.840]  that's uh jan chicowski from illinois yeah they had illegal plastic explosives too bimbo
[29:33.280 --> 29:38.160]  and you've got armed guards protecting you you little slime bag it was a gun-free zone where
[29:38.160 --> 29:44.640]  they attacked you monster so sick of felt like you and these people are anti-american trash

[29:51.680 --> 30:00.080]  their slaves disarmed alex jones predators want to feed on declawed prey while the government
[30:00.080 --> 30:05.760]  claims the tetanus vaccine is perfectly safe the kenya catholic doctors association disagrees
[30:05.760 --> 30:10.720]  they're charging unicef in the world health organization with sterilizing millions of girls
[30:10.720 --> 30:16.480]  and women undercover of an anti-tetanus vaccination program sponsored by the kenyan government the
[30:16.480 --> 30:23.040]  association had six tetanus vaccinations from around kenya tested 100 of them tested positive
[30:23.040 --> 30:30.400]  for the hcg antigen hcg is a pregnancy hormone developed by the world health organization in 1992
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.960]  and it's commonly used in anti fertility vaccines a spokesman for the kenya catholic doctors association
[30:36.960 --> 30:41.840]  said this proved right our worst fears that this world health organization campaign is
[30:41.840 --> 30:47.760]  not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well coordinated forceful population control

[33:43.840 --> 33:54.080]  christians should be admitted that's offensive and contrary to american values i cannot think of a
[33:54.080 --> 34:03.520]  more uh more potent recruitment tool for isil than some of the rhetoric that's been coming out of
[34:03.520 --> 34:12.320]  here uh during the course of this debate isle seeks to exploit the idea that there is a war
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.560]  between islam and the west all right that's enough everything obama says is a lie
[34:20.080 --> 34:24.480]  that we're against widows and three-year-olds no we were against turning women into widows
[34:24.480 --> 34:30.560]  and driving three-year-olds out of syria but that's not who's coming over it's men that want jobs
[34:30.560 --> 34:39.200]  it's men that want welfare it's men that want brides many of them a large minority of them
[34:39.200 --> 34:44.240]  are jihadis that failed in the takeover of syria and are now being allowed into turkey
[34:45.360 --> 34:50.400]  north of syria and then they're allowed to infiltrate and march in giant columns
[34:50.400 --> 34:54.720]  by the hundreds of thousands incredible footage that everyone's seen into europe
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.200]  and germans are told you'll be arrested if you criticize it and within hours of obama
[35:02.560 --> 35:07.760]  saying you know you're scared of women a woman blew herself up and blew a police dog up
[35:07.760 --> 35:10.800]  and shrapnel flew into the police vehicles nearby
[35:15.840 --> 35:18.240]  and then he goes on to say he can't think of a better recruiting
[35:19.120 --> 35:27.040]  tool for isis when the west funded isis 90 plus percent of the rebels are
[35:27.040 --> 35:38.000]  wahhabist al-nasra al-qaeda isis same group isis is the worldwide caliphate recruiting arm establishing
[35:38.000 --> 35:47.520]  islamic states is is the islamic state they're setting up with an area between eastern syria
[35:47.520 --> 35:55.040]  and western iraq and the public is so incredibly politically uninformed and geopolitically
[35:55.040 --> 35:59.120]  uninformed about what's going on in the world that they get confused by it
[36:01.440 --> 36:07.280]  former dia director us made willful decision to support isis in syria
[36:09.760 --> 36:14.160]  that was former top general on record
[36:14.160 --> 36:23.600]  general michael flinn should i play the clip again
[36:25.840 --> 36:29.440]  and by the way i'm not a fan of a lot of the stuff that comes out of the moodles than i ran
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.680]  but i'm not for war with iran and iran is not attacking this country they're the shiites that
[36:35.680 --> 36:42.720]  are fighting the shiites believe you've got to be genetically descended from muhammad the prophet
[36:42.720 --> 36:50.080]  to be able to be a cleric obviously that's not going to take over islam even though it's arguably
[36:50.080 --> 36:58.880]  the oldest form of islam the sunnis say no you've just got to profess it and be recognized
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.600]  by the people as a spiritual leader that's why they're the majority of islam because there's
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.080]  going to be a lot more preachers out there pushing their brand of islam because they can say that
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.880]  they're a madi or a leader or a spiritual man because according to the shiites you got to be
[37:12.880 --> 37:20.720]  related to muhammad and that's the big fight in islam ladies and gentlemen and the average american
[37:20.720 --> 37:28.240]  doesn't even know what that is and that's what the politicians prey on all day long and now the
[37:28.240 --> 37:42.080]  supreme leader of iran the ayatollah of rock and rola has come out and said that the west was behind
[37:42.880 --> 37:49.680]  the terror attacks and the media spun that to say that he was saying it was completely staged
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.360]  video from iran supreme leader reportedly blames us for paris attacks but when you read deeper he
[37:55.360 --> 38:02.240]  says the west funded islamic state to overthrow shiite controlled areas of the world and now
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.240]  it's blowing back on them and it's a true statement wiki leaks said the same thing
[38:06.240 --> 38:13.040]  they got demonized it's true it's true i don't care who says it if bill clinton said it would be
[38:13.040 --> 38:20.560]  true even though he's a liar the video posted on facebook page affiliated with iran's islamic
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.640]  revolution guards corps was first reported by the middle east media research institute
[38:28.240 --> 38:32.400]  it explains that the u.s created the islamic state to advance its own agenda that's what
[38:32.400 --> 38:40.160]  the general over di a said it's just true and see the ayatollah is not bad for saying it our
[38:40.160 --> 38:48.960]  government's bad for doing it you got these 911 truthers out there that will look at me and say
[38:48.960 --> 38:55.360]  i am not covering the full story because i'm not saying it's all completely manufactured
[38:55.360 --> 39:02.880]  because it's not all manufactured at the ground level but it was manufactured at the beginning
[39:02.880 --> 39:10.320]  because they created the group funded the group protected the group so it is a false flag but
[39:10.320 --> 39:16.320]  i'm explaining the type of false flag it is i said isis was coming i said they were real
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.440]  i said get ready for major attacks because i've been analyzing the group i've seen them on the
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.440]  ground we've been threatened by them over and over again i watched them be allowed to recruit
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.720]  online and they're now going to use this threat to take our freedoms there is purely staged
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.480]  terror there is manufactured terror there's provocateur terror there is finance terror
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.960]  where it's real terror groups but they got their money up the chain from shadowy corporations
[39:44.960 --> 39:53.440]  i've made my mission to study this and that's why we're getting into these areas but it is a real
[39:53.440 --> 40:00.640]  threat but yes the door was opened to these organizations to come into the west but it's
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.520]  worse than that because our criminal governments the illegitimate groups that have hijacked our
[40:05.520 --> 40:11.200]  nation and hijacked europe have been financing and funding these groups so they helped finance fund
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.720]  and protect and shepherd them and now they're opening the door for them joining us with his final
[40:16.720 --> 40:23.440]  report from paris france he's got new news of chemical weapons threats we know isis and i'll
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.760]  kind of do have chemical weapons at least in syria and other areas they got it from Saudi
[40:27.760 --> 40:33.040]  arabia even the un had that founding uh that finding and he's got more intel for us before he
[40:33.040 --> 40:39.120]  goes to london uh to report with paul watson and of course michael zemmerman uh so joining us from
[40:39.120 --> 40:46.480]  paris france is former army staff sergeant joe biggs uh joe what's the latest joe biggs here
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.160]  with info wars dot com now we're in downtown paris and to go back to where you're talking about with
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.360]  the social media how isis was being allowed to recruit i mean it's amazing if you or i we get
[40:57.360 --> 41:04.320]  on there we say something that's uh discriminatory uh so-called racist or anti-immigration we can be
[41:04.320 --> 41:11.040]  censored meanwhile these guys have been left to just get on twitter openly recruiting posting these
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.560]  stuff and they don't go after you know if i post something saying something say if i said something
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.120]  about hillary clinton the fbi is going to be knocking at my door but there's nothing going on with
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.960]  these guys uh you know today uh we found out the french prime minister said that there is a great
[41:26.960 --> 41:34.400]  possibility of a chemical attack here in paris and i'm trying to wonder you know i'm trying to
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.000]  figure out where that idea came from and i think this comes from possibly the raid yesterday
[41:40.560 --> 41:46.560]  in st charles where or st denis where the police went into that building and raided it now they
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.000]  said when they the initial report is when they went in there they found evidence of another
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.320]  attack being prepared for now did they find some kind of chemical stuff in there that they were
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.200]  working on different kinds of vests something like that so that's where i'm beginning to think
[42:01.200 --> 42:07.760]  maybe that intel came from well obviously that's where the mastermind was and was reportedly killed
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.800]  as you first reported yesterday it's now been confirmed today that they're saying the mastermind
[42:12.800 --> 42:19.840]  of the paris attacks of halloween uh or or of friday the 13th was indeed killed speaking of
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.240]  halloween the russians have come out obviously yesterday confirming that that was a two pound
[42:24.240 --> 42:29.360]  bomb on board that aircraft's ices did take responsibility for that the point is they're
[42:29.360 --> 42:37.120]  on the march and as you know al qaeda slash is has launched multiple chemical attacks inside
[42:37.120 --> 42:40.960]  syria and attempted to blame it on a sod so there's no telling what they're going to pull
[42:41.840 --> 42:48.160]  well the lady who had the uh suicide vest strapped to herself in st denis during the raid she
[42:48.160 --> 42:54.320]  actually was going up to the window and looking out as they saw the police coming and screaming
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.880]  help me help me to lure them in to try to get them in there and instead of falling for i guess
[42:58.880 --> 43:03.840]  they sent the police dog in they said when that vest went off that it was such a big explosion
[43:03.840 --> 43:09.040]  that the floor that she was standing on collapsed and fell through and the explosion was so great
[43:09.040 --> 43:20.880]  that it sent her spine across into the street joe being inside uh the middle of the epicenter of
[43:20.880 --> 43:29.760]  the ices jihad and traveling to brussels belgium and being thrown out uh by the uh islamists that
[43:29.760 --> 43:35.120]  didn't want you in the area what's your overall takeaway after being on the ground for five days
[43:35.120 --> 43:40.720]  well you know i go back to the article i read right before we came over here that paul joseph
[43:40.720 --> 43:47.840]  wasan put up saying that about i think was 27 percent of uh perisans actually support ices
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.720]  and i'm sitting here thinking that that's farfetched those aren't perisans those are invaders
[43:53.840 --> 43:57.680]  and i'm sitting here thinking that's so farfetched but now that i've actually been here
[43:58.560 --> 44:03.600]  i 100 percent believe that to the t i can tell you this much and let's go back to july 7th
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.880]  here in france i found the story i forgot about it i actually uh read about it back when it happened
[44:08.880 --> 44:15.200]  40 grenades 180 detonators and plastic explosives stolen from french military base this is an
[44:15.200 --> 44:21.360]  article at the telegraph so that stuff went missing back there you know back in july no telling
[44:21.360 --> 44:27.040]  how that's been you know being used if it's being sent over into syria iraq here in france
[44:27.040 --> 44:34.800]  so there's definitely that out there that stuff has been stolen someone is using it joe i keep
[44:34.800 --> 44:41.360]  asking this question i'm going to ask you again how do you think they're going to get away when
[44:41.360 --> 44:46.640]  there's clearly more terror attacks in europe in the united states in other western nations
[44:46.640 --> 44:51.680]  how will they politically get away with that unscathed the socialists the collectives the
[44:51.680 --> 44:58.160]  the murkles the obamas the halons just today obama plans to veto refugee screening bill
[44:58.160 --> 45:02.960]  despite terrorists having entered the u.s as refugees president says legislation would create
[45:02.960 --> 45:09.680]  unnecessary and impractical requirements the definition of treason of high treason is aiding
[45:09.680 --> 45:17.680]  an abetting sworn enemies to enter and attack your nation i mean this is the definition of cut and dry
[45:17.680 --> 45:25.440]  uh military sabotage against our country i mean from shutting down our power plants to bringing
[45:25.440 --> 45:32.160]  in jihadis uh to attacking our families to funding isis obama really is trying to destroy this
[45:32.160 --> 45:40.240]  country he really is trying to sabotage this nation he really does want to destroy the country
[45:40.240 --> 45:46.160]  that gives him all his power i mean these people are mentally ill he is worse than i ever thought
[45:46.160 --> 45:53.280]  he could be i mean this is joke level bigs yeah i mean they're pushing this entire pc culture to
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.720]  where it's almost like they want to everyone to have this sense of stock home syndrome to where
[45:58.720 --> 46:05.360]  they have to love being attacked that you know it that's how i feel that it's like stock home
[46:05.360 --> 46:09.920]  syndrome that they want everyone to feel like all right these are your oppressors are doing it but
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.560]  you're gonna love them anyways and just kind of ignore the fact and that's why this whole pc culture
[46:14.560 --> 46:18.560]  keeps getting pushed all the time though where they it's just reverse psychology
[46:18.560 --> 46:24.880]  to instead of going after the bad people after going after the corrupt government you feel racist
[46:24.880 --> 46:30.480]  you feel like a bigot you feel horrible for doing it and it's the same thing with that i just don't
[46:30.480 --> 46:36.000]  understand it and so many people are falling for it around the world it's not just in america it is
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.960]  everywhere people are writing articles saying that you know you should sympathize for these people
[46:40.960 --> 46:45.360]  but donna says we should love them look these people are bullies that oppress their own people
[46:45.360 --> 46:50.560]  in their own nations it's sickening but what's behind a lot of the guilt with the grassroots
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.480]  is we know attacking iraq was wrong now uh you've said that yourself and you were there and we're
[46:56.480 --> 47:01.040]  wounded there uh we know we were fed lies we know we've done a lot of bad things to middle east
[47:01.040 --> 47:08.000]  but here's the problem the very globalist the very new world order people that lied to us
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.800]  into all these wars to destabilize the middle east and set the stage for ices to come into the
[47:12.800 --> 47:19.680]  vacuum are the ones now saying open our borders it's the globalist they're the problem we'll have
[47:19.680 --> 47:24.480]  some breaking news right now there's actually a raid being conducted by french police and uh
[47:24.480 --> 47:30.960]  charville mesure that is a town that is about three hours away from here on the belgium border
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.280]  and uh right now there are police conducting this raid sweeping through looking for possible
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.760]  terrorists so that's going on right now actually have a link just posted on facebook on my twitter
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.840]  and all that you guys can grab it it has live updates of what's going on from that area but
[47:43.840 --> 47:49.280]  like you tell folks your twitter that's rambo bigs yes at rambo bigs and be sure and retweet
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.840]  that at the real alex jones there on twitter uh as well i don't want to say exactly what
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.120]  you're planning next but you're going to go to london uh in the next uh day or so you're also
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.400]  going to be going to some of these no go ghettos where women are told uh you must not wear uh
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.640]  skirts you must wear hoods uh they even tell people not to come out of bars uh same thing's
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.520]  happening in germany now where they had to stop october fest because the migrants were upset by
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.480]  outdoor drinking i mean this is just totally ridiculous uh so hopefully you're going to go
[48:20.480 --> 48:26.080]  document some more of that because people are in denial about what you experienced yeah so we will
[48:26.080 --> 48:33.520]  definitely i mean the fact that i mean i i can believe that people don't want to to accept that
[48:33.520 --> 48:39.360]  that's fine but i mean i'm telling you myself michael and paul were there that happened without a
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.680]  doubt we had no problem we're in front of the building where that raid was conducted because
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.360]  it's in a very open area but once we walked further into the ghetto and started moving
[48:47.360 --> 48:51.040]  around through there that's when the cars started coming by that's when the people started hanging
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.000]  out and screaming like spit coming out of their mouth angry that were there and then i was kind
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.120]  of wigged out so we're like all right let's go into this restaurant and try to like get away
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.280]  from this for a minute and as soon as we open the door this guy comes scooting in and kind of
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.680]  grabs the door and goes no no no no you can't be here you can't be here you know but there's not
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.160]  going to be any liberal lawsuit because you're white or you're western or you're christian
[49:12.160 --> 49:17.360]  so you weren't let in this this is the suicide of the west well it's been documented you're
[49:17.360 --> 49:22.240]  going to document it some more joe begs will continue to see your reports as you follow them

[49:34.560 --> 49:38.640]  together for a nice produced report but we actually went to the area where the police officer
[49:38.640 --> 49:42.240]  was killed on the sidewalk there was a lot of people saying that that was a hoax you could
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.880]  actually see a little rut like a divot in the concrete where it looked like a bullet hit hit
[49:46.880 --> 49:52.320]  as well so we documented all that uh the the bottom floor charlie hebdo has been completely
[49:52.320 --> 49:56.960]  cleaned out it looks like they've moved up further a lot of signs everywhere and we were
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.200]  able to go in and get closer to the bodyclon theater today they moved back the barricade
[50:01.200 --> 50:05.760]  or actually i should say they brought it in closer just around that area instead of a huge block
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.800]  they still had the memorials out as well but you could see the signs up from last friday saying that
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.840]  the eagles of death metal the american band that has the front man for queens of the stone age
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.400]  that had all that still up there a lot of people out there scared worried now we have the threats
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.280]  of the chemical attacks so everybody's on edge here i went out last night and actually spoke to

[50:30.560 --> 50:36.000]  ago and he said he was actually supposed to go to that theater that night that him and his wife
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.840]  had tickets and he decided last minute that morning to go to amsterdam and party there so he never
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.480]  updated his family he had never updated his work that he had changed his plan he gets a call from

[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.680]  and i've got to tell you i'm not a tribal person in the mindless sense of i go off what color
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:58.400]  somebody is or i'm not a big joiner of groups but i am pro-human and i am pro-justice and i
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:05.760]  physically get aggressive and feel hateful and feel let's just be honest violent doesn't mean
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:12.640]  i'm gonna act on the violence but it's normal genetic traits of an alpha male when he sees innocent
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.880]  people men women and children being murdered by bullies to want to attack them and the globalists
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.840]  know how to show us the jihadis and show us their arrogance show us their classical evil
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.200]  they're animated by a spirit of evil they look crazy they look hateful they look oppressive
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:39.200]  they do and just incredibly unshivalrous activities and then i see them persecuting innocent people
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.600]  murdering innocent muslims that's the main group they kill
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.040]  and christians and and women and it makes me sick
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.640]  you know we talked with lord mongton yesterday about a period of about 500 years when there was
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.920]  a golden age of islam when it actually promoted medicine and mathematics and science and actually
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:11.760]  helped europe but that whole time is is is over and the west certain leftist elements of it that's
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.440]  who's doing it big foundations are funding radical islam we're going to talk to a real expert the
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:25.840]  author of on the run a mod salim life after undercover top fbi informant egyptian military
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.200]  officer who tried to stop the first world trade center bombing and they basically the higher
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.680]  ups had the fbi stand down that was a false flag and we're going to get his expert view on isis
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.640]  and what's happening coming up briefly earlier it's very expensive for us to spend
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.720]  the the the the type of money we have to send three reporters to paris france
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.200]  one of the most expensive cities in the world i'm not complaining about it that's why we
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.520]  do what we do here it's why we sell products why we have sponsors is to build a media
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.920]  organization that can really report on things really break things and really find out what's
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.760]  happening we didn't go out to france with an agenda we went there to really see what was
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.920]  happening and that's what we did and we're reaching millions of new viewers and listeners
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.200]  because of it the issue is the most people in the internet age think of media as free
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.040]  they consume it for free and that's great that's our goal but we need people to purchase the
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.720]  products and so i just want to ask listeners to partner with us going into this christmas and

[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:19.520]  so
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:29.120]  donald front now in national polls is 45 46 percent he's gone up even more
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:36.560]  from the low 40s last week and you've got both political parties trying to demonize him the
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:44.160]  reason he's so popular is he is engaging in basic populist activity saying we deserve
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.000]  to be a sovereign country we should have a government that puts the interest of the
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.800]  american people first and that they call races that they call bad they say it's politically
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.080]  incorrect well so what what the politically correct people push why do we have to sit there
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.800]  and listen to what they have to say anymore why are we under this this ridiculous
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:19.040]  gauntlet of guilt why do we continue to grovel in the face of all of this
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:29.920]  us meanwhile we've seen our basic human liberties trashed and we've seen homeland security expanded
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.120]  and we see it targeting returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians we see the irs
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.880]  persecuting in mass the most law abiding citizens in the country and getting caught politically
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.360]  targeting them and msnbc goes on air and says good we should target christians and the tea party
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:10:01.360]  they're racist it's so dangerous when you have rasmussen polls with a large percentage of democrats
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  saying arrest people who don't agree with man-made global warming or disarm gun owners and put them
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:23.040]  in prison or restrict their free speech that's why a supreme court justice told matt drudge this year
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:30.160]  that other members of the court have said we're coming in 2016 for your free speech we're coming
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:39.600]  to restrict your free speech online we're going to shut you up and your time is quote limited this
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:47.440]  is real this is really happening there is an authoritarian move taking place with the rhino
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:11:00.720]  neocon republicans and the democrats and overseas the exact same agenda is being pushed
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.960]  against populations there where they act like with all this fake consternation that it's bizarre
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.640]  to say there should be any vetting of any type of refugees into a country
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.920]  but then you've got to prove who you are to get a driver's license
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:29.280]  so what is the end game the end game is to allow jihad attacks all over the western world
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:36.880]  and then have the west misdirected and attack innocent countries and innocent leaders just
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.360]  like saudi arabia was involved in 911 we attacked iraq that's now been declassified it's now been
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.680]  leaked it's now been admitted the 28 pages just like they're now in the news saying attack the syrian
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:56.720]  army and the syrian people and the syrian president because it's his fault isis has a stronghold in
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.200]  syria because he wasn't a good enough leader to defeat isis when our own government's been
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.560]  financing him and running him and i know i've talked a lot about this but man if the public was
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:16.240]  politically and geopolitically informed at any level obama would be indicted obama would be
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:23.840]  arrested angela merkel heland all of them are engaged in treason and i don't say those words
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:37.200]  lightly our government overthrew the egyptian government what was it four years ago for an
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.520]  entire year and put the muslim brotherhood in charge while they were blowing up churches
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.560]  crucifying people attacking military bases shooting members of the egyptian military until
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.880]  15 million people hit the streets and removed that government of moracy we've got an expert
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.320]  coming on who can break it down he's having some skype issues right now we're about to go to him
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:08.080]  and you think about how our ally for 33 years is overthrown and they don't put some more democratic
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:17.200]  more pro-western group in they put radicals in that want to destroy the west why why because
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.280]  then they can wreck the middle east the globalists can and they can wreck us too because the globalists
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:30.640]  have a philosophy of divide and conquer deindustrialization and balkanization and every secular
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:38.320]  government from mohammed mozadek in 1953 and i ran to the government of hazy mubarak has been
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:44.880]  overthrown by the west because they do not want stability in those countries shame reason sedam
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.560]  hussein was removed and all these hbo movies made about how bad he was a bunch of bull sedam
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:57.520]  hussein is an angel compared to people like al-qaeda sedam hussein never attacked the united
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.560]  states sedam hussein was told to attack iran and given 40 billion dollars by the united states
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.760]  and satellite intel oh we know he launched chemical attacks on the Kurds because the cia gave him the
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:16.240]  directives and how to use it with his helicopters and his artillery
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.760]  and it's wrong to set countries up it's wrong to destroy countries it's wrong to
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.960]  break up countries like they're breaking up syria and iraq right now
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:38.320]  and it is completely and totally cold-blooded
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.040]  in other news while we're waiting for our guests to uh sort out audio or we're sorting it out
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:52.000]  oklahoma earthquake rumbles through nine states there were no immediate reports of injuries or
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.280]  serious damage after a magnitude 4.7 earthquake struck oklahoma and kansas thursday morning
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.280]  authority said the quake shook parts of northern oklahoma and southern kansas at 1 42 a.m according
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.320]  to the national earthquake information center was centered near cherokee oklahoma which lies 20
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.800]  miles south of the kansas border in the ozark mountains the quake was a nothing uh residents
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.520]  of the area are not used to according to national earthquake information center geophysicist randy
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.200]  bald one who told the associated precedent 2015 uh he has felt more than 20 magnitude
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:31.680]  for earthquakes the point is is it's heating back up and i'm not worried about
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.160]  the balcony's fault line through austin texas and four extinct volcanoes i'm not worried about
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.960]  the fault lines and then and the new madra and all of it up there what i'm worried about is the
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:49.760]  ring of fire because every seismologist we've talked to ever reportedly seen admits the entire
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:57.120]  ring of fire that cost tsunamis a decade ago and caused earthquakes in japan and fukushima all of it
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:03.760]  the only place that hasn't triggered and had its earthquake yet is the section that runs up from
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:09.680]  northern bahá up into seattle and the main trigger point is schmack dab
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.520]  in those fault lines outside los angeles the old classic statement that it may just break
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.480]  off and fall in the ocean it's amazing so
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.560]  they're not saying it's a question of if but when and they're saying it's imminent
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:37.760]  for a seven magnitude earthquake on the west coast anytime and it's a miracle a miracle
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.080]  it hasn't happened yet and you're going to see highways collapse you're going to see buildings
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.440]  fall in you are going to see some major death tolls when this sucker hits because they say it's
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.400]  going to be one of the biggest ones ever recorded in modern seismology on the west coast
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.640]  so just remember we're so worried about terrorism and all the rest of it
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.160]  terrorism is one of the rarest forms of death in the west it still is a problem obviously if you
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.280]  get killed by it or injured or lose family but we shouldn't give up any of our liberties
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.160]  in the fight against terrorist because it won't protect you anyways and and that's what governments
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:20.080]  want that said though i don't know why the west is is is opening the door to this now joining us
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:29.760]  for the balance of the hour is amad salim amad salim.org emadsalem.org he's the best-selling
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:35.280]  author of on the run life after undercover you want to understand what really happened
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:44.400]  with the situation back in the early 1990s with the first world trade center bombing he was there
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.000]  he tried to stop it and was ordered to stand down that's even been in the new york times
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.080]  and we're going to go to break here in a moment and go through it all but amad salim is the
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.840]  former egyptian military colonel who went undercover with the fbi and infiltrated the
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.240]  first al-qaeda cell in american soil in new york city in 93 world trade center bombing
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.640]  he also penetrated the headquarters of al-qaeda in america under the leadership of the blind chic
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.280]  omar abdel ramon and the underground terrorist cell were planning to blow up the landmarks of
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.200]  new york city and become the government star witness in the day of terror trial he is the
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:20.640]  author of undercover the untold story of al-qaeda the fbi and cia in america you should get the book
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.080]  just to support somebody that has as much courage as he did and of course the la times breaks down
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.960]  how powerful his book is as well in a review seeking a sense of purpose fbi informant decides
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.600]  to tell all we're going to break in about a minute and a half he wants to get into the the attacks
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.800]  but let me ask him this question we appreciate him coming on in the one minute we have colonel
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.080]  is there a method behind the madness to bring in millions of people from known
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.720]  wahabi is jihad held areas into europe the united states what is obama what is merkel
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:01.600]  what is the french president what are they thinking well i think bringing these refugees
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:12.080]  into our homeland is a big mistake and i think that will will jeopardize the safety of the american
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:23.120]  people and we got exposed to the day of mayhem in 1993 and thankfully we were able to foil that
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:33.840]  plot the same day of mayhem had happened in paris um on friday um and the lack of the
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:41.280]  intelligence did not let the french people to be able to stand on the top of the terrorists
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:49.040]  at this time i think it's a big mistake if we allow these people they are wahabis as you said
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.480]  they are so need and we don't know who is who well colonel stay there i want to come back

[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.240]  colonel sent over here to work with the cia and the fbi well you already moved here began working
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.840]  with them try to stop radical jihad groups the first al-qaeda cell inside the united states
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:33.680]  and he is a specific expert obviously fighting wahhabi is to fighting radical sunnis and other
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:40.400]  groups here in the united states and overseas and he wants to go over his condolences to france
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  the similarity between the simultaneous attack on france and uh the simultaneously bombing of
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.240]  the day of the terror attack on new york city they were planning the russian plane in egypt
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.880]  and so much more so sir please continue with your breakdown of of what is i mean our governments
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.440]  aren't stupid so what are they planning allowing these groups in that we know we're gonna end up
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.960]  attacking and have been attacking and then i specifically want to flesh out uh where you
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.920]  think isis is going and all of this and are they double crossing some of the western governments
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:20.880]  that were aiding them in the fight against Assad well alex unfortunately if we allow this group
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:31.360]  of sunni wahhabis people to enter into our land um there is no doubt in my mind that it will happen
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:40.800]  again we already got attacked in 1993 by the same group however different name it's all the same
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:50.320]  ideology and we were able to stop five bombs from going simultaneously in the holand tunnel
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:56.480]  linkham tunnel the washington bridge the headquarter of the fbi in new york city in
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:04.080]  26 federal plaza and the united nation building uh unfortunately they succeeded to pull that
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:12.880]  trick in france and the day of mayhem happened in france last week my biggest con my biggest
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:23.280]  condemnation to that cowardly attack to attack people who are not armed civilian uh people
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:32.320]  has nothing to do with their corrupt ideology and they attack them when they are in a regular day
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:40.880]  having fun um if we allow these people the same group to enter into our homeland it will happen
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:48.160]  again but again i don't know if our government wanted that to happen again to start to take
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:56.160]  our liberty out of our hand more and more and put more restriction on the on the media like
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:04.720]  like you alex for example um i'm sure there is a lot of uh governmental agencies would like to
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:16.080]  shut your show up uh yes sir and uh unfortunately uh if we can stop this madness from happening
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:22.240]  before it happened and then they will say oops it happened again and they let these people to
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:30.640]  start to hurt uh the american people to give them a reason to start to monitor more and to
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:39.280]  take our liberty out of our hand and this from a former egyptian army colonel amad salim who
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:44.320]  tried to stop the first world trade center attack the higher ups above him at the fbi were doing
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.080]  their job as well but they were basically countermanded and so the bombing went forward and we know
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.360]  that story because he recorded them he tapes them not just the terrorists but also the government
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.520]  basically uh involved in the partial stand down and for whatever reason that bombing went forward
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.280]  but you were able as you said to stop the other bombings looking at this situation
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:16.720]  in europe if we're bringing in such large numbers of isis uh just from a gut level colonel it tells
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.400]  me that when there are attacks there's going to be a lot more of them and they're going to be bigger
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:28.960]  is that accurate to say it is very accurate alex and uh there is something i would like to bring it
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:37.120]  to the american people's attention uh merkel in germany was kind enough to open her doors
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:46.960]  to the immigrants and the consequences was really hefty that on the day of the soccer game
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:54.640]  they had that tip that there is a terrorist attack going to happen they vacated the stadium
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:04.320]  and it never heard in the american ministry media that they uncovered an ambulance loaded with
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:14.000]  explosive parked near the stadium ready to get blown up at the people of germany wow
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.360]  and this has never been published in american mainstream media i never heard it in american
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.560]  media colonel colonel stay there you're gonna have the floor when we come back because
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.640]  you have incredible credibility new york times la times everything you've ever talked about has
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.200]  been proven i was unaware of this please tell us the sources and what happened we know about
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.000]  the evacuation the cancelling of the of the football game the soccer game but i did not
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.360]  know that they actually had the explosives laden ambulance that was discovered this is incredible
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.360]  imagine if it would have gone off it could have killed thousands we'll cover it all straight ahead
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:55.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:43.760]  he was a army colonel in the egyptian military they've had a lot of experience dealing with
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:50.640]  the radicals and extremists who want to seize power and the main group is coming out of Saudi
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:57.360]  arabia generally and that of course is the wahhabist radical version of sunni islam most sunni
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.080]  muslims are not radical they don't want to terrorize people but it is this group that
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:08.240]  continues to carry out most the terror worldwide and i want to get later into the fact that egypt's
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:14.080]  been forced to now start working with russia our government has double crossed egypt on record
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.040]  they've had trials there where it's come out the muslim brotherhoods being financed by obama
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:27.040]  through kenyan i mean this is a really reckless bizarre move by obama and i never believed that
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:32.000]  he secretly worked with radical islam and had some plan because i've been against conquering
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.480]  these countries invading and destabilizing them as folks know i was against the iraq war but now i
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.400]  see what obama is doing it's it's just it's not in the u.s interest it's not in anybody's interest
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:52.240]  it's not in people's interest in sunni countries to be under these wahhabist and it just gets worse
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:59.120]  and worse and worse and crazier and they're catching just huge numbers of these folks coming in now
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:04.400]  and they're bringing them in and obama says he'll veto a bill just to screen these people who they
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.240]  admit five out of six passports are fake these aren't syrian refugees these are jihadis that
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.400]  went in there to take over now i'm gonna stop ranting again colonel amad salim is the best
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.720]  selling author of on the run you can go to his website and find the book and read it and and
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.480]  show it to your friends and family amad salim dot org i'm gonna tweet that out by the way at real
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.680]  alex jones and tell folks to get this hero's book because he risked his life and a lot more
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.240]  to bring us this information he's telling you right now specifically what's going on so we
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:44.240]  we ended i actually googled it and here it is uh in the foreign press ambulance full of
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:50.560]  explosives reportedly found near german stadium uh but we never heard this here in the united states
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:58.320]  as he said so uh colonel please continue yes sir you mentioned the canian connection with the
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:08.960]  muslim brotherhood uh and that shows in mr obongo obama uh mr obongo obama is uh mr uh borac
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:18.480]  hisan's brother in tinnia and he is a the main support line for the muslim brotherhood in africa
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:28.000]  um unfortunately the muslim brotherhood start to blackmail mr obama and the egyptian
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.880]  intelligence of course leaked to the media and if you have that newspaper it's called
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:44.480]  el ahram newspaper that is the governmental main issue of newspaper who talks on behalf of
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:52.800]  the government mr obama succeeded to alienate egypt from working and cooperating with america
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  alienating saudi arabia for comb from cooperating with america um and we know that we have labia
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:09.760]  this table we have syria this table and we have iraq under the iranian control and mr obama
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.920]  unfortunately become alienated from this country not giving their not getting their support in
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:25.040]  the kind of war and this is the most sunni arab countries knows how to talk the talk and walk the
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:33.360]  walk when it comes on war on terrorists but unfortunately i don't know why mr obama have to
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:39.680]  support the muslim brotherhood and you can see the headline in an ahram newspaper that the muslim
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:48.640]  brotherhood warning mr obama not to withdraw his support from them or they're going to release
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.360]  documentation to jeopardize his throne wow eternal this is incredible because dr jerome
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.440]  coursey as you know has worked in the middle east for the state department and done a lot of other
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.480]  work uh he has published a world net daily a lot of what the egyptian government and courts have
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:10.000]  brought out including the documents but now by obama's actions uh from the threats of a year ago
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.400]  of blackmail we see it's working that makes sense why obama would do things that aren't even good for
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:24.000]  him because his cousins and and half brothers and others are on record working with them uh they are
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.680]  very daring that they would try to blackmail a president of the united states and it it looks
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.960]  like if you're correct and i think the evidence shows you are they have really outclassed him
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.840]  and really double crossed him can you expand on that and then and break down where you see this
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.000]  going and uh what you think isis and the muslim brotherhood kind of their spokesmen are going to
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:52.400]  do well at this time this is the newspaper in the middle east if you see the intelligence on the
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:39:00.320]  egyptian streets today you can see how they portray mr obama how they portrayed him with a big
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:09.200]  beard and a turban and they asking him to stop his support to the muslim brotherhood because
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:17.440]  they are bombing inside cairo they are bombing inside the muslim arab countries and we want to
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:25.280]  open the door for them to come to america to start to carry their bombings as well up here
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:32.640]  unfortunately for germany they don't want to admit this ambulance full of explosive because
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:42.480]  it is against what the president of germany had done that she allowed these people to enter her
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.400]  country and now they will start the bombing and they will start to suffer great deal of
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:56.320]  pain from that fanatic group and if we let these people to enter here uh we're going to have the
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:03.760]  same consequences and then we will lose our liberty i want to go back to mr obama's first
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:11.840]  speech in egypt in cairo egypt the first visit when he went there and he said to the muslim
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:22.800]  brotherhood i am sorry for what america had done i don't understand what is mr obama apologizing for
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:30.560]  america was a great deal of help to egypt at that time we were giving the egyptian military
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:39.920]  1.5 billion by the b dollars as an asset as an help with their military all of that being stopped
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:48.880]  and that allowed saudi arabia to step in with their money and then pewton have to step in to show
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:57.600]  his support to egypt america walked out of the egyptian land and pewton put his roots up there
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:05.440]  so we look at the first speech for mr obama i'm sorry for the america i am sorry for what america
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:14.240]  had done and then you can see the behavior after that unfortunately mr president you
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:25.360]  castrated the american military and the american influence around the world because america when
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:34.240]  it is strong you would have a lot of people wanted to relate to today unfortunately i know for a fact
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:44.880]  that america is not being liked or respected by our europe sony al eyes and we are not helping even
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:53.120]  our allies in the countries in the middle east uh on the contrary he is trying to
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:03.600]  say that he is fighting the war but we are making only five bombings again nothing a thousand
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:10.160]  a thousand and more than a thousand a day at the time when we were fighting real fight uh
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:18.640]  mr obama unfortunately you weakened our country you are not helping us well let me ask you this
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:23.520]  colonel because i don't think i've had anybody on that boils it down that crystallizes it like you
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.400]  do everything you say i mean i look at the news every day it's all through and i sit back and i
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:32.240]  think i had a blind side because i know our government's not perfect it's done bad things it's
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.480]  been corrupt all governments have problems we try to you know influence them to be better that's
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.600]  why we get involved just like you did in your government but i used to hear obama wants to
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.920]  bring down america he wants to destroy our influence he wants to sabotage us and i went
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:52.080]  look the democrats have got problems but that's not what they're really doing now everything they do
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:58.640]  from our borders to our energy being cut off to our jobs to the regulations to obama care designed
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.800]  to wreck health care i mean i've read it i know what it does it's designed to um just everything
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:11.040]  he does is like he's a sleeper cell or something to destroy the country and i tell you i've never
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:19.440]  been more not even afraid it's more shocked i just am in disbelief and then i wonder what is he
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:27.760]  gonna pull next and why would our elites finance him to do this and then i i want to believe that
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.720]  there's a method behind the madness even if it's evil but then i come to the realization i talked
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.680]  a lot of high level generals current and retired and other people and they say no you don't understand
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.520]  literally the government is being run by obama and a few people they think they know what they're
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:48.480]  doing they're completely insane they believe they're leftist ideology and that's why the whole
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:54.560]  world is so scared and starting to aim their nuclear weapons at us again is because it appears
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.960]  that we do have crazy people running things can you do you disagree with that can you elaborate
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:08.240]  or what's your view i agree with you 100 percent on that alex because obama has apologizing about
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:14.720]  what america is doing bringing democracy and trying to bring peace into the middle east
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:27.120]  uh mr obama used to sit in his church listen for his minister mr right when he was damning america
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.800]  when he's attacking america and he accepted that and attended the church for years and years
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:39.600]  and once he got the opportunity to become the president of the united states he started to
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:47.600]  castrated the power of america and lowered the energy of the american influence around the world
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:57.120]  and that opened the door and vacuumed to ices to take place in iraq in syria spread to labia now
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.880]  they are hitting in egypt now they are in france they just about to hit in germany they succeeded
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:13.440]  to stop them at this time and if we allow to open our doors to the immigrants to enter our home
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:20.080]  i'm not a conspiracy theorist but i am afraid that if they allow these people to walk in
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:25.920]  that's going to be a false flag operation to let them bomb america and then they say oops they
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:32.400]  bomb america we have to monitor america more and take your guns and take your liberty and take
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:41.280]  every even the mainstream media today start to be controlled by the government it is sad in me
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:51.040]  this is not america i immigrated two thirty years ago this is not america which i put my life and
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:46:01.360]  my family's life on the line for mr obama please please help america don't weaken america and
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:10.800]  don't listen to mr pastor who used to explain to you that america should be doomed with what we are
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:19.760]  trying to accomplish america can lead the world america cannot be led by russia russia today
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:28.800]  have influence in the middle east in egypt in saudi arabia in jordan in iran in iraq in syria
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:35.920]  are we gonna win and you said this you said this with us over a year ago uh kernel salim and now
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:41.920]  it's all gotten more obvious and again it's not that i'm against russia but the whole point is why
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:48.640]  would it's one thing of the u.s pulled out influence wise but it actually backed the radical al-qaeda
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:55.440]  al-nasr groups that became isis in syria so it's even worse it's not just pulling out it's it's
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:01.600]  putting bad guys in i mean what did obama think what did the cia think is we've had the military
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:08.400]  whistleblowers on cia pilots on i mean we've we've had kernel schaefer on one week after
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.440]  ben gazi happened they said it was a weapons transfer uh up to those groups uh and now it's
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.800]  been proven but didn't they know isis would turn against them and i guess you said it then when
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.000]  isis attacks us they think we're so politically illiterate they take our rights like this congress
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.240]  woman in illinois says take our guns because isis shot people well i mean they have a gun
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:37.360]  ban in france how do you blame what happened in france on my guns well this is one of the policies
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:46.160]  mr obama trying to do he is trying to control everybody in america taking your rights taking
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:53.760]  your guns taking stripping you from your rights so he can control you you cannot defend yourself
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:01.200]  you cannot stand up for your rights and um executive order he has a phone and a pen unfortunately
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:12.160]  he's using that very well to weaken america and lacking and if mr obama really loves the syrian
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:21.840]  people what did he do when the syrian people got gassed by mr bashar el asad why did he do about
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.560]  his red line to mr asad if he gasses people why didn't he take care of the syrian people
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:35.120]  before they get smothered in their homeland to the point that they start to immigrate to europe
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:45.280]  and to come to invade the western world he gave isis the time to grow up as much as he gave
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:56.240]  iran the time by slacking and lacking on the deal he had done with them which is catastrophe to get
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:02.480]  iran that power and there is giving them the time giving them the money the billions of
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:08.400]  dollars they're gonna get it back it's gonna go into terrorism again and all of that will work
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.240]  against america i don't know why i don't know what he is thinking all right sir stay there we're

[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:34.640]  would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing

[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.440]  we are witnessing a treasonous policy so evil two years ago hundreds of commission and non-commissioned
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:24.000]  officers as high up as kernels and captains in the navy put out images of themselves on facebook
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:31.520]  and twitter holding up signs saying i will not be al-qaeda's air force in syria when our government
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.120]  was openly backing rebels that they knew were al-qaeda and kernels schaefer went and testified
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:43.760]  to congress in closed session in committee we had him on about that others did so it was a great
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.280]  moral moment where our military said we're not going to be part of this but the public is ignorant
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:55.040]  because they were they're not geopolitically informed in what's left of this segment the next
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:00.320]  we're going to be talking to a man who is really a premier expert on this and talk about the russian
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.400]  airliner down more on what isis is doing and where he thinks all this is going in ways to stop this
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.560]  but briefly again christmas is here the holidays are here this is also a time we help fund our
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:21.040]  operation every gift we have at info wars store dot com will help wake somebody up and one of the
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.800]  things that people use every day that's so effective to wake up friends and family is a coffee cup if
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:31.040]  your friends and family aren't listeners or don't listen routinely and you want to wake them up send
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:39.680]  them on info wars dot com made in america coffee cup they're eight ninety five they cost us four
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.480]  dollars made in america they cost us a dollar made in china we have a chinese version as well
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.920]  if you choose to buy from china i'm not against buying from china as long as it promotes liberty
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:58.800]  but the point is three of our four cups are made in america so we have the little cup that just says
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.040]  info wars dot com is made in china the big cups are made in america with info wars dot com and another
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.720]  has a sheepdog chasing a wolf meaning we're patriots we're not predators but we're not sheep and
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.760]  this is a design that i came up with obviously uh you know with harkins to the books made popular
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:24.000]  in the movie american sniper but that's something i was brought up in texas and told you're not a
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.800]  sheep and you're not a wolf you're a sheepdog and so it's a great gift to give friends and family
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.520]  that's a very handsome cup it's on both sides and people will end up visiting the site so you spend
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:40.400]  895 and i'm telling you it is a great gift and you're done you buy 10 of these you got your

[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.920]  in the next i want to invite you back on the nightly news in the near future sir but what's
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.440]  your breakdown on the russian shootdown or the russian uh bombed plane uh on the russian bombing
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:27.440]  they finally uh uncovered that it was two pounds of explosive uh unfortunately isis playing a game
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:38.080]  here um the bomb they put it on the peak which is their magazine cannot be the bomb went on that
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:49.360]  plane uh i i have been in charmes sheikh airport so many times and i know how secure that airport is
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:58.640]  but unfortunately i think that isis succeeded to recruit somebody who carrying the luggage in the
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:06.080]  back of the plane in the cargo area and they succeeded to sneak the real bomb not the one
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:13.840]  they put it on their website and they succeeded to bring this plane down and it is the beginning
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:27.120]  of a new era for terrorism and unfortunately today they brought a russian jet down and i don't know
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:36.080]  what will happen tomorrow if we let these syrian people who is being brought up with the idea stay

[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:13.120]  about what's happening in egypt more informed about what's happening in syria you got cut off
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.080]  pointing out that the syrian people were quote many of them ingrained with a very deep and then
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:27.920]  you got cut off yes sir the syrian refugees most of them were brought up in a middle eastern
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:36.800]  controlled middle eastern country controlled by the ideology of hating the west the west to them
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:45.520]  is the infidels unfortunately and if we open our doors to them instead of we go secure our borders
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:53.520]  to prevent any trespassing on the american borders we open the doors from the other side
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:02:02.400]  by mr obama's decision to let them in i just want to mention back what happened
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:12.800]  in in bani gazi bani gazi started from egypt because at that time simultaneously when the
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:22.000]  bani gazi attack was going on the blind shakes children which is dr abdallah they were demonstrating
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.560]  and setting fire in the american embassy in cairo our intelligence uncovered and intercepted
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:36.720]  it some communication it didn't broadcast it at the time but since then disappeared
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:46.880]  that they informed their followers in bani gazi to set fire in it and that's when we lost our
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:57.360]  ambassador it started from egypt it ends up in bani gazi and it was a it was a deal of weapons to
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:04.800]  these people who we don't even not sure that these weapons one day if we give it to them it will be
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:12.160]  used against us unfortunately we didn't learn from our lesson when we allow it the blind
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:20.880]  shade to enter the country and he turned against the country and ordering me to go build the bomb
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:28.080]  and blow up the world threat center and build the bomb and go blow it in the in the army uh at 96
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:35.600]  street in manhattan so we need to understand that these people talk from both sides of their mouth
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:43.680]  they might say yes we are coming to america because we love america but we have to to really
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:50.800]  understand what are we doing who are we are letting in and i don't think it's a it's a it's a good idea
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:58.960]  i don't think it is safe for the american people to let these people to go and roam into our country
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:06.640]  at this time we have to strengthen our military again we have to start to lead not to be led
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:16.800]  and not to give time to isis to grow what happened with isis since we they were the jd team
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:23.840]  we give them the time to grow now they are taking over syria they are taking over iraq they have
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:30.960]  been in libya they went back to egypt and they are bombing everywhere paris germany and now we
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:39.520]  want to bring them in uh it's just spells catastrophe it does wow well colonel amad salim

[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:07.680]  change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks the sanders campaign
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:13.360]  was furious verney wasn't ready to talk about terrorism the moderator asked him if he still
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:18.160]  thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change absolutely in fact climate
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:22.240]  changes are directly related to the growth of terrorism you understand what sanders is saying
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:28.240]  climate change is directly related to terrorism terrorism has nothing to do with wars for oil
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:33.520]  and power it's not about a clash of cultures and as every liberal will tell you it has nothing to do
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:40.640]  with islam so it must be climate change bernie al qaeda and isis were not created to fight climate
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:46.480]  change but there is an indirect link bernie sanders won't tell you however if he even sees it al qaeda
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:51.280]  and isis are creation of the same governments and multinational corporations that are trying to

[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:39.600]  many of which do intend to engage in terror attacks this is one of the craziest actions i've
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:46.240]  ever seen but i had a big whistleblower on a former egyptian army colonel author of on the run
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.800]  amad salim on he's the guy that exposed and tried to stop the first world trade center attack

[02:08:55.280 --> 02:09:00.320]  he believes it'll be another false flag this is obama's false flag to bring these people

[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:34.080]  refugees in you go after people with profiling for what they've committed or who they're affiliated
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:40.080]  with with you don't go out to the entire public that is not the answer in fact i've had former
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:47.440]  head of technical from the nsa in the studio and he said more data swamps everything they need
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.800]  targeted but see that doesn't let them spend tens of billions a year on no bid contracts there's
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:59.120]  another article out today about this from rt usa leaked nsa doc revealed sheer luck needed to find
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:05.600]  useful info and see if surveillance data well i have that from thomas drake william benny you name
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:13.360]  it now of course dr jerome course he is worldnet daily dot com wnd dot com writer he's a phd from
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.440]  harvard university in political science he's also an economist and worked with some of the biggest
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.240]  banks out there he's worked as a consultant in terrorism and secretive operations for the state
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:27.520]  department and of course he's uh the guy that ran the swift boating operation which was accurate i
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:33.040]  commend him i didn't like george bush it's just john carrey is who they say john carrey was uh total
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:37.440]  fraud and he's also written many other bestselling books a number one new york times bestselling
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:43.920]  books jerome course he dot com uh so dr coursey this is even getting too crazy for me to believe
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:51.520]  i've had reporters in france all week um we see attacks in the u.s like at ford hood and the army
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:57.440]  navy marine corps recruiting centers not being called terror the garland attack not being called
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:03.360]  terror and the best i can tell from talking to you talking to amad salim and many others
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.560]  obama's gotten in over his head he's been blackmailed through ben gazi probably blackmailed
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.800]  uh by the saudis by the turks and by the muslim brotherhood he's in deep with them
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.360]  and now it's gone to the level of they basically have a compromised controlled president whether
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:26.320]  he's a sleeper cell radical muslim or not he might as well be one now and this is like a science
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.480]  fiction movie i can't even believe we're in this much peril in every angle i look at the analysis
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:39.120]  only goes from bad to worse in your expert analysis and what you know what is really going on right
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:46.080]  now because this is insane well i mean clearly obama is beginning to embarrass himself uh with
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:53.120]  his cavalier attitude uh when i wrote abomination i pointed out that obama was raised a muslim in
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:12:00.640]  indonesia uh he's never renounced that uh obama i think has given every indication that his sympathies
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:08.800]  continue to be with islam and he's making that clear again now the idea of flooding the united
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:16.640]  states with refugees is if that somehow excuses and this is a small number of the people have been
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:24.320]  displaced in syria when obama and hillary clinton were responsible for destabilizing the the middle
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:31.440]  east including destabilizing and destroying what's left of syria and suddenly obama wants to play
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:38.000]  this guilt trip that we've got to take in syrian refugees it's ridiculous uh the american people
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.880]  aren't going to stand for because the risk is apparent you've got organized isis terrorists
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.640]  who are clearly capable of crossing borders communicating across borders using encrypted
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:57.280]  technology on getting into the united states launching simultaneous attacks and a coordinated
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.360]  in efforts that they persist in when they are thwarted with one attack they plan another
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:09.760]  and not deterred even by law enforcement in fact law enforcement is going to find it very hard in
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:16.320]  europe to get down to trace to trace all the potential terrorists uh people are traveling
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:23.440]  freely between europe and syria participating with isis going back to europe the crossing the
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:30.480]  border with mexico and obama is basically is showing dereliction of duty it's not defending
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:36.000]  the people of united states he shows no enthusiasm for supporting the people of the united states
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.640]  which is his primary constitutional obligation a lot of experts say he's mentally ill and has lost
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.120]  grip on reality uh i mean i think that's even more frightening than if he's just a pure trader i mean
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:54.080]  what is he thinking he's committing political suicide in front of everyone i mean we know we're
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:59.040]  going to get hit by more terrorists now it's already happened he just can't have the media label it
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:05.360]  as non-islamic now dr corcy well obama is getting indefensible i mean he says you know the day before
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:13.280]  we get the paris attacks that isis is contained he ridicules the gop for orphans and widows and then
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:22.480]  a woman terrorist bomber blows herself up in in in paris you know you've got clearly a president
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.120]  that's out of touch with reality and as i said when i wrote the obama nation obama
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  ends out he starts with a hatred of america he's a socialist he was trained by frank marshall
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:40.160]  davis as a communist obama was trained also in a sol linsky organization he wants a radical
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.720]  revolution he wants to weaken the united states when i wrote obama nation i predicted that we would
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:52.080]  have more racial strife in the united states a weakened america internationally uh we would
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  have a terrorism on the increase all of which has come true and obama as far as i'm concerned is
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:04.400]  carrying out the agenda he was elected saying he would carry out but in his crazy leftist
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.360]  red diaper doper baby world he really thinks radical socialism and collectivism can ally with
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:17.360]  radical islam and i know historically it has allied but i don't get how you get feminist lecturing
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:25.200]  western men who who are the most loving to women out there undoubtedly how they hate us but then
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.280]  they love people that would sexually mutilate them not let them drive cars and put bags on
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:35.440]  their heads i just don't get what sick freaks these gloria steinham people are well it's as
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:41.440]  bizarre i mean the idea that the left would embrace islam it's only because you know whoever
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:50.080]  hates my enemy is my friend and the left hates america radical left hates america right obama
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.600]  airs uh the whole group of the radical left and that's just taking over the democratic party and
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:00.960]  i always hear they hate america but they really do they really do i mean they really do it's like
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.800]  mentally old children that hate their parents it's like spoiled rotten brats that you hear that you
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:10.080]  know kill their parents this is the exact same type of crap well it comes down to a self-hatred it
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:16.000]  comes down to fundamental psychological problems and i'm not a psychiatrist but they hate america
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.360]  they blame america they won't credit america with any of the good things america has done in the world
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:30.960]  and as a result feminists as you point out who should loathe islam for its treatment of women
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.240]  um it basically one of the worst religions of the world if you want to call it a religion
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:42.960]  and i mean you know the way radical islam is practiced is an ideology but beating women
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:47.440]  radical islam is the enslavement of women yes it is there's no question about it
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:54.480]  radical islam has no regard for islam if the you know the desired sexual creature and radical
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:17:00.800]  islam is not a woman that's been the reality for anybody who knows anything about the middle east
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:06.560]  and this is radical islam these are the extremists these are the ones who want sharia law these are
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.880]  the but they're the ones that are willing to blow themselves up and am i right in saying that
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:16.080]  geopolitically they're gaining ground they're becoming dominant islam well they are becoming
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:21.680]  the the force of islam the the vocal force as i've said islam needs to go through a
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:28.240]  reformation but the voices and forces that should be speaking out condemning islam right now
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:34.800]  are silent this is the problem islam needs to have a reformation and there's no voices in islam
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:42.480]  speaking up for that reformation and if we have the radical jihadis hijack the religion and take
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:47.840]  it over you know we're going right back to charles mark tall in the battle of tours because the
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.640]  europeans have already once decided that there was nothing they could do with islam except killed
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.880]  them all and throw them out and if islam wants to go down that path with the jihadists it's going
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.360]  to come to the same i was about to say these young radical jihadists that think they're killing a bunch
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:08.640]  of liberal french and people if they think that's the real resolve the veneer of civilization will
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.360]  peel off europe and the united states very very quickly and then it's going to get really really
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:18.880]  nasty they shouldn't take the weakness of a bunch of liberal college kids uh for the rest of us well
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:26.560]  in fact you know of course you know europe is not the spoiled children in colleges today oh you know
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:32.560]  want um woodrow wilson removed from princeton because they think he was a racist i mean this
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.800]  insanity these spoiled kids i don't know how any of them are going to get jobs or how many of them
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:43.760]  are going to be employable but at any rate the idea that europe is now i mean radical this attack
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:49.600]  in paris has done more to destroy the european union in one event than i could have imagined
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:55.040]  possible and the european union needs to be destroyed this whole idea of eliminating
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:19:01.280]  countries and one world government uh it's also ironic these terrorists are in brussels which is
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:07.440]  the home of one world government it's the center centers where the eu you know the nameless my
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.480]  reporters were there yesterday tried to go in restaurants tried to walk and were just screamed
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:19.600]  at and run out three times well the european union is going to quickly change because when people are
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:25.200]  this if you can't go to a restaurant you can't go to a concert you can't go to a mall uh innocent
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:31.680]  victims are being slaughtered and this was slaughter this was not this was no noble attack this was
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:39.360]  cowardly slaughter in no gun zones which they knew were free of anybody in the terrorist being
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:45.600]  opposed when they were doing their attack so of course we got to go to break the wnd.com
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.720]  drum courses our guests when we come back i'm going to ask him how much more dangerous will

[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:26.240]  is 800 259 92 31 how dangerous do you think obama has become i think he was always dangerous but
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:34.800]  now i really do see that he's moving even faster than i thought possible 800 259 92 31 house bill
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:42.720]  to bar syrian refugees from us without more vetting just past the house is probably believed
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:50.720]  to be set to pass the senate it passed 289 to 137 by wide margin politically popular obama says
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.920]  that he'll just veto it but what happens when there's a terror attack then he's directly responsible
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:02.000]  this is unprecedented dr. coursey he's got to be blackmailed i mean there's no reason
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:08.080]  for him to be doing this politically the optics are so bad well i mean i continue to say and have
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:14.080]  always said that obama's sympathies are a muslim i i've written extensively about it i think obama
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:20.720]  has always warned this ring which has the shahada on it i still believe that's the case i know the
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:27.520]  white house tried to alter the ring but the obama was wearing this wedding ring which you know with
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:34.960]  which has got from indonesia with looks me muslim inscriptions on it since he was in college long
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:41.920]  before he was married i mean even at harvard law school they do a joke law review issue every year
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:47.440]  they were mocking obama about this muslim ring that he wouldn't explain why he was wearing it
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.960]  i mean obama i think sympathies have been islam and he's telegraphed in any number of ways i don't
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.320]  know what he made for all i know i may be an atheist at heart but the point is he was raised a muslim
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:06.880]  he's never renounced the religion and i think he wants to expand you know the chaos in the middle
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:13.920]  east for his own goals of reducing the power and influence of the united states and has left us
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:19.360]  agenda of revolutionary transformation of the united states let me ask this question what you
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:23.600]  wrote about seven eight years ago about obama's all come true so we'll give you that again you've
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.720]  been right doctor but how are the elites allowing this i know there's not one elite but there are
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:35.520]  different elites who've become very powerful off of american prowess why would they be allowing
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:39.520]  this to happen is it just it's so fun to be politically correct that they think this is cute
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.720]  i think you're seeing in europe the beginning of the end of the political correctness at
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:51.520]  least a correction in it i mean in europe as i say that this one attack has done more to bring the
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:59.840]  EU to an end than i thought possible i think the EU is seeing a swing of the pendulum over to more
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:07.200]  conservative parties that wants security that want to eliminate this multicultural nonsense
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:13.440]  this multicultural nightmare that europe has become the loss of identity i mean you know europe is
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.720]  becoming a muslim nation and what they don't understand is that you know islam reaches
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:25.200]  a critical per percentage eight percent they're in sharia law and they'll lie about it they'll
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:31.280]  lie about what their true intentions are unfortunately the radical islamists are currently
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:37.680]  in control and in the ascendancy and what you're going to quickly see the united states and i think
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:47.680]  russia combined to do with or without obama is you know the basic idea of massive retaliation
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:54.480]  throughout the middle east you know if islam wants to put the civilized world the european
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.160]  united states under the condition that you know these people need to all be eliminated and killed
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.400]  i think you're going to be surprised to find the europeans willing to turn the middle east
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:10.560]  into glass with nuclear weapons before they allow themselves to have more terrorist attack like they
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:16.000]  did in paris i think this is going to backfire against the radical sure and you can argue the
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.160]  u.s has done some bad stuff in the middle east europe's pretty much been out of there for 50 years
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:25.440]  so this is really picking a fight here dot of course you got a minute and a half obama caused
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:32.480]  this this is what people got to remember hillary and obama sided with al-qaeda and destabilized
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:38.640]  libya they were bringing weapons in through ben gazi that's what chris uh our ambassador was
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:43.520]  doing there and that caused the chain reaction caused the chain reaction to stabilize syria
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:51.280]  this is the result of a conscious policy by obama and hillary that is at their doorstep
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:54.640]  they caused the destabilization so they are the authors they should be held accountable
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.520]  precisely i agree entirely i know you said you could hold on a little bit longer i want to
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:02.800]  five minutes i'm going to let you go dr. coursey on the other side of the spray because i've got to
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.960]  ask you because you've been so frighteningly accurate i mean i'll be honest i had you on
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:12.080]  ten years ago or 15 years ago but i i thought you were smart but i just didn't you know believe
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:16.400]  it all what you predicted it's actually coming true like like a crystal ball so i want to ask you
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:21.440]  when we come back what do you expect obama to do in his last year in office what do we do to try to
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:27.040]  stop him how far will congress go in letting him go crazy i mean there's got to be because for the
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:34.160]  first time ever i'm beyond scared it's more just like ready to take action i mean i don't know what
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:38.560]  i'm supposed to do to stop this but i know for my family's sake i need to get even more aggressive
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:46.000]  with these people because they are just crazy criminals i they're just they're like psychopaths
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  or something i want to keep your take on what they're going to do next we're on the march

[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:02.400]  got coming up uh hillary clinton is criticizing a comedian that made fun of her she's saying bernie
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:07.200]  sanders is sexist again i mean this is just you know i think this is what has come down to i know
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:13.760]  that left this ideology and collectivism is such garbage historically that i i just can't believe
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:18.480]  that practitioners of it believe it when they when they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:26.080]  like hillary clinton or barack obama but i think obama more than hillary actually smokes the dope
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:31.040]  and actually has the chips on the shoulder even though he's had the silver spoon life
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:37.600]  and i guess there's a certain vandalism against the west i don't know what you call it so so

[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:51.680]  obama to do in the next year in office how do we stop it what should we be looking for next well
[02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:56.400]  i think obama can't be cannot be trusted to defend the united states i think he's going to do everything
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:06.160]  he can to get iran nuclear weapons iran's going to advance very fast in its accumulation of uranium
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:12.160]  and its advance in nuclear technology obama will do nothing to stop it i think in obama is going
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:17.840]  to essentially throw hillary under the bus blame hillary for the middle east i believe hillary
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:26.880]  clinton will be under criminal indictment before the election likely both from the uh apartment
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:32.800]  justice wow and also in the states bill and hillary clinton are going to be prosecuted in
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:38.480]  the states for the foundation they can lose control over the foundation uh the democrats i
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:44.080]  think have resolved that they're going to lose this election hillary has been picked to take the fall
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:48.720]  no one in the democratic right between 1952 when the democrats knew adlai steven said it was going
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:55.040]  to lose and no serious democrats could would win just like the eisenhower situation and obama's
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:36:00.800]  going to clean out the old hillary clinton wing of the democratic party all the old democrats so
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:06.160]  he is involved i've heard that from other insiders there is an obama coup over the clinton machine
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:10.880]  absolutely obama is going to take the clinton's down obama will not let the clintons have control
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:17.280]  the white house which means control the democratic party this is going to be the demise of the what's
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.480]  left of the centrist wing of the democratic party it's it's going to well so as bad as they are
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.360]  doctor you're saying it's about to get even more radical it's going to get more radical and they're
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:33.120]  going to try to align with the forces in the universities to do an air style revolution
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:39.120]  which will mean opening the borders rushing to the end of a new world order climate change all
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:45.200]  the things that obama has predicted will want to do he's going to rush to do is going to fail i
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.000]  think there will be more terrorist attacks in europe i think there's going to be terrorist attacks
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.800]  in the united states and ultimately donald trump it's all going to benefit donald trump
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:59.200]  donald trump's numbers are going to continue to rise very soon i think you'll see donald trump
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:04.960]  over 50 percent you're going to see more and more terrorists stopped at the border you're going to see
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:10.880]  more and more criminal activity the country is going to close the border and the country may start
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:19.440]  throwing out muslims in europe and the united states if obama continues to press this agenda
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.880]  i think obama will settle for cleansing the democratic party of the centrist the clintons
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:30.640]  make sure they're prosecuted the clinton foundation is in its last days it will be put under receivership
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:36.320]  by one or more of the states clinton's will lose control of the foundation and the democratic party
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:46.240]  will move far to the left i tell you in the process the we will we will hit the wall as soon as
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:54.720]  interest rates rise we're going to see a global recession global depression the debt bomb is
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:38:01.040]  going to explode and the united states in europe obama set that up obama's been borrowing money
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:07.200]  doubling the debt that's all going to come to roost will be into another 2008 or more severe
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.200]  recession when interest rates start rising stock market could easily lose four or five thousand
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:20.960]  points well i tell you i have to say that i know there's a cfr and globalist and they want global
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:24.480]  government and i've talked to a lot of smart people like you and they said look the leftist plan on
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:30.160]  double crossing the professors the think tanks plan on double crossing the elites and i think the
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:35.760]  elites are starting to figure that out that they didn't just use radical islam and and leftist
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:42.080]  ideology to to scramble the country and divide and conquer that there are leftist factions that
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:47.120]  are going to go for everything and i just can't believe that the rich elites that that the west
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:53.120]  made them so rich that that they would create these horrible organizations that now even threaten
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:58.480]  them and i just hope the establishment i know it's a diverse establishment has figured this out i
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:02.800]  mean i'm starting to get some inklings of that are you getting any inklings like that that maybe
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:07.440]  there's some elites in the west that don't want to commit political suicide well there are they're
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:12.320]  thinking about it very seriously but the the clinton's are going to the clinton's are criminals
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:15.200]  and they're going to go down they're going to be thrown down they're going to be thrown down hard
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  when clinton's go down a lot of the people who are around them are going to go down
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:24.320]  we multiple prosecutions of the clinton and their close associates it's going to spring
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:29.040]  into wall street and those the list of people being published like the wall the washington
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.400]  post the people who are back clinton are all going to back away from them they're all going to get
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:38.160]  scared they're all going to stop funding them the criminal elite which has been what what clinton
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:45.040]  has cultivated is going to be ultimately hunted down much more than it has been and the new
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:51.600]  world order crowd i think is going to be very surprised by the reaction of a revival on the
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:59.280]  right and a demand for closed borders a demand for return to family the lgbt agenda all of these
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:06.000]  extremes to which it have gotten the left overplayed his hand and i think is now in for a severe set
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.920]  back the left knows it the left is going to let the clinton's take the fall regroup and in eight
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:17.840]  years the left will try to rise again i think that's what i think obama knows it velary gerrant knows
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:24.000]  it that no serious person on the left is running in the democratic party you've got the elizabeth
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:32.720]  warren saying we'll wait out 2016 let hillary go down hard put a bite in whomever else he'll lose
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:38.480]  and then we'll regroup for eight years when we have a chance to come back and do it the right
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:44.480]  i agree with you and it's key that patriots libertarians constitutionalists don't let the
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:49.680]  old rhinos come in and destroy this opportunity that we try to save the country reform it cut the
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:56.080]  taxes cut the spending turn the engine up rebuild our infrastructure rebuild our military and try to
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.480]  restore the republic and i think the elites would be smarter doing that than this whole globalist
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:05.040]  operation that is in the end going to destroy them as well and i'll tell you one reason that i've
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:09.520]  been so against black lives matter in other groups is they're so clearly controlled by soros is that
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:16.640]  i've learned the last few years that the government the military even the fbi uh you name it these
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:21.280]  agencies now are really awake to what's going on they've always had problems and corruption
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.480]  but they really want to go after the corrupt people in government they don't want to be corrupt
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.320]  they don't want to ruin the country and they're just waiting for the american people to give them
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:37.200]  the opportunity uh with the grand juries with the states and others uh to uh really bring justice
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:42.720]  to the criminal elite that you mentioned and so we are at a major crossroads i think the next
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:48.240]  14 15 months don't you agree is going to decide so much the future of this country and the world
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:53.120]  as i think you're going to see people like harry reid and nancy polosi under criminal
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:58.000]  investigation i think you're going to see it extend into the leadership of the republican party
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.600]  i think the grassroots of the republican party is going to reject the washington wino leadership
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:09.680]  and uh wall street's going to have to decide how much longer it wants to play this leftist game
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.200]  if wall street continues to play it when the economy turns around there's going to be a massive
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:22.720]  sweeping out of wall street because the this entire goldman sacks engineered death structure with the
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:28.080]  obama doubling our debt is going to come crashing down it was the clintons that engineered that well
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:33.920]  and it goes even you know goes way back i mean greens fan was the you know beginning but sure
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:37.600]  but wasn't it larry because you're the expert in banking wasn't it larry summers and the clintons
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:43.360]  that really green lighted the crazy derivatives yeah i well the derivatives were going the summers
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:48.240]  and the others said we don't have to worry about debt the paul krugeman's and the others
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:56.640]  have as much debt as you want that's good you know all this basically return to fundamental
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:04.240]  economics of spend spend spend and as i am debt debt debt is okay and i i think that all that
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:11.360]  economics we're going to see a repudiation of the entire economics of you know the post-war era
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:16.560]  come crashing down in this debt structure and wall street's going to come and have a come
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:21.840]  up into with it as well as will the republican establishment uh the country is in yes there's
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:28.560]  going to be you know major major upheavals in the united states but i think the the smart forces
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:36.640]  valery gerrits within the democratic party realize that obama overplayed the hand and now
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:41.360]  they're going to retrench and wait eight years until they have a chance and now he's just throwing a
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:47.120]  fit over playing it that much more with arrogance and disconnected from reality uh i'm stunning
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.000]  analysis i think this is the best interview ever uh dr corcy but obviously we're in very very dangerous
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.440]  time so the information is going to be hardcore very powerful interview will be reading your articles
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:03.680]  at wnd.com thank you sir my pleasure thank you alec thank you very much thank you yeah i mean
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.560]  folks this isn't rhetoric here i i've gone past the hair on the back of my neck standing up at
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:16.480]  this point i mean this is just crazy i mean this is crazy talent when you've got weirdo
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:22.560]  nazi collaborators running basically the media and the government and trying to shut down free
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:31.360]  speech and funding putting transvestite bathrooms in the first grade i mean it's just twilight zone
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:37.600]  how nuts these people are and then they're just radicalizing muslims and in and in funding al-qaeda
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:41.120]  roiders three weeks ago remember i read that headline like 20 times it was
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:49.520]  white house criticizes russia for bombing moderate rebels al-nazara slash al-qaeda
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:57.600]  the moderate al-qaeda i mean you know how dare you bomb al-qaeda i mean i'm reading this i'm reading
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:03.360]  you know national poll democrats want to arrest those that deny man-made climate change
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:11.600]  that was two days ago they're freaks people they're total crazies that's not liberal to
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:19.520]  want to arrest me for my speech you crazies i used to say they're not crazy they're not crazy
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.200]  they're not crazy they've taken over there's a method of their madness they're not crazy
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:28.960]  but at a certain point on a power trip someone who's not crazy becomes crazy
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:37.200]  at a certain point bravada hutzpah arrogance hubris whatever you want to call it becomes mania
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:43.680]  i mean as i've gotten a little more power and in reach but let's face it the show has a lot
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:52.480]  of power it's scary i've gotten less confident less mindless uh more humanitarian i guess you
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:57.200]  should say that i was pretty arrogant when i was 22 with a radio show you know weeknights in a major
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:04.080]  city but compared to these people i was never arrogant i mean these people are nuts and and
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.280]  you know your arrogance can only take you so far and the smarter you get the more you realize
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:14.480]  arrogance is your weakness i'm gonna go to break and come back with your phone calls or maybe i'll
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:20.800]  go to him right now i've got a few minutes for a break um the optics of everything the globalists
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:26.960]  are doing is bad like the pope coming out and announcing world government and they still have
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:32.080]  news articles saying no world government exists don't people know that only makes our credibility
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:40.880]  rocket and the average person in government is not the enemy because big government's the problem
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.240]  but people in government aren't the enemy on average i've talked to them they're more awake than
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:49.920]  the public they know how corrupt it is i mean there are a lot of good people in america and in
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:57.040]  the world and i've i've really had a chance to discover that and uh we've got a lot of hope but

[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:42.160]  about to happen and no matter what system and this is going to be a screw job because it's
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:46.480]  written by these companies that control the government and have created a fake free market
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:51.840]  a real free market you'd get the lowest price highest quality would win now you got to buy it

[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:30.800]  it uh don't take in colorado you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead hey i'm just calling
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:37.280]  because obama is obviously you know using abusing his power and originally i'm from new world and
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.800]  and i don't want to i just want to take a minute and i appreciate everything you're doing i ordered
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:47.520]  so many of your products and i don't want to do a plug here well listen i'm going to come back to
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:53.280]  you because i i noticed we had a call from sweden that i hadn't got to yet and i don't want and i
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:56.720]  want you to come back and talk but i want to go to sweden first because i'd promised to go to
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:00.320]  that caller first and i forgot so i apologize i'll come back to you don't take a minute
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:06.560]  nicolas and sweden sorry i had forgotten you were there go ahead oh it's okay alex greetings from
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:13.760]  the pc capsule of the world yes the originator of the stalker syndrome that's right yeah that's
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:20.000]  right well this the situation here in sweden it's like being on the front line uh i must say i think
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:27.280]  i know how uh the people in bg france felt like because we're being occupied basically and uh
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.640]  it's really really scary when you see your society crumbling in front of you and you
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:40.720]  can't do anything about it it feels like because everyone you speak to are having a severe cause of
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:47.840]  the you know cognitive dissonance you know uh there is resistance growing but i think the danger
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:53.520]  here is that many people are putting their hopes into you know the political system which is of
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:59.440]  course rigged i mean we have the sweden democrats for instance that have uh you know in the latest
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.800]  post they're they're the biggest party now sweden so there is a resistance mounting the problem is
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:11.760]  however that the even if this party uh you know it's good you know i don't trust politicians
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.960]  myself but the even if this party is good all the other parties combined they've already
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:22.880]  shut them out sure describe what it's like to live in sweden i mean i've read reports where they won't
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.720]  even report the number of women raped because it's politically incorrect they want to arrest people
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:31.600]  for rape and reportedly the muslims have gotten so radical they just run around bullying everybody
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:40.320]  and they're like gods yeah let's just say this we had one case now uh not very long ago uh in a
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:47.040]  swedish town where there's these refugee centers that they set up for you know the the orphan
[02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:51.440]  children or whatever you know lonely immigrants that come without their parents so to speak
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:57.440]  here in sweden we call them pig bomb which is bearded bearded children because everyone knows
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:03.920]  that they're not children they're grown men but they're basically you know uh put out there that
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:09.680]  they are you know children and these there was this woman that went outside one of these uh
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:16.880]  you know homes for these so-called children she was brutally raped and then when she had
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:22.560]  was raped one time she managed to you know get up and walked away and tried to you know get
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:28.960]  help basically then there were other men from another you know of these homes that raped her again
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:34.400]  and sure i saw that in the news and then the police wouldn't it didn't even arrest one of them i
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:38.560]  remember correctly it's just over the top you should tell your testimony online on youtube you
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:43.920]  should write an article about it uh just this is the murder of the west by design and there's
[02:58:43.920 --> 02:58:47.360]  plenty of nice muslims we can bring in but they don't they bring in the radicals we're going to

[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:32.000]  to cover the latest uh in the economy what's happening overseas the open borders and more
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:36.480]  we were talking to a caller from sweden dante sorry to cut you off i had just promised to go
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:43.440]  to that caller first if he was able to hold uh go ahead from colorado all right thank you um i just
[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:50.080]  wanted to say you know obama is obviously abusing his power and we have to realize that you know
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:55.840]  in 1776 it was us we the people that really at the end of the day that's where the buck stops
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:02.800]  and the sooner we realize that the better off this country will be and i'm just sad to see america
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:07.840]  just kind of going down the tooth like this and i just wanted people american citizens even people
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:15.200]  worldwide to know that it's it's the people that have the power not the not the government that
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:22.480]  are abusing their powers and it's given to them or like puppets if you know what i mean well i agree
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.640]  with you and the elites have just gotten away with so much they think they're invincible they're not
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:33.280]  we are engaged in 1776 though an info war we're winning on many fronts the hearts and minds
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:37.920]  whether it's on abortion whether it's on open borders whether it's on gun control whether
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.840]  it's globalism we have to defend ourselves if it gets physical and we are having a revolution
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:49.040]  of people buying guns learning how to use them that's in the news as well that's confirmed but
[03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:54.480]  offensively going after criminal elements of the government is not the way to go
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:01:58.640]  because they're set up to respond to that to demonize that to spend that that's why they
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:02.560]  want to get things violent and i know you're not calling for that i'm just pointing out
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:08.400]  that that is the last thing we want i appreciate your call the last thing we want is any violence
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:14.720]  against obama because that would turn him into a martyr that would turn him into a celebrity that
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:21.600]  would turn him into a victim and we don't want that we want to destroy the ideas he's pushed
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:27.760]  we want to destroy his fraud we want to keep him alive to destroy him in name and his politics and
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:33.680]  and what he represents we want to keep him alive to destroy him completely politically
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:37.280]  d on in illinois thanks for holding your own the year
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:47.360]  ellis how are you doing good brother go ahead yeah i think obama springer and the refugees
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:52.960]  maybe to set up a false flag where they shoot up school oh yeah of course and then and then he'll
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:56.640]  say turn our guns in the democrats are already saying that yeah because they've suspended logic
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:03.120]  yes do you think we're uh one false flag away from uh suspension of firearms and that the
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:09.840]  refugees would be the perfect pass before that yes and i think they're not above attacking
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:14.240]  a school full of refugees too and blaming it on the left wing or right wing or anything i mean
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:18.480]  there's just no telling what these crazies will do let me tell you they're they're too confident
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:22.400]  like course he thinks they're on the rocks and i think he's partially right but i'm telling you
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:27.920]  yeah they're too arrogant they're too confident they're either completely insane or they got
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:37.200]  multiple ace cards up their sleeves have you seen the movie that's a watching in the siege
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:44.960]  have i seen the movie the siege i think i have refreshed my memory yeah uh they're
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:50.000]  they kidnapped the terrorists abduct them and then there's a series of uh terrorist attacks
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.200]  in the city oh yeah that's in new york and marshal law gets declared yes yes because of course it's
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:00.960]  got uh it's got bruce welleson and i appreciate your call he plays the commanding general all right

[03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:05.040]  debate this last weekend those last minute changed the day before to talk about foreign policy because
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:11.840]  of the terrorist attacks the sanders campaign was furious bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism
[03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:15.840]  the moderator asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national security was climate
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:20.800]  change absolutely in fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism you
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:26.240]  understand what sanders is saying climate change is directly related to terrorism terrorism has
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:31.520]  nothing to do with wars for oil and power it's not about a clash of cultures and as every liberal
[03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:38.320]  will tell you it has nothing to do with islam so it must be climate change bernie al qaeda and ices
[03:05:38.320 --> 03:05:44.160]  were not created to fight climate change but there is an indirect link bernie sanders won't tell you
[03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:50.080]  however if he even sees it al qaeda and ices are creation of the same governments and multinational
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:55.040]  corporations that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and climate change

[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:21.280]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show the overdrive edition i'm anthony
[03:08:21.280 --> 03:08:27.600]  gucciardi i'll be your guest for the remainder of the hour covering the newest news some of
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:31.840]  the news you definitely didn't hear about on the show today but i've dug up from around the internet
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:37.360]  and also we have a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour that's going to talk about
[03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:44.080]  some really really interesting new ways the so-called secrets of cleansing your body from the toxic
[03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:50.000]  substances that we're experiencing on a daily basis and speaking of toxic substances let's go
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:55.360]  through some of the news headlines including genetically modified salmon cleared for human
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:59.520]  consumption if you've been following this for a while you know that the i believe it's called
[03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:05.840]  aquafresh genetically modified sound salmon aqua bounty that the fda went back and forth for a while
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:10.160]  congress actually blocked it and said that the approval may be unsafe and there's more testing
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:13.920]  required and then the fda said well we don't care we're going to push it through whatever
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:19.920]  and this is out of Reuters today federal regulators cleared the way for a genetically engineered
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:24.320]  salmon to be farmed for human consumption in the first ever such approval for an animal
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:31.360]  whose dna has been scientifically modified now we're getting into modified dna of animals
[03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:35.920]  even more complex than plants the us food and drug administration's approval of the salmon
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:41.200]  developed by aqua bounty technologies to grow faster than conventional farmed salmon follows
[03:09:41.200 --> 03:09:46.240]  years of deliberations the regulator has declared the salmon is as nutritious as normally grown
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:51.120]  atlantic salmon which means the salmon will not require specific labeling that's the key point
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:59.520]  they're not actually going to even label the gmo salmon because it's the same thing guys regardless
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:05.280]  of whether or not it's even safe right regardless we should still have the decision
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:12.160]  to choose to eat genetically modified animals when we're at the grocery store but the fda says
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:16.640]  that would be bad because it's nutritionally the same even though it's modified you're not allowed
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:23.120]  to know what you're doing another news Putin puts 50 million dollar bounty on heads of metro jet
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:28.560]  bombers and if you're not aware of this news already Vladimir Putin is after 50 million dollar
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:32.880]  bounty for anyone who can find those responsible for blowing up a russian plane over egypt
[03:10:32.880 --> 03:10:38.400]  saying we will find them anywhere on the planet and punish them it's a hardcore statement from
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:43.440]  Putin and it's interesting and i want to play some of these videos for you because as other
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:50.640]  countries are issuing these hardcore statements against isis and terrorism of all forms and
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:55.200]  saying we're going to do anything possible 50 million dollar bounties just going all out
[03:10:56.240 --> 03:11:02.000]  what's happening here in the united states what's happening in france we're accepting more refugees
[03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:10.080]  and people like sheryl atkinson say that obama won't even read the reports on terrorist groups
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:15.120]  to begin with let's queue up that video i have talked to people who've worked in the obama
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:20.640]  administration who firmly believe he has made up his mind i would say close his mind they say
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:26.160]  to their intelligence that they've tried to bring him about various groups that he does not consider
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:32.480]  terrorists even if they are on the u.s list of designated terrorists um he has his own ideas
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:37.040]  and there are those who've known him a long time who say this dates back to law school if if he did
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:41.440]  not necessarily you may think this is a good trait you may think it's a bad trait he does not
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:47.040]  necessarily listen to the people with whom he disagrees he seems to dig in and you know that
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:51.600]  would be i i suppose he would say because he thinks he's right so you're saying he is he is
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:56.000]  facing formidable opposition on this particular point so when he stands there and says as he
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:00.640]  always does no matter what the issue you may notice this i'm sure as a as a as a reporter you notice
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:04.560]  this like i do you know no matter what the issue no matter what the topic no matter what the press
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:08.160]  conference if it's a controversial thing or he's getting pushed back on it from anywhere
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:13.200]  he'll say i'm not the only one who believes this everybody believes that he that's a weakness i think
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:18.880]  but but you're telling me that you've talked to people in his inner circle or in the administration
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:24.240]  that that are telling you that even though there are groups that might be on our terrorists that
[03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:30.400]  are classified as terrorist groups obama in his mind doesn't consider them to be terrorists because
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:36.160]  what because they have a gripe i don't know the reasoning for it i've only been told by those who
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:41.200]  have um allegedly attempted to present him or been in the circle that have attempted to present him
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:45.760]  with certain intelligence that they said uh he doesn't want it he said he doesn't want it well
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:51.200]  he won't read it so he won't even read the intelligence reports according to share Cheryl
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:57.280]  ackerson about the isis terrorists about terrorist groups in the united states just letting everyone
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:13:04.000]  in and and here's the thing by the way this isn't even a political issue i'm over politics i'm on
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:10.160]  the third party of reality i'm on the third party of humanity i'm on the third party of reason
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:17.600]  this is above politics this is beyond politics this is the most fundamental basics and one of
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:24.560]  the main reasons this country is so sick and this planet is so sick and our ideologies have been
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.760]  decayed and destroyed in many ways is because we don't seem to understand the details
[03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:35.360]  we have to lump everything because we've been told to by the establishment system from the
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:41.040]  schools we've been put into to the reeducation camp style learning systems that everything has to
[03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:47.920]  be black or white a or b right you know the basic analogy of left versus right the democrats
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:53.840]  versus republicans that everyone uses to attack the other what it is it's a self defense mechanism
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:14:00.640]  that we've created that we've utilized throughout our lives to protect ourselves from new thoughts
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:06.800]  and ideas it's a it's a way to stay closed-minded by labeling people so i'm sitting here right now
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:13.120]  talking about the ridiculousness that obama does not even look at the reports on terrorist groups
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:17.920]  is letting refugees in and just letting all this happen and i have another video i'm going to play
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:24.320]  here in a second about how he was warned about the syrian refugees before the isis paris isis
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:31.120]  attacks and he didn't care that's not politics but some people listening right now are going to say
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:36.400]  well anthony gucciardi sounds like he's a right winger because he criticized obama or they're
[03:14:36.400 --> 03:14:42.720]  going to say something even sillier right they're going to say that shirt he's wearing looks bad
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:48.800]  therefore i don't trust him or or you know he sounds like an idiot the way i the way i speak
[03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:56.080]  makes your brain shut off all that all these people do in many ways is they label things
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:02.960]  to shut it down or they use personal attacks right so let's say for example i like fishing
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:07.200]  which i actually not a huge fan of fishing but i like to go out fishing but you don't like fishing
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:12.080]  so therefore everything i say is bad or i made a mistake one time on air and i said something
[03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:18.640]  that you didn't agree with or i used a word right i used a word that you didn't agree with well
[03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:23.600]  everything he said is now wrong and that's how we've been taught to think we've just been taught
[03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:29.120]  to think that ideas reflect on the person and if we don't agree with something about that person
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:35.840]  or agree about something that person does therefore the ideas are worthless but i know most of you
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:41.520]  listening to this show and watching it on whatever platform you're watching it on know that it is
[03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:46.400]  about the ideas and that's why we're making a difference and that's why we can talk about real
[03:15:46.400 --> 03:15:52.320]  things and real issues instead of the mainstream media which is like a circus and all they use
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:59.520]  is labels they say conservative journalist liberal journalist libertarian journalist
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:07.040]  how about journalists why do we have to coincide with a specific party or a specific idea
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:12.880]  black lives matter versus all lives matter versus not even having to say that
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:18.400]  it all goes back to the fundamentals it's a self-defense mechanism and speaking of that
[03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:23.200]  let's go to this video where it actually says obama officials before paris attacked weren't
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:27.840]  of risk of syrian refugees in us and this is not a political thing this is third party of reality
[03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:32.880]  this is third party of reason we should probably care about syrian refugee intel on terrorist
[03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:37.520]  attacks let's check out this video it is a time consuming process and one of the challenges we
[03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:43.280]  will have is that we're not going to not we're not going to know a whole lot about the individual
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:48.960]  refugees that come forward from the un high commission on refugees for resettlement and
[03:16:48.960 --> 03:16:56.400]  embedding i don't obviously put it past the likes of isil to infiltrate operatives
[03:16:56.400 --> 03:17:04.640]  among these refugees so that is a huge concern of ours didn't we still encounter cases of domestic
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:11.520]  terrorism conducted by those admitted as refugees with significantly less information on potential
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:17.840]  syrian refugees isn't it true that you can't ensure that the iraqi experience is not going
[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:23.440]  to be replayed you're you're correct that we did discover in people who had come in as refugees
[03:17:23.440 --> 03:17:29.360]  from iraq a number of people who are of serious concern including two that were charged when
[03:17:29.360 --> 03:17:33.600]  we found their fingerprints on improvised explosive devices from iraq there's no doubt
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:39.440]  that that was the product of a less than excellent vetting that had been done on iraqi refugees
[03:17:39.440 --> 03:17:44.240]  it is not a perfect process there is a degree of risk attached to any screening and vetting
[03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:52.800]  process we look to manage that risk as best we can the bad news is our ability to touch data with
[03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:57.280]  respect to people may come from syria may be limited that is if we don't know much about
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:00.640]  somebody there won't be anything in our data we don't have the information on most of these
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:05.520]  people isn't that true yeah and and i so i can't sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:10.800]  that that there's no risk associated with this the bad news is there's no risk-free process
[03:18:11.360 --> 03:18:17.760]  well the bad news is we should probably just ignore all the risks about the terrorist groups
[03:18:17.760 --> 03:18:21.840]  that we're letting inside the united states and again it's not a left versus right issue it's a
[03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:28.800]  third party of reality thing maybe we shouldn't ignore all the warnings from people that actually
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:34.160]  know what they're talking about but you know what i saw an r next to someone's name indicating
[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:39.520]  republican on that mashup by the washington free beacon and thanks to the washington free beacon
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:45.520]  for allowing us to use that but i saw an r next to one of their names i'm going to use labels
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:50.240]  and preconceived notions and the mainstream media slash establishment system that i've been brought
[03:18:50.240 --> 03:18:57.120]  up on to attack that person and therefore disregard everything they just said in fact you notice
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:04.160]  someone that is hardcore left or right i mean they could literally have cancer and their doctor could
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.920]  be the opposite spectrum let's say they're extreme liberal and they go to the doctor and
[03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:12.240]  they're the doctors are republican he says i've done all the tests you have cancer you're a liar
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:18.240]  you don't know anything you're a republican it is so silly that we can't listen to humans anymore
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:22.960]  because of their ideas we have to label them to shut them down as a self-defense mechanism
[03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:28.640]  against free thinking ideology because i can't talk about this stuff or i'm an obama basher
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:35.600]  or i'm criticizing or i'm supporting the republicans nope that's not how it is this is reality
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:39.600]  this is anthony gucciardi on the overdrive edition of the alex jones show we'll be back
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:44.000]  with a lot more and a special guest coming up alex jones at the end of the program joining

[03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:12.400]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we
[03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:17.440]  start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:21.920]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:26.400]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:32.080]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern
[03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:36.720]  there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:42.800]  come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for

[03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:19.280]  up next segment we've got a very special guest who's going to break down the secrets of
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:25.040]  total body cleansing and some really really free things you can do at your house that i totally
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:30.080]  agree with and i think are really powerful to feel better in a very short period of time but first
[03:24:30.080 --> 03:24:35.040]  i want to get to some news and articles and then later at the end of the show the last segment alex
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:41.200]  will be joining us with some feedback on some health stories as well but remember that company
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:50.640]  run by the ceo who decided to do this that raised the price of an age related age related it should
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:55.760]  say on all these titles by the way because it's really a food poisoning type drug that specifically
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:01.840]  used in a lot of hiv slash aids patient cases but it's age related drug he jacked up the price
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:09.360]  by five thousand five hundred percent okay it went from like twenty dollars it's an article i
[03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:16.400]  remember reading it months ago yes it was one it costs a dollar per pill to me or per tablet to make
[03:25:16.960 --> 03:25:22.320]  and he he raised the price from a thirteen fifty which is an amazing profit margin to seven hundred
[03:25:22.320 --> 03:25:28.480]  and fifty dollars a pill so it's used to treat conditions including aids related toxoplasmosis
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:32.720]  and that's what i was talking about it's it's specifically used in a lot of cases for AIDS
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:37.520]  patients but thirteen dollars and fifty cents to seven hundred and fifty dollars you might remember
[03:25:37.520 --> 03:25:44.640]  this article five thousand five hundred percent well his company touring pharmaceuticals has now
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:52.080]  lost fourteen point six million dollars this quarter the loss was made between july and the end of
[03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:56.960]  september at the next revenue reported in turing's financial report for era prim and blood pressure
[03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:02.880]  drug was five point six million he defended the losses saying it had been investing money into new drugs
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:12.080]  well i'll tell you what it's good to make money and help people it really really is it's an amazing
[03:26:12.080 --> 03:26:18.240]  thing for good people to have money and i mean good intention people we all make mistakes right
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:23.600]  there's no one that's truly good no angel out there there's no mother chorizo walking around
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:30.160]  making millions but i mean people with good intentions money is not actually inherently evil
[03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:35.440]  because in the bible we talk you know people say well money is the root of all evil no actually
[03:26:35.440 --> 03:26:44.160]  it says love of money is the root of all evil and i believe love of money can read help raise
[03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:49.040]  the hiv related drug price by five thousand five hundred percent and what happens is
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:56.480]  it's called churn and burn you can make a ton of cash up front when you do truly wicked things for
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:01.360]  cash let me just launch the cash the pharmaceutical companies do it all the time i know people that
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:05.200]  we're making three to four hundred thousand sometimes five hundred thousand dollars per month
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:11.680]  due to a pharmaceutical drug company loophole where blue cross blue shield would pay for certain
[03:27:11.680 --> 03:27:17.440]  drugs due to some weird legislation or whatever that were upwards of thirty thousand dollars
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:24.320]  per bottle insurance would cover it so doctors would be writing it out and these companies
[03:27:24.320 --> 03:27:31.680]  were making tons and tons of cash until it got shut down churn and burn the sustainable way to do it
[03:27:32.480 --> 03:27:37.680]  is to have good intentions and again we all make mistakes no one's perfect if someone says they're
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:42.080]  perfect run the other way if you're if you're talking and coming clean about something and
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:46.960]  someone says well i'm perfect i don't do anything like that i'm a great person i would never do
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:53.440]  something like that turn around say nothing say thank you and walk away and run away from that person
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:28:00.480]  and say thank you for showing me that you are a completely phony fake person just like the politicians
[03:28:00.480 --> 03:28:06.960]  that stand up there during the debates with a smile on their face and love of god and family
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:15.520]  what joker clowns what complete actors and actresses complete morons that have no truth
[03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:21.760]  in their human essence and their soul and their humanity they choose to be fake to dupe you
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:26.800]  being real is the only answer and it's the only way let's get into some more news before we hit
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:32.560]  the next segment super bug emerges in china to remind us that antibiotics won't last forever
[03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:38.240]  which is extremely true in general um this is from the washington post according to a study in the
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:43.760]  lancet infectious diseases a gene dubbed mcr one is becoming more common in bacteria found in china
[03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:49.760]  mcr one gives bacteria the ability to resist antibiotics called polymixins these harsh antibiotics
[03:28:49.760 --> 03:28:53.600]  are considered a last line of defense a treatment when bacteria have shown resistance to everything
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:59.040]  else but with mcr one in tow bacteria can thwart our most aggressive drugs and i've told you for

[03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:21.360]  gucciardi with you for the rest of the hour we've got dr. abrid group on the line and we're going
[03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:26.880]  to talk about a whole lot of things including the precedent that has been set today with the approval
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:31.600]  of genetically modified salmon for human consumption and regardless what you think
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:36.560]  about gmo is the safety whatever this is a serious precedent because it is the first time
[03:33:37.520 --> 03:33:43.120]  that an approval has been set for an animal with augmented dna that is dna that's been
[03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:49.920]  genetically modified and they're not even going to label it so this is a powerful precedent that's
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:54.320]  been set we're also going to talk about the article i just mentioned the super bug emerging in china
[03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:58.080]  that's reminding us that antibiotics won't last forever we're going to talk about some awesome
[03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:03.200]  ways you can cleanse your body and a lot of a lot of really really fun stuff and then after this
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:09.120]  alex is going to join us for his take on the whole thing at the last segment of the hour but
[03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:14.080]  dr group i want to talk to you about what you think is uh some of the most important things
[03:34:14.080 --> 03:34:19.840]  going on today and your take on this whole thing but go ahead and lead us off well uh
[03:34:19.840 --> 03:34:26.400]  regarding the salmon i mean that's just crazy we we did a show not too long ago about transgenics and
[03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:32.160]  whenever you have animals that are genetically modified i mean this has been going on darpa's
[03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:38.480]  been funding these black ops you know operations for a long time not only with animals but with
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:44.720]  humans so this is the first step where we're actually seeing this take place in some sort of an
[03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:50.080]  approval process from the government with the salmon i think it's sick but i think that the
[03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:57.120]  solution is not to buy salmon i mean you know get the word out as much as possible and coming
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:03.600]  into the holiday season this is the worst time of the year for sickness you have what we've discovered
[03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:08.000]  out there right now which i'm sure you've had a lot of callers calling in too which is with
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:13.760]  chronic respiratory infections that have been lasting for four to six weeks uh even more than
[03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:19.200]  that so we definitely know that there's something going on that's in the air around the world right
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:26.240]  now we know that Fukushima is acting up there's more radiation in the water the animals the uh
[03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:31.440]  off the coast of california they're banning crabbing uh because of the high levels of radiation
[03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:36.720]  we're seeing it from all different angles right now and at the time we're coming into the holiday
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:41.280]  season we're coming into Thanksgiving people are going to be consuming more high fructose
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:46.720]  corn syrup they're going to be consuming more processed canned foods which are going to contain
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:52.160]  all sorts of chemicals so it's a good time right now for people to really be aware of what's going
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:58.400]  on in the world and to start focusing on their own health their family's health make a commitment
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:05.920]  this holiday season to change up and use organic products for all your Thanksgiving or all your
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:10.400]  snacks and everything else that you're going to be consuming and your family's going to be consuming
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:16.960]  and not only that but people overeat and usually gain 10 to 15 pounds from Halloween to January
[03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:24.160]  so it's best if they just really look at everything that you're doing drink more water try to reduce
[03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:31.760]  the alcohol content don't go get flu shots and and vaccinations out there during this time try
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:37.360]  to reduce your stress levels and just be happy during the holiday season which is what it's
[03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:42.400]  intended to do it's really become more of a stressful scenario over the last few years than
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:49.040]  it has a relaxation period and a healthy period for people i think so too and it's amazing because
[03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:54.560]  the modern society that we've live in we live in right now this construct it feels as if
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:37:00.160]  we're always walking around with 50 backpacks full of bricks on whether it's the stress or the
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:05.360]  the the reality of reading this news i mean just look at some of these headlines you know gml
[03:37:05.360 --> 03:37:11.120]  salmon cleared for human consumption the pot smoking paris suicide bomber x wife reveals
[03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:16.880]  blood brother terrorist was a job like a jobless layabout who spent his entire time taking drugs
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:21.280]  and sleeping never went to mosque and then he went and blew himself up trying to kill people
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:26.720]  super bugs emerging isis threatens new york city a new propaganda video the us approves
[03:37:26.720 --> 03:37:33.360]  1.29 billion dollars in arm sale to saudi arabia the truth is life is stressful the truth is that
[03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:39.200]  a lot of people including me including everyone have short attention spans and we forget when
[03:37:39.200 --> 03:37:43.600]  the holiday season comes about the high fructose corn syrup we forget to drink the water we forget
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:49.840]  all of it but the sad reality is there are groups that are generating all this stuff they're creating
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:37:57.120]  high fructose corn syrup with mercury the washington post in 2007 found that one third of all processed
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:01.040]  foods and containing high fructose corn syrup were full of mercury and just as he mentioned with
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:07.520]  fukushima i've done extensive stuff on that and so has has uh dr group but i mean they said the leak
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:13.360]  wasn't that bad it was 1.5 times what they even said in the beginning and then in 2013 it was
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:19.760]  leaking even more than the first first month and the first year it's going 72 to 73 percent of it
[03:38:19.760 --> 03:38:24.880]  is dumped of the cesium right into the pacific ocean but we forget about that we don't care about
[03:38:24.880 --> 03:38:29.680]  that until it blows up again we're not going to care some of us care i know you listening care
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:35.760]  but the general population we're constantly in a struggle pushing back against these corporations
[03:38:35.760 --> 03:38:40.320]  against these establishment groups that are just shoving it all on us they're shoving it all on
[03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:47.280]  this and the point of this show you know for me and having dr group on is dumping all of that
[03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:52.240]  like a backpack full of bricks the stress that's keeping you down the hopelessness the apathy
[03:38:52.240 --> 03:38:56.240]  just all of it just dump it you can escape all of this that's why we're talking about cleansing
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:00.960]  the body take control of your health take control of your life and these are serious steps when he
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:05.360]  talks about this stuff it's not like oh yeah yeah i'll try and do that no no it's time to get out of
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:11.280]  the system because they are controlling you they are giving you poison to consume and i'm not saying
[03:39:11.280 --> 03:39:17.280]  that for effect i mean we know that if you go to the grocery store the processed foods contain real
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:22.640]  serious toxic poison and it's not it's not something that we we should laugh about these
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:26.800]  corporations don't care it's just like the guy that jacked up the age drug by five thousand five
[03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:31.440]  hundred percent there are sociopathic people not even saying it's sociopath but you know
[03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:36.320]  there are people out there that have sociopathic tendencies to just make money and hurt people
[03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:41.920]  we're against that we're standing against that doctor group i i couldn't have said it better
[03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:48.320]  you know you when you look at every single toxic chemical that's put out there from fragrances to
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:56.320]  environmental pollutants to cosmetics sunscreen pesticide residue fire retardants bug sprays
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:40:01.840]  sun you know it's just the list goes on and on and on and it's really there is solutions and that's
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:07.280]  what that's what we're all about we're all about giving people solutions to cleanse their body
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:13.280]  reactivate their body self healing mechanism and avoid as much as possible any of these chemical
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:18.160]  contaminates that that are in their environment that are exposed to at work and at home because
[03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:24.320]  you have to sleep at night you know you might be sleeping on a memory foam mattress and you're
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:29.520]  inhaling a massive amount of toxic chemicals all night long you know just little things like that
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:36.000]  putting plants inside your home but like you said spending more time with yourself instead
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:40.720]  of watching the news and watching all the fear-based and negative and negative and negative stuff
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:44.960]  because it is real easy to get wrapped up in it we're living in a negative world right now the
[03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:50.400]  earth is sick the earth is it has negative frequencies being broadcast all over it through
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:56.640]  the cell phone towers through harp the you know people say why don't you get into politics and
[03:40:56.640 --> 03:41:02.640]  be a senator and run for president sometimes and i tell them it's not you're not ever gonna create
[03:41:02.640 --> 03:41:10.480]  change in government the way it is right now what we're doing all of us the grassroots effort
[03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:17.440]  the activism that we're doing we've done more for the planet and more for the world's population
[03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:22.480]  in the last 10 years than the government has done in the history of the government it's about the
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:30.320]  people the power of the people coming together and standing up for what they believe in and not
[03:41:30.320 --> 03:41:38.320]  purchasing that's how you really affect change is to not buy the chemical laced things to call your
[03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:44.880]  senators about fluoride being in the water trying to get it out to look at the side effects of the
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:49.760]  pharmaceutical medications to not believe the psychiatrists out there that are trying to sell
[03:41:49.760 --> 03:41:57.040]  you psychiatric med medications for what's they made up as mental illness which there's no such
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:03.840]  thing as mental illness no exactly and it reminds me that's interrupt the 200 plus grocery stores
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:09.440]  i read about that aren't going to sell the gmo salmon or the numerous companies that are taking
[03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:14.960]  high-fructose corn syrup out of their products they're being forced to change and take the gmo's out
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:19.840]  because of the activism that we're trading right here and at the end of the day that's what it's
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:24.240]  all about and you said it best it's not even about politics third-party reality is here the
[03:42:24.240 --> 03:42:28.800]  political spectrum is dying once you enter the game they are the game masters you don't have
[03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:33.120]  to play the game you're outside the game you're influencing on a greater level you're not going
[03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:38.400]  to play on their chessboard that is how you lose you're actively influencing from a much greater
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:44.560]  perspective and much higher peak exactly and that's why we're actually seeing that's why
[03:42:44.560 --> 03:42:50.240]  they're running scared right now and that's why they know that change is on the horizon i mean
[03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:58.400]  think about how much just one chemical bpa there's eight million eight billion pounds of bpa produced
[03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:04.400]  a year that's more than a pound for every single person on the planet and you only need parts per
[03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:12.560]  million to create negative change in the system so just if if people were to understand that alone
[03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:19.200]  and write their senators and bring awareness through email through social media that's another good
[03:43:19.200 --> 03:43:26.560]  reason that social media is out there because one part it only takes one other person to send it to
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:30.960]  five other people and then those five people send it to another 10 people and then those 10 people
[03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:38.800]  send it to another 50 people so the thing is we're all here and most of the listeners that are out
[03:43:38.800 --> 03:43:44.400]  there that listen to alex and that are aware of these things we all know what needs to take place
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:50.960]  and we're all spreading the word on a daily basis and we've accomplished a lot of things in the last
[03:43:50.960 --> 03:43:56.560]  10 years and we're just going to continue going and continue going and continue going until each
[03:43:56.560 --> 03:44:01.920]  thing fluorides out of the water until they stop spraying chemtrails in the air until they
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:07.120]  you know start working and utilizing more natural medicine which you're starting to see because
[03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:35.120]  there's a demand patients are walking into their doctor's offices and saying hey I don't want prescription medications or what do you have that's natural that I can take and the doctors are being forced to learn about natural medicine I know because they contact me they buy my book they they want to learn what we're doing they do and it is a slow change and it is happening but right now you have a massive amount of forces at play negative forces versus positive forces absolutely
[03:44:35.120 --> 03:45:03.120]  and you know I always say feed your brain like you would your stomach you wouldn't eat spam for a week straight or like you wouldn't eat like McDonald's hamburger you know unless you're you're mentally insane for a whole week straight unless you're making a documentary where you would just feel like crap you get sick right you have to feed your brain in that same way your content consumption your media consumption you're choosing think about it like you're eating food when you go when you watch the mainstream
[03:45:03.120 --> 03:45:19.120]  media and it just talks about the wars and the famines and you're going to die and there's crime in your area you watch the crime tracker there's burglaries in your area you better be scared you know it's all just crap and then you go online and you look at the news and it's all just angles to
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:33.120]  attack you it's just angles and political correctness and losing the foundations of what makes us human and what makes us connect with each other because now you're not even allowed to talk to people on the street you're really not if you go up to someone on the street and I want to do a video about this they look at you like you're
[03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:48.120]  crazy if you say hey what's up man how are you doing they're like oh my god someone is speaking to me let alone shooting a video on the street right when we walk around and shoot videos about whatever on the street people look at us like oh my god right all of our consumption
[03:45:48.120 --> 03:46:01.120]  our brain consumption these days from the silly television shows and it's fine to watch some of this stuff but the mainstream media it's all negative crap it's like eating cheese whiz for a week straight and it's killing you and we're
[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:13.120]  not even thinking about it we're just consuming all the time while looking at stupid buzzfeed articles looking at stupid stuff you have to eat wholesome wholesome things for your brain feed your brain wholesome information listening to this program listening to solutions
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:29.120]  listening to Dr. Group right and you talk about social media that's one of my favorite ways I mean Alex's page is used huge his info wars pages use your page the gold healing center page people like Bryant McGill reaching hundreds of millions every week that's serious media consumption
[03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:42.120]  change that is literally diluting the crap put out there from the mainstream media and changing the system from the grassroots and they can't silence that and that's the best part we are winning and if people
[03:46:42.120 --> 03:46:54.120]  just start changing their media consumption their brain consumption treating it like their bodies man if we could just have the minds changed and the bodies change we'd have a revolution tomorrow anything type of group
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:47:13.120]  yeah one of the best ways to do that actually is to reverse the damage to that's done to the brain through all the chemicals and all the heavy metals and especially that the toxic halogens one of the reasons why we did survival shield and deep cleanse because you
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:29.120]  want to get that mind back to a normal state like I was talking about earlier there is no such thing as mental illness all it is is it is a toxic slew of chemicals that are creating the misfiring of the nerves in your in your mind and creating depression
[03:47:29.120 --> 03:47:42.120]  anxiety stress and all the other things that they're labeling is mental illness but yeah one of the best ways to do that the Germans and the Russians years ago they use fluoride to calcify the pineal gland to take away your connection with God so
[03:47:42.120 --> 03:47:58.120]  and your third eye to calcify it and make it hard so when you start to detoxify the body and you clean your body it's just like a kitchen that you eat cook and eat three meals a day in and you never clean up after yourself after about a week you're
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:15.120]  going to have mold and fungus and bacteria and viruses growing in there and if you walk in and breathe that in it's a disease area it's a disease state what that's what's happening with most people's bodies right now from all the chemicals and everything that they're taking in every single day and they're
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:32.120]  not cleaning the inside of their bodies so it's accumulating and accumulating and accumulating and our job is to is to educate people as to why that is I mean that that's what we spent all of our years doing research on what is the root cause of disease
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:46.120]  I don't want people walking in my office with a bunch of symptoms and I'm going to hand them a prescription medication for their headache or for their arthritis or for their diabetes or I don't even want to hand them a natural product for their diabetes or their heart disease or
[03:48:46.120 --> 03:49:02.120]  anything like that what I want to do is address the root cause of the problem and explain to them why they have diabetes why they have heart disease and what they can do to fix it once and for all and that's why the development of all the products for the
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:19.120]  infowars life and in the things that we do are not real not addressed to try to sell people a bunch of stuff and make a bunch of money yes it's great that we can support them the activism movement and educate more people but it's about really addressing
[03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:38.120]  and cleansing and eliminating and it's the solution to what we're being bombarded with it especially with the iodine is designed to D D calcify and to help cleanse the thyroid the pineal gland to bring back you have the
[03:49:38.120 --> 03:49:52.120]  not only toxic fluoride but you have bromine and chlorine and those are everywhere I mean look at the water systems and so when you have an accumulation of all these chemicals and then you have a restricted
[03:49:52.120 --> 03:50:09.120]  element that everybody needs such as iodine that is the whole purpose of getting the body back to normal by cleansing all these things by doing intestinal cleansing by doing liver and gallbladder cleansing by doing using the deep cleanse and doing real good
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:31.120]  cellular cleansing and assisting the body and in eliminating all these chemicals and toxins that are just bringing your energy levels down causing fatigue headaches I tell you what practically every single person in the United States over the age of 12 is suffering from some form of symptom on a daily
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:47.120]  basis or some health problem no it's absolutely true and you know what we're not the people raising the price of the AIDS pharmaceutical drug by 5500% from $13 to $750 a pill real products that matter that make a difference and guess what financial support is a good thing
[03:50:47.120 --> 03:51:02.120]  when it's right intentioned and it supports the movement thanks a lot we'll be right back
[03:51:02.120 --> 03:51:24.120]  and at 42 years old I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life what did I do I created extendivite a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life for over 17 years now I have made this formula available to you

[03:53:55.120 --> 03:54:23.120]  we spent over a year trying to put together something for somebody for everybody especially working with Alex and the team over here at info wars life to create a product that would focus on helping people clean environmental
[03:54:23.120 --> 03:54:37.120]  chemicals and toxins from their body and how to detox those from the system we have a lot of good products over here from the x to all of the liver cleanse products the oxy powder the winter sun I mean you name it down the line
[03:54:37.120 --> 03:54:49.120]  everything is great today though I'm really excited because this is something that you guys have the exclusive for which is a product called deep cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula
[03:54:49.120 --> 03:55:04.120]  almost like the iodine crystals we have two unique products that nobody in the world has one of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called shell is cheat and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because
[03:55:04.120 --> 03:55:18.120]  thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet and we wanted to put this stuff for a couple years but we couldn't get an organic form
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:23.120]  let's explain this stuff so good we couldn't put it out for years
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:35.120]  right so I had to actually it's kind of like the iodine crystals finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available but in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains
[03:55:35.120 --> 03:55:41.120]  thousands of years ago they found they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains
[03:55:41.120 --> 03:55:53.120]  now you're being racist against monkeys and they would pick this black substance from the mountains and so in Russia they actually it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayan and only in the summer
[03:55:53.120 --> 03:56:10.120]  and shell is cheat is actually the decomposition of seven up to seven thousand different medicinal herbs so it decomposes all these different herbs decomposing the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there and what happens in the summertime
[03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:28.120]  it's almost like an oil from yes it's high in folvic acid is high in humic acid is always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants there is some oil that is based from fossils but most of it's really a biotic but so so this is a true fossil
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:44.120]  source I mean explain it to me it is a it's really the decomposition like I said of over seven thousand different medicinal herbs and plants and it and with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains it freezes and and during the summertime and the pressures build it up
[03:56:44.120 --> 03:57:01.120]  it oozes out oozes out so it literally oozes out of the mountain rock sap it's like rock sap it's black and it's highly nutritious even in the 1980s when the Olympic athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids they found out that they were actually been given
[03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:16.120]  shellage eat because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles it's a big dose in there the second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and then what this formula is designed to do the shellage eat and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge
[03:57:16.120 --> 03:57:36.120]  all the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges so these go in they grab it and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy I mean the this is an amazing formula I wish I actually had it but because this was
[03:57:36.120 --> 03:57:48.120]  an exclusive info wars life product you're the only one in the world that has this formula now and you know there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year
[03:57:48.120 --> 03:58:02.120]  how do people take it how is it recommended that this be done just a daily daily dose yeah daily dose the instructions are on the label you know of course I kind of modified for each individual it depends on what your lifestyle is I mean
[03:58:02.120 --> 03:58:15.120]  the honestly the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment and try to identify them and start slowly reducing them but personally I'm going to probably take it every day every other day and I'll probably go with about a
[03:58:15.120 --> 03:58:36.120]  dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls and I and I live I don't expose myself to any chemicals but it's just out there in the air it's and everything well I mean I tell you what I do the I've never been a supplement person I keep it now on the kitchen table with a lazy citizen and when I just make myself take all every day I feel so much better
