[00:36.680 --> 00:41.160]  leading experts out there on the full spectrum mortgage fraud and what it means
[00:41.160 --> 00:45.720]  not just the United States but the entire globe what it means to confidence
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.660]  common law private property Randy Kelton will be joining us in studio in
[00:50.660 --> 00:56.700]  the third and fourth hour today as we go into overdrive you know I've been
[00:56.700 --> 01:00.860]  talking a lot in the last few years about Pentagon's admitted plans we knew
[01:00.860 --> 01:03.980]  about it of course before it was public and talked about it because of the
[01:03.980 --> 01:07.500]  secret training we were able to infiltrate and cover back in the mid
[01:07.500 --> 01:12.100]  and late 1990s that there was a program and an operation to shut down our
[01:12.100 --> 01:17.220]  economy bring us to our knees financially to the IMF and World Bank and of
[01:17.220 --> 01:20.900]  course to China the biggest holder of debt the Federal Reserve the second
[01:20.900 --> 01:24.340]  largest holder of debt you got to love it they're engineering the financial
[01:24.340 --> 01:28.620]  system and the collapse and they hold the second amount a large amount of our
[01:28.620 --> 01:34.460]  debt that they were preparing the society for full military occupation in the
[01:34.460 --> 01:40.900]  name of quelling social unrest that they had on record engineered the
[01:40.900 --> 01:49.420]  sociological financial national global climate to induce civil unrest and we
[01:49.420 --> 01:54.900]  wrote a story yesterday I saw the story by Paul Joseph Watson I mentioned it on
[01:54.900 --> 01:58.940]  air and I sent Paul and I am and I said this is the type of story the drudge
[01:58.940 --> 02:01.900]  report will pick up and it's not just getting picked up by the drudge report
[02:01.900 --> 02:05.140]  it's that the drudge report is a bellwether of what other media is going
[02:05.140 --> 02:09.180]  to pay attention to and no sooner had we put that article out in the previous
[02:09.180 --> 02:13.620]  articles last week about this will Americans follow French example of mass
[02:13.620 --> 02:17.660]  civil unrest the drudge report picked it up yesterday and today and guess what
[02:17.660 --> 02:25.820]  came out this morning time magazine will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war
[02:25.820 --> 02:31.460]  and here's our newest story out on today time magazine prospect of civil war in
[02:31.460 --> 02:37.820]  us doesn't seem that far-fetched meanwhile rioters rampage protesters block
[02:37.820 --> 02:43.860]  French airports as day number eight now accelerates in Sarkozy bags for calm
[02:43.860 --> 02:48.140]  here's the London Guardian headline Nicholas Sarkozy calls for calm as
[02:48.140 --> 02:56.340]  French pension protest gather pace cars burned shop windows smashed as 4,000
[02:56.340 --> 03:01.700]  petrol stations awaiting supplies on six day of French protest they say the six
[03:01.700 --> 03:04.380]  day it's actually day eight or nine depending on how you look at it but I
[03:04.380 --> 03:08.740]  guess day six or seven of shutting down the gas stations overall the millions of
[03:08.740 --> 03:12.580]  people taken to the streets from Spain to Greece to of course the epicenter
[03:12.580 --> 03:17.100]  Petrie and all over France has been going on for about a month as they're
[03:17.100 --> 03:20.700]  told we're raising your taxes cutting your pension funds and raising
[03:20.700 --> 03:24.580]  retirement age and the French you can say what you want about them as it's a
[03:24.580 --> 03:30.980]  national sport to bash them and make fun of them but the French have said look
[03:30.980 --> 03:35.180]  we paid into this socialist system and they know the vast majority of their
[03:35.180 --> 03:39.820]  tax money now goes to service on debt not to actual services and they
[03:39.820 --> 03:43.100]  understand the banks are a bunch of fraudsters and this was all done by
[03:43.100 --> 03:48.420]  design and so now the questions being asked will this happen here and got a
[03:48.420 --> 03:53.660]  big stack of political news in my politics stack right here with town
[03:53.660 --> 03:59.340]  halls getting violent getting feverish people getting angry Democrats are in
[03:59.340 --> 04:03.540]  all-out retreat right now there's a ridiculous headline that Nancy Pelosi
[04:03.540 --> 04:07.620]  isn't going to seek the speakership next year well of course she's not going
[04:07.620 --> 04:10.940]  to run for speaker the Democrats aren't going to have the house that's a foregone
[04:10.940 --> 04:16.380]  conclusion but will the Republicans get the Senate the media is in a full court
[04:16.380 --> 04:22.500]  press to regurgitate discredited ridiculous fairy tale lies about Rand
[04:22.500 --> 04:28.500]  Paul and the final disinfo against him with just a week and a half or almost
[04:28.500 --> 04:33.140]  two weeks going into the election is fake polls put out by CBS and others not
[04:33.140 --> 04:36.860]  predicted this claiming oh it's now neck and neck but the full index of polls
[04:36.860 --> 04:40.460]  show Rand Paul seven to fifteen points ahead depending on which polls seven
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.060]  eight points nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen you can find them all
[04:43.060 --> 04:46.860]  across that spectrum but it doesn't mean he's going to win because Kentucky like
[04:46.860 --> 04:52.420]  many states is famous for chicanery and election bamboozling by the whatever
[04:52.420 --> 04:55.780]  party is in power and of course the guy's running against is the attorney
[04:55.780 --> 05:00.820]  general there has lost rings he can pull it's all coming up stay with us this is
[05:00.820 --> 05:04.220]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:04.220 --> 05:08.100]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:08.100 --> 05:12.380]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.380 --> 05:16.660]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.660 --> 05:21.020]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:21.020 --> 05:25.180]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:25.180 --> 05:29.620]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.620 --> 05:33.740]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.740 --> 05:37.740]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[08:20.420 --> 08:26.220]  political news the economic news the rioting going on all over the western
[08:26.220 --> 08:31.660]  world the mainstream corporate media here saying is it coming to the shores of
[08:31.660 --> 08:36.380]  the United States will Americans get mad at having their pension funds taken
[08:36.380 --> 08:41.460]  and taxed will they get mad at their dollar being devalued that is all
[08:41.460 --> 08:44.980]  coming up and I want to just go ahead now and throw the toll-free number out
[08:44.980 --> 08:52.060]  we take a lot of calls throughout the full four hours today 1-800-259-9231
[08:52.060 --> 08:58.980]  1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air I particularly want to
[08:58.980 --> 09:03.780]  hear from military and police currently who are serving police officers or
[09:03.780 --> 09:09.340]  military or veterans I know there's been military training going back a hundred
[09:09.340 --> 09:13.220]  years for riot control we know about the bonus strikers in front of the
[09:13.220 --> 09:16.700]  White House from World War one wanting to get their bonus money they were
[09:16.700 --> 09:21.020]  promised under law being you know written down by Patton and McArthur when
[09:21.020 --> 09:25.180]  they were young colonels they got promoted for that but this is a
[09:25.180 --> 09:31.620]  systemic creeping death a quiet covert operation of massive scale to take over
[09:31.620 --> 09:35.420]  every town and city and to take over every local government and that is now
[09:35.420 --> 09:40.180]  publicly admitted we were able to decipher the intelligence information we
[09:40.180 --> 09:45.540]  had back in the mid-1990s and correctly forecast exactly what we're facing not
[09:45.540 --> 09:49.300]  just what the military is being trained to do and openly being announced now but
[09:49.300 --> 09:54.780]  what the cause and the cover trigger for that for that would be a banking
[09:54.780 --> 10:02.060]  crisis engineered by the globalist and so here we are today and it's now getting
[10:02.060 --> 10:07.620]  a lot of attention I told you last week how the reports in local news around the
[10:07.620 --> 10:10.860]  country that we boiled down and put in a prison planet comm article got a lot of
[10:10.860 --> 10:16.260]  attention nationally and even locally because reporters and talk show hosts
[10:16.260 --> 10:19.620]  could just read Paul Watson's article and see where the army admitted they're
[10:19.620 --> 10:24.420]  preparing to take over every town and city during the economic collapse and in
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.740]  the latest articles written by Paul Watson we have links to the army's own
[10:27.740 --> 10:31.660]  memorandum where they believe there is going to be a total collapse but of
[10:31.660 --> 10:34.860]  course they don't point out that their banker masters are the ones that
[10:34.860 --> 10:38.540]  engineered it the drudge report of course picked up our will Americans
[10:38.540 --> 10:43.860]  follow French example of mass civil unrest yesterday and today time magazine
[10:43.860 --> 10:50.580]  headline will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war and so I'm going to be
[10:50.580 --> 10:54.940]  detailing this throughout the next two hours and then we're going to for two
[10:54.940 --> 11:00.300]  hours look at one of the major contributing future triggers and current
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.220]  triggers for this but it just continues to unfold and that is the galactic
[11:04.220 --> 11:11.820]  sized unbelievably off the chart naked banking mortgage fraud by the big six
[11:11.820 --> 11:16.340]  any small bank trying to engage in this fraud of course their their their
[11:16.340 --> 11:20.500]  directors are hauled up before a federal grand jury and they're sent to
[11:20.500 --> 11:26.140]  prison but that is not the case by the big mega banks that have engineered this
[11:26.140 --> 11:30.580]  situation will also be looking at the latest developments headed into the
[11:30.580 --> 11:35.980]  November election or less than two weeks away as well so let's go ahead and get
[11:35.980 --> 11:40.500]  into that right now then we'll open the phones up on this subject and a lot more
[11:40.500 --> 11:48.940]  here we go will Americans follow French example of mass civil unrest or will the
[11:48.940 --> 11:55.340]  sleeping middle class continue to scratch their hind ends and watch dancing
[11:55.340 --> 12:03.020]  with the stars that's a nice headline by Paul Joseph Watson and then there's
[12:03.020 --> 12:08.940]  the I shouldn't laugh about this Watson has a little penchant for throwing things
[12:08.940 --> 12:13.580]  in like that I've told him not to but hey drudge reports picking it up he must
[12:13.580 --> 12:19.260]  know what he's doing time magazine is a related story posted up in the top of
[12:19.260 --> 12:25.780]  the article time magazine prospect of civil war in US doesn't seem that far
[12:25.780 --> 12:29.860]  fetched that's our newest article on it how will Americans react when the
[12:29.860 --> 12:33.100]  government begins to impose the same austerity measures that are causing
[12:33.100 --> 12:39.700]  riots street battles fuel blockades and other assorted chaos in France will we
[12:39.700 --> 12:46.260]  witness mass civil unrest or will the sleeping middle class continue to watch
[12:46.260 --> 12:51.060]  dancing with the stars it goes on back in June we forecast that the imminent
[12:51.060 --> 12:55.460]  onset of so-called austerity measures which in reality represent nothing more
[12:55.460 --> 13:00.620]  than an elevated phase of government run looting on the taxpayer would herald an
[13:00.620 --> 13:05.020]  age of rage leading to riots and revolutions as people react with
[13:05.020 --> 13:09.540]  fury in response to their jobs savings basic public services pensions and
[13:09.540 --> 13:13.300]  welfare money being seized by financial terrorists who caused the economic
[13:13.300 --> 13:19.700]  collapse in the first place that's what we forecast in June four months later
[13:19.700 --> 13:24.060]  and citizens of one of the most prosperous countries in the world with
[13:24.060 --> 13:27.900]  the highest standard of living have shut down France after six plus days of
[13:27.900 --> 13:31.980]  strikes and protests in response to the government plans to raise the retirement
[13:31.980 --> 13:37.500]  age from 60 to 62 and the full state pension age from 65 to 67 and they get
[13:37.500 --> 13:42.260]  away with that they'll raise it to 75 as Boehner was proposing last week John
[13:42.260 --> 13:48.340]  Boehner of Michigan undoubtedly there are two different protests occurring in
[13:48.340 --> 13:52.620]  France the more violent scenes are the work of renomab anarchist youths who
[13:52.620 --> 13:57.060]  could care less about pensions but will waste no opportunity to don black hoods
[13:57.060 --> 14:01.660]  and pointlessly smash up shop windows in demonstrations against capitalism
[14:01.660 --> 14:04.580]  of course they caught him last year in Greece mainstream news admitted the
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.500]  police dressed up like anarchist knocking out shop windows to make the
[14:07.500 --> 14:10.740]  protesters look bad but we ought to pull that back up what's not to add that to
[14:10.740 --> 14:16.100]  this article when in reality government seizure of pensions has all the
[14:16.100 --> 14:20.060]  hallmarks of a command and control socialism and nothing to do with true
[14:20.060 --> 14:25.900]  free market capitalism three youths are these youths are also more concerned
[14:25.900 --> 14:29.380]  about their welfare checks being cut but they won't garner sympathy of the
[14:29.380 --> 14:34.420]  rest of the French people by taking baseball bats to Starbucks four courts
[14:34.420 --> 14:40.220]  in mocked-up media stunts the legitimate protests and the ones that are
[14:40.220 --> 14:45.460]  generally hurt by the establishment and put the idiot anarchists to shame are
[14:45.460 --> 14:49.500]  being run by French workers truck drivers and union leaders and enjoy the
[14:49.500 --> 14:54.380]  support of around 70% some pulse say 80 plus percent of the population over a
[14:54.380 --> 14:58.520]  thousand gas stations have now run out of fuel across France with strategic
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.820]  reserves set to run out in just a few weeks flights and trains have been
[15:02.820 --> 15:06.860]  disrupted organized slowdowns of snarled highway traffic the French are
[15:06.860 --> 15:11.540]  showing Americans how it should be done but uniting peacefully to shut down an
[15:11.540 --> 15:16.260]  entire country this is genuine people power the French are sending a message
[15:16.260 --> 15:20.860]  to the establishment that they will no longer play ball until the looting stops
[15:20.860 --> 15:28.180]  and it continues will the rena momma anarchist stage similar violent riots
[15:28.180 --> 15:31.740]  in America or will the middle class embrace a much more legitimate backlash
[15:31.740 --> 15:35.420]  in the same vein of the union protesters in France with the Obama
[15:35.420 --> 15:39.140]  administration set to seize 401k pensions and turn them over to the
[15:39.140 --> 15:43.740]  Social Security Administration how long will it be before Americans stir from
[15:43.740 --> 15:47.020]  their slumber and realize that their economic future and also that of their
[15:47.020 --> 15:51.260]  children is in immediate peril when will Americans begin to understand that the
[15:51.260 --> 15:55.020]  onset of another government bailout in the form of quantitative easing to
[15:55.020 --> 15:59.740]  represents the biggest bank robbery in history just how distracted dumbed down
[15:59.740 --> 16:04.140]  fat lazy has the American middle class become to prevent them from realizing a
[16:04.140 --> 16:10.100]  threat when they see it British historian Simon scama predicts not only will
[16:10.100 --> 16:14.300]  ride spread civil unrest in America but even a potential revolution if the
[16:14.300 --> 16:18.940]  elite allow the situation to spiral out of control he notes that Obama will have
[16:18.940 --> 16:24.700]  to ditch misplaced obligations of civility and become a authoritarian
[16:24.700 --> 16:28.820]  enforcer in order to emerge successfully against the rising tide of
[16:28.820 --> 16:33.020]  constitutionalist rage that will be directed against the coming austerity
[16:33.020 --> 16:40.740]  fascism and it continues here as we documented in our article the kind of
[16:40.740 --> 16:45.380]  public spending cuts tax increases salary caps and retirement crackdowns that
[16:45.380 --> 16:49.300]  are now about to be implemented outstrip anything we've witnessed before in
[16:49.300 --> 16:53.340]  modern history a lot of it's already been implemented actually if the American
[16:53.340 --> 16:56.820]  middle-class reacts to the total bank will take total banker takeover by
[16:56.820 --> 17:01.500]  collectively scratching their hind ends and flipping the TV channel the country
[17:01.500 --> 17:05.740]  as we know it is probably gone for good however if Americans follow the example
[17:05.740 --> 17:09.220]  of the French and send a clear signal to the elite that they will refuse to
[17:09.220 --> 17:13.060]  participate in rigged game the true revolution that will restore both
[17:13.060 --> 17:19.500]  political and economic freedom and prosperity will be set in motion will
[17:19.500 --> 17:22.940]  Americans buying silver to protect their savings and guns to protect
[17:22.940 --> 17:26.900]  themselves and record numbers it seems that the message is at least getting
[17:26.900 --> 17:32.140]  through to some of the people but until we see mass walkouts blockage and other
[17:32.140 --> 17:35.780]  acts of nonviolent mass protests disobedience the establishment will
[17:35.780 --> 17:40.220]  continue to move forward with an onslaught after onslaught of financial
[17:40.220 --> 17:43.860]  pillaging numerous forecasters governments spy agencies and
[17:43.860 --> 17:47.820]  international bodies are predicting mass riots and unrest in response to the
[17:47.820 --> 17:52.420]  worsening economic picture in November of 2008 right as the economic
[17:52.420 --> 17:57.060]  implosion was unraveling the US Army War College released a white paper called
[17:57.060 --> 18:02.100]  known unknowns unconventional strategic shocks in defense strategy development
[18:02.100 --> 18:06.180]  the report warns the military must be prepared for a violent strategic
[18:06.180 --> 18:09.900]  dislocation inside the United States which will be provoked by unforeseen
[18:09.900 --> 18:14.060]  economic collapse yes unforeseen their bosses engineered it purposefully
[18:14.060 --> 18:18.860]  domestic resistance purposeful domestic resistance pervasive public health
[18:18.860 --> 18:23.660]  emergencies or loss of functioning political and legal order the widespread
[18:23.660 --> 18:27.740]  civil disobedience the document said would force the defense establishment to
[18:27.740 --> 18:34.660]  reorient priorities in extremists to defend basic domestic order and human
[18:34.660 --> 18:38.700]  security so that's the sales pitch right there oh we don't know what caused
[18:38.700 --> 18:43.620]  this collapse but the people aren't gonna like losing everything and so we're
[18:43.620 --> 18:51.540]  your only hope with basically martial law to keep you safe it goes on a
[18:51.540 --> 18:55.980]  British Ministry of Defense report struck a similar tone when it predicted
[18:55.980 --> 19:00.140]  this was three years ago that within 30 years the growing gap between the rich
[19:00.140 --> 19:04.940]  and the middle class along with the urban underclass threatening social order
[19:04.940 --> 19:10.140]  would mean the world's middle class might unite using access to knowledge
[19:10.140 --> 19:13.620]  resources and skills to shape transnational process in their own
[19:13.620 --> 19:19.260]  class interest and in the classes could become a revolutionary class again the
[19:19.260 --> 19:22.780]  middle class could become a revolutionary class and then we have some
[19:22.780 --> 19:27.580]  videos posted under that now now that's Watson's article about it yesterday
[19:27.580 --> 19:34.300]  here is time magazine today we're gonna cover this when we come back will the
[19:34.300 --> 19:41.820]  Federal Reserve cause a civil war will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war and
[19:41.820 --> 19:47.180]  then an even more detailed article than what Paul wrote yesterday dealing with
[19:47.180 --> 19:52.860]  this latest headline time magazine prospect of civil war in us doesn't seem
[19:52.860 --> 19:57.820]  that far-fetched this is a very complex issue we're gonna break it down on the

[24:03.540 --> 24:09.500]  we're back live Paul Watson has another story on today he's on fire at
[24:09.500 --> 24:16.860]  prisonplanet.com violent anarchist help French authorities crush pension
[24:16.860 --> 24:23.900]  protest pointless rioting burning of cars and smashing shop windows has shot
[24:23.900 --> 24:27.540]  the protest movement in the foot and that's the new government talking point
[24:27.540 --> 24:33.660]  and clearly we have videos of the police not arresting the thuggish youth but
[24:33.660 --> 24:38.100]  going after mainline protesters and we've caught them all over the world in
[24:38.100 --> 24:47.340]  Italy in Greece in Spain in England in Denver, Colorado in in what happened in
[24:47.340 --> 24:54.420]  Seattle in 99 up in Canada in Monobello a few years ago they just do it over and
[24:54.420 --> 24:58.220]  over and over again so here is the headline violent anarchist help
[24:58.220 --> 25:03.540]  French authorities crush pension protest and this this dovetails with
[25:03.540 --> 25:08.980]  exactly what I was about to cover we know in fact this happened to myself in
[25:08.980 --> 25:14.820]  1999 when the Fortune 500 had their meeting in Austin and there were
[25:14.820 --> 25:18.460]  clearly police dressed up like anarchists trying to start fights and we
[25:18.460 --> 25:22.580]  identified them as police and uniform police ran over and you know basically
[25:22.580 --> 25:25.780]  removed them from the crowd when I was in their face shouting at them that we
[25:25.780 --> 25:30.380]  knew that they were cops and so this is how they demonize the protest it's one
[25:30.380 --> 25:34.220]  thing to shut down the government it's another thing to burn private vehicles
[25:34.220 --> 25:41.900]  and to knock out windows of private shops in fact guys search the term Greek
[25:41.900 --> 25:49.860]  television police caught smashing shops or police caught provocaturing in
[25:49.860 --> 25:54.380]  Greece and in national television their biggest national TV network you know had
[25:54.380 --> 26:00.420]  piece after piece what last year where the police were caught dressed up
[26:00.420 --> 26:06.420]  smashing out windows smashing out car windows setting things on fire as a
[26:06.420 --> 26:10.860]  pretext and the evidence is clear that people affiliated with the police also
[26:10.860 --> 26:14.980]  shot police officers that way you get the rest of the cops against the
[26:14.980 --> 26:18.180]  protesters because the last thing you want is what's happening in Greece
[26:18.180 --> 26:23.940]  Spain France and many other nations where the police are now joining with the
[26:23.940 --> 26:27.060]  protesters because they're having their pay cut they're having their pension
[26:27.060 --> 26:31.940]  stolen I mean in France they take over 80% on average of your money and so the
[26:31.940 --> 26:35.780]  people paid for all this socialism but that's the scam with socialism it
[26:35.780 --> 26:41.460]  always gets stolen by the elites no one's gonna take your paycheck and take
[26:41.460 --> 26:45.140]  your money for decades and then give all of it back to you you'll be lucky if you
[26:45.140 --> 26:48.620]  get any of it back do you understand that it doesn't work you're better off
[26:48.620 --> 26:53.780]  keeping it for yourself investing in as you see fit but the government grows
[26:53.780 --> 27:00.100]  these giant welfare groups and then uses them as a political army to checkmate
[27:00.100 --> 27:05.540]  the working middle class and the new voracious others to where anytime
[27:05.540 --> 27:10.300]  somebody wants to cut taxes or cut welfare this mob comes out and says
[27:10.300 --> 27:16.540]  don't do it but remember the media and fake conservatives always point their
[27:16.540 --> 27:22.020]  fingers predominantly at welfare moms and people they are a tiny part of the
[27:22.020 --> 27:26.780]  overall budget in every major nation upwards of two-thirds of our
[27:26.780 --> 27:32.620]  discretionary spending now and of the overall tax money you pay goes to
[27:32.620 --> 27:37.500]  interest on the debt and who holds the debt the communist Chinese and then
[27:37.500 --> 27:42.140]  number two the private Federal Reserve that has engineered the situation but
[27:42.140 --> 27:46.380]  but here's the issue we're now at the point where it's not Alex Jones 15 years
[27:46.380 --> 27:51.060]  ago talking about the quiet slow preparations for martial law and as I
[27:51.060 --> 27:55.220]  said 15 years ago it could be next year it could be 20 years from now all we
[27:55.220 --> 27:59.620]  know is the Pentagon is admittedly federalizing everything spying on the
[27:59.620 --> 28:03.700]  citizens and getting ready for a total takeover of society and door-to-door gun
[28:03.700 --> 28:07.220]  confiscations I've been to the drills I've been to the urban warfare drills
[28:07.220 --> 28:13.100]  I've had countless videos in Alabama and Tennessee and Maryland and Florida and
[28:13.100 --> 28:17.500]  Louisiana and I've been to California and I've been to South Texas and we've
[28:17.500 --> 28:22.940]  been to Chicago this year to cover the military with foreign troops training
[28:22.940 --> 28:28.700]  to put role players who play the part of Americans in FEMA camps at the sports
[28:28.700 --> 28:31.900]  stadiums those are the relocation centers they take you there and then
[28:31.900 --> 28:35.820]  decide where to send you jaren found the article we'll put it up on screen did
[28:35.820 --> 28:39.820]  Greek anarchist agents provocateurs torch police I'm sorry I thought you'd
[28:39.820 --> 28:44.660]  found the Greek stuff if you have to call Watson he's answering when you
[28:44.660 --> 28:48.260]  dial him on this phone with the phone number that's the first number in it
[28:48.260 --> 28:52.660]  and because I want that for the next segment he can find it because he wrote
[28:52.660 --> 28:56.780]  articles about it but the search would be again something like Greek police
[28:56.780 --> 29:02.300]  caught vandalizing businesses and cars and then there's Greek television
[29:02.300 --> 29:09.020]  showing police in uniforms directing groups of people in black masks to do
[29:09.020 --> 29:14.860]  this and it came out they were police that is key to show people okay I'm now
[29:14.860 --> 29:18.740]  ranting the point is where this is a short segment long segment coming up
[29:18.740 --> 29:22.740]  when we come back from break I'm gonna get into this article and then your
[29:22.740 --> 29:28.820]  phone calls time magazine will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war and
[29:28.820 --> 29:33.300]  we have the story that really kicked off this debate yesterday from prison
[29:33.300 --> 29:38.860]  planet calm will Americans follow French example of mass civil unrest so why
[29:38.860 --> 29:44.060]  is time magazine hyping civil war over the private Federal Reserve we'll break
[29:44.060 --> 29:47.860]  that down and give you my take on it and get your take on it on the other side

[33:01.260 --> 33:11.660]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:15.460 --> 33:22.180]  Bob, Mark, Matt, Joel, Austin your calls are all coming up the toll-free
[33:22.180 --> 33:29.460]  number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 so we're now at that point we're now
[33:29.460 --> 33:33.700]  descending into the global tyranny everything we told you was brought off
[33:33.700 --> 33:38.420]  their own documents so of course it's happened exactly as we told you it wasn't
[33:38.420 --> 33:41.700]  any big secret it's just the mainstream media wouldn't cover it for decades as
[33:41.700 --> 33:47.500]  patriots worldwide as lovers of freedom and dignity tried to warn the general
[33:47.500 --> 33:52.060]  public we were laughed at but because we planted the seeds now we have
[33:52.060 --> 33:55.980]  incredible credibility and people are listening to us open world government's
[33:55.980 --> 33:59.820]  been announced run by the very banks that have engineered the crisis they are
[33:59.820 --> 34:04.300]  hiring provocateurs worldwide to burn down buildings to attack vehicles to
[34:04.300 --> 34:09.740]  attack shops as a way to demonize normal protest so microwave guns sound
[34:09.740 --> 34:14.700]  cannons and other weaponry can be used against the population now the globalist
[34:14.700 --> 34:18.780]  no people are going to get angry about this they are going to come in with
[34:18.780 --> 34:22.580]  provocateurs to demonize everybody they are no doubt as this gets worse and
[34:22.580 --> 34:26.820]  worse for the next few years going to stage terror events to demonize all
[34:26.820 --> 34:32.900]  opposition to this but it's not going to work because we have been on the job
[34:32.900 --> 34:39.300]  exposing their system of control but think how far we've come that now there
[34:39.300 --> 34:45.340]  are scores of news articles today today that sound like it was written by
[34:45.340 --> 34:50.020]  prisonplanet.com or info wars.com that sound like Steve Watson Paul Watson
[34:50.020 --> 34:57.820]  Kurt Nemo Aaron Dykes or our other great writers it's really happening and more
[34:57.820 --> 35:02.020]  and more Americans are having to face the facts more and more French more and
[35:02.020 --> 35:06.700]  more Brits more and more Australians more and more Russians we are all under
[35:06.700 --> 35:10.460]  the same global corporate government they have different management teams
[35:10.460 --> 35:14.140]  over each country the management teams fight with each other at certain levels
[35:14.140 --> 35:19.220]  China is now announcing they're going to cut off all major key rare minerals that
[35:19.220 --> 35:23.900]  are used in our semiconductor industries and computer development they are the
[35:23.900 --> 35:28.300]  majority holder of the debt they were set up for this to be the Chinese
[35:28.300 --> 35:32.900]  century this was all pre-deployed they were given the Panama Canal they were
[35:32.900 --> 35:35.820]  given the old military bases in the Caribbean they were given the Long
[35:35.820 --> 35:39.660]  Beach Naval facility they were given hundreds of other of our ports in many
[35:39.660 --> 35:44.980]  cases for free to encircle us because the global crime syndicate the bankers
[35:44.980 --> 35:48.260]  that run our military that run our police that run our federal government
[35:48.260 --> 35:53.740]  they also are in league with the communist Chinese against the American
[35:53.740 --> 35:58.900]  people that doesn't mean the people of China are bad but the but the leadership
[35:58.900 --> 36:05.340]  of the globe has allied the the global corporate Fortune 100 banking cartel has
[36:05.340 --> 36:12.140]  allied itself with the communist Chinese as the industrial and military muscle
[36:12.140 --> 36:17.500]  the US funds the global government then tax incentives are put in place to move
[36:17.500 --> 36:21.860]  our jobs overseas with NAFTA and GATT and globalism and now as we go into
[36:21.860 --> 36:26.060]  depression we are being set up to be fully imploded so there's an even bigger
[36:26.060 --> 36:31.340]  fire fire sale to take over what's left of our society and fully re-engineer our
[36:31.340 --> 36:39.300]  society and make us totally dependent on the globalist and I was on man cow big
[36:39.300 --> 36:43.140]  syndicated radio show it's on WABC you name it it's on hundreds of stations
[36:43.140 --> 36:47.700]  around the country and he was telling me on the show oh it's so wonderful I was
[36:47.700 --> 36:52.460]  at a banquet last night for friends of the IDF and he's like you know we know
[36:52.460 --> 36:56.100]  our government's corrupt but what about Israel let me give me a break all these
[36:56.100 --> 37:00.940]  nations are run by crooks okay and they feed on every population the Chinese
[37:00.940 --> 37:05.140]  government's bad the Chinese people aren't bad by and large the Israeli
[37:05.140 --> 37:09.260]  government totally corrupt are the Israeli people bad by and large no the
[37:09.260 --> 37:13.180]  Saudi Arabians totally corrupt and decanted the leadership are the average
[37:13.180 --> 37:18.860]  Saudis bad no the American people aren't bad on average is our government
[37:18.860 --> 37:22.580]  totally run by crooks at the highest levels yes that top strata completely
[37:22.580 --> 37:27.300]  criminal and when people who aren't crooks try to get into the power structure
[37:27.300 --> 37:30.820]  like Rand Paul they come out and say he's kidnapping women I mean you know
[37:30.820 --> 37:34.460]  this is what they do when they start saying somebody's kidnapping women even
[37:34.460 --> 37:37.740]  when it's admitted to not be true oh they're not a medical doctor when it's
[37:37.740 --> 37:42.140]  admitted to not be true or that you know he's got racist at his tea parties and
[37:42.140 --> 37:44.980]  they've caught these people being Democratic Party operatives on record
[37:44.980 --> 37:49.660]  they don't care they still go with it when somebody's under full attack you
[37:49.660 --> 37:54.940]  know they're good but but continuing here then man cow goes on to say yeah
[37:54.940 --> 37:59.700]  isn't Israel cool how they launched the worm attack on the Iranians and I said
[37:59.700 --> 38:04.420]  man cow that thing had the secret codes to the core operating system that nobody's
[38:04.420 --> 38:11.100]  got except for Microsoft to Microsoft and I said you notice they're now
[38:11.100 --> 38:15.300]  announcing that they're going to use this new mega worm as a pretext to pass
[38:15.300 --> 38:19.500]  homeland security takeover the internet and the Obama kill switch known as
[38:19.500 --> 38:23.260]  cybersecurity started under Bush and he said oh actually at the banquet they
[38:23.260 --> 38:26.300]  were saying that that they'd have to take over the internet to protect it from
[38:26.300 --> 38:31.180]  the worm that Israel basically admits they created and Israel's just as
[38:31.180 --> 38:34.620]  complicit but you better believe our own government's involved in it as well and
[38:34.620 --> 38:41.260]  so is Microsoft so so this is an example of industrial cyber false flag attack
[38:41.260 --> 38:46.180]  out in the open no debate out in the open that the West has launched this
[38:46.180 --> 38:51.300]  attack it's ultra sophisticated against Iran and that if it blows back to the
[38:51.300 --> 38:54.100]  US and you know they've got the fixes for it but they'll never tell you that
[38:54.100 --> 38:58.180]  they've got the fixes for their systems their key infrastructure if it blows
[38:58.180 --> 39:03.420]  back which it looks like it's starting to do with this mega high-tech 21st
[39:03.420 --> 39:08.140]  century super worm then the government says we need to take over web freedom
[39:08.140 --> 39:12.420]  and control everything you're doing to protect you from a worm that we created
[39:12.420 --> 39:17.500]  I mean that's false flag out in the open just like the banks engineering the
[39:17.500 --> 39:21.500]  financial collapse on record came out and the emails from Goldman Sachs and
[39:21.500 --> 39:25.300]  the rest of it and then their solution is give them more power I mean I mean this
[39:25.300 --> 39:32.580]  is so bald face this is so naked this is so open uncloked this is so in your
[39:32.580 --> 39:42.100]  face this is so inside job out in the open and I know I'm ranting it's just do
[39:42.100 --> 39:46.060]  you know where all this leads it does lead to total decade-long depression
[39:46.060 --> 39:52.860]  collapse of society by design I mean the economy the so-called stimulus is just
[39:52.860 --> 39:56.380]  to enrich the banks the bailouts are to enrich the insiders and now that's
[39:56.380 --> 39:58.980]  running out and now they've announced they're gonna hyperinflate the currency
[39:58.980 --> 40:04.140]  that'll destroy any savings you've gotten 401ks you name it stocks bonds you
[40:04.140 --> 40:08.220]  know I mean this is on this is unspeakable and the globalist are going
[40:08.220 --> 40:11.220]  for broke they're bringing in an authoritarian system I read to you
[40:11.220 --> 40:16.220]  mainstream news articles saying Obama may need to implement total authoritarian
[40:16.220 --> 40:20.500]  control to save us they're now pitching that oh you yuppies want to keep some of
[40:20.500 --> 40:24.540]  your pension fund let us take control of it and let us have basically martial
[40:24.540 --> 40:28.980]  law for your security or things are gonna get worse and then you give in to
[40:28.980 --> 40:32.860]  them hoping things are gonna get better and then they make the crisis even
[40:32.860 --> 40:40.820]  worse and they say give us more control and we'll make it better it's just
[40:40.820 --> 40:46.700]  exhausting it's totally exhausting to know the truth and and to realize how
[40:46.700 --> 40:53.020]  horrible it is it really does give me a headache okay let me go over this
[40:53.020 --> 40:58.940]  report so so now here it is out in the open time magazine oh that Alex Jones
[40:58.940 --> 41:02.420]  says they're gonna collapse the economy and that there's gonna be a rebellion
[41:02.420 --> 41:05.060]  against the Federal Reserve as people learn that it's the real government
[41:05.060 --> 41:08.460]  illegitimately running things into the ground for their own consolidation of
[41:08.460 --> 41:11.500]  power oh that guy's crazy he says they're training troops beyond the
[41:11.500 --> 41:15.260]  streets of America now it's all over the news they didn't just build this
[41:15.260 --> 41:18.860]  domestic army overnight they didn't just put in threat fusion centers overnight
[41:18.860 --> 41:22.100]  they didn't just put up face scanning and license plate reading cameras overnight
[41:22.100 --> 41:25.660]  they didn't just federalize your public school and put biometrics in to train
[41:25.660 --> 41:29.060]  your kids for casual society overnight they didn't just gear up for force
[41:29.060 --> 41:32.940]  inoculations overnight they didn't just put sodium fluoride in the water
[41:32.940 --> 41:39.020]  overnight this is all part of an overall scientific dictatorship now
[41:39.020 --> 41:43.580]  continuing will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war what is the most
[41:43.580 --> 41:50.140]  likely cause of civil unrest immigration gay marriage abortion the result of
[41:50.140 --> 41:57.420]  election day the mosque around zero no try the Federal Reserve November 3rd is
[41:57.420 --> 42:00.700]  when the Federal Reserve's next policy committee meeting ends and if you thought
[42:00.700 --> 42:04.180]  this was just another boring money meeting you would be wrong it could be
[42:04.180 --> 42:07.740]  the most important meeting in Fed history maybe the US central bank is
[42:07.740 --> 42:12.580]  expected to announce in the next move to boost the faltering economic recovery
[42:12.580 --> 42:16.860]  there's the lie oh they want to fix it all they want to help you in their next
[42:16.860 --> 42:21.980]  move to try to fix the faltering economy and recovery to say that there has
[42:21.980 --> 42:25.380]  been considerable debate and anxiety among Fed watchers about what the
[42:25.380 --> 42:30.660]  central bank should do would be an understatement chairman Ben Bernanke has
[42:30.660 --> 42:34.460]  indicated in recent speeches that the central bank plans to try to drive down
[42:34.460 --> 42:39.380]  already low interest rates by buying up long-term bonds a number of people both
[42:39.380 --> 42:44.060]  inside the Fed and out believe that this is the wrong move but one website
[42:44.060 --> 42:50.540]  seems to believe that Ben's plan might actually lead to armed conflict and I
[42:50.540 --> 42:53.660]  didn't click on that link we you guys click on that link there in the second
[42:53.660 --> 42:56.780]  paragraph and see what website they're talking about they're talking about zero
[42:56.780 --> 43:01.060]  hedge last week the blog zero hedge wrote paraphrasing a top economic
[43:01.060 --> 43:05.180]  forecaster David Rosenberg that it believes the Fed's plan is not only
[43:05.180 --> 43:10.460]  moronic but positions us solely one step closer to civil war if not worse we
[43:10.460 --> 43:16.460]  just read British economist saying the same thing I'm not sure what if not
[43:16.460 --> 43:21.060]  worse means is supposed to mean if not worse than civil war but with the Tea
[43:21.060 --> 43:24.740]  Party gaining followers the idea of civil war over economic issues doesn't
[43:24.740 --> 43:28.420]  seem that far-fetched these days and Ron Paul definitely thinks the Fed should
[43:28.420 --> 43:33.540]  be ended in times recent cover story on the militia movement many said these
[43:33.540 --> 43:38.220]  groups are powder kegs looking for a catalyst oh so see it's not the bankers
[43:38.220 --> 43:42.900]  fault doing this to us it's the militias and its Tea Parties and its gun owners
[43:42.900 --> 43:47.620]  they are the threats see but don't worry the Army's waiting and been quietly
[43:47.620 --> 43:54.860]  training for that they'll make sure the bankers can really take over so why not
[43:54.860 --> 43:59.460]  a Fed policy committing meeting still I'm not convinced we're headed towards Fed
[43:59.460 --> 44:03.820]  Mageddon that being said the Fed's early November meeting is an important one
[44:03.820 --> 44:07.780]  here's why usually there is generally a consensus about what the Federal Reserve
[44:07.780 --> 44:11.660]  should do when the economy is weak the Fed cuts short-term interest rates to
[44:11.660 --> 44:15.820]  spur borrowing economic activity when the economy is strong and inflation is
[44:15.820 --> 44:19.300]  rising it does the opposite but nearly two years after the Fed cut short-term
[44:19.300 --> 44:23.580]  interest rates basically to zero well for the banks at zero for you it's 30%
[44:23.580 --> 44:28.340]  more and more economists are questioning whether the US central bank is making the
[44:28.340 --> 44:31.140]  right moves it's making the right moves to destroy the economy and consolidate
[44:31.140 --> 44:35.060]  power and hyperinflate the currency I mean right move for them record bonuses
[44:35.060 --> 44:39.780]  stock market down banks up that was the Bloomberg headline yesterday the economy
[44:39.780 --> 44:44.660]  is still very weak unemployment seems stubbornly stuck near 10% how about 22
[44:44.660 --> 44:51.100]  time magazine the problem is the Fed only directs short-term interest rates
[44:51.100 --> 44:54.660]  and they are already about as close to zero as you can go that's why Bember
[44:54.660 --> 44:58.380]  Nacky has been recently talking about something called quantitative easing that's
[44:58.380 --> 45:02.340]  when they monetize the debt that's when the Fed basically creates money to buy
[45:02.340 --> 45:06.020]  the long-term bonds that it does directly doesn't directly control and
[45:06.020 --> 45:10.220]  drive down those interest rates as well that should further reduce the cost of
[45:10.220 --> 45:13.580]  borrowing for large companies and homeowners uh-uh the banks aren't
[45:13.580 --> 45:18.380]  loaned some people are calling it QE2 because the Fed made a similar move
[45:18.380 --> 45:22.620]  during the height of the financial crisis when it bought mortgage bonds not
[45:22.620 --> 45:26.820]  everybody agrees with this move in fact a number of presidents of regional Fed
[45:26.820 --> 45:30.500]  banks not all of which get to vote on Fed policy meetings have recently come
[45:30.500 --> 45:34.060]  out against Bernanke's plans some say it sets bad policy others think it will
[45:34.060 --> 45:41.700]  stoke inflation which might be the point well yeah the Fed said they want to use
[45:41.700 --> 45:46.540]  inflation to pay off the debt few though have warned of armed conflict here's how
[45:46.540 --> 45:51.220]  zero heads justifies its prediction of how the feds November 3rd meeting will
[45:51.220 --> 45:56.260]  lead to violence and they have a link to that and it goes on in a very real sense
[45:56.260 --> 46:00.460]  Bernanke is throwing granny and grandpa down the stairs on purpose he is
[46:00.460 --> 46:04.140]  literally threatening those at the lower end of the economic strata along with
[46:04.140 --> 46:10.460]  all who are retired with starvation and death and in just and in a just nation
[46:10.460 --> 46:15.700]  where the rule of law controlled instead of being abused by kleptocrats that's
[46:15.700 --> 46:20.780]  thieving politicians he would be facing charges of seditious conspiracy as his
[46:20.780 --> 46:25.060]  policies will inevitably lead the destruction of our republic I agree
[46:25.060 --> 46:30.180]  okay the idea that Bernanke will kill large swaths of low-income neighborhoods
[46:30.180 --> 46:35.100]  or Florida by his plan to further lower interest rates is a little ridiculous
[46:35.100 --> 46:40.100]  hyperinflation won't hurt people already on the verge of but of starving you
[46:40.100 --> 46:43.780]  mean you don't know about that time magazine but there is a point in zero
[46:43.780 --> 46:50.620]  hedges craze lower rates do tend to favor borrowers over savers and the largest
[46:50.620 --> 46:54.140]  borrowers in the country are banks speculators and large corporations yeah
[46:54.140 --> 46:57.020]  they get it for close to zero the largest spenders in the country though
[46:57.020 --> 47:01.300]  tend to be individuals consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy and the vast
[47:01.300 --> 47:04.820]  majority of consumers are on the low end of income scale so I think it's a
[47:04.820 --> 47:09.060]  valid question to ask whether the feds desire to drive down interest rates at
[47:09.060 --> 47:16.300]  all cost and it goes on companies are already borrowing at low rates they are
[47:16.300 --> 47:21.860]  just not spending that being said civil war probably not it is a gross
[47:21.860 --> 47:27.700]  exaggeration says Alan Meltzer who is a top Fed historian at Carnegie Mellon I
[47:27.700 --> 47:33.820]  cannot recall ever learning about riots or civil war even when the Fed made
[47:33.820 --> 47:38.620]  other mistakes not a mistake when I call David Rosenberg he was traveling and
[47:38.620 --> 47:42.060]  couldn't talk but he did send me a quick email to stress that he never ever
[47:42.060 --> 47:46.980]  suggested that any moves the Fed makes will lead to militia uprising no he
[47:46.980 --> 47:53.460]  talked about protesting and and disintegration of society some smart
[47:53.460 --> 47:58.580]  people though including Metzler it appears and Rosenberg do think the path
[47:58.580 --> 48:02.460]  of quantitative easing that the Fed looks likely to embark on is the wrong
[48:02.460 --> 48:07.420]  move John Taylor a top Fed scholar at Stanford says eventually you will have
[48:07.420 --> 48:12.620]  to pull the support out and when you do it a year from now and when the economy
[48:12.620 --> 48:17.980]  is recovering he thinks it would could be quantitatively disruptive and quite
[48:17.980 --> 48:22.620]  disruptive so even if you don't double dip now we're been we've never left the
[48:22.620 --> 48:26.420]  depths this is all just baloney you might double dip then and even if you

[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.300]  buddy hey Alex about six weeks ago on your show you spontaneously prayed a
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.900]  prayer of repentance do you remember that yes I said we need to pray to God
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.500]  that for all of us have been corrupt and decadent and mindless and we need to
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.100]  get ourselves right with God because folks this is just the beginning
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.380]  everything you're saying you in particular at that time pray to prayer
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:43.060]  for the abominable sin of abortion repenting against that basically and I
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:47.180]  just wanted you to know Alex that your sincere and heartfelt prayer of
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.820]  repentance inspired me to begin a movement of the true church of God to
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:57.020]  publicly and sincerely repent and to our God for the sins of America that is the
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:01.100]  sense of commission and the sense of omission this is what Almighty God
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.540]  expects and requires of his true church in America and until his true church
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:10.100]  truly repents for the multitude of abominable sins of the evil doers and
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.940]  his own sense of omission and not standing up combating and resisting the
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:19.700]  flood of evil which has come into our country God's mighty hand of protection
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.980]  and guidance will not come well I mean I mean if you know and I agree with you
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.300]  we don't believe in God if you rationalize killing 50 plus million babies
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.220]  and saying they're not human well then of course Bill Gates is going to come out
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.700]  and say kill old people I mean of course they're gonna have Newsweek saying the
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.820]  case for killing granny abortion comes from the modern eugenics movement they
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.580]  admit it and now Scientific American says more abortions more kill more babies
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:50.220]  it's for the earth this is their this is their religion of anti-human okay they
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:55.180]  come to kill steal and destroy and and and we all need to repent for not doing
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.940]  more to stop this evil but of course you know more evil is going to come if we
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.660]  lie to ourselves by the way women it doubles your
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:07.140]  cancer cervical and uterine and ovarian cancer could just search that term we'll
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:11.220]  get mainstream sign of it reports you have one abortion it doubles your
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.540]  chances of cancer and it affects breast as well because it manipulates the
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.060]  hormones but not it doesn't quite double it it's around you put the statistics
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:23.780]  puts around 20% increase each abortion you get is a death sentence for yourself
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:31.140]  now they don't tell you that see if the baby needs to be to die your body knows
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.300]  that and turns the lights out and it's a sad thing but your body knows what to do
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:40.900]  99% of the time okay but when you go in there and have them destroy a new life
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:47.380]  in you and cut that whole process off the body basically hits a self-destruct
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.300]  button and the countdown to your early death has begun and I'm I'm sorry for
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.620]  women that to tell you this but all the numbers show you might as well drink
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:58.020]  Jack Daniels every day and smoke two packs of Marlboro Reds because it's a
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.980]  lot better for you to do that than to kill babies I mean your body says well
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:07.420]  this doesn't make sense and it fries all your hormonal connections you know the
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.820]  endric and channels everything but I'm we're going to break but give us 30

[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.700]  absolutely right and we deserve everything we're getting for the
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:42.620]  decadence we've put on ourselves but luckily for us we have a forgiving God
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.980]  who will if we repent to him he'll take us back into his arms and hopefully
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.740]  bless you know Matt we don't meant Matt we don't screen calls unless I have a
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:55.020]  special guest on it's on a certain topic or I ever you know once a month I'll
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.060]  say only military callers are only doctors if it's on a specific issue or
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:04.100]  only veterans who are exposed to DU but we didn't screen your calls we just
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.020]  ask where you were calling from and notice the last three callers are
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:13.500]  bringing up repentance and I find that interesting don't you it's where we're
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.180]  staring at that is almost the last hope that we have but I did have a point I
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:22.860]  wanted to bring up to you I don't know if you're aware here in Florida we have a
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:29.420]  media cover-up an actual manipulation of the elections going on here in the US
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.540]  Senate race you would think we only have three people running for senator
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:38.340]  there's actually nine with one of them being a libertarian candidate that has
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:44.020]  been excluded from every debate and we've even protested at the locations
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.340]  where they were holding them well if people want reform that's one of the
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.260]  big ones is to demand that all the major candidates you know be allowed in the
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.180]  debates and that people need to stop voting for who they think the winner is
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:02.420]  well the lesser of two evils all vote no vote for who stands on principle and
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:09.020]  you know we in their explanation for him not being incorporated in the debates
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:14.060]  is that he's not polling above 10% but when you look at the polls they only
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.940]  list the three main candidates the independent Democrat and Republican and
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.740]  then give a fourth choice as other he's not even included on the poll to them
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:27.100]  look at the poll and then say okay you can participate in the debate most of
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:32.100]  the real polls have been showing him at about 15% is and you can see where we've
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:37.260]  protested and been met by armed police officers and security guards at the
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:45.500]  locations at SNI T as in Tom KER2010.com you can find the video of how
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.740]  we've protested every debate they've not let us in they've actually held us you
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.780]  know from even getting near the the property and I just wanted to bring that
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.620]  to people in Florida's attention and to your attention that the media is
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:03.540]  manipulating the elections they're not letting you know true citizens that are
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.860]  trying to run and change things you know and because he's the third party
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.820]  libertarian you know he's not allowed to participate in the in the debates and
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:15.900]  everything listen I appreciate your call very interesting points Matt I'm gonna
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:22.260]  go to Joel Austin I'm gonna go to Candace I'm gonna go to Roger and others
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.980]  that are holding but I wanted to do a quick note because I was up late last
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.340]  night and I was going through my email and I was going through you know
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:35.220]  comments and things scanning for news tips and I don't normally respond to
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.980]  stuff like this because every time you respond people say oh I just want you
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.700]  to respond and then you respond a hundred times and then people just want
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.340]  attention and they want you to respond respond respond respond but this guy
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.620]  sounded a little bit more you know friendly and reasonable and I only
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.420]  watched part of it because I was so busy and had to move on and a lot of times I
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.820]  don't respond to this type of stuff because it's so ridiculous I know I'm
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.300]  good I know I'm real look at the fruits of what this radio show has done you
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.380]  will know them by their works and it doesn't matter even if I was a bad guy
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.620]  the issues we're covering are real what are you going to do about hyperinflation
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.380]  at the feds announcing they're gonna do what are you going to do about the fact
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.900]  that they're openly announcing putting troops on the streets to control the
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.380]  American people they told you it was for Al Qaeda what are we gonna do about them
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.540]  pushing the deadly h1n1 flu shot combined with the seasonal flu again you
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:32.540]  know I stay on issue I stay on topic but this is an example of things being
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.020]  hidden in plain view and folks not being able to understand what it is so I want
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:43.180]  to put the info wars money bomb comm website up on prison planet dot TV this
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:47.780]  guy who even interviewed before he's an author put a video out asking me to
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:52.300]  respond to what this is an info wars money bomb calm well what this is is a 30
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.180]  second conversation with Phil our graphics guy we've got two graphics
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:00.500]  people and he said about two months ago what type of money bomb website and I
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.860]  said I want an American flag background with a an American flag motif with a
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:12.140]  radio tower on it and so he went to clip art on Google you know free public
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.020]  images and he said what radio towers do you like I said I like that old 40s
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:21.260]  design and I said as the money comes in instead of having a thermometer like we
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:26.060]  had last time it'll be a radio tower and that's what he made now now put it back
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:31.860]  on screen okay and I saw this video with like 5,000 views going gets the proof
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.980]  he's Illuminati saying that's a pyramid that is not a pyramid that is a radio
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:41.940]  tower then they say what are the lightning bolts that's the radio tower
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.820]  symbols a tower with waves coming out of it I'm a radio hose come on that's not
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.780]  a pyramid then they say what's the star it's the lone star of Texas now I didn't
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.860]  design that part I said a stars and stripes motif you got blue you red
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:01.300]  white and blues the colors you got you know straight up stars on the blue and
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:05.500]  you got a star in the middle okay now that's what that is that's what that is
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.420]  that is not a pyramid that is not Illuminati that is not New World Order
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:13.500]  give me a stinking break and oh here's another question I get about this and
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:17.860]  I'm going back to your calls go to prisonplanet.com and just go to the top
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:24.020]  I asked Janae our great graphics lady she lives out in California go over to
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.500]  the side actually I don't know where that logo is now somewhere oh there it is
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.020]  there it is on the right hand corner see the blue prisonplanet.tv banner I
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:38.280]  get emails all the time saying that's a swastika or that's an occult symbol
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:46.620]  that's PP prisonplanet PP PP okay that's what that is I mean people don't know
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.140]  what a radio tower is they don't know what two P's are and another thing the
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.500]  globalists create similar symbols because they're archetypal symbols that
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.700]  communicate with us at our deepest levels obviously a pinwheel or a flower
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:05.620]  or a Sun symbol is powerful and evocative those are our symbols the
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:11.740]  globalists just use archetypal symbols to control people so I I get I say give
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.540]  me logos they send me 10 15 different ideas and I literally spend 10 seconds
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:21.820]  and go I like that one or I say give me an American flag background and a radio
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.820]  tower because you know feels like you want to have a thermometer like last
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.340]  year with the money bomb and I said no everybody uses a thermometer let's have
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:34.580]  a radio tower and you know as them as the donations go up it'll show that we're
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.860]  gonna be able to transmit out then the money stopped at 400,000 I saw comments
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:44.300]  on there I was reading these marveling at it put it back up thank you on
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:51.060]  Friday the money stopped at at 400,000 100,000 short and so then they said look
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:57.540]  it made a capstone on the pyramid I mean it just there's no end to this that's a
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:03.020]  radio tower and no one got that it was a radio tower it's a radio tower from
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:08.180]  clip art it's the American flag look at the stripes I guess you could argue it's
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:14.140]  a cultic I guess everything is oh in fact Phil I wasn't gonna cover this because
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.420]  I thought about it last night I just remembered it while the caller was
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.180]  talking I remember you showing me different towers asking which one I
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.660]  wanted oh that's the other thing they think those are upside down crosses in
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.500]  there and pentagrams so will you go search the original clip art you got
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.180]  that from and even we'll put it on screen and show people when you find it
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:36.340]  you drew that towel okay well I saw similar ones oh so you are the agent
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:42.660]  you are in here you we oh my gosh we it Phil is so evil all right there you go
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.700]  and infiltrator I'm joking Phil I remember show me different towers I'm
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:50.660]  like I like this one I like that one but the point is so there you have it
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:55.460]  ladies and gentlemen pure absolute proof of our evil no it's not a pyramid it's
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:01.340]  a radio tower and the symbol is it's broadcasting across the world yeah show
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:05.140]  some more of these devil towers look yeah click on that black one over there
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:09.500]  on the right hand corner it's a good one oh look it has Nazi symbols everyone
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.980]  has Nazi symbols on their towers no the symbol of electricity coming out of a
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:19.340]  tower has always been the symbol for electricity it's always been the symbol
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.900]  for broadcasting click on that one that's that's somebody else's I guess
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.100]  that's what you're saying you designed it off of it just wasn't big enough so so
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:32.060]  so Phil took that it wasn't a big enough image so he remade it and oh my gosh you
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:37.420]  could say there's crosses on it and an all-seeing eye at the top and look
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.740]  Nazi lightning bolts it's the print no it's the symbol of a radio tower how
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:47.700]  could anyone look at this and here's the other issue I've now responded to it
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.820]  which I don't care I don't mind more fake controversy actually just sends us
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:55.340]  more listeners that's God's little secret all the false attacks all the
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.020]  misunderstandings all the COINTELPRO all the jealousy I'm not saying this guy's
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:03.900]  like that it only listen we're completely out of everybody else's league
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.540]  we're in the same league in overall reaching numbers of people as Glenn Beck
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.940]  okay but we are truly alternative media and people know that so there is just
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:18.780]  outrageous just complete jealousy I was also reading the comments last night
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:22.460]  while I was watching the video or listening to it and they were saying
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.500]  why hasn't he responded why hasn't it was just over why hasn't he responded
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.260]  yet you're lucky I even happen to see it there are probably a thousand YouTube
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.660]  videos a day conservatively about Alex Jones separate from what we do
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:38.580]  literally if you go search YouTube for how many Alex Jones movies it's
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:42.340]  something like 55 million I mean I forget the number last time I searched it
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.940]  you know searches that come up for it I mean you think but but luckily I happen
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:52.740]  to see this and it's like why hasn't he responded oh my god yeah that's why I
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:57.740]  exposed skull and bones Bohemian Grove but but let's just say I was Illuminati

[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.180]  of civil war doesn't seem that far-fetched in the US they are really
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:17.900]  hyping this they've been gearing up to crush a civil war that's their plan so
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.140]  the question is how do we take our country back without that happening we
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.820]  peacefully take the legislatures the towns the counties back we take the
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:28.660]  congress back we have criminal investigations of the bankers we expose
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.860]  them and we continue to expose provocateurs and stage terror that's
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.380]  one way to do it that's the basic solution right there Joel and PA then
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:42.620]  Austin Roger mortis and others Joel you're on the year hey I'm a long-time
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.460]  listener and full-time info warrior it's been a few months since I last called in
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:52.340]  I just got one comment and one question go ahead I see a lot of people who are
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:56.700]  awake and trying to awaken others come down with battle fatigue in the info
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.020]  war they get discouraged because they can't seem to get through to some people
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.900]  they start to get pessimistic move on move on don't waste your time with
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.460]  laughing zombies plant the seed move on yeah they get this defeatist attitude
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:12.260]  like the globalists are invincible but we got to stay optimistic and look at all
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:16.860]  the victories we're having I mean as we all know there's a huge global awakening
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.980]  taking place everywhere and people are starting to resist this oppression and
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:24.820]  it's accelerating the majority of Americans now know that the Federal
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.980]  Reserve is a private holding company for offshore banks we had a major victory
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:34.100]  with the climate aid emails you and Ron Paul are becoming more and more mainstream
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:38.060]  every day because you guys were telling the truth all these years and now now
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.260]  you're being proven right so I think it's important for everyone to stay
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.860]  optimistic and to keep the winning attitude because we're gonna win this in
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.780]  the end well I agree with you Joel but and and even more important we need to
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:53.380]  explain to everybody who works for the system look you're gonna be hurt in this
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:59.300]  as well you're not immune from this and it's we the people 99% of us against a
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:04.020]  tiny ruling clash who is completely criminal and illegitimate and we've got
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.380]  to come together and keep getting the word out now's the time to get the word
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.540]  out what does Cass Sunstein at the White House say in public memos that they
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.940]  send out fake conspiracy theorist on the web to get us in fighting with each
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:19.060]  other because as long as we're fighting with each other and debating
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.260]  mindless garbage we're not gonna move forward in waking new people up the
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.100]  system is scared as a bigger presence he said four months ago and I appreciate
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:32.220]  your call he said this is the first time in human history ever that the entire of
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.780]  humanity and that means generally you know the entire of humanity is awakened
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:41.020]  staring at the elite and is politically aware okay people know it's the private
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:45.780]  banks around the planet not puppet Obama not puppet Bush and that ain't gonna
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:52.420]  work anymore they know Nicholas Sarkozy's a pimp they know that all these
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:58.180]  leaders are just frontmen they're pimps okay and they're pimping us out and
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.660]  people know that now and that's a big problem for the globalist we see them
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:07.700]  now their denial doesn't work anymore let's talk to Austin in Ohio Austin
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.780]  you're on the year

[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:24.660]  info nuke to drop on you okay okay all right now the story about what happened
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:29.220]  in the Gulf is not over that's why I say so we've been posting videos of just
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:33.100]  thousands of dead fish corex at everywhere but Obama says corex it
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:39.540]  didn't bad for him anybody that eats golf seafood might end up dead and it's
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:46.300]  all on BP's anyway I will I hope that this will be like the new search term
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:51.580]  for the day and millions and millions of people will see the truth about what
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:59.460]  happened there so I want to point everyone's attention to Marine log dot
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:06.980]  com and an article that they posted on September 2nd 2009 so seven months
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:18.140]  before the horrible thing on 420 2010 the headline is again it's this is Marine
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:25.460]  log docs and news mix or some okay I'm just gonna read it September 2nd 2009
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:31.820]  trans ocean submersible sets drilling depth record that's the headline then
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:37.340]  underneath it it says trans ocean limited today announced that it's ultra
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:42.980]  deep water submersible rig deep water horizon we've all heard of that
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:50.660]  recently drilled the deepest oil and gas well ever while working for BP and
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:56.380]  its co-owners on the Tiber well in the US Gulf of Mexico this is the one that we
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.820]  all have heard about that we saw I'm gushing and gushing and gushing okay
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:09.380]  and okay anyway and from there it says the trans ocean cruise on the deep
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:18.620]  water horizon drilled the well to 35,050 feet vertical depth and 35,055 feet
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:24.180]  measured depth or more than six miles okay so what's the big news I mean I
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:29.780]  knew about that okay well the thing is I could not explain how somebody
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:37.620]  got so-called fossil fuels from six miles below the Gulf of Mexico I mean
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:42.820]  that just didn't make sense I mean when was yeah it's it's it's abiotic stay

[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:29.860]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.940]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.660]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.740]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.460]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:50.460]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:55.140]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the son so go to
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:33:02.900]  www.mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 from the front lines of the
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:08.020]  information war it's Alex Jones
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.340]  all right I want to try to race through your calls we got a guest coming up for
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:21.180]  two hours in studio and I'm going on RT right at the end of the show never ends
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:25.220]  yes Austin there's a lot of evidence and many more scientists and trolling
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:31.380]  geologists are saying that most oil is not produced by dead plant and animal
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:39.300]  matter or the oil the essence of dead dinos but that it's being produced down
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.060]  on the earth and they've seen this all over the world with even hundred year
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:47.660]  old oil wells filling back up sometimes with more oil than they originally had
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.460]  and so yes if you drill down six miles the question is why are they hitting
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:58.340]  some of the biggest gushers ever I mean did the dinosaur blood drip down six
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:04.460]  miles but go ahead and finish your point okay well the point is so I go and I
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:09.540]  look to see I mean six miles underneath yes six miles so this is
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:15.500]  continental crust this is not you know this is not normal crust like if you'd
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:22.100]  go underneath the high mountain yeah this is not alluvial alluvial crust
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.620]  we're getting now you know down to close to the mantle go ahead so what's your
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:30.260]  big incredible bombshell info that's exactly the point Alex they the reason
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:34.860]  it just kept gushing and gushing is because the mantle is liquid and they
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:39.740]  drill drill down six feet if you look up the continental crust meaning you know
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:45.100]  under ocean they say that the the average continental crust center is three
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:50.660]  to six miles so what they did is they just drilled all the way down I mean
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:55.580]  this was criminal right they drilled all the way down into the liquid mantle
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:02.180]  which because the earth spins it goes through centrifugal force and therefore
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:06.980]  that's why the liquid stuff was just gushing and gushing and gushing well
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:13.180]  to be specific they think the they believe the core may spin but not the
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:16.580]  mantle but though there is a lot of molten stuff going on in the metal I
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:21.100]  mean the earth spins every day we see it I mean you know that's why the sun
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.020]  rises and falls is because the earth spins and it doesn't make a difference
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:31.340]  to us but when you're a liquid in the center and around it so what is the
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:37.820]  huge breaking news well that's it they all they did I mean the reason that it
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:43.900]  gushed for months was because it was just they drilled into the mantle and then
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:48.220]  took all the oil that was coming out of it or whatever you want to call the
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:53.140]  stuff that is the mantle they were taking it for about seven months and then
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:59.420]  they destroyed their own well to create a huge catastrophe that would kill
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:03.020]  millions of people well to be specific they were working on completing the
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.820]  well just because they drilled down didn't mean it was completed they have
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.860]  to case it and you know go through a bunch of different activities they were
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:12.340]  having a lot of trouble doing it for months but but that is important and
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:19.500]  we have actually covered that Austin I appreciate your call but that's the
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.540]  issue of science going crazy they're telling you we need to tax you because
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:29.140]  you're carbon dioxide that plants respirate from is deadly poison but then
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.900]  they're not worried about genetic engineering or antimatter weapons or the
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:37.460]  CERN superconducting supercollider they're not worried about you know all
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:40.900]  these other super weapons they're developing and they've just got thousands
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.620]  of giant research government private university facilities doing pure
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.540]  research just to see what's going to happen and they admit their own
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:53.620]  permutations with the case with CERN that it could create a strangelet or a
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:58.100]  black hole a whole bunch of different permutations an equation show it could
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:01.100]  cause something that could destroy the planet or even blow the whole solar
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:06.380]  system to Kingdom Comer suck it into a black hole you want to see a movie
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:09.900]  example of it it'd be like the last Star Trek you know where the where the bad
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:14.060]  guys go and you know drop a bit of this antimatter into the core of the planet
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.700]  and it sucks into a black hole that's basically what a strangelet would do but
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:25.500]  I mean here is Reuters today CERN scientist I parallel universe breakthrough
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:31.820]  and they're looking for this this magic particle and so they're accelerating now
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:36.540]  not just uranium and the blocks of lead they're accelerating uranium plutonium
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:40.820]  and other things at each other at light speed running them into each other
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.780]  they're not running particles they spin up into a block of lead or whatever
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.460]  they're testing to find out about the nature universe they're they're taking
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.220]  particles themselves and accelerating them at each other now what makes a
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:58.940]  atomic explosion or a hydrogen explosion they're they're taking those atoms and
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:04.660]  jamming them together and causing a chain reaction and I read with these
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.620]  physicists at CERN say they say yeah there's a small chance we'll destroy the
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.580]  earth I mean it goes back to the Manhattan project when they first
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:15.140]  tested the a bomb the majority of the scientists wrongly thought it was going
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:19.100]  to ignite the atmosphere and burn the atmosphere of the planet up but they went
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:26.020]  ahead with it so the more of these experiments they do in the thousands of
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:30.620]  years now and all these other facilities the more chances there are and if they
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:37.180]  created what what they call a strangelet it would create a particle that would
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:40.980]  sink to the center of the earth and it would take years before it reach
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.460]  critical mass and you the way they describe it is you'd have earthquakes for
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.980]  about two minutes by the time you figured out it was happening and by the
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:52.700]  time it expanded to the next level the whole planet would just be sucked into
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.700]  it you can pull up all the different types of things that can do I'm just
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:01.660]  giving over generalizations here physicists probing the origins of the
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.340]  cosmos hope that next year there will be a turn up the first proofs of
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.940]  existence of concepts long dear to science fiction writers such as hidden
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:14.220]  worlds and extra dimensions which the mathematics show are there I mean what's
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:18.820]  going to happen a gate's going to open up a hellraiser or an army of who knows
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:23.740]  what I mean who knows what's going to happen or just another dimension opens
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:26.540]  up and swallows up our planet that's what a lot of physicists think black holes
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:35.220]  are and as their large Hadron collider LHC at CERN near Geneva moves into high
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:40.700]  gear they are taking increasingly of the new physics on the horizon that could
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:44.260]  totally change current views of the universe and how it works parallel
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.580]  universes unknown forms of matter extra dimensions these are not the stuff of
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:53.340]  cheap science fiction but the very concrete physics theories that scientists
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:57.860]  are trying to confirm with the LHC and other experiments now remember the theory
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:06.940]  of atomic theorem the atomic theory the theory of atomic science was crystallized
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:12.980]  in 1900 110 years ago by physicist Max Planck and the equations he drew on
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:21.180]  chalkboards he predicted atomic weapons now these guys with supercomputers and
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:26.540]  all this system all these powerful systems they are predicting and showing
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.500]  with their algorithms that they are going to open dimensional gates the
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:39.500]  equivalent of Stargate this is not science fiction okay now these people
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.540]  will end up destroying us if we don't get control of the situation and the
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:45.780]  global is probably saying oh we want world government to stop a nuclear war
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.900]  to stop problems we want they hand out the weapons to everybody oh we need a
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.820]  global government to stop bio weapons being developed that'll kill everybody
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.900]  they built 36 level four bio weapons labs all over the US in areas with level
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:01.780]  two containment in the middle of major cities it's it's as if they want to
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.860]  destroy life it's as if they're looking for a way to nihilistically annihilate
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.980]  our planet and then you read the writings of some of the top futurist and
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:13.300]  transhumanist that's all they talk about they go we're gonna go on willing and go
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:17.780]  on building and go on exploring until we're gods or we're gonna die trying
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:23.180]  life extension super high-tech physics all of this it's all what that's why
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:27.340]  they're on power trips acting like we don't count oh let's go ahead and take
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.140]  everybody's pension funds let's go ahead and take six million dead and dying
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:35.260]  veterans death benefits oh let's go ahead and just you know flu shots are
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:39.180]  hurting people they admit they are but that's just the way you know used to 20
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:42.740]  years ago they told troops don't use du now they say here it is it's great for
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:49.780]  you they it's like they know something we don't know they don't care it's like
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.460]  somebody running around a fireworks factory with giant piles of white and
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:59.100]  black gunpowder everywhere with huge torches with embers falling and they're
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:04.020]  just like laughing like a combination of Daffy duck and Woody Woodpecker going
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.540]  just insanely running around in the fireworks factory with these burning
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:21.700]  torches embers falling right by the by the dynamite and and these people are
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:28.540]  completely insane but they're crazy like a fox and in their mad competition for
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:32.700]  technocratic godhood let's say they discover many of these things that are
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:37.220]  seen by many as godlike powers somebody 10,000 years ago 5,000 years ago you
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.780]  showed them a hydrogen bomb going off at McKinney or out at Trinity you better
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:47.020]  believe they think that was God a cell phone is magic compared to people you
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:51.900]  100 years ago well you ain't seen nothing yet not to mention the stuff
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:54.460]  they've already discovered and they're keeping from us we know they keep most of
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:00.620]  it from us so they're running around on wild power trips the Vatican and the UN
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:05.140]  have appointed ambassadors for the alien landings they say are coming I'm not
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:08.860]  the one covering this they're the ones doing it I'm not the weirdo talking
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:15.580]  about this I'm reading you Reuters Reuters Reuters and this is the stuff
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:20.140]  that keeps me up at night I want to go on living I like human society I want my
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.140]  children to have great-great-grandchildren I want to go to the
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:28.660]  stars but we've got a bunch of crazy inbred nutcases on power trips running
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:38.260]  everything this caller is called aerosol spraying in Illinois that's an
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:44.980]  inventive name go ahead aerosol you're on the air quickly before I get to that
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.980]  people in touch dot org 20 week prayer to get back our country for repentance
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:53.780]  talks about great chapters in the Bible books talking about the war against
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:59.700]  Jesus terrorism the financial crisis increasing taxation charles charlie
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:05.260]  Stanley great-out preacher of the Lord people look that up yeah I'm here in
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:09.380]  Macomb and I'm sick and tired of seeing this aerosol indirect and semi-direct
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:14.020]  aerosol campaign going on if you look that up in Google you'll find tremendous
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.060]  documents hundreds of thousands of universities department of energy
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:23.420]  foreign governments a giant weather modification program going on if you're
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.140]  in Illinois and you want to talk to someone about this
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:32.140]  Greg McFarquhar from the University of Illinois he's a huge he's the get
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:36.220]  funded by the Department of Energy this is disgusting one of the CFR documents
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:41.900]  has a Boeing plane showing you know exactly examples of the dimensioning
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:46.100]  it's not not the old-timers 15 years ago did the test and said they're spraying
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.860]  aluminum dioxide barium salts and sulfur and now the government comes out says
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.500]  we've been testing it but now we want to go operational and block out the sun for
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:00.540]  your safety barium salts aluminum dioxide and sulfur particles exactly what the
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:06.100]  test showed we just magically 15 years ago with so many great activists and
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.500]  researchers said exactly what it was and then magically it is that one last
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:17.740]  thing Alex you're going on RT today can you plug the the birth certificate
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.460]  March in Washington to see people Google Obama crimes they'll take you to
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:25.540]  Phil J Berg's website let's get that number one yeah we're trying as hard as
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.580]  we can we had him on yesterday I appreciate your call you know national
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:33.060]  media international media doesn't tell me what to say but they call up and they
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:38.980]  say we're having you on about the fact that you say corporate governance is the
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:46.380]  new world order and so then if I start going on any shows and talk about
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:50.780]  something completely separate to what I've agreed to come on about then they're
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:54.260]  not going to have me back on because it's kind of like if I had a guest on
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:59.700]  about superconducting super colliders and they came on and talked about Phil
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.180]  Berg's March I mean we plug Phil Berg's Marx we did it I don't know if I could
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:08.580]  interject that in there but I mean I've been on RT many times exposing Obama as
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:13.100]  Barry Citero but I appreciate your call Roger in New Hampshire Roger you're on
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:19.100]  the air hi Alex can you hear me yes I can okay I know you covered like the
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:24.100]  pension stuff and this is a similar situation you know I got laid off
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:29.700]  recently and I tried to be responsible and put some money away in an FSA you
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:37.900]  know what that is right like savings account well they're telling me that I
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:47.620]  can't touch the money because I'm no longer an employee but I had no I had no
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.700]  yeah I can tell you're upset this is happening everywhere they lay you off
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:57.180]  and then for five ten years how long she worked there I worked I worked with this
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:00.900]  company for about seven years okay so you worked there seven years they tell
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.140]  you it's your money and then when it comes time for you to get it out they
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:07.940]  say you don't work here anymore you can't have it just like the troops that
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:12.780]  paid for death insurance death benefits and they made a secret deal 11 years ago
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:16.780]  with Prudential and others to never give them their money and so you need to get
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:20.340]  a lawyer you need to get a lawyer who's an expert in this and you need to go in
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:24.620]  there and a lot of times they bluff you but that's your money and you should be
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:29.580]  able to get your money out so so what are these people telling you they're
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:34.380]  saying that if I you know if I'd been to the doctor earlier before my layoff
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:39.020]  date I could file a claim against that but I had no reason to think that I
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:42.540]  would be laid off they were all this company was pretty busy wait a minute
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:46.700]  you're saying you they took money out of your check for the pension and many
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:50.700]  companies make you do this and then they're not giving you your money it was
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.340]  for a flex savings account and granted yes I signed up for it and I feel like a
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:48:00.340]  chump but you know I signed up for it with the expectation that if I went to a
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:05.260]  doctor and whatever whatever it was wasn't covered by the health insurance
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:09.220]  well here's another scam they're running they will create big companies
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:14.140]  create subsidiaries they shut down the old company and say it's bankrupt so oh
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:17.780]  you don't get your benefits that was a clause but then the new companies
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:21.020]  operating in the same building and they bring in you know new young people they
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:25.380]  can set up for the next scam but I'm sorry to hear that happened to you what
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.860]  what's your specific question no I just wanted to say that it's not just the
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:33.940]  pensions that they're stealing you know it's similar but it's not just the
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.740]  pensions that these companies are stealing so they told you this was a
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:41.140]  medical care account right the flex savings account for things that aren't
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:45.140]  covered by this high-price stupid policy you know and it was a savings account
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:52.300]  with your money and they say sorry it's ours now you pretty much now just I'm
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:56.620]  just angry I just wanted to I know it's partly my greed because I tried to by
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:01.660]  putting it in FSA it's it's basically a tax shelter for the working rapport so
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.300]  it's partly but this is that I mean this is theft you put it in a medical
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:08.660]  savings account and that's just like an education savings account or anything
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:12.460]  else and this you know that company probably already you know took that money
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:17.340]  as bonuses out the back door don't just listen to them tell you oh we're taking
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:20.300]  your house you're like but I'm not behind in payments you don't even have the deed
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:24.540]  shut up you know you need to learn how to counter them I've got a sneak and
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:29.580]  suspicion that this is all basically a bluff so continue to research that just
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:33.780]  don't believe them when they say oh you invested for seven years and I'm afraid
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.140]  that money's ours now it can only be used for medical and you're like well it
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:43.260]  is for my medical sorry that money's ours hmm how much money was it with interest
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.860]  well well well it's only from year to year so at January 1st you have to
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.180]  start over again oh so they only got to suck a few thousand out of you well
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:55.140]  actually it's only a couple hundred but that could have been well feel better
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:58.580]  than other people feel better than you know people at Enron where all the money
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.780]  was taken out the back door they blew it out gave the people nothing and that's
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:05.460]  about to happen to most people or the people paying into Social Security for
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:09.540]  50 years and now they are told no cola for the next two years increase the cost
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.220]  of living I mean don't you know don't feel bad you've barely been dinged my

[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:03.900]  it is a huge flashing neon sign you're on the right track you're on the right
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:09.260]  track you're having a big effect it's a sonar ping that that that we are having
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:12.980]  a giant effect people say how do you do it every day how do you do interviews in

[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:53.660]  GCN visit GCN live comm today Alex told you the government announced recently
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:58.540]  that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:02.500]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.860]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:09.580]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:13.660]  their long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking

[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:14.020]  got just all this other stuff going on my brand when we talking about mortgages
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:17.580]  the banks martial law I've got all this other stuff I'm dealing with trying to
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:20.860]  get this social network launch all that's going on during the breaks I'm
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:24.100]  talking to people and I get in here and I've got a kind of reset to be focused
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:32.420]  point is KSCO.com KSCO.com if you want to get tickets they're about to sell
[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:36.300]  out to the second showing on that Monday evening I'll speak for two hours take
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:42.180]  questions for 30 minutes it's $10.80 for 1080 a.m. and Michael's whirling known
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:45.500]  as MZ the great guy has been on two stations there and both of them are
[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:49.260]  just blowtorches one of them especially covers you know the Bay Area not just
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:53.060]  Santa Cruz and we've have a huge response off those great folks and I
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:58.020]  always enjoy talking to him so KSCO.com if you want to get tickets they're
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:02.220]  almost gone and MZ was very excited in the emails he's gotten people are
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.220]  coming from three four states away they're coming from Oregon they're
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:09.260]  coming from Idaho they're coming from Utah they're coming from Colorado they're
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:14.140]  coming from New Mexico they're coming from Arizona they're coming from all
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:19.940]  over California and I didn't we could have gotten a place for 2000 and if I
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:22.220]  would have hammered it I'm sure we could have sold out the second showing a
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:30.700]  2000 but you know I like speaking and people say I'm best in person but it's
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.540]  just so comfortable to be my little digital nest my little layer and to be
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:39.220]  able to talk to millions every day and do interviews and talk to millions it's
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.980]  just so much more effective but it is great to go out and be able to speak to
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.700]  wonderful crowds and meet people so I haven't done a lot of events this kind
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:51.060]  of illustrates though I've had events with 1200 1400 at a before we really
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.860]  should do more of these at least once a month or so I should do a speaking
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:56.980]  engagement around the country because it gets local news attention to show people
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:01.860]  how strong the Patriot movement is it also we can then shoot video of the
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:06.540]  speech put it on YouTube and then reach millions of people digitally that way
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:10.780]  so I'm really glad that MZ prodded me because listeners prodded him to come
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:13.700]  out there and speak and I look forward to seeing him in person I've he's
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.180]  actually come to Austin and see me and I've had a chance to meet him and his
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:21.100]  mother who he brought along he was here at a seminar on vitamins and stuff he's
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:24.180]  he's big into that great guy so I look forward to seeing you all out there
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.300]  Sunday and Monday and I'm also killing two birds with one stone while I'm out
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:32.380]  in California I'm out there on a secret mission and I'll just leave it at that
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:38.100]  but that's all coming up Randy Kelton in studio with some of the most important
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.900]  information ever and even if you don't have a mortgage in foreclosure and
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:44.540]  trouble this affects you because the mega banks are saying they can take your
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.500]  house even if it's paid for and they don't have the note they don't have the
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.340]  deed and this goes to the confidence of the entire system and just how out of
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:55.740]  control and ruthless these criminals are so two hours of this information

[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:20.740]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:32.100]  Alex Jones all right with us into the overdrive fourth hour today is Randy
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:38.580]  Kelton I remember ten years ago researching mortgage fraud and hearing
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:42.020]  about how they were selling the mortgages over and over again at different
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:45.260]  institutions as derivatives this all really kicked off 11 years ago with the
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:47.940]  end of Glass-Steagall that Bill Clinton honchoed through with the
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:51.900]  Republicans as well in 1999 so it allows them to go away from fractional
[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.060]  reserve banking where a bank can loan out ten dollars for every dollar it's
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:09:00.660]  gotten holdings to just unlimited and they've now created 1.5 quadrillion 1.5
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:05.980]  thousand 1500 quadrillion dollars conservatively that that number's
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:09.820]  about a year old so it's impossible to ever pay this back but they hold the
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:12.740]  economy hostage saying give us trillions more which they then use for
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:16.900]  bonuses Wall Street's you know record profits the banks record profits
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:22.140]  everybody else worldwide going into a black hole and now it's confirmed CNN's
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:26.380]  reported it we played the clips people's homes who were paid for are being
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:31.620]  taken but multiple banks are trying to foreclose on the same house or Obama
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:35.300]  claimed he had this plan to let people renegotiate they go into renegotiate sign
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:40.180]  papers then they take the house just every form of criminality going on so a
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:44.260]  few months ago it's like conspiracy theorists I saw headlines conspiracy
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:49.380]  theorist and you know patriots are filing paper terrorism and lying and
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:53.740]  saying that banks are taking homes without the deeds this is a lie that's
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:58.540]  just two months ago now everywhere AP Reuters your headlines Bank of America
[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:03.740]  suspends all foreclosures the other four big banks suspend as well government
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:07.820]  you know Harry Reid calls an Obama to suspend it a mortgage fraud BBC headline
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:14.380]  Obama to allow banks to continue mortgage fraud but to quantify this and to
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:17.540]  cover a wide spectrum of it is Randy Kelton because I've been studying this
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:20.620]  for 10 years since I learned about it I mean I'm people tell me about this 10
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:24.020]  years ago and I've done research and don't want to give advice about mortgages
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:27.420]  because it's very complex but over time I've learned quite a bit and I like
[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:31.380]  Randy because he's a pro se litigant and researcher means he's not a lawyer but
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:34.140]  he does advise lawyers and many others he has his own radio show and rule of
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:38.580]  law radio calm and Randy's an Austin I've interviewed him many years ago
[02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:42.300]  before and he stood up against corrupt police and you know that's where he
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:45.900]  started was in the trenches just dealing with the Bill of Rights and common law
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:49.860]  and his mortgage situation over the last five years gets brought to him so much
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:53.100]  he's researched it and he's researched the cases that have been won the cases
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:57.820]  that have been lost they've had a I'd say 90 plus percent success rate blocking
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:02.220]  foreclosures which is simple things they do but he will tell you there's no
[02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:06.540]  silver bullet the courts are incredibly corrupt anybody and I hear this all over
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:11.100]  talk radio I hear it everywhere and I hear other shows on this network you
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:14.820]  know saying and I'm not trying to attack people maybe it's gonna work but the
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:20.460]  point is when they say 100% we can fix it send us $10,000 in my opinion don't
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:25.940]  walk don't run sprint away from that okay I like Randy because he just goes off
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.900]  the facts and he's and and he's so busy he won't even usually even take more
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:34.140]  people to help because he's overwhelmed that's the mark of somebody real and
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:38.900]  but regardless I want Randy to have the floor and spend the first few segments
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:45.100]  quantifying how the mortgages work what the mirror system is while this is
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:50.540]  coming to a head the announcement that they've passed the law CNBC on Monday
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:56.500]  said had the headline CNBC analysts predicts that Obama will legalize
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:12:00.020]  mortgage fraud well they already passed the law two weeks ago two and a half
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.980]  weeks ago Obama has pocket vetoed he didn't get rid of it he just set it
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:08.380]  aside to last for the election show just like Bush got caught with warrantless
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:11.660]  wiretapping on Americans and lied about it they then had Congress pass a law
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.620]  retroactively making it legal but if they do this there's no confidence in
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:19.780]  mortgages private property this is so big a lot of people are like well I don't
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:23.580]  have a bad mortgage folks they're taking houses that are paid for this is on
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:28.060]  mainstream news in fact we can search the term Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan both
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:33.540]  will do it you know takes house that they didn't even own you know court rules
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:37.060]  against them taking house that was paid for that that they didn't have a deed
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:42.180]  to because the Chinese the Europeans individual pension funds you're hearing
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:46.300]  they're in trouble now they've all been sold this so Randy let's go over how a
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:49.420]  mortgage really works what this does the fundamentals of land ownership in this
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:53.220]  country one of the things that made it so great you get clearer title here than
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:58.940]  anywhere else in the world and and and what this means this this total shift
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:02.180]  and where you see it going so let's go over mortgages and then just of the
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:07.100]  cornucopia some of the biggest scams they're running yes quickly I'll go
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:15.620]  through how the mortgages work the in the late 80s early 90s first Clinton and
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:20.220]  then Bush under the guise of making housing available to the poor removed
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:27.620]  two primary protections that lenders had that restricted the actions of the I'm
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:31.500]  sorry restricted that restricted the actions of the lenders to protect the
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:35.820]  borrowers instead of making houses available to the poor what they did was
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:40.300]  went to people in good stable loans building equity in their houses and
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:47.420]  convinced them to do the one thing that had always been taboo to speculate with
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:53.780]  your home oh yeah look at us the market is going straight up you sell this
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:56.900]  crummy old house you're in by this real expense when you can't afford that don't
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:02.060]  worry about a couple years price to go up you'll be inverted you can remodry can
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:06.620]  get a new loan on it you'll have so much equity in it you'll almost nothing
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.700]  people bought this story they thought that the mortgage industry was increasing
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:17.420]  that the that the demand for property was increasing it wasn't an increase in
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:21.060]  demand it talked all these people again to getting out of the houses they were
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:25.140]  in and moving into another one so it was a movement and the movement created a
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:29.100]  bubble they knew full well it was creating a bubble at about the same
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:37.220]  time somebody come up with this great idea we have all of these investment
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:45.420]  funds primarily your retirement and my retirement all of this money building up
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:50.620]  in these long-term funds that need a place to invest and they come up with a
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:56.300]  great idea how to strip all of it first we strip the equity from the property
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:01.420]  owner by getting him to sell his property and commit his equity to a new
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:08.820]  purchase that the lender intends they cannot pay and then we sell this as a
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:17.500]  security into an investment pool and get the borrower's employers to invest
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:21.980]  their retirement fund in the investment pool and in the end game we'll steal it
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:25.940]  all and that's exactly what they're doing and we saw them in 07 the very
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:29.780]  financial publications that have promoted this fraud we saw them start to
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:35.220]  bash the housing system and purposely cause the bubble to pop then we saw in
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:39.340]  October of 08 Paulson and others the head of the Treasury the head of the
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:42.820]  fellow deserve come out in bad mouth and say we're going into a depression to
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:46.500]  further destroy confidence because there was so much irrational exuberance that
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.820]  they'd injected into us that people weren't popping the bubble and so they
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:55.060]  came in and popped it themselves precisely and there was one other thing
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:59.940]  that occurred that allowed this to happen in 1907 there's a major stock market
[02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:03.860]  crash this crash was caused because people were allowed to invest in a stock
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.820]  without owning it they could go into what they called a bucket shop you can
[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:13.220]  look on on the internet and do a search for financial weapons of mass
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:17.500]  destruction it's kind of like naked shorting yeah in 60 minutes did a little
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:23.620]  section on this after the crash of 1907 the legislature said no more that it's
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:29.420]  felony to do it last thing the legislature did in the year 2000 was
[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:35.260]  removed that restriction then the banksters could start selling derivatives
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:43.940]  again this is absolutely unregulated speculation so a lender goes to you and
[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:49.500]  induces you into a loan that you cannot pay and it is his intent that you cannot
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:53.300]  pay it most people when they hear that they think of a mortgage company like
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:59.100]  we think of it's a wonderful life where a bank gathers funds from the
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:03.340]  neighborhood loans out those funds collects them back over time at a
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:09.380]  profit after these changes in the late 90s that's not what happened anymore now
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:14.060]  there was an opportunity for a lender for someone to go into business as a
[02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:20.700]  mortgage company go to a large lender chase Bank of America Wells Fargo get a
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:26.180]  large loan convert that loan into 20 30-year mortgages problem they had had
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:30.940]  to pay that loan back within 69 months so they never had any intention of
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:38.180]  keeping the loan they go to the seller extract a loan from their credit line
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:45.220]  give the seller a promissory note with instant value present value check they
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:49.100]  in return for the title they take the title they trade it to the buyer for a
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:53.900]  promissory note with no present value but with increased future value well they
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:58.940]  need present value payback to bank so they take that and sell it to an
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:04.900]  investment pool special purpose vehicle a special purpose vehicle set created
[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:09.700]  for the purpose of gathering together a bunch of no loans into a single pool
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:14.020]  and then they file it with the IRS as a real estate mortgage investment conduit
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:19.700]  they filed it as derivatives with no deed yeah well they get it there and the
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.660]  problem with it that would have been bad enough but they didn't just sell it to
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:30.700]  a special purpose vehicle they sold it to lots of special purpose vehicles
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:37.340]  selling the same note 20 to 30 times it was just an unregulated glut on the
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:40.420]  market and that's what the media is just now getting around to admitting
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.660]  that's why you'll have two three four five banks trying to foreclose on the
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:47.780]  same apartment house or the same home of the same golf course because there's
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:51.900]  an even bigger swindle they didn't just triple a rate bad mortgages to people
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:56.460]  that couldn't pay it back that was just the vector point where it where the
[02:18:56.460 --> 02:19:02.260]  epicenter the real fraud is they've sold these over and over again in in literal
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:07.660]  counterfeiting exactly most people think that the banks defrauded them what
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:12.140]  they did to you is chump change the one they're really after is the backside
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:16.940]  investor that's the one they really defrauded and they created your note as
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:22.580]  a vehicle to perpetrate the further fraud and in the process of doing it the
[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:26.380]  more expensive they could create more expensive alone product they could create
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:30.740]  the more profit they made made it immediately when they sold it to the
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:34.260]  investor because all these different investment vehicles as they pass it on
[02:19:34.260 --> 02:19:39.500]  the line they're getting fees yes and they do more than that they gather these
[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:44.340]  together and they monitor the income streams what they guarantee to the
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:48.980]  investors an income stream so if one's producing weld and other ones not they
[02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:54.740]  do credit default swaps well stay there let's let's continue and they have a
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:59.940]  fake insurance put on it and that's something else they sell the right back
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.660]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a

[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:25.380]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:29.540]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:17.860]  against corrupt courts really researching the mortgage situation so so
[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:24.060]  Randy they've sold all these derivatives now China the EU pension funds and and
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:28.220]  they told us back in October of two years ago they said oh we're gonna need
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:31.420]  these billions these trillions of unfreeze mortgages but the day after
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:35.340]  October 4th Paulson said we're gonna spend it on something else we're not
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:39.180]  gonna tell you then they didn't even fix the derivatives problem they took it as
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:43.060]  bonuses and now here we are two years later let's go over what's happening in
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:46.820]  courts why they're stopping many of the foreclosures now why they're trying to
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:50.780]  get Obama to sign a law to legalize all this because I know most the frauds at
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:54.020]  the institutional level and pension level but individually the hundred
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:57.380]  thousand homes and foreclosure a month according to the federal government at
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:00.860]  record levels what is you know in the gamut what are some of the most common
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:06.180]  frauds the banks are engaged in one of the first things they do is they
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:13.980]  convince the loan broker the person who brings the the customer to the lender
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:23.140]  they convince him to breach his fiduciary duty to the borrower by lying to him
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:26.220]  and telling him that the telling him that the property is worth a whole lot
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:31.020]  more than it is and you tend to believe that because the appraiser will appraise
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:34.500]  it for a whole lot more it more than it's worth so there's systemic fraud yeah
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.740]  and the appraiser will appraise it for a whole lot more than it's worth because
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:43.380]  only the banks can hire appraisers by the banks rules this way they get the
[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:47.700]  increase the initial amount of the value of the property they get to increase the
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:55.540]  initial amount of the loan and they collect fees at closing if anybody has a
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:58.340]  loan here you look at your hut one settlement statement list all the fees
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:03.100]  they charged you good portion of those are forbidden to be charged to you they
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:08.260]  charge those to you then take those fees give them to the broker under the table
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:13.180]  the broker who brings you a loan is only allowed to receive one percent of the
[02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:17.700]  principle of the note as a commission that's so that everywhere the broker
[02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:23.580]  looks everybody's going to pay them the same however the lenders are sliding
[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:27.940]  the money under the table to get them to lie to the to the borrower and bring
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:34.260]  him a more expensive loan product when he when they do that then the lender can
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:39.540]  take the loan as soon as he you sign it he's going to take it and sell it he
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:46.260]  will receive consideration from the investor but he keeps the lien he'll
[02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:50.060]  sell the note the note is a it's like a check you're right a check that's a
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:54.780]  that's a security instrument you write a note that's a security instrument that
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:59.300]  doesn't get collected all in one moment it gets collected monthly over a period
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:03.780]  of years essentially it's the same thing so he takes that check and he sells it
[02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:09.260]  to the investor but he doesn't give him the lien document the document that is
[02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:14.140]  there to protect him in case you don't pay and it took a long time to figure
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:19.380]  that out because the Supreme Court of Kansas addressed this issue and they
[02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:26.980]  said why you can separate these two it's legal but if you do that then you've
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:32.060]  created a fatal flaw in that the guy who purchased the security instrument he has
[02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:36.580]  a claim against the property but no I'm sorry he has a claim against the
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:42.420]  signator on the note the guy who signed it but no claim against property the
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:47.060]  lender holding the lien he has a claim against the property but he received
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:50.860]  consideration he can't be armed so the liens void so that's how you have
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:54.500]  multiple banks coming after the same property they'll get no we what the
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:28:01.940]  lender then did the the special purpose vehicle that purchased the note he
[02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:07.380]  combined it into a whole bunch of different pools instead of one real
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:10.900]  estate mortgage investment conduit he combined it in a whole bunch of them
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:18.300]  sold them over and over again so he got multiple consideration for the note what
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:24.860]  we're saying is is even if you didn't pay the note and even if the payment is
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:31.020]  owed the question becomes who's it owed to who actually owns it so that's how
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:34.180]  they're taking houses that are completely paid for because it doesn't
[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:37.660]  matter because somebody else can claim they have some type of ownership to it
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:41.620]  exactly we have a guy in California that Bank of America came and took his
[02:28:41.620 --> 02:28:46.860]  house two months later Chase came and tried to take his house they all think
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:51.820]  they own it they've sold it to everybody but the question I had was why would the
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:58.620]  lender keep the security keep the lien if it causes much of a problem he kept
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:05.540]  it because he'll hold it for three years file a trustee IRS form 1099 a write it
[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:08.860]  all off his capital gains tax as abandoned funds he gets consideration
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:13.260]  a second time and then once he sells the note to the investor he becomes the
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:19.260]  servicer of the note if you pay the note on time he gets 3% of the payment paid
[02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:24.300]  late he gets an extra five it is in his best interest to create a loan the
[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:30.380]  borrower can't has to struggle to pay and regularly pays late and if you
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:34.300]  default he'll make about 50 grand on the default actually you make more than
[02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:37.100]  that's too complex here to explain now and they had to know it was going to
[02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:40.500]  destroy the economy when this went belly up but don't worry they've got the next
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:44.540]  answer give the bankers global government power have global VAT taxes
[02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:48.980]  carbon taxes to create the new global bubble he'll be back long 18 minute
[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:53.260]  segment coming up I'm Alex Jones Randy Kelton we're on the March the

[02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:06.140]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:09.900]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:14.460]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:18.660]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:23.300]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:27.300]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:31.420]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:35.380]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:39.540]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:43.300]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:47.220]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:31:08.940 --> 02:31:13.060]  find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:16.340]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:38.460]  with us so we're going through what these derivatives are how this is working
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:43.300]  we're talking during the break clearly engineered by design then we're not
[02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:46.900]  gonna just look at the fraud you know at the home buyer level and what this is
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:50.380]  gonna do to society but also the international fraud the real fraud and
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:56.300]  what dwarfs the original genesis of all of this but continue walking through
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:00.940]  this and then let's get into how the banks are losing in court now and what
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:03.620]  it's gonna do if the government comes out and says look banks can take any
[02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:07.300]  houses they want it doesn't matter if it's all illegal we've got to let them
[02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:12.860]  do this too big to fail yes you know I hear that might happen but somehow I
[02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:20.340]  think it won't I think it's worse than we then I would imagine I'm not I tend
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:25.380]  not to like conspiracy theories I don't want it to be that way but this one was
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:29.740]  forced down my throat all of these things are too well engineered to have
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:34.900]  happened by mistake they just all fit together the biggest problem I'll get
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:41.060]  through in a moment the lender he's this sharp point of the spear he's the one
[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:47.820]  that convinced the individual to go into a loan product he could not afford and
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:54.380]  he did it because he profited at every turn he profited when you when he sold
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:35:01.220]  the note he profited when he filed the 1099 a he profited when you paid late he
[02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:06.940]  profited when you default and all of that was Trump change the real profited
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:12.700]  God credit default swaps are essentially a form of insurance if you look at your
[02:35:12.700 --> 02:35:16.260]  HUD once element statement you'll see mortgage MPI mortgage insurance
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:21.500]  protection if you default on the note insurance company a pay him 80% of the
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:27.860]  principal based on that insurance premium what you don't know is on the
[02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:34.140]  derivatives market you'll get another 8 to 10 of those anybody who thinks your
[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:38.220]  lender is going to give you a modification you are dreaming that's
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:41.180]  coming out in the news now that they do these bait and switch is others a
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:44.500]  federal program and people are going into modify and then they're baiting and
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:48.700]  switching and then grabbing the house right there yes I have a quick story of
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:53.220]  a friend of mine happened to a friend of mine and I've read exactly the same
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:57.060]  story three times we're going to modify I said they're not gonna modify can oh
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:35:59.860]  yeah they're gonna modify so again now they're gonna modify they're gonna help
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:03.100]  me now they're gonna screw you they're gonna so he's gonna modify they tell
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:07.260]  him there's two documents that we need that but we don't know what they are he
[02:36:07.260 --> 02:36:11.860]  spent six weeks trying to find out what they were on a Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:18.020]  they called him and told him you didn't get us those two documents so we denied
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:21.820]  your modification they sold his house within minutes I've read this in three
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:27.660]  separate lawsuits they set you up once you go in and try to go into modification
[02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:31.780]  they tell you you don't qualify unless you lose two payments behind you're in
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:35.540]  modification and you get this notice of acceleration of the note you say wait
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:39.140]  wait what is this oh don't worry about that they induce you to give them the
[02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:42.620]  two payments behind to trigger the foreclosure exactly and then they run
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:46.540]  the foreclosure while they're doing the pre-ten modification well that's like
[02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:51.100]  CPS in every state in the union they also do this overseas it's the same you
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:55.340]  know unified continuity of agenda they say just sign these forms and agree to
[02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:58.460]  go to counseling and you'll get your baby back and while they've got their own
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:03.140]  hired psychiatrist lying about you who work for them they are already going to
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:07.580]  the court behind your back to terminate permanently parental rights so they put
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:11.380]  you into a process to get you to sign more forms and the whole thing is to
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:15.140]  create false hope and it's sold the public as a way to help your mortgage
[02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:18.660]  the and the whole thing is to induce more fraud yeah and even if you do get a
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:23.780]  modification the modifications they give are designed to fail the modification
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:27.340]  is supposed to give you a lower payment for a period of time and then go back to
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:31.060]  the original and the modifications have accelerated foreclosure yeah and if you
[02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:35.420]  that what actually happens is it's a lower payment for a period of time and
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:39.420]  then it shoots way up to where it's impossible to pay after modification
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:44.020]  miss one payment your history they can foreclose immediately and they set you
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:49.820]  up for that think about it they're gonna make a 10 to 10 times the amount of the
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:54.620]  principal on your note if you if they foreclose that's all they care about and
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:38:00.620]  they will force you into foreclosure what we did is worked on a remedy this is
[02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:04.780]  all we do is really it's not not polite to tell somebody you have a big problem
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:09.020]  unless you show them how to fix it and we worked on a remedy because it became
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:14.220]  so clear if we don't do something yeah let's talk about the remedies you've done
[02:38:14.220 --> 02:38:17.500]  that are working well let's talk about the other cases that are being one
[02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:21.420]  against these crooks that are bringing them to their knees you know why they're
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:26.540]  freezing them the foreclosures just got a call from one of our people today the
[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:32.740]  attorney called him let's make a deal the heat is on the lender we've been
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:37.820]  saying for a long time when the feds gave when the legislature allotted 200
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:43.580]  million to the feds to investigate a financial crime I told my co-host then
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:48.820]  watch June and July they'll start indicting September October they'll
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:55.100]  start prosecuting so they can say to the the voter oh look it does oh yeah we
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:59.460]  voted for that bailout but we got tricked into it but they're burning some low
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:04.100]  level people and we're helping you and that's they needed a scapegoat and they
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:08.860]  have thrown the lender to the wolves frankly they've done it much worse than
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:13.580]  I expected and that scares me because there's something more sinister underneath
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:20.540]  all of this because of the way the note has been sold around to different places
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:28.260]  who owns the note that is an incredibly major problem this country became a
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:32.980]  mecca for foreign investment because in this country if you purchase a piece of
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:37.340]  property you can trace the ownership of that property back to the original land
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:41.940]  grant that gave foreign countries confidence that they could invest and
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:48.300]  not have their investment taken away from them now with what's happening no
[02:39:48.300 --> 02:39:54.100]  one knows who owns what this will create a problem that will haunt this country
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:40:00.140]  for generations and plunge us into the worst depression that we've ever seen
[02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:05.220]  and I suspect worse than we even imagine what they're doing is they are
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:10.580]  clouding property rights and property deeds in this country to have government
[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:16.580]  as they're now announcing come in and change fundamental property law in this
[02:40:16.580 --> 02:40:20.220]  nation in the name of fixing it yes they're going to bring us to third
[02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:25.100]  world status they will plunge us into a depression that we have no way to get
[02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:28.220]  out and China today said they're mad about this and the New York Times is
[02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:32.500]  reporting they're freezing all rare earth mineral shipments to the United
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:38.140]  States I'm not surprised China really got hoodwinked on this one and a lot of
[02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:42.100]  the pressure that's on Bank of America is because China is suing them and the
[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:48.620]  egg for selling on the same notes 20 and 30 times over okay so let's get in
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:51.860]  before we cover all that there's so much to get into here because there's what's
[02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:55.380]  happening locally and then there's the big international scheme but but but go
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:41:01.020]  over the successes you and many others and lawyers are having in court by going
[02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:05.500]  in and showing the corruption the fraud of the lenders of the brokers and others
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:09.180]  and the fact that when you just sue them or kick it into criminal that
[02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:13.180]  immediately checkmates them yes and that's why I say there's no magic here
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:19.780]  there's no magic bullet the courts are absolutely corrupt if you go into court
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:24.380]  you can expect the court to rule against you out of hand at every turn just
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:28.380]  expect that if you hire an attorney he'll take your money in his screw your
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:31.940]  oil they get screwed him worth with it with the attorney because he's your
[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:35.660]  attorney and he speaks for you so you have no objection if you go in pro se
[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:41.180]  the courts are going to rule against you because you're pro se however as pro
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:47.820]  says we have powers and abilities beyond those of mortal attorneys as pro says
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:53.260]  there are tools we have we can use and we put together a program to take
[02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:58.100]  advantage of that I suggest people go into the federal court sue in the federal
[02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:02.620]  court pro se now we know the courts going to rule against us whether we have
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:06.700]  attorney or not attorney so having one or not it's not going to help us but as
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:12.700]  pro says there are things we can do the courts hate pro says they don't hate
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:17.060]  pro says cuz pro says right stupid pleadings the hate pro says because
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:23.060]  every once in a while they come across the pro say from hell the pro say who
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:29.340]  knows the power he has the pro say can go after the judge and go after the other
[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:36.060]  attorneys with relative impunity and there's only one way the judge has of
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:40.980]  influencing anyone in the case he has to influence the attorney on the other side
[02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:46.900]  to your benefit to get you off of his case and but in order to get there we
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:55.820]  have to give tools to the judge that he can use frankly we seem to be getting
[02:42:55.820 --> 02:43:01.500]  far better opinions from the judges than I had expected okay but let's just
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:04.060]  quantify this before we get into some of the things you're doing some of the
[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:07.780]  cases that are being won the successes you're having and blocking them but I
[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:11.220]  mean there's been a lot of these big cases where the banks are losing yeah
[02:43:11.220 --> 02:43:15.140]  and that's that's what I'm saying the judges they're being I've always said
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:18.220]  it's not about laws about politics sure but what exactly but but I mean what
[02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:24.380]  specifically is successful in court so far against them who holds the note
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:32.300]  first whoever's doing the foreclosure who are you how do you have agency to
[02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:36.260]  represent the principle and if you do have agency even if you can prove it
[02:43:36.260 --> 02:43:40.060]  most of these attorneys who are doing foreclosures don't have a contract with
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:46.060]  the principle they just find out which ones which loans are in foreclosure and
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:49.100]  they just pick them up run with them so they don't have real standing have no
[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:53.900]  standing at all and the trick of agency agency cannot be proven out of the mouth
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:57.980]  of the agent it must be proven out of the mouth of the principle so who the
[02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:02.620]  heck is the principle for the most part the one doing the foreclosure has
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:07.340]  it no clue and that's why the banks admit they've frozen the foreclosures most
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:10.420]  the big ones have Bank of America and the other four big ones is because they're
[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:15.260]  trying to find out who is the principle who has standing in court yes and their
[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:22.020]  problem is there's no way to do that it's lost they 40% of all of the notes
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:26.940]  have been destroyed so the solution is Congress passes a law Obama hasn't
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:31.260]  signed it yet saying mega banks can take anything they want they are now God
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:35.980]  like and and but then politically to try that that's gonna cause a revolution
[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:40.140]  even with brain dead fluoride heads it's time magazine headline prospect for
[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:45.580]  civil war in us doesn't seem that far-fetched exactly in looking at this
[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:51.660]  there may be another agenda it may be that we're simply pawns and to them
[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:56.900]  we're not that important I don't see that they have that the real money people
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.380]  the bill the birds and the other ones behind all of these they don't care if
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:06.820]  they sacrifice the lender and right now the one thing they could do to stabilize
[02:45:06.820 --> 02:45:15.340]  this country and still keep their money is forbid the payment of the credit
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:22.340]  default swaps derivatives if the insurer can no longer pay the derivative
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:28.740]  then the bank doesn't have that motivation to foreclose now it has to
[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:33.020]  foreclose based on the property itself now that's why the banks haven't cared
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:36.260]  about depressing the economy bow all of this and destroying their original
[02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:39.460]  investment because they're getting paid to the derivative they're getting paid
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:46.020]  through the nose big time we stopped that we stop a lot of their incentive
[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:50.660]  but what we're looking at is first thing we create remedy and we're stopping
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:55.540]  them we've stopped over 200 so far it takes a couple years to get through a
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:45:59.540]  suit so we've only been doing it since last November so we haven't had any go
[02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:03.300]  all the way through yet but almost everyone is still in their house and
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:07.300]  the only ones that aren't are the ones that were so close to to even and we're
[02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:10.860]  gonna talk about what you've done with over 200 cases specifically with much
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:13.460]  better results than almost everybody else out there but let's go to the people
[02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:17.860]  that did start this two years ago we're now seeing success success success by
[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:22.660]  proceeds by lawyers by law firms and you talk about being you know a plagiarist
[02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:27.700]  well it's not plagiarism in law it's called precedent but but but but so
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:31.140]  they're going in and saying show us the note what else are they doing yes and I
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:34.620]  say I'm a plagiarist and that's because I'm not going out and trying to find
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:40.900]  something new some magic trick that we can pull I'm just looking at what people
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:46.860]  have been winning we had two recent decisions in San Diego, California where
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:53.340]  they the guy filed bankruptcy and claimed that the lender had an unsecured note
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:58.580]  and he said oh no no I've got a secured note he said well show it to me prove
[02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:03.220]  that you have that you're the holder of this note and they may they may no
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:08.420]  attempt to because couldn't they knew they couldn't the real question the
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:16.260]  only question who is the true holder of the note the holder of the note can
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:20.740]  only be the holder of the note if somebody who held it legally put it in
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:25.100]  his hand and that person must have got it from somebody who held it legally all
[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:30.140]  the way back to the original lender and because of the the glut on Wall Street
[02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:34.980]  the glut of profit-taking that it was too much trouble to keep track of all of
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:41.140]  these notes when you put 10,000 notes in one pool and then you you sell that pool
[02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:45.540]  to different investors and then you transfer swap part of the pool to another
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:51.140]  pool another one back the law says that the sale of a security instrument based
[02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:56.780]  on real property must be filed with the County Recorders Office it must be a
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:02.260]  public sale so even if he comes to the to the court and says well I've got this
[02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:07.500]  note and I'm the holder of it we go look in the County Recorders Office and say
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:14.460]  well I don't see your name in there so either you hold this note illegally that
[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:21.580]  you don't hold it at all or if you do hold it then you hold it in in consequence
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:26.660]  of a ongoing criminal conspiracy to trade in illegal securities you come to the
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:31.380]  court with dirty hands and the court has no authority to let you profit from this
[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:35.780]  illegal scheme so either way they go they got a problem well studying property
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:39.220]  law a little bit myself correct me if I'm wrong but let's say properties change
[02:48:39.220 --> 02:48:43.300]  hands three or four times she's a piece of ranch property but you go back to the
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:47.620]  original contract if there was any fraud in that contract or fraud in the way the
[02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:51.820]  payments were done everything is null and void and it reverts back to whatever
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:55.900]  happened before that contract that's exactly where we're trying to take it
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:49:02.220]  precisely where what we do is demonstrate the fraud and in one of my
[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:06.380]  seminars that attorney came to me and she said when I listen to you it sound
[02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:10.100]  like you were sitting in in the courtroom listening to the judge chew me out
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:15.540]  because I could only claim that they didn't have standing you didn't bring
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:22.620]  me anything specific to this note what we do is look at the numbers look at the
[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:28.180]  the numbers they charge the amounts they charged you at closing when you sat
[02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:32.780]  down to closing do you remember the lender bringing in documentation to
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:38.700]  prove that all the fees he charged you were authorized by law were necessary
[02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:43.540]  the amounts charged were reasonable and that he didn't take an undisclosed markup
[02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:46.460]  on those because if they did that it breaks the law and now the whole things
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:50.460]  don't avoid yeah there's a whole bunch of them that what we do in developing the
[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:55.580]  fraud the first thing we want to do is look at the note and your HUD one settle
[02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:59.660]  I'm sorry your truth and lending statement truth and lending statement has
[02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:06.220]  the amount you actually pay on it the note has what you agreed to pay so one
[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:12.660]  of the first ones I looked at 159 thousand dollar note six percent truth
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:17.460]  and lending statement called 113 nine at six and a half well I asked Steve
[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:21.540]  about that he said well I saw that but I've read all these documents my brain
[02:50:21.540 --> 02:50:28.300]  was dead it looked like it would balance out in fact if they paid if Steve had
[02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:32.980]  paid what the truth in lending statement called for over the life of the note he
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:39.420]  would overpaid the note $44,000 we ran a calculation when I first ran it I looked
[02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:46.700]  at it and thought that can't be right I rerun it $47 overpayment every month he
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:53.340]  would have overpaid $44,000 on $115,000 note so it's just not just the fraud of
[02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:57.460]  the interest it's the fraud compounded for all the extra fees they add on that
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:03.300]  is patently illegal stay there over right back is it really possible to get out
[02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:07.220]  of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18 years ago we developed a

[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:48.420]  mortgages in mass they know that and they're trying to figure out you know
[02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:52.060]  some type of political remedy for this but continuing with some of the other
[02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:57.420]  victories that are being had against these criminals continue okay what we do
[02:54:57.420 --> 02:55:03.460]  is is we create a tool you can go into court with a tool that's very specific
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:09.060]  to your loan that sorts out the fraud in your note and we we're getting a lot of
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:12.260]  experience we've got a couple hundred out there we're getting a lot of
[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:16.980]  responses from the court and frankly the responses from the court are
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:23.020]  surprising me initially the courts will just blow us off or pro says they pay
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:27.780]  no attention they just deny it out of hand they're not doing that anymore
[02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:33.820]  whenever we get a denial we tend to get a four or five page brief telling us
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:40.260]  precisely why they denied it what exactly you have to give us so we can give you
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:46.340]  the ruling we want the indication is that the politicians are turning against
[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:53.660]  the lenders in order to try to buy favor with you and I they're going into this
[02:55:53.660 --> 02:55:58.140]  election added with a eleven percent approval rating ever remember the house
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:56:03.460]  is up for reelection and they can hear the toilet flush it so the courts are
[02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:07.820]  asking us to give them things they can use and that's exactly what we're doing
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:14.540]  generally if you have a $300,000 note I can generally find between one and 1.2
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:21.180]  million in fraud claim against the lender in the in the process of trying
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:26.340]  the case the other side will whittle that number down but we don't care because
[02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:31.140]  we know and they know on the first on on the front end if they ask where we got
[02:56:31.140 --> 02:56:36.260]  that number we can take them to that number to the penny show them exactly
[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:41.500]  how we got that by law and in the end you know there's only one number the
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:46.060]  lender is going to remember I'm sorry there's only one number the jury's going
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:50.140]  to remember and that's the number we walked in the door with so to be clear
[02:56:50.140 --> 02:56:54.940]  you the best defense is a good offense I mean you stall their foreclosures you
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:01.860]  show all the procedural error and fraud but you also countersue on the on their
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:06.460]  issues of fraud to basically create a new case and now you can depose them now
[02:57:06.460 --> 02:57:10.140]  you can force them to bring in lawyers now they're not just engaged in a
[02:57:10.140 --> 02:57:15.580]  predator action against you now you're fighting back exactly and we're going to
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:20.300]  go after the attorney firm and we're going to want him to tell us who the
[02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:25.540]  principal is because we want that principal deposed and then we're going
[02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:29.940]  to be taking criminal charges against him to the grand jury we'll get their
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:34.140]  attention but first we'll take it to the district attorney he'll refuse to act
[02:57:34.140 --> 02:57:38.980]  at least we hope he does and then we'll take it to the highest judge we can find
[02:57:38.980 --> 02:57:44.060]  and he'll refuse to act at least we hope he does and then we'll go to the grand
[02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:48.940]  jury with criminal charges against the judge accusing the judge of shielding
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:53.860]  the prosecutor from prosecution because the judge shielded his buddy lender from
[02:57:53.860 --> 02:57:56.460]  process and by the way this is all blustering fraud it's like when you try
[02:57:56.460 --> 02:57:59.340]  to go file a complaint on a police officer they'll tell you get out of here
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:04.700]  we won't let you by law they have to take it so yeah exactly what we do is we
[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:10.700]  turn their procedures on their head there are procedures in place to get you
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:16.820]  to help the police detect crime they want you to come in and report crime if
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:21.740]  you report crime they'll protect you problem is we start reporting crime
[02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:26.420]  against them then you get these policemen doing this little chicken dance
[02:58:26.420 --> 02:58:31.260]  because they don't know what to do and everybody that says anything to us that
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:36.140]  is the least bit threatening we file against them immediately back in 70
[02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:42.260]  seconds with Randy Kelton the fourth hour in overdrive

[02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:04.060]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to

[02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:57.860]  coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.860 --> 03:00:23.580]  Broadcasting Network network we're back live our number for Randy Kelton will be
[03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:27.380]  back in with us again next week we're in open the phones up you've got to clear
[03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:30.140]  the phone line start those we haven't gotten to other subjects if you're
[03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:33.420]  being foreclosed on or your house was paid off and they took it or multiple
[03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:36.980]  banks are trying to take it give quick simple questions for Randy Kelton
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:44.420]  800-259-9231 800-259-9331 but Randy during the one-minute break you were
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:48.100]  saying I need to make the point that stalling them engaging them in court
[03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:52.580]  that can keep you in the house for years even if you lose and then you end up
[03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:56.580]  winning by not having to pay that you know the note you end up as the market
[03:00:56.580 --> 03:01:01.820]  drops now you're punishing them explain that to people right now if you bought a
[03:01:01.820 --> 03:01:08.780]  home in in say 2007 for 300,000 try to get 200 for now you'll get more for it
[03:01:08.780 --> 03:01:13.980]  here in Austin than anywhere else New York Detroit Detroit you couldn't sell
[03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:19.580]  it at all California you might get a hundred within a year and a half to two
[03:01:19.580 --> 03:01:26.540]  years property values will drop up to a third of their bubble prices so time is
[03:01:26.540 --> 03:01:31.980]  on your side and the one thing everybody complains about in civil
[03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:37.820]  litigation is it takes forever and as you can see we've been talking about this
[03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:42.940]  for a while but it's beginning to happen the longer time goes on the more
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:49.780]  pressures put on the lender the more the property values drop you file suit
[03:01:49.780 --> 03:01:54.380]  against the lender you got a $300,000 property you stop paying the lender take
[03:01:54.380 --> 03:01:58.420]  that money and put it in gold silver something hard then in year and a half to
[03:01:58.420 --> 03:02:03.140]  two years you go to the lender and say yo pay you what either make me a deal I
[03:02:03.140 --> 03:02:08.660]  can't pass up or take this property I'll go buy the one out across the street with
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:14.380]  the money I didn't pay you so time is on our side and as anyone watching the news
[03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:20.380]  can see pressures on the lender the heat is on yeah they were invincible and now
[03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:25.380]  Bank of America all foreclosures halted the other four major banks all halted
[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:30.100]  and it's happening in Europe too yes and rather you use what I do use what
[03:02:30.100 --> 03:02:36.820]  somebody else's does sue them go on the internet use my favorite skill plagiarize
[03:02:36.820 --> 03:02:41.980]  go find suits that have been filed find the elements that match what you're
[03:02:41.980 --> 03:02:47.460]  doing put together a suit and sue them but stop them if you don't stop them
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:52.140]  your children and your grandchildren are going to suffer the result of it if the
[03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:56.060]  more people we can keep in their properties the less severe this
[03:02:56.060 --> 03:03:01.420]  depression is going to be and the shorter it's going to be we're trying to
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:08.580]  doing everything we can to stop every one we can as fast as we can so however
[03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:14.380]  you do it so I'm good suit bad suit in the end in the end it matters some but
[03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:19.020]  not a whole lot it'll get everything stopped and if you're in foreclosure if
[03:03:19.020 --> 03:03:22.540]  right up the edge if they're about to go to the courthouse steps and sell your
[03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:27.180]  property go get your red manila folder stick it full of papers run down on a
[03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:30.380]  courthouse steps when they call your property step up and wave that folder
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:34.140]  at them tell them there's a claim against the property you buy the property you
[03:03:34.140 --> 03:03:39.300]  buy the claim and it's been on the news the problem with buying the property
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:44.980]  right now that will stop the bank from selling to a third party you do not want
[03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:48.780]  it to go to a third party stop that forced to bank to buy it back sue the
[03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:54.100]  bank now you stopped him it doesn't statutorily stop the bank but it
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:59.660]  realistically does because he has it now if he forces you out the property
[03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:04.980]  becomes empty and he's responsible for maintaining it and you can't ensure an
[03:04:04.980 --> 03:04:09.420]  empty property that's what's keeping everyone in the houses that's the reality
[03:04:09.420 --> 03:04:16.420]  sue them quickly as these new issues come out the likelihood of the banks
[03:04:16.420 --> 03:04:21.540]  coming to the table and making a deal increased dramatically and we need to
[03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:27.340]  stop as many as we can we have about 200 in the works right now and all but
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:32.660]  about four or five are still in their houses one of my bane people lost their
[03:04:32.660 --> 03:04:36.860]  house but it was incredibly illegal Colorado has been the worst they don't
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:40.940]  care what the law says or at least they didn't they did whatever they wanted to
[03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:45.620]  now all of a sudden well by people coming up the the courts it is forcing
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:49.140]  this fraud out in the open instead of people just rolling over and going okay
[03:04:49.140 --> 03:04:52.660]  take my house and the fact that banks are taking houses that are totally paid
[03:04:52.660 --> 03:04:56.100]  for and they don't have the note the fact that they were so greedy that they
[03:04:56.100 --> 03:04:59.500]  aren't just taking some guy who's really upside down they're taking people where
[03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:03.740]  they have no claim we'll be right back in a few minutes you may not be thinking

[03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:13.660]  dealing with a corrupt system I go back to Bloomberg two months ago and again
[03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:17.820]  two weeks ago reports were prudential admitted in court which is another
[03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:22.820]  variant of these banks that they and many other major insurance companies made
[03:09:22.820 --> 03:09:27.940]  a deal 11 years ago right when they are with a Glass-Steagall to to have contracts
[03:09:27.940 --> 03:09:31.420]  that they're allowed to break with the 6,000 dead and dying veterans from World
[03:09:31.420 --> 03:09:36.020]  War two up to today and they just take their insurance money just like they're
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:39.580]  announcing oh we fired you from this job you've been here in seven years ten
[03:09:39.580 --> 03:09:43.700]  years 20 years we're not gonna give you your pension money now you didn't read
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:47.180]  the fine print we changed and I've seen them in the last six years changing all
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:51.860]  these rules but they're not laws and so the courts are there these are
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:55.540]  politicians they're just there to ram through whatever they're told to do
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:10:00.020]  people are standing up and saying no now now give me an example because you're
[03:10:00.020 --> 03:10:03.460]  talking about just any suit to block them for a while but but but and I'm
[03:10:03.460 --> 03:10:07.540]  sure it varies case to case but a few case point examples of an average
[03:10:07.540 --> 03:10:11.380]  mortgage with what they're doing they've lied in the fees they've lied and how
[03:10:11.380 --> 03:10:15.300]  they sold the note to others they don't have the original note they don't have
[03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:20.260]  standing let's say Randy Kelton owned a $300,000 house and you were three months
[03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:24.620]  behind and they were starting procedures to foreclose what would you do first
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:29.420]  thing I would do is determine the fraud they committed when they created the
[03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:37.820]  note get you a good dollar figure to come into court with and then look on the
[03:10:37.820 --> 03:10:43.900]  internet there's plenty of information on how to make an argument that you have
[03:10:43.900 --> 03:10:48.500]  not proven that you have authority to raise this issue and again you've got
[03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:50.660]  all this on your computer and we were gonna show us that we're gonna do it
[03:10:50.660 --> 03:10:54.740]  next week is it so complex because I want to load it as exhibits into our
[03:10:54.740 --> 03:10:57.860]  computer so we can just pull it up on screen not just aim a camera at the
[03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:05.020]  screen yes but I have a very in very large spreadsheet that I use to work out
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:11.940]  the the fraud claim against the lender and frankly in using it we use every
[03:11:11.940 --> 03:11:16.140]  stinking rotten low-down lawyer trick we can find there's something real
[03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:21.380]  satisfying about turning this back on these guys and they seem to be very
[03:11:21.380 --> 03:11:25.820]  accommodating they seem to go out of their way to see how stupid they can be
[03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:30.740]  and we greatly appreciate that and I want to thank them for it we well they've
[03:11:30.740 --> 03:11:34.020]  been getting away with murder for so long they're arrogant they're arrogant
[03:11:34.020 --> 03:11:37.780]  they're accustomed to it now all of a sudden the tide is changing we have an
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:42.300]  opportunity now people just begun to fight and it's frozen them originally
[03:11:42.300 --> 03:11:47.940]  when I first started this 95% of all mortgages went uncontested the last
[03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:54.740]  figure I saw was 53% the courts are getting flooded with suits and that's
[03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:57.260]  the best thing to help us because the courts are going to be going to these
[03:11:57.260 --> 03:12:01.700]  lenders and say you got to do something to get these out of my court and that's
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:07.060]  going to develop more test cases to find out what's them what's the real
[03:12:07.060 --> 03:12:14.020]  Achilles heel yes and the part of the difficulty was that were the judges the
[03:12:14.020 --> 03:12:20.380]  judges were accustomed to ruling a certain way and judges are terrified
[03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:24.380]  about making precedent they don't want to be the one that the Supreme Court
[03:12:24.380 --> 03:12:30.340]  overrules so they would tend to rule the way other judges have ruled well now
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:34.420]  that tide is changing we have more and more ruling in our favor and there's
[03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:39.420]  precedence against the banks now exactly and it's building it every week we have
[03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:44.660]  more judges ruling against the lenders this is a tide that's building and we
[03:12:44.660 --> 03:12:49.460]  have an opportunity here and I'm here because I want everybody to stop their
[03:12:49.460 --> 03:12:54.060]  mortgage to stop their foreclosure rather use me somebody else I don't care
[03:12:54.060 --> 03:12:59.580]  I got more business I can do but do something do not let these people steal
[03:12:59.580 --> 03:13:02.820]  your property so I mean quantify it simply I know each case it's different
[03:13:02.820 --> 03:13:07.580]  but but so they've you know they've lied on the where they sold the mortgage
[03:13:07.580 --> 03:13:11.220]  they've lied that they that they have standing they've lied that they you know
[03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:15.060]  have that chain of title they've lied in the fines and fees and broken the law
[03:13:15.060 --> 03:13:22.300]  what do you do we charge them initially with civil fraud on a number of counts
[03:13:22.300 --> 03:13:27.180]  it's just too complex to get in all the issues you have the truth in lending act
[03:13:27.180 --> 03:13:32.580]  which is generally too late to claim after three years but we can still go
[03:13:32.580 --> 03:13:37.220]  back after them for common law fraud for fraud by non-disclosure breach of
[03:13:37.220 --> 03:13:45.060]  fiduciary duty breach of good faith and fair dealing in each of the states there
[03:13:45.060 --> 03:13:49.380]  is a whole family of fraud with brokerage firms banks assessors and others
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:53.860]  they're held to a higher standard when they use your ignorance against you
[03:13:53.860 --> 03:13:58.740]  absolutely most people when they go into a foreclosure each or a mortgage issue
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:03.220]  they only deal with licensed professionals you deal with licensed
[03:14:03.220 --> 03:14:07.500]  professionals who are licensed by the government you have a reasonable
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:13.980]  expectation good faith and fair dealing from those people and they turned out our
[03:14:13.980 --> 03:14:20.580]  government's supervisory role was just non-existent they allowed them to do
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:26.420]  anything they wanted but that's changing now now we can actually get these
[03:14:26.420 --> 03:14:32.020]  adjudicated we actually had one case thrown out here in Austin by a certain
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:37.660]  judge federal judge whose name starts with an S ends with a K but ends with an
[03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:43.380]  S but I won't mention his name threatened a client with sanctions if he
[03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:50.340]  didn't take out every reference to criminal acts by the defendants I was
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:57.380]  astounded we're going to prepare tampering with a witness obstruction of
[03:14:57.380 --> 03:15:04.140]  justice against the judge so you want to dance well now we get to lead but there
[03:15:04.140 --> 03:15:08.940]  are a few judges who haven't got it yet but most of them around the country are
[03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:15.500]  beginning to realize that the political tide is changing that the
[03:15:15.500 --> 03:15:18.580]  lenders have committed fraud on every case and primarily what you've got
[03:15:18.580 --> 03:15:25.660]  fraud on the front end they lied to you and at every case the broker who brought
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:29.340]  the loan to you lied to you that's enough to get the whole contract thrown
[03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:35.860]  out the lender lied to you the appraiser lied to you the trustee lied to you
[03:15:35.860 --> 03:15:40.700]  everybody lied and people should have known when the appraiser and the broker
[03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:45.420]  and the bank comes and says lie honey put this house is worth more put on here
[03:15:45.420 --> 03:15:49.260]  you make more you should know if they're telling you to lie they're lying to you
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:54.300]  yeah and when the bank told you oh you can't hire an appraiser we have to do
[03:15:54.300 --> 03:16:01.140]  that only the banks can hire appraiser that should be a great red flag and it's
[03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:06.020]  it's worse than than we've been a had had time to produce here they produced
[03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:12.980]  that overinflation overinflated appraisal so that they could defraud the
[03:16:12.980 --> 03:16:18.860]  bankruptcy courts and the IRS on the back end you ever notice how all of
[03:16:18.860 --> 03:16:23.140]  these mortgage companies are going out of business they're creative fortune in
[03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:26.780]  illegal income and they keep bankrupting they move it out the back door
[03:16:26.780 --> 03:16:32.540]  all the that's we had a rich dad poor dad on he explained that's how this is all
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:36.260]  done they just keep rolling the debt while the profit goes out the back door
[03:16:36.260 --> 03:16:42.700]  they get this overinflated appraisal and then they had take the product and
[03:16:42.700 --> 03:16:47.660]  when the mortgage company sells the security instrument to the special
[03:16:47.660 --> 03:16:52.740]  purpose vehicle it's not a arms-length transaction as it's generally the
[03:16:52.740 --> 03:16:56.500]  special purpose vehicle actually owns the mortgage company and the mortgage
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:17:01.300]  company then reduces the value of the property to the to the proper value and
[03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:05.900]  shows a great loss on it when he sells it to the security to the special purpose
[03:17:05.900 --> 03:17:10.500]  vehicle he takes a loss on every transaction and he goes out of business
[03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:16.500]  and he hides all this extra profit he uses the bankruptcy courts to go out of
[03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:22.420]  business and lose all his debt and thereby the defraud the IRS in the
[03:17:22.420 --> 03:17:29.100]  process every single step that I've looked at well I mean but but but that's
[03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:31.900]  what our guest was saying he's saying the elite have written these rules for
[03:17:31.900 --> 03:17:35.300]  themselves and then they control the regulator so they're always allowed to
[03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:41.860]  get away with it we had a judge in California tell a litigant you need to
[03:17:41.860 --> 03:17:46.780]  get this to the federal court because the banks have so arranged the laws in
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:52.940]  California you have absolutely no chance that's another issue you go right to
[03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:55.060]  federal court yes we go right to federal court
[03:17:55.060 --> 03:18:00.500]  primary reason is people are terrified of the courts they're terrified of the
[03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:08.180]  banks and when you walk into a federal court pro se people come away amazed at
[03:18:08.180 --> 03:18:13.260]  how professional how polite and how helpful they are it actually gives you
[03:18:13.260 --> 03:18:19.180]  some confidence that there is something you can do because there is helps you
[03:18:19.180 --> 03:18:25.140]  get over the propaganda the more we go after them the more the courts to start
[03:18:25.140 --> 03:18:30.420]  ruling in our favor and it's happening we're up to almost 50% of all the
[03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:35.820]  foreclosures are being resisted all this easy profits going away now if we can
[03:18:35.820 --> 03:18:41.100]  get people to start filing criminal charges against these lenders that will
[03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:44.540]  bring them to the table well that's what Ron Paul many others have said he's
[03:18:44.540 --> 03:18:47.980]  he said he's talked about the state grand juries and others it's up to us we the
[03:18:47.980 --> 03:18:52.220]  people to politically demand that the law be enforced and that these crooks go
[03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:56.340]  to jail that would end this all out of hand very quickly yes and we have a plan
[03:18:56.340 --> 03:19:00.380]  to get that done the judges and the prosecutors don't want to go after the
[03:19:00.380 --> 03:19:07.740]  banks because the banks invest a lot of money in their campaign funds however if
[03:19:07.740 --> 03:19:13.620]  we can put the judge on a legal dime you know I tell people in my seminars when
[03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:17.780]  I do do process seminars when I walk into a courthouse I'm the baddest motor
[03:19:17.780 --> 03:19:23.100]  scooter in the building and there's only one reason I am because I'm nobody I'm
[03:19:23.100 --> 03:19:29.780]  not a prosecutor a lawyer a clerk a freedoms just another word for nothing
[03:19:29.780 --> 03:19:36.660]  left to lose well I'm the citizen the highest guy in the place the judge has
[03:19:36.660 --> 03:19:42.140]  no claim on me whatsoever as a citizen walking into the courthouse I'm the
[03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:46.380]  only one and climb right down his throat I can drag him in front of a grand
[03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:51.100]  jury there's nothing he can do about it and they do not want you to know that's
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:54.940]  right the lawyers are all part of the bar and inside baseball they're all playing
[03:19:54.940 --> 03:19:58.260]  golf together Clay all right we'll be right back Randy stay there we're gonna

[03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:24.460]  we'll be back in with us next i think thursday thursday's a good day one to
[03:24:24.460 --> 03:24:28.060]  three again we'll do two hours because there's just so much of this to cover
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:32.780]  but to quantify it and correct me if i'm wrong if people go in and beg the lender
[03:24:32.780 --> 03:24:37.500]  or beg the mortgage broker or or or just call the police that doesn't do anything
[03:24:37.500 --> 03:24:40.140]  because they know you're ignorant and most of them are ignorant too
[03:24:40.140 --> 03:24:43.180]  uh you know it's just a system of ignorance it's at the top that it's
[03:24:43.180 --> 03:24:48.300]  all all you know been thought out but by suing or by filing motions
[03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:51.980]  you now put into a whole nother arena where they actually have to at least
[03:24:51.980 --> 03:24:56.780]  address the law at certain levels and so there's a record and that stalls them
[03:24:56.780 --> 03:24:59.740]  so at least you're not having to pay your rent while you're in there
[03:24:59.740 --> 03:25:04.060]  and the stock and and the market's going down so they're losing in the end
[03:25:04.060 --> 03:25:08.780]  precisely once you take them on there are a lot of different
[03:25:08.780 --> 03:25:12.220]  supposed ways of dealing with that one of the
[03:25:12.220 --> 03:25:16.380]  the things that a lot of people are doing are administrative procedures
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:19.900]  ministry administrative procedures look great on paper
[03:25:19.900 --> 03:25:23.100]  but the lender will just ignore them because they have no
[03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:27.500]  legal teeth until you drag them into court with the summons
[03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:30.540]  you don't have their attention you're physically taking their time now
[03:25:30.540 --> 03:25:36.540]  exactly and now especially we're taking an approach that normally isn't taken
[03:25:36.540 --> 03:25:39.900]  we're taking on the criminal side as well as the the
[03:25:39.900 --> 03:25:44.140]  civil uh this judge here in austin who saw it
[03:25:44.140 --> 03:25:46.780]  really didn't like it the first time he saw it well
[03:25:46.780 --> 03:25:50.620]  sorry baba that ain't going to get better we're going to introduce him to
[03:25:50.620 --> 03:25:53.900]  the criminal side uh you know the cigarette companies
[03:25:53.900 --> 03:25:58.860]  the government sued them three times the cigarette companies had
[03:25:58.860 --> 03:26:04.140]  bottomless pockets and beat them three times until they came back with riko
[03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:09.020]  and then the the executives said whoa hold on here
[03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:13.100]  we can go to jail over this one now all of a sudden they come to the table
[03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:16.060]  and we intend to start bringing them to the table
[03:26:16.060 --> 03:26:19.820]  by bringing them before grain because if they broke the law on the fees and they
[03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:22.620]  broke the law on trying to come to take your house when they don't have the
[03:26:22.620 --> 03:26:25.340]  note and the list just goes on you've got them
[03:26:25.340 --> 03:26:28.540]  resistance is victory it doesn't it doesn't mean everybody's gonna win
[03:26:28.540 --> 03:26:31.340]  it means everybody standing up or even a big percentage
[03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:34.700]  i'll bring them to their knees they're already near their knees right now
[03:26:34.700 --> 03:26:38.700]  suspending most foreclosures yes and and this has only happened
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:42.780]  because people were resisting people were fighting them people were bringing
[03:26:42.780 --> 03:26:45.580]  them to court and making them and because you're following the law
[03:26:45.580 --> 03:26:49.100]  they've got to go to congress to try to get the law changed but is congress
[03:26:49.100 --> 03:26:52.140]  gonna make the decision to say okay fraud's the limit
[03:26:52.140 --> 03:26:56.220]  you can do anything you want that will destroy the entire system so that's
[03:26:56.220 --> 03:26:59.500]  it's really got a problem a while back i was in north
[03:26:59.500 --> 03:27:04.780]  carolina there was a primary runoff two incumbents in the runoff
[03:27:04.780 --> 03:27:09.180]  it was clear the only reason they made the runoff was because so many people
[03:27:09.180 --> 03:27:11.660]  ran against them they split the vote against them
[03:27:11.660 --> 03:27:16.220]  they lost terribly in the runoff and the exit polls all said the same thing
[03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:22.060]  they voted for the bailout congress can hear the toilet flushing we have an
[03:27:22.060 --> 03:27:28.620]  incredible opportunity right now and with them turning on the lenders
[03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:32.300]  once we get a new set of representatives in
[03:27:32.300 --> 03:27:36.220]  this could be the one where everybody gets flushed now i understand we'll
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:39.500]  hire we'll elect more politicians and they're corrupt
[03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:43.660]  but it takes them a while to get organized and in that period in between
[03:27:43.660 --> 03:27:47.420]  we have opportunity for some great change our ancestors have whooped
[03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:50.220]  tyranny over and over again because they had a fight in spirit
[03:27:50.220 --> 03:27:52.940]  and when you got right on your side you can't be stopped let's take a first
[03:27:52.940 --> 03:27:55.900]  call before you go to break here bill in florida you're on the air with randy
[03:27:55.900 --> 03:28:00.860]  kelton go ahead hi how you doing good you know it's amazing everywhere you
[03:28:00.860 --> 03:28:05.420]  turn you just see more and more and more
[03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:11.500]  my concern though is and all sincerity when this gets to the level of the
[03:28:11.500 --> 03:28:14.940]  water rising so much and it creates the backlog
[03:28:14.940 --> 03:28:18.140]  because don't forget when when the economic thing came to a halt in
[03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:22.060]  september 2008 it was hank paulson that marched
[03:28:22.060 --> 03:28:25.180]  over to the white house and said mr president we have a problem
[03:28:25.180 --> 03:28:28.060]  he said we're gonna have martial law and blood in the streets
[03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:32.620]  well yeah exactly and then on that original tarp note that was submitted
[03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:36.140]  the very language that was used on the tarp note
[03:28:36.140 --> 03:28:40.060]  was picked up out of one of the last executive orders and if you go to google
[03:28:40.060 --> 03:28:44.140]  and just type in fema and executive orders and read yeah during any
[03:28:44.140 --> 03:28:47.820]  emergency including financial they can suspend the congress
[03:28:47.820 --> 03:28:51.580]  exactly congress isn't even allowed to review it for six months
[03:28:51.580 --> 03:28:59.180]  yep okay so at that point in time what what actually transpires well we're
[03:28:59.180 --> 03:29:02.620]  forcing them to come out with total naked tyranny
[03:29:02.620 --> 03:29:06.700]  see i mean and look their tyrants they're coming down on us we can lay down
[03:29:06.700 --> 03:29:09.740]  or we can get up to say i don't know who's going to win this but i'm open in
[03:29:09.740 --> 03:29:13.260]  the can let's go i mean you know i mean that's what it comes down to
[03:29:13.260 --> 03:29:16.220]  i'm gonna force you to come right out in the open
[03:29:16.220 --> 03:29:21.500]  precisely when it when it when it backs up to the point that that panic has
[03:29:21.500 --> 03:29:25.100]  come about then they have by executive order by the
[03:29:25.100 --> 03:29:30.060]  president's decree if he declares a national emergency and declares
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:33.180]  martial law fema takes over all the banks fema
[03:29:33.180 --> 03:29:36.460]  takes over communication stay there but this is exactly how we open this
[03:29:36.460 --> 03:29:39.740]  interview an hour and a half ago and you're absolutely right about this but
[03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:42.140]  they were going to do that anyway but let's let's talk to you more on the
[03:29:42.140 --> 03:29:52.060]  other side and get randy's take on what you're talking about
[03:29:52.060 --> 03:29:55.900]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:55.900 --> 03:30:00.940]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:33:28.380 --> 03:33:32.140]  deal with other you know legal issues he's had for years in his radio show
[03:33:32.140 --> 03:33:34.140]  but they're going to be adding and building the next week they weren't
[03:33:34.140 --> 03:33:35.900]  going to launch it till next week but you can
[03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:39.260]  sign on to a mailing list or if you've got any questions or want to talk
[03:33:39.260 --> 03:33:45.660]  to randy give folks that website yes that's mortgage for mortgage crime.com
[03:33:45.660 --> 03:33:50.300]  mortgagecrime.com mortgagecrime.com now
[03:33:50.300 --> 03:33:54.380]  i want to go back to the calls to bill steve ben kathy and many others
[03:33:54.380 --> 03:33:57.580]  that are patiently holding their specific questions for you but
[03:33:57.580 --> 03:34:00.540]  what he raises is central that's how we started the interview
[03:34:00.540 --> 03:34:03.740]  was they're already going to congress trying to get a blank check
[03:34:03.740 --> 03:34:06.060]  just like with the bailout money they could do whatever they wanted with it
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:10.220]  it was all secret now the sec and the banker reorganization of this year
[03:34:10.220 --> 03:34:13.580]  has more secrecy can't get in trouble for protecting made off
[03:34:13.580 --> 03:34:17.820]  but again that's open more fraud that's that that's open tyranny
[03:34:17.820 --> 03:34:21.900]  and so yes they have sold this they've meant to make it unravel
[03:34:21.900 --> 03:34:25.980]  they were going to do it regardless uh and so i mean what do you say to what
[03:34:25.980 --> 03:34:29.660]  bill was stating well if if it's going to come out
[03:34:29.660 --> 03:34:34.540]  we needed to come out now i've been doing a radio show for several years
[03:34:34.540 --> 03:34:40.620]  and i see the the individual's perspective changing there used to be a
[03:34:40.620 --> 03:34:43.420]  lot of talk about people who are asleep people who are awake
[03:34:43.420 --> 03:34:48.060]  i never hear that anymore this sleeping giant's waking up and he is not happy
[03:34:48.060 --> 03:34:51.740]  the question is how awake are they yes it's degrees
[03:34:51.740 --> 03:34:55.740]  but with the kind of publicity we've been getting lately
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:35:00.380]  this is going to be waking everyone up and there was one report i found most
[03:35:00.380 --> 03:35:05.340]  comforting that there was a report that the
[03:35:05.340 --> 03:35:09.100]  they were concerned that the united states
[03:35:09.100 --> 03:35:13.900]  was purchasing had in the last year had purchased more weapons than all three
[03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:17.820]  of the largest armies in the world combined
[03:35:17.820 --> 03:35:21.260]  good news that's the american people yes american people
[03:35:21.260 --> 03:35:25.580]  that were there are alarming they're arming themselves at an alarming rate
[03:35:25.580 --> 03:35:29.020]  and and you know kaiser was making jokes oh you won't use them we hope that isn't
[03:35:29.020 --> 03:35:32.460]  the case the point is the biggest arms purchasing
[03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:35.660]  spree in the last two years ever is only accelerating
[03:35:35.660 --> 03:35:39.660]  and if one percent of those people decided to stand up and defend themselves
[03:35:39.660 --> 03:35:43.100]  out of 300 million americans that's three million people and we're hoping it
[03:35:43.100 --> 03:35:47.100]  doesn't go there but fema is not all powerful a lot of this bill
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:50.460]  is calling their bluff because we know they're going to do this to us
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:54.460]  regardless so let's see fema try to seize everything and take everything over
[03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:57.500]  i mean they're already in this process what's your take on that bill
[03:35:57.500 --> 03:36:00.780]  and or where do you think we ought to go with this
[03:36:00.780 --> 03:36:05.740]  well you know that if you look back and and and my troubles by the way i sent
[03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:10.140]  an email to jaren at your producer there
[03:36:10.140 --> 03:36:13.660]  yesterday and i also left a phone number because i'd love to talk to you
[03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:17.660]  after the fact i left a phone number with janet over there at gcn
[03:36:17.660 --> 03:36:24.300]  um my concern and and i i really say this genuinely i grew up in manhattan
[03:36:24.300 --> 03:36:28.460]  and i'm i'm aware of a lot of things that transpired there and
[03:36:28.460 --> 03:36:34.620]  their trojan horse was the fact of 535 four color
[03:36:34.620 --> 03:36:39.180]  covered published books that were put on all of congress
[03:36:39.180 --> 03:36:43.820]  and that was the patriot act and that was their trojan horse
[03:36:43.820 --> 03:36:49.980]  and they were told don't read it don't debate it don't review it sign it
[03:36:49.980 --> 03:36:54.780]  now those books were put on their desk two weeks after
[03:36:54.780 --> 03:36:59.820]  911 and the average person doesn't even think about that
[03:36:59.820 --> 03:37:04.140]  two weeks no 535 four it had already been written yeah
[03:37:04.140 --> 03:37:08.060]  but but i mean so i mean what so from your view what would you do bill do we
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:11.740]  do people just let them take houses that are even paid for i mean just give them
[03:37:11.740 --> 03:37:15.260]  everything oh no what i think what needs to be dealt with
[03:37:15.260 --> 03:37:19.420]  is to stop the trojan horse they attempted this back and they approved it
[03:37:19.420 --> 03:37:22.620]  for a period of while and then it got rescinded
[03:37:22.620 --> 03:37:27.500]  and that was in and mccarran did the internal security act and he was a
[03:37:27.500 --> 03:37:30.860]  senator that was good buddies with mccarthy
[03:37:30.860 --> 03:37:35.820]  and you know here they've still kept the name at the airport in los vegas named
[03:37:35.820 --> 03:37:41.100]  after him mccarran international and that act was repealed within a
[03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:45.020]  year later the majority probably 95 98 percent of it was
[03:37:45.020 --> 03:37:49.900]  based it was unconstitutional sure you're saying they're going to try to
[03:37:49.900 --> 03:37:53.980]  use the marcho law secret police system to enforce this and there's no way
[03:37:53.980 --> 03:37:56.860]  they're going to get away with it i mean they're not going to blow stuff up and
[03:37:56.860 --> 03:38:01.180]  say people that don't want to hand over their houses or the terrorist i mean
[03:38:01.180 --> 03:38:05.340]  they politically don't have the will we know we're going down this road
[03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:08.620]  we can lay down to them or we can stand up and expose their fraud but i see what
[03:38:08.620 --> 03:38:12.300]  you're saying uh any comments on that randy them we're going back to calls
[03:38:12.300 --> 03:38:15.820]  well i'm as afraid of the military commission's act as
[03:38:15.820 --> 03:38:19.260]  anybody else is when i read it it terrified me
[03:38:19.260 --> 03:38:26.220]  and what else do we do do we stand by and watch it go by or do we stand up and
[03:38:26.220 --> 03:38:29.900]  give them reason not to try to hey we're the good guys and if i'm here
[03:38:29.900 --> 03:38:33.340]  exposing tyranny and they come shoot me in the head that's just the way it is
[03:38:33.340 --> 03:38:36.780]  i mean at a certain point you just got a man up and say look you're a bunch of
[03:38:36.780 --> 03:38:41.660]  criminal nutcases and it's over i mean they're so arrogant ladies and
[03:38:41.660 --> 03:38:44.940]  gentlemen they're so arrogant that they're taking the death
[03:38:44.940 --> 03:38:49.660]  benefits the insurance of six million veterans and signed a secret deal now
[03:38:49.660 --> 03:38:52.380]  public and that's not a big issue i mean
[03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:55.500]  none of us are safe with these people these are mad men
[03:38:55.500 --> 03:38:59.500]  i mean they're just full of arrogance yes and
[03:38:59.500 --> 03:39:05.340]  i see the political nature of the public changing people are getting upset
[03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:08.460]  and and i'm a veteran and i've dealt with veteran groups
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:13.420]  and i felt like the veterans seem to be the most whipped group in the country
[03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:17.820]  but when i've talked to veterans lately they are really getting peoed
[03:39:17.820 --> 03:39:20.780]  and i'm i suspect when you get all the veterans groups
[03:39:20.780 --> 03:39:25.340]  up and active that they will change a lot themselves there are a lot of
[03:39:25.340 --> 03:39:30.300]  pressures moving to neutralize the kinds of injustices these people are
[03:39:30.300 --> 03:39:33.820]  trying to do for the first time in a long time i'm
[03:39:33.820 --> 03:39:38.300]  beginning to have some some confidence well look at new ham shirts
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:41.340]  you know they put out a false report that he was a convicted person wasn't
[03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:44.620]  true everybody thought he wasn't going to get the baby back and the irish has
[03:39:44.620 --> 03:39:47.740]  got the baby back because the system's getting scared
[03:39:47.740 --> 03:39:50.860]  also a lot of judges are looking around and going am i on the right side of
[03:39:50.860 --> 03:39:53.740]  this yes and uh the supreme court in
[03:39:53.740 --> 03:39:59.820]  connecticut is hearing a case where the attorney general
[03:39:59.820 --> 03:40:06.540]  threw out the ballots for the libertarian party candidates
[03:40:06.540 --> 03:40:10.220]  a week before the the final date they just they claimed they lost everything
[03:40:10.220 --> 03:40:13.420]  they've been throwing the uh overseas military ballots out everywhere
[03:40:13.420 --> 03:40:20.140]  and dan real went after him prosaid filed his pleadings with the court
[03:40:20.140 --> 03:40:24.860]  the attorney general didn't answer so he's going before the supreme court
[03:40:24.860 --> 03:40:31.740]  they answered with a memorandum of law but no affidavit of fact they have no
[03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:35.340]  fact to go before the court they just didn't they were afraid
[03:40:35.340 --> 03:40:38.700]  they didn't produce a lot of garbage because
[03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:42.140]  they were clearly afraid that if they lied to this court this court would come
[03:40:42.140 --> 03:40:45.820]  back and get them and he may beat them hands down
[03:40:45.820 --> 03:40:49.340]  this was it's absolutely totally unexpected the point is they've been
[03:40:49.340 --> 03:40:52.780]  getting away with murder forever we just got to stand up and even if we don't
[03:40:52.780 --> 03:40:56.140]  win every time we're pointing out the fraud let's go to another call here
[03:40:56.140 --> 03:40:58.220]  let's talk to steve in pennsylvania we gotta hurry now
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:00.780]  steve thanks for holding her on the air with randy kelton
[03:41:00.780 --> 03:41:04.380]  hey hi what's going on over there good welcome
[03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:09.580]  hey uh i have a question here for randy and i really appreciate it if you'd
[03:41:09.580 --> 03:41:13.500]  give me an honest answer here i have a sister
[03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:19.340]  that uh lives up in uh new york city and she had a home worth three hundred
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:22.700]  thousand dollars and it was paid for
[03:41:22.700 --> 03:41:26.300]  and one day they received a note in the mail saying that they were going to
[03:41:26.300 --> 03:41:31.260]  foreclose on a property now it came out in court
[03:41:31.260 --> 03:41:35.980]  that a uh piver attorney which was forged
[03:41:35.980 --> 03:41:39.980]  uh by somebody else that they refinanced uh
[03:41:39.980 --> 03:41:44.220]  and took loans out not once but twice oh yeah i read about this i get calls and
[03:41:44.220 --> 03:41:48.300]  read about this this is constant but three times and then they foreclosed
[03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:51.180]  and they went when they went to court and everything
[03:41:51.180 --> 03:41:56.460]  the other person involved uh also was getting section eight money for three
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:41:59.980]  or four different tenants supposedly living in the property
[03:41:59.980 --> 03:42:05.180]  and when it came to court uh uh she took the the fifth
[03:42:05.180 --> 03:42:09.420]  you know uh saying she's not going to testify in court because she don't want
[03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:13.580]  to discriminate herself uh my sister went to the fbi went to
[03:42:13.580 --> 03:42:17.340]  district attorney so let me ask you what happened they ended up taking the house
[03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:21.100]  yeah she lost the house in fact when they moved
[03:42:21.100 --> 03:42:25.420]  uh well when the other people that was living it was like a duplex lived in
[03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:28.460]  in the other understand what's the what's the honest answer you want what's the
[03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:34.700]  question well uh my sister has a handicap child
[03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:40.460]  and she lost everything and in fact they even put her in jail for uh uh on her
[03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:43.740]  property taking pictures as as they were moving out
[03:42:43.740 --> 03:42:47.020]  the other people living in a house yeah that's standard so what's the what's the
[03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:50.460]  question well where where does she go from here
[03:42:50.460 --> 03:42:53.900]  i mean nobody would help her the fbi or how long
[03:42:53.900 --> 03:42:58.780]  how long has this been uh about a year and a half ago okay first thing she
[03:42:58.780 --> 03:43:03.820]  needed to do is her homework and it's hard for me to to give you a
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:08.140]  a bad answer because this has been through court so i would need to see
[03:43:08.140 --> 03:43:13.100]  what has actually been filed in the court uh primarily what i would want to
[03:43:13.100 --> 03:43:18.380]  look at doing is going after the court itself the court has two duties
[03:43:18.380 --> 03:43:21.660]  as a trial court he must determine the facts in accordance with the rules of
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:24.700]  evidence and then he must apply the law as it
[03:43:24.700 --> 03:43:28.620]  comes to him to the facts in the case if he fails to do so you can go for the
[03:43:28.620 --> 03:43:34.300]  judge itself if this is as improper as it sounds
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:37.820]  probably the best place to go initially is after the judge
[03:43:37.820 --> 03:43:40.700]  but it's it's hard to give you an answer one way yeah because it's like
[03:43:40.700 --> 03:43:44.620]  diagnosing somebody over the telephone but this is kind of a microcosm of what
[03:43:44.620 --> 03:43:47.740]  the derivatives are where they sell it to all these different banks and even
[03:43:47.740 --> 03:43:50.380]  though you've already paid off one bank the other comes to get it because they
[03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:53.340]  think they own your house and now the derivatives have gone down they're not
[03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:56.380]  getting their money it's the same thing here some scammer i keep
[03:43:56.380 --> 03:44:00.140]  reading about these in the news goes and says they have your house they get
[03:44:00.140 --> 03:44:04.380]  loans on the house that's very common and then they default on those and you're
[03:44:04.380 --> 03:44:07.100]  like no i'm the real person i live here this is wrong
[03:44:07.100 --> 03:44:10.860]  they don't care the court says doesn't matter boom we're giving it to the bank
[03:44:10.860 --> 03:44:15.500]  yes they they're going to say it goes to the person who has a right to
[03:44:15.500 --> 03:44:18.540]  possession and if you have a problem with how
[03:44:18.540 --> 03:44:21.660]  he got possession you'll have to deal with that somewhere else and that's
[03:44:21.660 --> 03:44:25.580]  kind of how they sidestep it and we're working on ways to go
[03:44:25.580 --> 03:44:28.700]  after the judges themselves but it just shows what a mess it is
[03:44:28.700 --> 03:44:31.820]  i mean it's it's if they're so confident they'll take the death
[03:44:31.820 --> 03:44:35.500]  benefits that people paid for an insurance of six million veterans
[03:44:35.500 --> 03:44:38.540]  that that's confirmed they'll do anything i mean that they're just and
[03:44:38.540 --> 03:44:42.780]  that they made a deal with the veterans affairs to allow them to do it
[03:44:42.780 --> 03:44:46.380]  i mean because they're making a campaign contributions and the corrupt
[03:44:46.380 --> 03:44:48.620]  government said go ahead and rob the vets
[03:44:48.620 --> 03:44:51.660]  i'm sorry to hear about that story steve i get those calls all the time
[03:44:51.660 --> 03:44:55.020]  let's talk to ben in north carolina ben you're on the air
[03:44:55.020 --> 03:45:00.060]  hey alex i'm a regular listener my question for randy is
[03:45:00.060 --> 03:45:04.940]  randy how can we hire you to help us fight our foreclosure
[03:45:04.940 --> 03:45:08.700]  or who do you recommend that we could contact to obtain help
[03:45:08.700 --> 03:45:15.740]  go to mortgage crime dot com okay and just uh put in some information there so
[03:45:15.740 --> 03:45:19.500]  we can get back to you and we will show you how to go after these people
[03:45:19.500 --> 03:45:23.100]  but to be clear i mean again there's no silver bullet randy can't completely
[03:45:23.100 --> 03:45:27.020]  hold your hand he can show you cases he can look at your numbers right right
[03:45:27.020 --> 03:45:29.100]  but i mean your problem is you're completely overwhelmed
[03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:32.140]  yes we're going to try to teach you how to protect yourself
[03:45:32.140 --> 03:45:37.180]  uh we could feed spoon feed you all the documentation wouldn't help a bit
[03:45:37.180 --> 03:45:42.540]  once you understand what's wrong and under and get an idea of how you can
[03:45:42.540 --> 03:45:47.420]  fight this yourself you will be a part of the fix to the problem
[03:45:47.420 --> 03:45:51.020]  we don't have to have the whole country rise up but you said a 200 cases you've
[03:45:51.020 --> 03:45:53.580]  only had five in the last year get thrown out i mean
[03:45:53.580 --> 03:45:56.780]  it's a bottom line you're able to stall them and those cases aren't done it's
[03:45:56.780 --> 03:45:59.660]  just those are the only people that are out of their property and only because
[03:45:59.660 --> 03:46:02.620]  we've got them too late we're still after them
[03:46:02.620 --> 03:46:06.620]  we have a lot of cases where we got them after the person had already been
[03:46:06.620 --> 03:46:10.780]  out of the house the house sold we go back after them sue them anyway
[03:46:10.780 --> 03:46:13.900]  we have people that are up to date on the mortgage
[03:46:13.900 --> 03:46:18.140]  those are the ones that are getting the best deals uh one of them filed suit
[03:46:18.140 --> 03:46:24.140]  and in seven days got an offer to modify from six and a half percent to two
[03:46:24.140 --> 03:46:29.180]  oh that's a good point don't just uh go after them criminally or severely
[03:46:29.180 --> 03:46:33.580]  once they're already foreclosing there's fraud in the truth in lending there's
[03:46:33.580 --> 03:46:36.540]  fraud in the fees there's fought fraud and how they sold it
[03:46:36.540 --> 03:46:39.340]  you can go after them even if you don't have a problem yeah this is only
[03:46:39.340 --> 03:46:42.940]  secondarily about foreclosure primarily this is about
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:47.740]  stinking lion thieves and going after the stinking lion thieves so what
[03:46:47.740 --> 03:46:51.340]  specifically real quick uh there been what happened with you
[03:46:51.340 --> 03:46:55.820]  we have a rental property and we've been fighting trying to do a loan
[03:46:55.820 --> 03:46:59.260]  modification over quite a bit of time and i'm listening to randy and i
[03:46:59.260 --> 03:47:01.900]  appreciate you guys providing the information
[03:47:01.900 --> 03:47:05.180]  and they just finally filed a foreclosure notice
[03:47:05.180 --> 03:47:09.180]  we have some good tenants there they've had a rough time because the economy
[03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:12.700]  he's a contractor he hadn't been making his payment on a regular
[03:47:12.700 --> 03:47:16.940]  basis uh my business has dried up a little bit we haven't been able to
[03:47:16.940 --> 03:47:20.540]  afford it so when all this came about we said you
[03:47:20.540 --> 03:47:24.060]  know what i'm we're tired of the bankers we're tired of the corruption
[03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:27.660]  and my wife and i have no problem going pro say to the federal court
[03:47:27.660 --> 03:47:31.500]  we just need to be trained so we can go fight this fight
[03:47:31.500 --> 03:47:36.460]  but to be specific uh they are they are
[03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:39.660]  i mean is it like randy said they claim oh we'll do a modification they try to
[03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:43.340]  get you in to trick you they hadn't tricked us but
[03:47:43.340 --> 03:47:47.100]  um you know every case is different but i wouldn't put it past them
[03:47:47.100 --> 03:47:51.420]  i've sort of been playing them because uh you know i've been playing
[03:47:51.420 --> 03:47:54.940]  nice guy because i'm aware that all this is corrupt anyway
[03:47:54.940 --> 03:47:59.100]  and the foreclosure process is corrupt in the in the criminal bank so
[03:47:59.100 --> 03:48:03.580]  uh it just now has come to a head we don't want to lose the property so what
[03:48:03.580 --> 03:48:07.740]  ben does is i mean i mean what you would do personally is because you're not
[03:48:07.740 --> 03:48:09.980]  really given advice you're talking about what's worked here
[03:48:09.980 --> 03:48:14.140]  is you're saying uh you would then file suit on they would have to analyze the
[03:48:14.140 --> 03:48:17.580]  fines and fees or the the the the profits they made
[03:48:17.580 --> 03:48:21.500]  fraudulently when they did the loan and that's how he go after them to make
[03:48:21.500 --> 03:48:24.620]  to them bring him to the table exactly you claim fraud against them for
[03:48:24.620 --> 03:48:27.660]  everything they did wrong they're used to being able to do things wrong and
[03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:31.100]  nobody pays attention to it so you start bringing them to the
[03:48:31.100 --> 03:48:34.620]  table and everything's about the money this is a
[03:48:34.620 --> 03:48:39.180]  calculation we today i just got a call just before i came here from a guy
[03:48:39.180 --> 03:48:44.060]  any yours is a commercial loan and not a consumer
[03:48:44.060 --> 03:48:48.300]  his was a commercial he filed suit the attorney called him
[03:48:48.300 --> 03:48:52.620]  he said that he wanted to do a modification the guy said no
[03:48:52.620 --> 03:48:56.620]  modification he said look i got 20 000 left on this note
[03:48:56.620 --> 03:48:59.500]  it's going to cost you more than that than that in attorneys to fight me and
[03:48:59.500 --> 03:49:02.540]  the guy the attorney actually said yes it would
[03:49:02.540 --> 03:49:05.820]  and then when you get into court with me i sued you for over million dollars
[03:49:05.820 --> 03:49:09.580]  good chance when you get in front of a jury jury's going to give me
[03:49:09.580 --> 03:49:13.660]  anything i want and the attorney said the other that's possible
[03:49:13.660 --> 03:49:17.740]  and he's talked to his client they're coming to table to make a deal
[03:49:17.740 --> 03:49:22.700]  it's all about the money so it's not rather you're going to win or lose at
[03:49:22.700 --> 03:49:26.540]  the end it's about bringing them to the table
[03:49:26.540 --> 03:49:29.900]  to make yeah they're going to make a deal with you because they've got other
[03:49:29.900 --> 03:49:33.820]  gazelles they're like big lions that they're going to go gobble up that
[03:49:33.820 --> 03:49:36.620]  you know you're acting like a grizzly bear are they going to attack a grizzly
[03:49:36.620 --> 03:49:39.820]  bear or a gazelle so you don't want to be a gazelle
[03:49:39.820 --> 03:49:42.620]  you want to be the grizzly bear that somebody dumped from a helicopter around
[03:49:42.620 --> 03:49:45.820]  the middle of the african savannah believe me nothing's messing with that
[03:49:45.820 --> 03:49:48.940]  exactly they're going to be looking for gazelles
[03:49:48.940 --> 03:49:52.540]  a pride alliance comes across a grizzly bear
[03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:55.180]  they're going to go you know what this doesn't look too friendly i'm going to
[03:49:55.180 --> 03:49:58.860]  move on to a gazelle you don't want to be a little bug-eyed bunny rabbit
[03:49:58.860 --> 03:50:01.660]  when there's a bunch of wolves out there you want to be
[03:50:01.660 --> 03:50:05.580]  you know a bigger batter wolf and and i'm going to skip this network break
[03:50:05.580 --> 03:50:08.540]  because i'm going to play at the end this trailer for enemy of the state
[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:13.420]  we'll do that at exactly 54 after and and and in this overdrive transmission
[03:50:13.420 --> 03:50:16.460]  randy's back next thursday and we'll really get into nitty gritting and
[03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:19.980]  just show you his actual cases and again this isn't advice to you
[03:50:19.980 --> 03:50:24.540]  this is what he's done this is prosa and and and randy's got all the nomenclature
[03:50:24.540 --> 03:50:26.940]  for that if he talks to you he's just talking about what's worked
[03:50:26.940 --> 03:50:30.460]  what people have done and understand it's totally corrupt so nothing's a
[03:50:30.460 --> 03:50:33.660]  silver bullet but you see the mortgages being frozen you see this
[03:50:33.660 --> 03:50:37.500]  happening nationwide you see people waking up
[03:50:37.500 --> 03:50:40.940]  and and and and you know laying down isn't going to be good
[03:50:40.940 --> 03:50:45.180]  so so at least stand up and it's having a big effect because it's coming out
[03:50:45.180 --> 03:50:48.220]  let's talk to real fast kathy in north carolina
[03:50:48.220 --> 03:50:52.220]  in south carolina excuse me you're on the air kathy
[03:50:52.220 --> 03:50:56.060]  hi i'm actually from south carolina yeah i got it wrong i said i'm south carolina
[03:50:56.060 --> 03:51:00.540]  the second time go ahead that's right um my question is similar to the previous
[03:51:00.540 --> 03:51:04.460]  caller um we are not behind in our mortgage however
[03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:08.700]  we're extremely upside down because what in the last couple years
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:13.180]  our home is now not even close to what our loan
[03:51:13.180 --> 03:51:16.380]  is so you're so to get in i mean this is what i would do
[03:51:16.380 --> 03:51:18.780]  again i'm not giving any advice i'm not a lawyer i'm not out here doing this
[03:51:18.780 --> 03:51:22.380]  like randyism we're just debating and discussing this
[03:51:22.380 --> 03:51:26.300]  then you sue them for violations in the truth and lending act
[03:51:26.300 --> 03:51:29.500]  to then bring them to the table to truly reduce it go ahead yes i mean is that a
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:32.460]  good idea yeah i'll put them in a position to where
[03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:37.100]  they have to do a monetary calculation once you sue them
[03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:39.900]  then they're going to be in court with they're looking at being caught with
[03:51:39.900 --> 03:51:43.340]  you year and a half to two years and they know precisely what's happening to
[03:51:43.340 --> 03:51:48.380]  the league to the real estate market in 2008 it drove off a cliff
[03:51:48.380 --> 03:51:52.060]  and real estate prices are dropping like and now commercial is going off a cliff
[03:51:52.060 --> 03:51:55.180]  and commercial is falling behind we will see
[03:51:55.180 --> 03:51:58.860]  cascading failures it's going to get worse it's going to get worse
[03:51:58.860 --> 03:52:01.340]  fat so what's your specific question kathy i'm sorry
[03:52:01.340 --> 03:52:05.100]  yes that's basically what i you know do i what i proceed in court
[03:52:05.100 --> 03:52:09.100]  because my husband feels like if we do the right thing then things aren't going
[03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:13.340]  to happen to us but we're not like you said we're up against
[03:52:13.340 --> 03:52:18.060]  the psychopaths who are doing this to us well go with what your gut is i mean i'm
[03:52:18.060 --> 03:52:21.420]  upside down in my mortgage and i'm not doing this and i've gone and looked at
[03:52:21.420 --> 03:52:25.340]  the fees and things it's not as bad in some cases and i like where i live
[03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:29.260]  but i mean the point is if it ever comes down to the total economy melting down
[03:52:29.260 --> 03:52:32.860]  or they try some weird chicanery i'll i mean i'll sue them
[03:52:32.860 --> 03:52:38.220]  yeah and it's not that hard people aren't accustomed to suits
[03:52:38.220 --> 03:52:42.060]  we have people that we help get suits filed in court and they're amazed at how
[03:52:42.060 --> 03:52:46.940]  easy it is it's not near as daunting as it appears
[03:52:46.940 --> 03:52:51.420]  and europe will say so it doesn't cost you and by the way this isn't just us here
[03:52:51.420 --> 03:52:55.020]  saying this is there's a bunch of fraud it's admitted so all we're doing is
[03:52:55.020 --> 03:52:58.780]  citizens going how do we help people how do we help ourselves what do we do
[03:52:58.780 --> 03:53:02.300]  about these crux yeah and you get them into court
[03:53:02.300 --> 03:53:05.820]  the whole dynamic changes they have to make a monetary consideration because
[03:53:05.820 --> 03:53:09.500]  normally they just lie to you install you and pat you on the head and
[03:53:09.500 --> 03:53:12.220]  and then just i mean at least you're putting up a fight
[03:53:12.220 --> 03:53:15.740]  if they start lying to you in court now you've got somebody else looking over
[03:53:15.740 --> 03:53:19.580]  their shoulder but they notice uh your your your husband's saying do the right
[03:53:19.580 --> 03:53:22.460]  thing and i understand that you know payback of death
[03:53:22.460 --> 03:53:26.540]  but these banks just made all this up they induce the bubble
[03:53:26.540 --> 03:53:30.540]  and ensure people are dumb like myself to be upside down or whatever
[03:53:30.540 --> 03:53:34.060]  but but but the point is we didn't engineer this fraud you know we're not
[03:53:34.060 --> 03:53:37.580]  out there taking houses that are paid for we're not out there taking houses
[03:53:37.580 --> 03:53:40.940]  when we don't have a note and besides it's not about you
[03:53:40.940 --> 03:53:44.220]  it's not about your husband it's about your children
[03:53:44.220 --> 03:53:47.660]  my children my grandchildren exactly randy we are out of time sorry the other
[03:53:47.660 --> 03:53:51.180]  callers will be back next thursday from one to three maybe even longer
[03:53:51.180 --> 03:53:55.340]  god bless you appreciate you coming in uh and again that website one more time
[03:53:55.340 --> 03:53:59.980]  it's mortgagecrime.com mortgagecrime.com as we explore this as
[03:53:59.980 --> 03:54:03.500]  citizens god bless you all
[03:54:03.500 --> 03:54:05.500]  you
[03:54:12.300 --> 03:54:16.060]  you gotta love uh you gotta love computer system sometimes
[03:54:16.060 --> 03:54:19.500]  we're gonna play as much of this trailer people have been asking us to play this
[03:54:19.500 --> 03:54:23.500]  two more h1n1 related deaths in rhod Island 36 children have died from the
[03:54:23.500 --> 03:54:26.300]  virus 76 children have died from the h1n1
[03:54:26.300 --> 03:54:29.100]  virus since april the government now believes roughly
[03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:32.380]  eight million children have come down with the virus the infection is
[03:54:32.380 --> 03:54:35.740]  spreading well stockpiling vaccines closing schools and letting
[03:54:35.740 --> 03:54:40.140]  government employees work from home prepare don't panic they say the best
[03:54:40.140 --> 03:54:43.980]  way to prepare is to have your family vaccinated the vaccine appears to be
[03:54:43.980 --> 03:54:47.180]  safe the obama administration is considering implementing a new fall
[03:54:47.180 --> 03:54:51.020]  vaccination program against the flu composed of mercury and it's been
[03:54:51.020 --> 03:54:55.420]  proven to cause not only gmra syndrome but also autism
[03:54:55.420 --> 03:55:00.380]  where schools across the united states from kentucky to new york
[03:55:00.380 --> 03:55:04.540]  are forcibly inoculating children with the h1n1 flu vaccine
[03:55:04.540 --> 03:55:07.740]  even when their parents have instructed them not to do so
[03:55:07.740 --> 03:55:11.820]  and again when the schools get caught they say oops we made a mistake
[03:55:11.820 --> 03:55:18.380]  president obama has now declared the h1n1 virus to be a national emergency
[03:55:18.380 --> 03:55:21.420]  the white house says the president signed this proclamation last night it
[03:55:21.420 --> 03:55:25.900]  will allow medical officials to bypass certain federal requirements
[03:55:25.900 --> 03:55:30.140]  and so because there is this big backlash they're hyping the h1n1
[03:55:30.140 --> 03:55:33.500]  really as an excuse to try to set the precedent
[03:55:33.500 --> 03:55:37.900]  to forcibly inoculate the population i was working for one of the local
[03:55:37.900 --> 03:55:41.660]  hospitals as a security officer my supervisor notified me that there was
[03:55:41.660 --> 03:55:44.780]  a training opportunity a team was being formed with home
[03:55:44.780 --> 03:55:49.100]  insecurity primarily our job as an enforcement would be to
[03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:52.780]  remove the people from their homes school buses would be
[03:55:52.780 --> 03:55:56.380]  brought into the neighborhoods we would go door-to-door in teams
[03:55:56.380 --> 03:56:00.220]  and we would evacuate the people from their homes and take them
[03:56:00.220 --> 03:56:04.780]  to the decontamination area and then sending them to secure facilities
[03:56:04.780 --> 03:56:10.220]  i mean that whole description is exact what they did to the jews during the
[03:56:10.220 --> 03:56:13.500]  holocaust if you've been diagnosed with probable
[03:56:13.500 --> 03:56:18.300]  or presumed 2009 h1n1 or swine flu in recent months
[03:56:18.300 --> 03:56:23.100]  you may be surprised to know this the odds are you didn't have h1n1 flu in
[03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:27.180]  fact you probably didn't have flu at all we were told that
[03:56:27.180 --> 03:56:31.660]  takedown tactics would be necessary uh some of these people will not go
[03:56:31.660 --> 03:56:34.940]  willingly we must take them down and they warned us about that that there's
[03:56:34.940 --> 03:56:38.300]  going to be homeowners that may have a gun in the home or may have a gun on
[03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:43.820]  their person uh so be prepared uh to use tasers
[03:56:43.820 --> 03:56:57.420]  pepper spray and possibly even legal
[03:56:57.420 --> 03:57:03.180]  uh they moved her out of there the flu virus or any type of biological threat
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:06.940]  is the perfect cover for martial law and control
[03:57:06.940 --> 03:57:10.460]  because it's something that makes everyone a potential threat it makes
[03:57:10.460 --> 03:57:14.700]  everyone a potential carrier everyone a potential terrorist
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:18.220]  carrying the terrorist virus this helps us
[03:57:18.220 --> 03:57:22.540]  submit to tyranny it helps us suspect our neighbors it helps us
[03:57:22.540 --> 03:57:25.500]  see the government as our savior in the arbitrary
[03:57:25.500 --> 03:57:30.700]  and it divides the people against each other um what are your thoughts on or
[03:57:30.700 --> 03:57:33.900]  house to house gun confiscation or if the marines
[03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:37.340]  would ever have to do that in america i really don't want to speculate on that
[03:57:37.340 --> 03:57:41.100]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in
[03:57:41.100 --> 03:57:45.420]  an american city evacuees are flooding this
[03:57:45.420 --> 03:57:49.340]  embarkation center now despite the large number of people at pets
[03:57:49.340 --> 03:57:53.500]  things are running very smoothly now this efficiency can be attributed to a
[03:57:53.500 --> 03:57:56.620]  technology solution brought on by radiant
[03:57:56.620 --> 03:58:01.260]  rfid the jurisdiction is able to get an accurate manifest on every single
[03:58:01.260 --> 03:58:05.020]  person getting on the bus just by walking them through this simple portal
[03:58:05.020 --> 03:58:08.860]  well the lucid technology building is located in western oklahoma city
[03:58:08.860 --> 03:58:12.780]  it's a huge huge building uh lots of openware house space
[03:58:12.780 --> 03:58:16.060]  almost completely surrounded by barbed wire fence with secured gates
[03:58:16.060 --> 03:58:21.580]  and guard checks and in the back there's rail access you know which
[03:58:21.580 --> 03:58:25.500]  now meets the the the criteria of what people call a fema concentration camp
[03:58:25.500 --> 03:58:29.100]  i mean there's no sign out front that says fema concentration camp
[03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:32.540]  but it's one of these stills where you know it's a spray area but you know
[03:58:32.540 --> 03:58:37.980]  immediately that when they wanted to utilize it it could be put into effect
[03:58:37.980 --> 03:58:57.500]  this is gcn the genesis communicate
