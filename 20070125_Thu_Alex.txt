[09:08.880 --> 09:17.600]  but they survey less so it won't be a surprise to them all right in the last segment i ran down
[09:17.600 --> 09:23.040]  some of the news we've got a major break in the case exposing the fact that there was total
[09:23.040 --> 09:31.200]  election fraud in ohio as well as new mexico and several other states convictions convictions but
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.400]  it's in the ap but you won't hear a lot about it on the news at least i'll be surprised if
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.720]  you see it as a major news story in the news cycle every day thousands of major stories of
[09:42.720 --> 09:49.040]  very uh important topics come out on the news wires come out in newspapers but never get picked
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.200]  up by the big national news cycle so the general public doesn't even know they exist congressman
[09:55.200 --> 09:59.920]  tom tan credo again is talking about how they're held meant to completely destroy our sovereignty
[09:59.920 --> 10:06.800]  in the new congress but let me start with this first this is extremely important
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.840]  for several months we've been chronicling it so i know that most of you are aware of it
[10:16.880 --> 10:26.320]  duke geenrich who is a total new world order stooge has been running around giving speeches
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.680]  including international free speech conferences
[10:34.400 --> 10:40.640]  saying that free speech needs to be restricted for our safety
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.800]  and that multiple u.s cities are going to be nuked by al qaeda lci ada
[10:49.600 --> 10:53.440]  and they've had a bunch of other council on foreign relations members
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.160]  geenrich is one of the co-chairs on several of these committees
[11:01.920 --> 11:08.000]  and benjamin netanyahu is simultaneously running around doing the same thing so let me cover
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.680]  this raw story article then i'll cover the french news agency reporting on netanyahu today
[11:15.680 --> 11:28.160]  geenrich's 24 scenario u.s israel faced potential second holocaust which could lead to greater
[11:28.160 --> 11:34.320]  dictatorial societies echoing the plot line of the popular television show which is a government
[11:34.320 --> 11:40.160]  propaganda arm newt geenrich former speaker of the house and a potential republican candidate
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.680]  for president in 2008 warned attendance at a con at a conference that israel and the
[11:45.680 --> 11:51.360]  united states could face a potential second holocaust in the future and if the two or
[11:51.360 --> 11:58.480]  three cities were destroyed the two democracies may develop into greater dictatorial societies
[11:58.480 --> 12:00.160]  now let's just stop right there
[12:00.160 --> 12:12.240]  remember as soon as tommy franks left three and a half years ago the head of the iraq invasion
[12:12.240 --> 12:20.080]  operation four months after the invasion three and a half years ago he left and the media made
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.680]  a big deal out of the fact there's always little telltale signs that he was now an independent and
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.800]  he wasn't a republican and he wasn't a democrat and he was just going to speak his mind about
[12:30.800 --> 12:36.640]  what needed to be done and i said oh that's it he's on the payroll absolute indicator
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.160]  because your first thing announced hey i don't have an agenda you can go read the transcripts
[12:40.720 --> 12:47.760]  i'm independent but i think we need to stay in iraq forever and by the way it's real sad
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.200]  but there's going to be a major attack in the u.s and we're going to have to set aside the
[12:53.200 --> 12:56.960]  constitution and bill of rights the people are going to want it i don't particularly like it
[12:56.960 --> 13:04.800]  but it's what they want for a military dictatorship then it came out two years ago after a year and a
[13:04.800 --> 13:13.840]  half of his being on television every single day on fox cnn msnbc abc nightly news that he was
[13:13.840 --> 13:24.880]  being paid 454 000 a year in a covert payment plan part of the 1.8 i keep saying 1.6 it's now 1.8
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.960]  billion that they spent in that two-year period for fake news just type in bush purchases fake
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.560]  news fake news real illegal you'll get literally hundreds of reports on it the tip of the iceberg
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.160]  was armstrong williams and people just every issue every case tens of millions spent on it
[13:43.040 --> 13:49.120]  together billions that we know of and so he's out on the payroll off the script
[13:49.120 --> 13:55.760]  i'm sorry marshall law's coming even use that term it's what the people demand it's real sad
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.040]  but that's what's coming i'm sorry to have to tell you you know generals throughout history
[14:01.040 --> 14:10.240]  just hate having to have military rule we just hate power so that's what he said and he said
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.120]  he said cigar aficionado and he said it on fox news and he said it on cnn we played the clips
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.880]  here like there's somewhere in our computer that has literally thousands of clips but we play three
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.200]  or four clips a day in three years there's just there's got to be thousands of them in there
[14:23.200 --> 14:28.240]  like i'm wondering how many files are in that computer john you might want to dig those frank's
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.400]  clips out he would always preface it with now i'm independent don't even support bush but we're
[14:34.400 --> 14:40.000]  gonna need marshall law well what did dean rich just say oh and i have netanyahu saying the same
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.120]  thing in the next article oh we're gonna get attacked by nukes and uh let me read the exact
[14:47.120 --> 14:55.600]  quote greater dictatorial societies and oh we need to start banning free speech and oh we need
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.360]  to start arresting people and oh and then what do you hear from michael savage and medved and all of
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.120]  them let's arrest everybody if you criticize the war you're aiding al-qaeda you should be arrested
[15:07.120 --> 15:15.520]  remember the deputy attorney general of california in 2002 was named calhoun and it was uh in the
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.840]  oakland tribune saying we may start arresting all anti-war protesters because we're in a war against
[15:21.840 --> 15:29.920]  terror he's a democrat we're in a war against terror and uh because we're in that if you
[15:29.920 --> 15:36.640]  protest the war you're aiding terrorists so so they want to do this they're openly saying this
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.160]  and you should be really concerned because newt gehenrich one year before 9 11
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.880]  wrote rebuilding america's defenses a council on foreign relations policy report put out by
[15:50.880 --> 15:57.360]  warren rudman gary hart and nuke gehenrich we play a clip from that commission three days after
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.240]  9 11 and my film road to tyranny where gary hart says we need to use this disaster for what
[16:02.240 --> 16:08.160]  president bush's father called for i think only once and that was a new world order that's an
[16:08.160 --> 16:16.640]  exact quote and they get up there and they brag they say we predicted this we told you this would
[16:16.640 --> 16:23.520]  happen and then they wrote 50 recommendations for a homeland security department they wrote this a
[16:23.520 --> 16:30.240]  year before 9 11 and then they brought it forward on c-span three days after and every recommendation
[16:30.320 --> 16:38.480]  they suggested was implemented and put into the recommendations of the homeland security
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.760]  package and no surprise guess who else was on the commission that wrote this a year before
[16:49.120 --> 16:56.320]  the co-chairman of the 9 11 commission lee hamilton so it's the same guys over and over again
[16:56.320 --> 17:06.560]  saying on the payroll on with covert illegal defense department funding for fake news domestically
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.760]  that the people want martial law and that's what's going to happen when we get attacked
[17:11.040 --> 17:18.160]  so we have these treasonous traitors on the record now remember it was bush's grandfather
[17:18.160 --> 17:24.640]  press guard and this came out in senate hearings and we actually have the film of these
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.040]  i'm putting the new film i'm making we actually have
[17:29.680 --> 17:36.080]  the newsreel reports shock attempted coup to overthrow u.s government funded by fascists
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.240]  and it turned out that they went and tried to hire smedley butler the marine corps congressional
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.880]  medal of honor winning general who'd overthrown over 10 nations and he said look i discovered
[17:50.880 --> 17:56.080]  this wasn't for america this was for the global elite and he said they tried to hire me to lead
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.880]  the marine corps against the u.s government and arrest the president and put in a fascist
[18:02.880 --> 18:09.040]  dictatorship and of course press scott and the rest of them were on adolph hitler's payroll
[18:09.040 --> 18:16.160]  this is mainstream history but the average american doesn't know so the grandchildren of
[18:16.160 --> 18:24.480]  these people are now all over tv and all over the newspapers saying do you realize the magnitude of
[18:24.480 --> 18:29.920]  this we got to write an article about it saying that oh we're so sorry but there's going to be
[18:29.920 --> 18:37.520]  another attack and we're going to have to have a dictatorship a military dictatorship a military
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.960]  form of government these are quotes greater dictatorial societies i'm reading quotes right
[18:42.960 --> 18:52.800]  now from them they're not playing games this isn't a joke this is for real and they've been
[18:52.800 --> 19:02.160]  trying to take control for 70 years and folks it looks like they may succeed and they're going to
[19:02.160 --> 19:07.680]  do it by blowing up u.s cities and then the very murderers that implemented and orchestrated the
[19:07.680 --> 19:12.800]  attacks and the following policies will be worshipped on national television and many of
[19:12.800 --> 19:18.240]  you and your fear will who even know the truth will decide to willfully become ignorant when
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.760]  this happens and to serve it go ahead because once it's fully in place they're going to take
[19:23.760 --> 19:29.520]  your pension funds your private property everything enjoy the forced inoculations
[19:30.320 --> 19:35.520]  enjoy the complete end of our borders i know a lot of you are going to listen later you will
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.640]  later later you'll remember what alex jones said you see i think we can defeat this but just in
[19:42.640 --> 19:47.840]  case we don't we'll defeat it later because see we have the power of prediction we know their
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.560]  game plan and that's why everybody listens to the show now and why people are waking up everywhere
[19:52.560 --> 19:57.360]  because they heard us make all the predictions that have come true so far so we're laying out
[19:57.360 --> 20:04.480]  what they're trying to do well they're laying it out so when we get back i'll go over what
[20:04.480 --> 20:11.040]  geenrich is saying i'll go over what netanyahu is saying yesterday then we'll get into mobile phone
[20:11.040 --> 20:16.720]  use linked to brain tumors lung and telegraph and then the biggest threat to the drinking water
[20:16.720 --> 20:24.720]  what's in it right now reuters and much more i'm alex jones i'm just a good old boy from texas who
[20:24.720 --> 20:29.680]  found out there was a plan to destroy my country i swore to fight them and that's what i'm doing

[26:36.800 --> 26:40.720]  and that our country will devolve into greater dictatorial societies they're letting everybody
[26:40.720 --> 26:47.840]  know israel is facing the greatest danger for its survival since 1967 victory gingrich said via
[26:47.840 --> 26:55.600]  satellite at the hertzelia conference sponsored by the institute for policy and strategy in israel
[26:55.600 --> 27:02.960]  israel maintained its dominance in 67 even after the 73 failure gingrich continued that in 1984
[27:02.960 --> 27:10.960]  i wrote the wmds well yeah because you guys are the ones cooking it up uh you're the top strategy
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.840]  people writing the policy you're just something else gingrich in 84 i wrote the wmds and terrorism
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.920]  would pose a threat to u.s national sovereignty u.s security excuse me if two or three cities
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.480]  are destroyed because of terrorism both the u.s and israel's democracy will be eroded and both
[27:26.480 --> 27:34.720]  will become greater dictatorial societies and uh raw story goes on to quote this but and it just
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.320]  shows the delusional nature fox television 24 features keithner summerlin as a sort of
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.520]  superheroic counter-terrorism agent who sometimes uses torture to gain information
[27:46.080 --> 27:52.480]  and this season's plot concerns the race to stop nuclear bombs exploding across the united states
[27:52.480 --> 27:58.080]  they've had homeland security meetings on c-span to just thank 24 folks they know it's propaganda
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.400]  a lot of the viewers don't know that if you're aware of the new order you see it for what it is
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.640]  the general public just gets conditioned to torture nuclear bombs there's a real terror
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.440]  threat it creates the illusion in their minds which suspended disbelief the subconscious mind
[28:11.440 --> 28:17.440]  is seeing that show is real so it creates the illusion of a real threat and then mass roundup
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.880]  secret arrest that's what's on the show and notice gingrich and netanyahu and all of them
[28:22.880 --> 28:28.400]  are parroting the same line the fourth episode ended with a nuclear explosion in los angeles
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.800]  which prompted some characters on the show to argue for mass arrest and deportation of muslims
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.440]  in america but again it isn't really for the muslims so considering to test it out set the
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.320]  precedence with them it's about gun owners conservatives landowners although many critics
[28:42.320 --> 28:47.600]  slam the show as being slanted to the right or anti-muslim the current storyline also touches
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.480]  on the importance of civil liberties to democracies and even the scenes regarding torture aren't so
[28:52.480 --> 28:58.160]  clear-cut southern's character jack bauer is often portrayed as wracked with guilt and forced to
[28:58.160 --> 29:02.880]  resort to brutality in order to get people to talk and sometimes they so suggest that he went
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.560]  too far but you're still being conditioned and bathed in this we have the full transcript of
[29:08.560 --> 29:16.000]  gingrich's speech up on prisonplanet.com it gets even worse and here's another one out of uh

[33:57.760 --> 34:02.080]  attacked and the martial laws coming they're so sad about it they just hate all the power
[34:02.800 --> 34:08.800]  and control i had debbie scheduled for the show a few days ago you know she pops in every week or

[34:13.840 --> 34:19.600]  made water filters also high quality british-made filters but this morning i saw this story and i
[34:19.600 --> 34:24.000]  would have covered this anyway but i thought well this is perfect timing she's coming on
[34:25.040 --> 34:32.160]  this is from reuters uh today by christine stebbins biggest threat to u.s drinking water
[34:33.040 --> 34:40.320]  and guess what it is rust and that's a nice word for some of these 10 20 30 40 50 60 70
[34:40.960 --> 34:47.280]  80 year old pipes sometimes over a hundred years old that i've talked to plumbers i've seen it
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.640]  myself when they've been bulldozing old houses of where you'll have say a pipe that's got a
[34:52.640 --> 35:00.560]  two inch diameter an inch diameter and half of it or more is just build up dead bacteria dirt
[35:01.360 --> 35:07.920]  mineral deposits and folks the big city mains the connections the leaks in them
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.440]  and so the government pumps in all this chlorine and uh all of this fluoride and all this other
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.640]  stuff and all it does is when they're lucky kill the bacteria and then you got all the
[35:20.640 --> 35:24.880]  herbicide and the pesticides and the motor oils and the chemicals and the industrial chemicals
[35:24.880 --> 35:28.880]  and you go to the eph website there are thousands of chemicals listed thousands
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.760]  i've spent hours one time just reading it and there's all these quote allowable levels
[35:34.480 --> 35:39.120]  but you add it all together it's all way over safe levels when you add it all together in the
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.240]  aggregate a large percentage of what's in the water is deadly chemicals they don't clean it
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.120]  up folks they just kill the bacteria they just dump chlorine in there and then that breaks down
[35:49.120 --> 35:56.800]  and creates styrene and ammonia i cannot articulate how poisonous and toxic the water is
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.240]  and if you are drinking on and i mean heavily purified heavily filtered i don't mean just
[36:02.240 --> 36:06.560]  running it through some charcoal thing that's been on your faucet head for two years by the way then
[36:06.560 --> 36:10.320]  those get more toxic it builds up to a super toxic level and then all of a sudden it starts
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.720]  dumping it to you in mass you better keep your filters clean if you're using those cheap ones
[36:14.720 --> 36:19.200]  they're only good for a few months and then it just reduces which is better than nothing
[36:19.760 --> 36:25.360]  uh all the toxins big burkeys take it to non-detectable levels scientists they have
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.440]  several universities who study scientists will never say there's nothing in it they say the
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.600]  electron microscopes and the pathogen test find nothing non-detectable they can find nothing
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.080]  that's a new standard folks it's gravity fed using god's own technology just like the limestone makes
[36:42.080 --> 36:50.160]  the purest uh spring water same thing here and it goes on to say from an attack by militants to a
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.200]  decline in the snow melt caused by global warming look how they put propaganda everywhere public
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.480]  fears about the water supply have heightened in the united states so who would have thought the
[37:00.480 --> 37:04.240]  top worry among water experts turns out to be rusty pipes because that's because they're
[37:04.240 --> 37:09.040]  actually water experts not propagandists they're just studying the water if you clean up water and
[37:09.040 --> 37:14.240]  then put it into a dirty pipe there's no there's not much point said timothy ford a microbiologist
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.800]  a water research scientist at montana state university i consider the distribution system
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.920]  to be the highest risk and the greatest problem that we are going to be facing in the future in
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.400]  the future it's already bad towns and cities across the united states spent more than 50
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.040]  billion each year cleaning water sources from rivers lakes and underground aquifers more than
[37:33.040 --> 37:38.320]  170 000 public water systems are work to keep tap water flowing to american homes and meeting the
[37:38.320 --> 37:45.120]  standards of the safe drinking water act of 1974 but after the extensive purifying process water
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.960]  ends up in your glass after traveling through pipes laid under city streets 50 60 or 100 years
[37:50.960 --> 37:59.200]  ago the pipes made mostly from iron until plastic was introduced 30 years ago span almost 1 million
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.400]  miles the united states and it goes on to talk about the iron which is very toxic in high levels
[38:04.400 --> 38:08.240]  it just goes on and on it's a three-page article i just read half the first page
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.720]  it's on prison planet.com uh let's go to debbie morrow debbie i don't i think people need to get
[38:12.720 --> 38:18.240]  the water filters i think they need to stop drinking the tap water hi there alex i'm in total
[38:18.240 --> 38:24.480]  agreement with you and i'm really gonna you know go to your website and get a copy of that article
[38:24.480 --> 38:31.520]  and have it for the future because that is really amazing that they're actually admitting that
[38:31.520 --> 38:36.560]  there's a problem when it gets to your house look look look here in austin they we've got aquifer
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.000]  water but then they still add a bunch of chemicals to it but it's better than most cities but i
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.640]  wouldn't drink it at my house i guess we've got newer pipes because my house is only 20 years old
[38:45.440 --> 38:51.840]  my office is 60 years old the water tastes like kerosene and it's not from the main water supply
[38:51.840 --> 38:57.920]  it's whatever pipes are coming in here right yeah and if you break your water at least you're going
[38:57.920 --> 39:03.920]  to be getting all those heavy metals out at least up to 95 there's a berky 15 feet from me
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.320]  that's where our water goes through there you go and protect yourselves and protect your
[39:10.960 --> 39:17.040]  staff and your loved ones and you know using a berky is one of the only things you can do alex
[39:17.680 --> 39:24.560]  that you know that you're actually taking control of something in your life you know and you can
[39:24.560 --> 39:30.160]  test a berky to be sure it's working you don't have to guess you don't have to sit back and
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.040]  wonder if it's taking out the contaminants because you can test it with food coloring
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.200]  and here's an example i've always done the food coloring test with the five or six i've used
[39:39.200 --> 39:45.440]  personally in the last uh now i guess it's eight nine years since i got one in 88 but the one at
[39:45.440 --> 39:50.000]  the office we did the food coloring test food coloring went through it and i said uh-oh we
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.760]  didn't seat them right we screwed them back in next time it didn't go through that's it that's
[39:55.760 --> 39:59.440]  exactly you know what i'm not gonna i'm not gonna tell a lie it was a weird i didn't have food
[39:59.440 --> 40:04.320]  coloring i poured coffee in it no you didn't i just yeah the last the times at my house i did
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.680]  food coloring because my wife had it but i just simplifying i used coffee a little bit of it came
[40:09.680 --> 40:15.200]  through then we reseated them when we because i do test it as you recommend oh i didn't know this is
[40:16.080 --> 40:19.760]  simplify things i guess in a way i could say coffee's a food coloring and i was just a
[40:19.760 --> 40:26.160]  coloring but yeah oh that's pretty interesting i may have to try that and see what happens
[40:26.160 --> 40:29.840]  yeah i'm like we got to test this i'll go to the store get food i said no just pour coffee in it
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.120]  uh-huh and we poured a big old tanker of coffee in there and it came through brown it's a little
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.480]  bit yeah yeah because you know you're supposed to test it when you see them right when you screw
[40:38.480 --> 40:43.600]  them in and uh so i said okay let's do a test i took a coffee pot half full of coffee and
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.400]  dumped it in there and it was a little yellow a little bit came through so i said uh-oh we
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.400]  dumped it out washed it out re-screwed them and nothing came through oh that's great well there
[40:52.400 --> 41:00.960]  you go everybody i don't know since you mentioned it i'll call the story yeah i think i do red food
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.240]  coloring that'd be good you know that's a lot better yeah yeah for the listeners do red food
[41:06.240 --> 41:11.840]  coloring anyway but we sure are ready to take their berkey orders start the new year out with
[41:12.800 --> 41:19.280]  people taking control of their life and what they're putting in it so i i'd like to
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.760]  hear from your listeners um all of our phone lines are open and we've been working really
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.960]  diligently to get the water filters out really quick to people and did you hear
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.000]  alex about what happened in los angeles that they lost their battle against floyd
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.440]  no but i know there's a vote up today to renew fluoridating austin's water here in austin oh
[41:45.440 --> 41:52.080]  really oh yeah i did hear about la where where the judge said uh they voted to take it out the
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.640]  judge said you're not allowed to it's so important we're going to make you drink it because they love
[41:56.640 --> 42:02.960]  us so much yeah the thing is they never they didn't have fluoride they apparently from my
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.360]  understanding is they've been fighting putting fluoride in the water for years and years and years
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  and they finally just lost the battle i mean they have lobbyists and all kinds of stuff
[42:12.560 --> 42:15.600]  you know trying to keep because they look as late because the government wants your
[42:15.600 --> 42:22.000]  teeth to be healthy they care about you yeah that's what they say and fluoride's so deadly
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.720]  that everything is not to non-detectable levels but fluoride with a standard filter only reduces
[42:26.720 --> 42:30.960]  it you get a post filter and it does completely knock it out so it's hard to get it out but you
[42:30.960 --> 42:35.600]  have those systems available you have when you get a berkey you get a free gift a sports bottle
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.360]  that does 600 and something refills of tap water it only makes it safe to drink doesn't remove

[44:07.520 --> 44:14.160]  hi hello sir how you doing just fine i'm calling in i had heard you talk about the black dot on
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.240]  the computer screens and i tried to verify the story that it could be a camera somewhere
[44:20.240 --> 44:25.920]  and i had found that uh apple had a patent for an all-scene screen or a tele-screen
[44:26.560 --> 44:32.080]  out there if you could tell me more about that i think you misunderstood me there have been
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.080]  reports and i know there have been patents but we don't know if it's been implemented
[44:36.080 --> 44:42.720]  to have a screen itself that acts as a camera so you can do video conferencing what i've said is
[44:42.720 --> 44:50.080]  you can go verify this with apple right now all new apple laptops have a built-in camera
[44:50.080 --> 44:58.000]  a little black dot camera in the the frame around the screen in the middle at the top
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.160]  just walk into an apple store or an apple dealer and walk up to the laptop and you'll look at it
[45:02.160 --> 45:07.120]  it's about three millimeters across three millimeters tall it's a round circle and it's
[45:07.120 --> 45:15.600]  a camera and then there's a microphone built in on the base by the control hand pad for it
[45:15.600 --> 45:23.040]  quote for video conferencing and most pcs or laptops now have these built in most of in the
[45:23.040 --> 45:29.200]  last four years we've looked into it of the existing boxes old-fashioned pcs and max have
[45:29.200 --> 45:34.400]  built-in microphones you have to read the owner's manual to find it and so the point is google
[45:34.400 --> 45:40.480]  announced what six months ago now that they're going to start using the microphones and cameras
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.800]  to listen and watch without asking what's happening in your house and they say don't worry
[45:44.800 --> 45:50.480]  though a person isn't watching an ai computer system scans and records all the words and noises
[45:50.480 --> 45:56.800]  even registering dog barks then they pitch dog food ads at you over the google ads just like when
[45:56.800 --> 46:02.320]  you visit sites they go uh you know hey you're in austin get a mortgage in austin because they know
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.280]  from your cookies that you live in austin well now they'll know off the audio in your house and
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.680]  of course that'll also be sold or given to the government and this is a huge story just announced
[46:11.680 --> 46:19.440]  in plain view sir okay keep up the great work does that answer your question yes it does thank you
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.960]  lucas in texas you're on the air go ahead hey alex how's it going hey i was wondering if you have
[46:24.960 --> 46:31.840]  ever had a chance to see the movie the 1927 film by fritz lang called metropolis yes i have okay
[46:31.920 --> 46:36.320]  well i thought that was pretty uh that was a pretty good warning it was done almost 100 years
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.200]  ago yeah the government turning the people into slave automatons yeah i mean it was i just saw it
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.080]  for the first time the other day it kind of blew me away and uh i'd advise everybody who's interested
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.320]  in this to actually you know find a copy that's probably pretty hard to find but go check that
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.760]  out oh no you can buy a dvd of it online or you can rent it at any uh kind of art house video store
[46:55.760 --> 47:01.600]  that are in most major cities um another thing i wanted to mention about the uh ed brown situation
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.560]  something that would help him out a lot well back up because some people don't know who he is okay
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.520]  i got some mean posting on my myspace after i interviewed ed brown yesterday and after i've
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.480]  been talking about it all week saying how dare you alex not talk about ed brown when i had him
[47:16.480 --> 47:20.960]  on the show but for those who don't know tell folks about it well basically ed brown is holed up
[47:20.960 --> 47:28.880]  in his house uh he has followed the uh the plan of not paying income taxes because it's not mandatory
[47:28.880 --> 47:35.440]  as we've all been lied to and uh he's basically taken a stand what most of us need to actually
[47:35.440 --> 47:41.680]  finally do um is take a stand but what i wanted to say is i think something that would benefit
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.000]  him greatly is cameras webcams and and document all this stuff you know get this whole
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.720]  perimeter webcammed out so that whatever goes on we can get the full story and not the waco
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.360]  craft that they tried to give us that's what i said yesterday you know we've got webcams here
[47:59.360 --> 48:02.880]  they're over encrypted private networks and other things i won't mention
[48:04.640 --> 48:09.520]  well i mean the best thing to do is have it in other buildings with people you work with who
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.000]  you know nearby you so even if they shut your system off there's cameras recording
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  uh from across the street we'll just put it to you that way it's one of the most effective
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.080]  things to do and this is important uh for anybody who's in the fight big time to surveil yourself
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.360]  it's a very powerful tool right you get those get those cams out there that way if they you
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.560]  know we didn't get the full coverage of the waco because of course they suppressed half of it so
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.960]  yeah then people tell me well alex are you for big brother it's like a gun i'm pro second amendment
[48:38.960 --> 48:45.280]  i'm pro gun the gun isn't the bad thing it's the bad people uh it's the same thing with with
[48:45.280 --> 48:51.200]  cameras it's a double-edged sword their power in our hands you know we're not out uh surveilling
[48:51.200 --> 48:56.080]  the general public we're not out making people live and work under this it is used as a tool
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.880]  against them right and wanted to thank you too for putting my uh hank hill video up on your
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.160]  web page there got a lot of traffic after you did that oh you made that that was really funny yeah
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.440]  yeah i'm working on some more stuff too a few a few other truth videos i've got some ones uh
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.480]  basically i've created with these uh what i call sniper videos you label them with something like
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.160]  and have 911 truth so then yeah people are doing that i'll type my name into into youtube to see
[49:22.160 --> 49:27.280]  what else has been posted every day 5 10 15 20 sometimes great videos people are making using
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.880]  my work and i'm very honored and then i'll see something like you know hot japanese women and
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.160]  i'll go what alex jones and they just label it that to get all the dumbbells to go watch it
[49:38.160 --> 49:45.440]  yeah you know there's no uh you know hot blondes or japanese women but you go and it's clips of my
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.280]  films it's very effective oh yeah i kind of brainchild of that and uh basically i've gotten
[49:51.280 --> 49:57.200]  a couple million hits on my my videos now it's very yes somebody goes into our myspace and it
[49:57.200 --> 50:02.400]  says you know i don't want to repeat what it says it'll say like super hot women and you click on it
[50:02.400 --> 50:08.000]  and it's it's all this anti-new world order stuff i haven't done that i've debated doing that but
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.240]  i don't want to get it but if other people do it whatever it certainly is effective you just said
[50:12.240 --> 50:15.760]  you've gotten a couple million hits yeah i mean i think you're doing good with what you're doing
[50:15.760 --> 50:19.520]  and you don't want to associate yourself with tricking people but at the same time they don't
[50:19.520 --> 50:24.720]  know who i am you know so all i'm doing is getting the truth out there uh hey it's a war my friend

[52:43.280 --> 52:48.720]  would you be prepared during an accident during nuclear disasters great amounts of radioactive
[52:48.720 --> 52:54.320]  iodine are released into the atmosphere which are then readily absorbed into the body medical
[52:54.320 --> 52:59.200]  course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.400]  consequence of a nuclear accident radioactive poisoning potassium iodate can protect against
[53:04.400 --> 53:10.560]  radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine this shields the thyroid and prevents
[53:10.560 --> 53:16.720]  it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine potassium iodate is better than the iodide form
[53:16.720 --> 53:22.320]  because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children the elderly the sick and

[56:36.560 --> 56:43.520]  here it is wait a minute what are you talking about we bugged mr blake's cell you what we bugged
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.960]  the cell with alan's tape recorder just listen to this i can't listen to that but i can't listen to
[56:48.960 --> 56:56.160]  that i'm not permitted but paul you don't understand opie i can't listen to this now i told you about
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.080]  eavesdropping but paul this is different yes it's worse you overheard a conversation that was
[57:02.080 --> 57:12.320]  supposed to be private now i can't be a party to that i can't listen that's what i mean to do
[57:13.120 --> 57:19.760]  you bug the conversation between a lawyer and his client now that's violating one of the most sacred
[57:19.760 --> 57:30.400]  rights of privacy but paul no buts but if it helps the law opie the law can't use this kind of help
[57:30.400 --> 57:36.720]  because whether a man is guilty or innocent we have to find that out by due process of law
[57:39.200 --> 57:44.960]  oh yeah they can torture u.s citizens and then they put you before a kangaroo court and even
[57:44.960 --> 57:51.280]  if the kangaroo court finds you not guilty the president can then still say you're guilty
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.480]  boy that's something new and they've been spying on people's lawyers in the last five years and
[57:56.480 --> 58:05.440]  arresting them and using it in non-terror related cases so things have changed since the days of
[58:05.440 --> 58:12.000]  mayberry and andy griffin that's because the criminals the terrorists run the government
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.240]  and stage the terror attacks just like they ship in the drugs and orchestrate every other major
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.960]  crisis and then humanity itself's got a lot of problems and they start the crisis ball rolling
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.840]  and then we just help it snowball so the government doesn't get all the blame but they are
[58:27.840 --> 58:34.720]  pushing and setting fires they're arsonists in our society burning down our society they wreck things
[58:34.720 --> 58:42.560]  order out of chaos it's what they do it's how they operate and the sooner people who are
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.120]  compartmentalized who work for this system wake up and the sooner you start speaking out and standing
[58:49.120 --> 58:58.160]  up and not being cowards and social climbers the sooner we can turn this thing around all right

[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:18.960]  feeds into itself and just gets bigger and bigger yeah definitely um i'm actually working right now

[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:45.360]  levels he didn't know that the stannous and other types of fluoride that they're putting into the
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:53.920]  water he had no idea that it wasn't just that it was toxic waste with hundreds of chemicals in it
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.920]  directly from the fertilizer production chemical plant production they use fluoride to crack the
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.000]  the oil molecules and break it down into gasoline it just so they put toxic waste in the water
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.800]  it's a big joke yeah so i just take that the head guy in canada that got it put in is now running

[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:51.760]  and uh it's disgusting is what it is because our borders are wide open we got mexican troops
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.240]  shooting and killing border patrol and coming up to sheriffs at gunpoint in texas and putting guns
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.720]  to their head we've had the sheriffs on and taking drugs back from them they've seized
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.600]  and we've got american citizens being kidnapped i remember two years ago just all the deaths and
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:13.120]  the rocket attacks in texas and it goes on and on it goes on and on and it's all kept real quiet
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.000]  but that doesn't matter see we the military can't have guns or bullets for that but don't worry we
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.600]  can have them harassing alex jones because i'm here exposing their martial law plans terry
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.720]  anderson has a nationally syndicated program sunday nights and we're truly honored to have him with

[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.200]  do you hear what do you say buddy well i whenever i get a chance when i'm not driving around or at
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.960]  work on sunday nights i tune in and i i in one hour i get a really good condensed news report
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.800]  from all over the nation what's happening here on some of the biggest stations in the country
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.200]  and uh we're just so blessed to have somebody like you i wanted to get you on because you're
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:04.000]  a black man and uh hold on let me look yep you're right and i wanted to get it you know specific
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.040]  because you've talked about this in the past and i have a lot of black friends who've gone
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.760]  to the same thing we've seen the spray painting here in austin we've seen it all over the news
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.280]  uh we know about blacks being targeted we know that big gangs have said there's a bounty on
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:24.960]  blacks and uh just scores are killed a year just in la and san antonio and houston a year and i
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:31.760]  wrote an article paul watson did that is my team wrote an article uh racist mexican gangs ethnic
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.280]  cleansing blacks in la and they got a guy on the tape on cnn saying yeah they're dirty they're bad
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.280]  we don't want them around here and then they claim the blacks are taking over when it's really the
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.760]  blacks that are being overrun and again i'm out here bashing mexicans mexican americans the point
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.760]  is there shouldn't be denial about this and and usually on our message board 95 agree with us
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.840]  about 30 disagree with us this time saying how dare us make this up or or well blacks are bad
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.720]  too when they're targeting us and i'm sure that does happen but i'm really object i'm a white guy
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.960]  i don't have a dog in this fight i'm trying to really look at the facts over the years studying
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.280]  this and it looks like nine times out of ten it's the mexican gangs who are much bigger and more
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.400]  powerful and especially in prison and now in the public schools uh targeting blacks i mean if you
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.640]  look at the local news they admit that the that the illegal alien gangs at the schools that are
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.640]  you know eighty percent many of these schools are targeting blacks they seem to mainly leave whites
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.760]  alone was the cases of them killing them too uh so we know this is going on but by the time it gets
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.240]  on cnn it's blacks and hispanics fighting that's like if an old lady gets mugged and they say well
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.040]  the old lady got in a fight with the mugger no she got mugged terry anderson break it down for us
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.160]  well i had a problem with the article you guys wrote and that problem is you didn't hit it hard
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:50.160]  enough you you guys just skimmed the surface of it if you see if you get my point here alex
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.320]  it was a great article it really was no i'm sorry i know it's just not hardcore i'm sorry
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:02.160]  i i also read the comments that you speak another 30 who disagreed these are people who are naive
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.000]  and have no idea what my reality is here in los angeles california they have no idea zero
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.520]  zero idea now now let me say in their defense it is so unrealistic to believe that in 2007
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.400]  in the united states of america that one ethnic group would be targeting the other ethnic group
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.520]  in a city for extinction and i understand where people say oh this is just too far-fetched
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.440]  well when i when i used to hear about la reconquista from glenn spencer and others
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.560]  i thought it was far-fetched until i got into it and saw for myself and i became a believer
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.560]  and these people will become believers also when they see it for themselves but let me say this
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.440]  about the article your article hit it right on the money right on the money they are are
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:48.240]  systematically killing us in the city and let me do the disclaimer alex not all hispanics are
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:54.560]  doing it not all hispanics hate blacks but a lot of them do and here if if i leave here with one
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:00.800]  point today made i want it to be this one regardless if it's one person who's killed or a
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:07.360]  thousand people are killed there is no documented case of a black person killing a hispanic in this
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.480]  town because he was hispanic they are the only ethnic group that's doing it to us and i'll say
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.360]  again it might only be a small percentage of them doing it but they are the only ethnic group that
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.160]  has targeted another ethnic group whites are not killing blacks or hispanics or asians asians are
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.200]  not killing hispanics blacks or whites they are the only group that's doing this and this is what
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.320]  must be brought out in the into the open they have a hatred for black people not all but some
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.360]  hispanics do and and here's what angers me about those who don't have the hatred they're not
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:44.000]  standing up and condemning what their fellow hispanics are doing and that angers me terry
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.200]  gover some of the historical examples in the numbers well let me put it to you this way you
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.440]  mentioned a very good point a few minutes ago about the schools uh jefferson high school which
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.360]  is oh i guess a couple miles east of me here uh traditionally black school when i was in school
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:06.320]  about 100 years ago jefferson high was about 95 black uh it was a tough school we played football
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.480]  there we ran track there it was hard getting out of this place without a fight because it was a
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.320]  traditional thing they wanted to fight everybody that came there and beat them that's how schools
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.600]  are here in la but there was no racial animus it was just about it was the same thing for me
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.320]  growing up in dallas i was fighting black guys white guys rednecks we just all beat the hell
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.800]  out of each other there you go but there was no racial animus and let me tell you this that when
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:36.240]  that school was 80 black no violence 70 black no violence when it was 50 50 hispanics and blacks
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.720]  no violence and when it crept up to about 75 percent hispanic guess what happened to jeff
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.360]  i they started to attack the black kids on a systematic daily basis now jefferson high school
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:54.320]  right now is officially by by la city school numbers 94 Hispanic went from 94 black 20 years
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  ago to 94 percent hispanic now now alex that was driven by what the illegal alien invasion
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.280]  we did not have a change in demographics like that unless somebody's coming here illegally and
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.840]  they now have 300 kids in a school of 3500 that are black and they are being attacked every single
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:18.480]  day what does our mayor antonio poncho via regosa get on the on the radio and the tv and say we have
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.800]  to learn to get along blacks and hispanics are fighting each other the same parable you just
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.040]  use one of my employees one of my employees growing up in new york he told me the story
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.280]  and from memory uh he saw a black gets stabbed by hispanics there when he was in high school
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.320]  well it's happening here we had a black man who was stabbed taking his girl for the little girl
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.200]  to the grocery store one even out in harbor city that was two years ago we had five black men killed
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.200]  in hawaiian gardens four or five miles east of la uh in the last 10 years the highland park incident
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.960]  which is mentioned in the article where three black men were killed just because they were
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.640]  black there was another one in azusa there was another one in torrance there was another one in
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.920]  carson this is happening every day and let me say this to you we've got some rough rough housing
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.480]  projects here in la the jordan downs the nicholson gardens the imperial courts all
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:12.800]  100 black as the hispanics and i'm talking newly arrived hispanics to this country began to move
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.440]  into those housing projects not one not one event of violence ever happened never one time did the
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:25.760]  blacks say no you can't come in here but if black people go just drive through east la they'll get
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:32.080]  bricks and rocks thrown at them and worse what about this young black girl that just got killed
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.120]  that was in the out in the uh harbor harbor uh harbor gateway area harbor city let's talk about
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.000]  the specifics of what happened to her by these two shaved head hardcore gang bangers and it's
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.120]  weird it's if they look like they even have the tattoos it's like they're hispanic white
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.080]  supremacists they look and act just like it the skinheads they were looking to kill a black person
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.600]  204th street is a dividing line they told the black people do not come south of 204th street
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.840]  there's a grocery store right there small grocery store that was off limits black people couldn't
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  go in and get a quart of milk because if you go in there we're going to kill you and guess what
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.920]  this girl was down on the wrong side of the street talking to some people she knew they drove by and
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.440]  shot her because she was black two days later a man is picking up his daughter from a birthday
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.760]  party they shot him in the chest because he was black two days after that they killed another
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.080]  black man out there in the harbor gateway area and the whole time we're getting the same thing
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.320]  that you said about the lady being mugged we're getting the whole thing about this black and
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.360]  hispanic unrest no they're killing us they are killing black people and that's the bottom line
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.520]  that's the bottom line it is not there's no not naturally there's going to be some retaliation
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.480]  of course but it is all started by them certain parts of highland park where those three black
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:48.160]  men were killed if you even drive down the street and you're black they will attack you
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.800]  it is that bad now they're not doing this to whites though that's no they want to be white
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.320]  they want to be white alex i remember when hispanics were white i remember i remember
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:02.560]  when i was in school we had hispanics in the neighborhood they were white they were Caucasian
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.080]  they never claimed to be latin people that's new and you know why it's new it happened in the late
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.320]  60s early 70s when they started handing out the affirmative action they said we could get some
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:18.400]  these goodies if we're brown instead of white it's bizarre let's break it let's break it down
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:25.920]  some more i mean well let's talk about the plan of san diego i mean this is stated and it says
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.320]  kill all the whites and the blacks but for some reason i guess the blacks may be getting picked
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.640]  on though because you're a small minority i'm sure i'm sure it'll get around to the whites here

[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:03.520]  full of hatred for everybody else balkanize the nation divide and conquer terry anderson
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.640]  you know growing up i was like what is this racism thing i'm always hearing from the liberals about
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.800]  racism racism which is really a tool that everybody divided and thinking about their race
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.160]  but now as i've gotten older i have found racism and i've really found most of it emanating
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.840]  from one group and that is a large minority of the illegal alien population who is just
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:30.320]  completely nuts and uh completely out of control then you have the head of chicanos studies
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.240]  university of texas at arlington dallas openly saying we need to kill all white males 16 and
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.760]  older plan a san diego he says that word for word he says and now he just says we must plan
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:48.240]  of san diego for all whites and in plant of san diego it's also blacks and uh this is a i mean
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:54.560]  this is what is wrong with these people what's wrong with them is their lives are based on race
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:00.320]  alex you're you and i we're americans and you know we love this country uh we don't particularly love
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:06.560]  our government but we do love our country and as a result uh we we care about the country and fellow
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.920]  americans these people's lives are based on race let me tell you something they they identify
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.000]  along racial lines you know the olympics come every four years the guys in the in the ring
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.200]  boxing if this guy is a some white kid from wisconsin i'm cheering for him because he's an
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.120]  american okay if he's some asian kid from san francisco i'm cheering for him because he's an
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.640]  american most hispanics and i say most on this because it's true most hispanics and a lot of
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.240]  other races also but mostly hispanics will cheer for the hispanic from mexico from columbia from
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.920]  brazil anywhere against an american white black fighter they will even cheer against an american
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.720]  hispanic fighter because they feel more connected racially to those people from outside the country
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.120]  their lives are centered on race mine is not my life is centered on being a good american
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.400]  and doing what i can to preserve this great union and i mean that let's talk about some of the
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.880]  mainstream hispanic leaders who openly shoot their mouth off with racism and the corporate media
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.040]  funds them corporate contributions and it's supposedly we're not supposed to talk about
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.880]  it terry no you're not supposed to you're not supposed to know but look who look who funds these
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:16.320]  people ford foundation uh toyota gm uh nissan all these companies are funding these these racist
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.080]  organizations listen to the names of these organizations this is what gets me alex mexican
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.840]  american legal education defense fund league of united latin american citizens the national
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.320]  council of the race every one of these every one of these these organizations has either the word

[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.880]  write a book because this guy this guy could write a book about pepology 101 you know what

[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.280]  it's distasteful but it was done as a joke at this texas fraternity with the fried chicken in the in
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.920]  the 40s of beer and dressed up making fun of ghetto black people but the media is making a
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.520]  big deal about that why doesn't the media talk about all these black people getting killed in
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.360]  racial hits let's talk about something that really affects our lives that doesn't bother me in the
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:57.760]  least i mean that's just somebody having fun doing what they like do i like it no does it

[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.880]  to go against this illegal invasion and let me tell you why jesse jackson hates white people
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.200]  and when you hate white people you will do anything you think will affect and dilute the
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.400]  white people's power in this in this country now having said that uh i don't think anyone
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.880]  race of people should be in power but i think the multiculturalism and the diversity will handle
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.680]  itself over the over the period of time when you start forcing it by bringing people in here and
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.880]  these numbers you're going to upset the the trends in this country you're going to upset the fabric
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:36.000]  of this country you're going to have problems jesse jackson came out here the the the janitors

[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.440]  report they're watering it down it was in the local papers that it was the hispanics that attacked
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.280]  the blacks but by the time cnn was done it was just oh they're fighting but here's a clip where
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.800]  a hispanic gentleman on the street is saying things about black people i just wish they would
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.000]  just leave and go wherever they got to go and just leave us the way we were and everything would be
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.960]  cool we had a nice little nice little community here that is not nice anymore because of them

[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.600]  now think that it's the blacks and they say everybody get off our continent this is our
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:06.800]  continent uh i i mean the people from mezzo america have no claim to central north america
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:12.880]  they weren't here it'd be the plains indians it'd be the coastal uh natives uh native americans it's

[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.160]  in this country is happening now and all because our sorry president has allowed this to happen
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  well the scariest thing is my wife speaks spanish because she lived four years in spain
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.560]  so she can read what's on the grocery stores and hear what's on the radio
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.800]  and the radio stations are all like the invader the conqueror the rebel and that's it's on air

[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.720]  english language station he used to say all the time we're going to take la house by house block

[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.200]  me for instance i got salvadorans living on both sides of me now house next door to me came up for
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.400]  sale had a for sale sign on it black folks came and tried to buy the house alex they would ask
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.960]  the guy about the house the guy would he would know how to know how to english this guy wouldn't
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.120]  talk to him and when the english-speaking uh a real estate guy would say he would try to talk
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:11.520]  about about it they didn't want to sell him the house did you see the did you see the uh article
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:19.440]  in ap a few months ago a headline 500 top lenders uh support his spanish or something like that
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:26.080]  or no immigrants and then you read it and it's well they said we don't they don't have to have
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:31.120]  id for a housing loan or and it said this they said we're trying to it was of course a white
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.360]  corporate head he's going he's the head of a big bank going and they interviewed several of them
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.040]  well they need help and so we they don't even have to show id for a housing car or bank account
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.320]  and then and then a citizen whether they're hispanic black or white's got to show three
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:49.680]  forms of id i mean that's the government and banks in collusion you have to practically get
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:53.920]  a colonoscopy now to get to get a house in this town if you're not an illegal alien and that's
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.160]  the truth these people want every type of document you can present but if you're illegal
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:03.120]  you walk up okay well where'd you make if if i walk up with twenty thousand dollars to put down
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.800]  they want to know where did you get this down payment from these people walk up with twenty
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.680]  i had i know a guy that sold a house to a hispanic to it it was actually two hispanic families they
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:18.160]  brought in forty seven thousand dollars in cash to put down on the house no questions asked nobody
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.560]  asked well where did you get well the point is why is there this discrimination i mean i mean all
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.960]  these liberals want to find the discrimination they want to fight the inequality they want to
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.840]  okay well let me tell you where i found the majority of it and it's going on in this country
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.600]  why is the media the government the banks the corporations why are they rolling over doing
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.840]  somersaults playing twister to do anything they can to bring in as many illegal aliens as possible
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:49.440]  well let me tell you one of those bank chairmen said in the ap article it was a they said it all
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.600]  they said well we know there's a move to push them out of the country so we think they're so
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:59.200]  important for our economy that if we help them grow roots and get homes they can't be forced to
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:05.120]  leave yeah well that that that is one that is one way to see it so i'm asking you why is the
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.960]  establishment the money it's about the money and one other thing these are now the chosen people
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.400]  alex they are the chosen people they are getting things that i as a black person never got through
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.720]  affirmative action not that i ever wanted it but let me say this to you they are getting
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:26.080]  things that we were never given as a black community when my kids were in school elementary
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.800]  junior high and high school there was no books they couldn't take books home alex they couldn't
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.120]  take the books home there was one set of books for that classroom for every period of the day
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:42.160]  now they're building 160 schools in the city not county in the city of los angeles 160 schools
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.880]  for these illegal alien children and these jackpot babies of these of these illegal aliens
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.680]  they're building 160 schools when my kids couldn't get books when the schools were almost completely
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.960]  black they wouldn't give us nothing now that these people are are are invested in our schools guess
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.360]  what they get it all well it's simple they make everybody pay their taxes in this country to
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.440]  subsidize to bring in the cheap labor to drive down the wages and sink uh the richest middle
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.000]  class country in the world that's right and it's being cynically done by the elite now the good
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.400]  news is a lot of hispanics who are even illegal i've talked to now are starting to get this
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.760]  but there's a large group that'll say yeah we know we're being helped by your government
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.200]  but we don't care we're going to stab them in the back too i mean this is nuts it really is it
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:31.680]  really is and let me tell you what's building when you see this this this un uneven playing field when
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.480]  you see what they get that we don't get and i'm talking about americans when i say we guess what
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:42.400]  the animosity grows and when bush said in his speech we got to fix this without animosity and
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:50.240]  without uh uh uh amnesty he was wrong on both the animosity is here the animosity is here and from
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:57.200]  animosity comes hatred and i don't want to see that but it will come well plus his his guess
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.000]  worker program is called the lamest thing that's what it is it's always been that he ought to stop
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.560]  being such a liar and just say it he wants amnesty okay now we fight you on that but that's
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:12.000]  what it is it's nothing but amnesty that's all it's all that's ever been a pathway to citizenship
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.720]  well guess what alex i want to fight the pathway to citizenship because the pathway to citizenship
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:22.400]  that we had in 1986 was a disaster i want to take a few calls i agree i want to take a few calls
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:27.040]  terry and then let you go i know you're a busy man but what about the fact that 20 of the ground
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.560]  force in the army in iraq is illegal alien and what about did you did you see the ap in the
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.640]  boston globe of three weeks ago where they announced that they're going to go ahead and
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.080]  open even bigger recruiting offices in manila mexico city all ukraine everywhere this is
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.000]  outrageous i don't want any foreigners in my i'll take a legal resident alien who's been here a while
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.280]  in my armed forces but to actively recruit people from outside the country where's the
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.080]  loyalty who are they going to be loyal to well that's dangerous extremely dangerous
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:04.160]  foreigners will shoot americans under orders most americans won't no they won't most americans will
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.480]  not do that and if the government turns on the people which it already has but if it turns on
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.480]  them viciously guess what they're going to have a ready-made army to keep us in check
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:18.880]  well that's the plan and uh they're going to let the southwest secede as part of the
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.800]  north american union it's going to be a huge race war as glenn spencer has been saying
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.320]  and it is going to be just unbelievable blood in the streets i predict well the race war here's
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.080]  here's what i here's what i'm afraid of alex the race war is going to begin and everybody's going
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.000]  to forget how it got started just going to be blacks and hispanics fighting and then blacks
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.640]  and spanks and whites fighting but it all everybody must remember that article that you
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.840]  wrote that fabulous article on prison planet that your guy wrote that says that the hispanics are
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.640]  attacking others that's what we have to remember that's where it begins and then there will be
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:58.560]  retaliation well that's it's incredible i and again i have so many hispanic friends so do i
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.200]  and and and they're freaked out about what's happening and then last year they had a big
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.440]  loraza march and i wasn't gonna go protest until i called the directors and and the heads of it
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:15.200]  would laugh and go you know what's wrong gringo and i was like hey man i got i got hispanic friends
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:22.480]  oh you got a hispanic friend that's what you all said i'm like no man come on you know this is a
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.600]  racist thing on mexican independence day and i said i was calling to confirm this and you're
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:33.120]  and you're calling me a gringo and i said i'm gonna be out there and he says you won't dare
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.520]  you'll be afraid to you know well we saw he was afraid once i got out there we all go out there
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.720]  in protest so nobody's afraid of them and uh and uh well i wasn't gonna go till i got the threat
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.280]  and i'm just not going to put up with it people threatening me and if you want to see how racist
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.520]  and how threatening they could be read some of the emails on my website what do you mean i got
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:55.520]  the video of black men white men hispanics with their heads split open the cops stand there and
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.760]  take it yeah oh yeah re go but go read under mail received on our website the terryandersonshow.com
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.720]  read some of the hate mail some of the vicious nasty racist hate mail that i get from these
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:13.040]  people that'll let you know who who hates who and who's the racist but but see americans blacks
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:19.280]  whites hispanics we've been conditioned you know not to be racist and it's bad and so we're all
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.360]  you know kind of like these little chicken neck pathetic limp-wristed guilty people at least
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.920]  whites are and most whites it's just really pathetic and and you know living in the past
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:38.320]  50 100 years ago meanwhile you've got 500 million people south of the border and they are you know
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.280]  quote old-fashioned back when it all was about race and they haven't changed and we have and
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:49.520]  we're just made to be overrun there you go and it's happening it is happening well what do you
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:52.800]  say to the white liberals out there because they're the main ones mad at us about an article
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.520]  that just had the facts going it's not true or even if it is they're downtrodden or well the
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:06.560]  blacks are doing it too i mean here's an example we had silica stillo a highly decorated vietnam
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.680]  veteran former border patrol agent and he was uh you know head dea agent down there and he's not
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.120]  what you'd call conservative and he got up at a speech at ut and was talking about the threat of
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.600]  the illegals and how they're being allowed in the cia's involvement on drug dealing and and these
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.480]  liberal whites were getting up going but you're hispanic how can you say that he said look lady
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.680]  this isn't about being hispanic the facts are the facts yeah you know if if if hitler says it's
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.880]  raining outside guess what it's raining i mean i don't like him i don't like the klu klux klan i
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.760]  don't like any of these racist organizations but if they make a legitimate statement it's still a
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:45.040]  true statement you know it's just it's just like when when you're a child and your parents tell
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.520]  you something you want verification on everything well you know what they will write the first time
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.800]  you don't have to look for verification i don't care who you are if you're if if you've got a
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:59.440]  mind and you've got eyes in this country if you're if you're an american you can see what's going on
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:08.240]  your race matters not that's just stupid but they think it's liberal to go along with this and well
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.720]  listen black caucus so does the congressional black caucus the congressional black caucus in
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.040]  this country is selling out the black piece selling out america first of all but they're
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.920]  they're so pro black and so pro race consciousness that they are selling out their own race to people
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.720]  who are coming here and taking the low jobs the middle jobs taking over their communities taking
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.440]  over their schools taking over their whole culture and guess what the black caucus i have gone to
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.240]  their offices in washington dc we've almost been thrown out of me and my son and my buddy carlos
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.400]  from washington dc we went from black caucus office to black caucus office they are some of
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.040]  the nastiest people you have ever met in your life to try to reason with well let me let me
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:53.360]  expand on that and then we'll take a few calls because this is very important um a year and a
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.280]  half ago i discovered the plan of san diego that was mainstream i just didn't know about it
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:04.160]  and i wrote an article about it and the texas civil rights review attacked me white guys wrote
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.680]  the story and they said well it's true there's a plan to kill all the whites 16 and older but you
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:16.400]  know hispanics have been downtrodden and they're allowed to talk like that i mean that's crazy it
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.760]  really is and these people are nuts like that nobody should be allowed to talk like that i
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.360]  don't care how downtrodden you've been you know unbelievable well downtrodden i mean i mean you
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.680]  got a bunch of chicken-neck white people who are running around guilty licking everybody's boots i
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.080]  mean what have whites done now i mean i mean i don't even know what they're talking about
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.600]  well you know what's going to happen those same whites have to be bit when they get bit when those
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.000]  liberals get bit oh i've got liberal blacks here in the in black folks in my neighborhood here
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.920]  who told me to lighten up on these people they were people of color like us they were just
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:54.800]  they were just like us they were they were minorities a term that i never used like us
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.880]  and i should leave them alone some of those black people have knocked on my door and said man how
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.520]  did you know it was going to come to this because now it's personal they got one next door to them
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.040]  with chickens and goats they got one next to them that has loud mariachi parties every other night
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.040]  they got 20 people living in the house next to them and they're fed up with it and they're
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.280]  looking at me like i'm some kind of prophet no i'm not a prophet i just had my eyes open
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.600]  how did you start waking up when did that happen oh i guess it was the mid 80s
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.480]  right around the time of of the amnesty when i heard amnesty was going to happen i was very
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:31.840]  unpolitical when i said when i heard they were going to do the amnesty alex i said they must be
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.400]  crazy i'm the most unpolitical unaware person in the world but i know that ain't going to work
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.320]  that's not going to work and it didn't and that's what i well it works for what the government
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.480]  really wanted was to bring i mean look you got six and a half billion people in the world
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.520]  six million of them want to come here there's 180 million new births a year we just can't do it
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:55.360]  can't do it can't do it but yeah it did work for those who wanted it the businesses loved it and
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.000]  even they didn't love it because guess what once those people were legalized they couldn't exploit
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.320]  them anymore and they had to get a new set of illegals so that didn't even work for them it
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:09.120]  worked for the government well that's a key point you know what one more segment just five more
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.760]  minutes i'm going to come back and give callers a chance robert walt paul a few others to get on

[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:54.800]  uh one of the members of the council on foreign relations as well so i'm not sure if he's still
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:01.440]  a member i don't know if they know i'm confirmed yeah no he's a total total front man yeah um and
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.920]  then um the other the other thing is is that um uh i was watching like everybody else watching
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:14.640]  the state of union address and as bush was leaving um and getting his uh royal fanny um
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:20.720]  kissed on his way out um there is a man over on the left-hand side just before he exited the door
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.960]  giving him the horn sign to him and a thumbs up as i would like to know if anybody's got
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.680]  that video and take a look and see who exactly sure probably a ut fan what else is on your mind
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:38.880]  sir um and um the other thing is is that i totally agree with uh this this immigration thing and and
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.520]  you know i really don't really blame them too much because they've been downtrodden for a long time
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.280]  but you know just like anything else if there's a rabid dog coming towards my house i'm going to
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:54.400]  shoot it absolutely well well i mean here's an example the germans got downtrodden for 20 years
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.120]  after world war ii under the treaty of her size and hitler used that to then hype them up to go
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.000]  crazy so just because people you know had it tough doesn't mean they have a right to attack everybody
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:12.560]  hey i've had it tough too who do i who can i attack that's my question it is tribalism and
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.320]  then we've been conditioned not to have it and then the third world populations do yeah they
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.080]  do that is true absolutely i mean we're all tribal to an extent but not i'm not going to get tribal
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.720]  environment you know what i mean that's where i draw the line i appreciate your call uh robert
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.800]  let's talk to walt walt where you calling from hello uh alex yes go ahead i'd like to ask uh
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:41.120]  terry several questions terry yes sir uh two days ago hutton gibson talked about the vatican
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.760]  and i'd like to ask you this question what is the religion the majority of the latin americans
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.280]  coming into this country right now the catholics what were the religion of the people that were
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:56.480]  the illegal or or flood of immigrants that come in in the 1850s in the united states from europe
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:01.680]  what religion were they i couldn't tell you i recall my catholics okay from this country
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:08.800]  floods to new york okay the point is the united states was formed by protestants and the remainder
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.320]  of this country okay what's left of the protestant reformation is the purpose of all the illegal
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:19.520]  immigration all the racial tension and destruction that's going on in this country right now
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:27.200]  is is directed by rome that's the problem the world government is alex jones has talked about
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:34.480]  is controlled by the vatican the pope wants to be the ruler of the world he claims the title
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:41.920]  of temporal and spiritual leader of all men worldwide because here's my problem with that
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:46.560]  i can't fight that i can fight the guy that's illegally in my country and i can fight the
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:50.960]  government for letting him come here that's that's i'm not i'm not disputing you on it what i am
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:56.240]  saying is that that's hard for people to get their hands around and fight that's what the problem is
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:02.640]  jerry is the racial wars racial tension and division is is the tool used by the vatican to
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:07.200]  destroy any nation internally well i mean you can't debate that the pope's been calling for
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.400]  one world government so uh you know when it all started i guess you can debate you can't debate

[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:41.360]  him in the grand lodge of texas in waco in the early 90s right after he had been nisha uh elected
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:46.640]  president and uh he couldn't speak english but he had an interpreter there and he you know his
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:53.520]  speech was uh you know my people this and my people that uh the the curious thing i i just
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:57.440]  wanted to let you know that so maybe you could figure out a way it fit in now i live in houston
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.000]  i have the same problem that terry has with the illegals uh i have a man that moved in behind me
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.360]  that doesn't work lives in a shack and uh goes in a slop jar and then has it pumped out into a hose
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:13.200]  into my backyard i had to ask him not to do that and uh the man across the street from me bought
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.240]  a house next door to me for 103 000 now i mean that doesn't sound like a lot in most of the
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.840]  country but in this little area of houston it was quite a bit of money for that house
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:29.440]  and uh he brags about how he celebrates two birthdays one for his mexican uh name and one
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:37.120]  for his uh american social security number and you know i just uh i was i'm sick of the immigration
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.320]  issue it's what turned me against bush i voted republican all my life uh i was a free mason in
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:50.240]  92 for about 15 years i guess i still am i guess i don't know but the thing about the the issues
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:57.600]  just uh got to me on the other i appreciate you well thank you sir comments on what he said jerry
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.680]  yeah i i can i can sympathize with him houston's a tough time when it comes to this issue uh most
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:08.560]  most border states are but but you know what he and i he and i have to realize this we're no we're
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.600]  no longer exclusive these border states are now up into illinois and indiana and kentucky and
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:18.400]  tennessee it's all over so uh i understand and i and i also understand what he said about bush
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.680]  a lot of people voted for bush if you have no other reason to hate this man this is a good one
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.760]  well i mean let's say we've got let's take the government's number 14 million the real experts
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.800]  say over 30 what number do you get i mean because i'm told it's even well above 30 million now
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:37.360]  i i don't know i i would go with the 30 million that that's pretty close for me
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:42.960]  and all the studies i've done that looks about right it's unbelievable or maybe more i mean you
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.880]  know it could be a hundred million we have no way of knowing we can't we can't know because
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.880]  they won't let us ask let's go ahead and talk to uh chris in texas go ahead chris last call

[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:00.960]  speaking with you today um i had the same experience in a rural environment so it's not
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:05.360]  just constrained to large cities no you know you're right chris and i'm hearing from people
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:10.240]  here in california in the san joaquin valley in the farming areas same problem is what you just
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.640]  said and i'm seeing people do things that are dangerous to the uh common goods like putting
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.600]  fence lines across creek beds and that sort of thing in order to keep cattle in a non-restricted
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:24.480]  area well it should be restricted but it's not alex i called for a couple of other reasons i've
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.840]  been on hold for a while um so i mentioned metropolis earlier um there's a moment in
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.000]  metropolis in another version not the giorgio morota version the popular one where you actually
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  get to see the protagonist um with a vision that sees the machine that the servants are feeding
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.040]  becomes a vision and becomes molly and they actually have a screen it's a silent film
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.840]  they have a screenshot with the text molly and very big block letters wasn't that an
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:54.160]  italian version uh it's a film by fritz lang from 1926 and i think that was the italian version i'm
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:05:00.080]  not certain all right that's very fascinating and one quick thing also one the only thing that i've
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.120]  been able to find that president bush has done this good and this ties into something you did
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:08.720]  earlier was i believe he awarded andy griffith the presidential medal of freedom yeah but he
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:14.080]  does that as a stunt to make himself look good by giving good people awards thanks for the call

[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:22.960]  see what happens with it coming up at 33 after and it's a confirmed interview but i just i learned
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:28.480]  with murphy's law it's like the time i had charlton heston on and then he was trying to get on with us

[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:05.120]  uh but but let's get to this first government reportedly monitoring anti-war groups in austin
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:09.680]  now by the way i happen to know veterans for peace in austin i know it's a real liberal organization
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:17.680]  but don darlin was a submarine uh rescue ship captain i mean this guy was you know 40 something
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.800]  years old as a captain doing doing emergency dives just an amazing individual they lied to him
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.880]  about radiation they were dealing with they also gave him orders one time to do an emergency
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:35.520]  shutdown for a test on the first nuclear submarine what was its name it had the same name as a
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.280]  submarine in 20 000 leagues under the sea but it's the famous one he was in there before that
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:48.880]  in the in the nuclear corps and he had a degree in in uh in uh what do they call a nuclear physicist
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:55.360]  even though you're an engineer in that and they gave him an order to emergency power down which
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:01.520]  they knew uh would radiate everybody and they told him it wouldn't be a problem but he was a
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:07.440]  scientist he he knew that wasn't the case he followed the order and he said there was a good
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.880]  chance it would have blown up uh and gone critical and that he would have been when it killed
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:16.560]  everybody he would have been blamed later but he still followed the order and of course he's been
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.480]  radiated his uh that crew was radiated then they were radiated other times and he just found out
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:27.360]  they don't care about you they hate you it's their enjoyment to hurt the troops because they hate
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:30.960]  you they know you're a good american who thinks you're fighting for america so they use you in
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:37.040]  new world order ops and then they out they revel in doing bad things giving you experimental vaccines
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.200]  abusing you ripping you off not giving you your pension just also my point is one of the heads of
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.600]  veterans for peace here in austin is don darlin i've been friends with for about six seven years
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:56.800]  captain don darlin i mean later again left the uh nuclear submarine engineer corps and then
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.360]  did nuclear submarine rescue i mean just and if you know how hard it is to go through
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.600]  he he's one of the oldest people to ever go through i don't know why i'm off on don darlin
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.840]  right now just these are the great people i get to meet uh he was one of the oldest people to ever
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:18.320]  go through the navy diver program and if you have any idea how hard that is um just unbelievably
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:24.640]  dangerous super deep water dives all sorts of things uh you know those full body suits the big
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:29.440]  metal suits just you name it but but side issue these are good people i know them they're not a
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:35.280]  bunch of dirty commies as the media likes to say but even if they were a bunch of dirty commies
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.600]  the point is it's illegal to have the military spying on the american people but it goes on
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.200]  everywhere man i've been at mainline anti-war protest and there's official u.s army not even
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:49.760]  reserve out there with video cameras scanning everybody taking photos and videotaping
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:58.240]  and i've never really told these stories i've vaguely mentioned it but i've had special forces
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:05.600]  special forces troops uh assigned to black ops threatened me five separate times on the ground
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:09.600]  well no one time they didn't threaten me they were they were just
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:18.320]  following me around and and get in my face and stuff and but that was a long time ago that
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.480]  that stuff all quit about six seven years ago because they were you know trying to intimidate
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:27.040]  me then and they've now had a chance to assess and they know i'm never shutting up you can put
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.720]  a gun to my head and say shut up or i'm going to blow your head off and i'd say pull the trigger
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:37.680]  i mean you people are evil i'm committed to defending this country 110 and none of it works
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:45.280]  on me now last year uh a even more mainline peace group in houston brought peanut butter and jelly
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:52.080]  sandwiches and coffee to haliburton workers as they were going in by the front gate telling
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:56.240]  him telling recruiters how dangerous du was and how dangerous it was in iraq trying to educate
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.960]  them and they had the military infiltrate the groups and spy on them and all this you saw that
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:07.280]  at fahrenheit 9 11 2 others spying on the little peace group in northern california and this is
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:13.120]  what they do but it's a lot worse than this okay i mean i've had the internal hit team types
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:21.600]  threaten me repeatedly and they ought to be so ashamed of themselves you know what you've done is
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:27.760]  you only come you only confirmed to me how bad things were years ago when you did that you know
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.920]  when you walk up to me in a parking lot and get back in your government car right in front of me
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:37.680]  you know you are ashamed to this country and every veteran true veteran we've had
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:44.400]  i mean you are despicable then we've had other variants so that we did catch on video where
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:48.880]  you know we're on the side i-35 and troops come up and say turn your cameras off or we're in belton
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.320]  and troops come up yelling saying turn your cameras off and we say no we're not you're the
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:58.160]  ones that filmed me before you're absolutely right we filmed you before and we'll film you again
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.760]  we're free americans
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:08.160]  we're not going to let our forebears down that fought and died to give us freedom
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:13.200]  to give us a foundation that gave us a chance so we could fight to keep it you always got to fight
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:21.440]  to keep it let's uh go to this kxan whitewash piece listen to it a new report that says the
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.960]  federal government is monitoring anti-war groups in austin chin is live near the ut campus with
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:32.320]  more shannon good evening robert according to the aclu report released last week the department of
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:38.000]  defense has been monitoring peace groups around the country at least two of them in austin were
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.200]  put on the government radar because of a protest outside of an army recruiting station in doby
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:54.240]  mall some would say protests are part of the spirit of austin at an anti-war gathering in
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:16:00.320]  april of 2005 the group veterans for peace participates in a protest outside the army
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:06.160]  recruiting office at doby mall much like this one two years before but this unclassified document
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:12.800]  released by the aclu shows that a 2005 protest at doby mall was reported by the defense department's
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:19.600]  threat and local observation notice or talon database at one protest in austin texas it reads
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:24.240]  the protesters blocked the entrance to the recruitment office with two coffins
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:30.000]  one draped with an american flag and the other covered with an iraqi flag a certain amount of my
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:41.280]  activist spirit is angry for sure and it fuels me why why because it requires it's saying do
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:47.680]  something about this you can't you can't live with this tom heikela was just 21 when he was drafted in
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:55.120]  1967 he spent nine and a half months in vietnam when i came home from vietnam war i knew i had
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.720]  participated in something that i shouldn't have done and it plagued me
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.600]  so he joined veterans for peace and as the chair of the austin chapter he talks to young people
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:16.080]  about non-violence is veterans for peace a threat to the united states no no it's an asset
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:22.160]  it's unfortunate that it's it's not as unusual as we might suspect the local aclu chapter echoes the
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:28.080]  national group's call for further investigation some misuse of taxpayer dollars and resources when
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.840]  there are actually very real threats out there that uh the government should be targeting
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:40.480]  now the aclu report also acknowledges that the pentagon has admitted that much of the information
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:45.920]  gathered on anti-war activities should not have been in the talon database or classified as a
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:51.840]  threat to the u.s but the aclu argues also that far too little is known about how this information
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.480]  was gathered in the first place they are now calling for congressional hearings
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:04.080]  alive on the ut campus shannon wilson kxan nbc austin the talon threat database
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:11.680]  the talon threat database hey uh for people in these units if you want to see the threat turn
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:17.440]  on the state of the union you want to see the threat go down to uh the pratt house where the
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:22.640]  council on foreign relations is based and don't roll your eyes at me go read council on foreign
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:30.160]  relations publications the end of the free market the end of private property the end of the second
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:38.640]  amendment and if you twit don't understand who are part of this system that the bill of rights

[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.640]  capacity and you're too weak-minded to break out of it if you had moral courage you do what
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:08.000]  smently butler did you do what don darlin did you do what colonel donna grand prix has done you do
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.120]  what general benton k parton has done you do what so many real patriots have done when they see a
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.360]  threat to the bill of rights of constitution they break with it and if you don't know they're
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:25.760]  violating every canon of this free society i can't help you any more if you think i'm a threat and

[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.760]  head where they hold the handsets according to new research a large-scale study found that those who
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:49.360]  would regularly use mobile phones for longer than 10 years were almost 40 more likely to develop
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:56.240]  nervous system tumors called gliomas near to where they hold their phones we've got to stop
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:01.440]  this and you use them in front of your children they got toy cell phones i see six seven-year-olds
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:04.800]  with their cell phones they'll get them a cell phone keep track of them when they're at school
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:10.240]  you know 10 year olds uh and then now they're putting uh blackberry systems and video games
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:16.640]  and ipods into cell phones so the kids are all going to have them this is all part of the eugenics
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:22.000]  program the new research to be published later this year in the international journal of cancer
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.800]  is the second study to suggest the second study there's hundreds an increased risk of specific
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:32.320]  types of brain tumors in regions close to the mobile phone emissions enter the head however
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:37.840]  a number of other studies are found financed by the government uh so they can then claim cell
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.080]  phone companies didn't manage it but the cell phone companies they lobbied and the government
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.080]  funds these fake studies however a number of other studies have found no increase in health
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.720]  risk associated with mobile phone use professor laurie chalice the chairman of the government
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:55.040]  funded mobile telecommunications health research program said last week that most research has
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:29:01.040]  shown that mobile phones were safe in the short term but there was a hint of something yeah back
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:08.000]  in the 40s smoke more camels it's good for your health come on for longer term users professor
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.960]  chalice who was negotiating funding for a long-term international study said that last night i agree
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:18.880]  with the authors that this is a hint that needs further exploration it's further reason why a
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:23.040]  long-term study is necessary folks there's no doubt they're bad for your brain it's no doubt
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:29.360]  it's a high-powered microwave transmitter no doubt it's no doubt these things buy schools you know
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.520]  where they get the extra money for putting them on the schools and businesses there's no way there's
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:38.800]  a bunch of studies in australia u.s and england and the netherlands and germany where they have
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:42.880]  these big high-powered cell towers in the top two floors of the building half of the people get
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:49.680]  cancer i mean you know it's just numbers off the chart the cell transmitters are giant microwave
[02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:54.480]  transmitters super deadly so that's a lot more deadly than a little cell phone up against your
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:30:02.640]  head but it's a powerful transmitter all right we will uh get our illustrious guest on talk about
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:08.880]  his new movie and a lot more got a new coffee line out too i'm alex jones the websites are

[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:41.600]  did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:46.240]  well the glass has a natural resonance if the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:50.480]  is big enough the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters using
[02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:54.880]  a similar principle royal raymond wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:59.360]  using different resonant frequencies the biosolutions frequency instrument uses the same

[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:50.420]  director and writer on with us
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:52.420]  i'm a fan of so many of his films
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.420]  The Elephant Man, Eraserhead
[02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:56.420]  the tv show
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:36:59.420]  Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway
[02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:01.420]  it goes on and on
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:03.420]  i even like Dune
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:05.420]  what an epic film there
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:07.420]  and he is a prolific individual
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:09.420]  he's got a new movie coming out
[02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:11.420]  he was just screening it here in Austin
[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:13.420]  he has a signing at Barnes and Nobles
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:15.420]  today at North Austin we'll tell you about that
[02:37:15.420 --> 02:37:17.420]  we have links to it up on
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:20.420]  www.wars.com right now
[02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:22.420]  and you know he's also made headlines
[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:25.420]  with some of his statements in politics lately
[02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:27.420]  he is David Lynch
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:31.420]  and the new film coming out is Inland Empire
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:33.420]  Mr. Lynch it's a real honor to be able to speak with you
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:35.420]  good to talk to you Alex
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:38.420]  tell us about Inland Empire
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:41.420]  i haven't gotten a chance to see it yet
[02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:43.420]  tell us about the film
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:45.420]  well all i say about it is
[02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:47.420]  it's a story of a woman in trouble
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:51.420]  and i'm told it's like quite a few of your films
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:54.420]  it's pretty complex
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:56.420]  well you know Alex
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:58.420]  i love stories
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:00.420]  and particularly
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:02.420]  stories that
[02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:04.420]  are at one level concrete
[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:06.420]  stories
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:08.420]  that hold abstractions
[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:10.420]  and abstractions are
[02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:13.420]  things that cinema can say
[02:38:13.420 --> 02:38:15.420]  things that are
[02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:17.420]  you know we experience in life
[02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:19.420]  but cinema can say them
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:21.420]  so it's an experience that
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:23.420]  may be difficult to put into words
[02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:25.420]  but cinema can say it
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:28.420]  and people can feel-think it
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:32.420]  and it's a beautiful language of film
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:34.420]  and so i would say
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:36.420]  Inland Empire
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:38.420]  holds some of this
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:41.420]  i mean how would you describe it though
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:44.420]  i mean if you could say there's a plot to this David Lynch films
[02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:46.420]  i've just read a synopsis of it
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:48.420]  and it's getting obviously rave reviews
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.420]  i've got several here in New York Times
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:52.420]  Austin American Statesmen in front of me
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:54.420]  i mean for those that
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:56.420]  i mean to give them some handle
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:38:58.420]  what's the basics with Inland Empire
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:00.420]  well you know Alex
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:02.420]  bless your heart man
[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:04.420]  it's a story of a woman in trouble
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:06.420]  and that's it
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:10.420]  i always think i don't like to know too much about a film going in
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:14.420]  and i love the experience of
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:15.420]  there you are
[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:17.420]  and the curtains are opening
[02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:19.420]  the lights go down
[02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:22.420]  and we get to go into a world that didn't exist
[02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:25.420]  and now we're going into that
[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:28.420]  no you do bring the journey of mystery
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:30.420]  and that's why your films are so powerful
[02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:32.420]  in fact a lot of your dvds
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:33.420]  of your previous films
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:35.420]  don't even have chapter markers do they
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:37.420]  you know i sort of
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:39.420]  i understand that people
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:41.420]  you know like it but i really believe
[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:43.420]  i never skip ahead i never go to the back of the book
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.420]  well you know the thing is that
[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:48.420]  this chapter thing started
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:52.420]  and dvds extra content started
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:55.420]  and the film seems to get pushed to the back
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:57.420]  when it should be forefront
[02:39:57.420 --> 02:39:59.420]  big you know giant thing
[02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:01.420]  and um
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:04.420]  so i just like to protect the film
[02:40:04.420 --> 02:40:06.420]  no i understand now i've got to ask you this question
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:08.420]  we'll get back into inland empire
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:10.420]  and some of the other things you're doing in your new book
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:13.420]  but lost highway i mean i have my own interpretation of it
[02:40:13.420 --> 02:40:16.420]  and you know basically like an alternate reality
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:19.420]  or a total hallucination
[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:20.420]  somebody who's insane
[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:23.420]  i mean any comments from the director
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:25.420]  on lost highway
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:27.420]  well you know i've been saying lately that
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:30.420]  you know looking back on lost highway
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:34.420]  that that um i i wrote the screenplay with barry gifford
[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:36.420]  he and i wrote the screenplay together
[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:39.420]  and and there we never really talked about this
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:41.420]  but um
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:46.420]  it's it's it was at a time when the oj simpson trial was going on
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:52.420]  and you know um similar things with the character fred madison
[02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:57.420]  um how a human being can do a thing
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:00.420]  uh that is so horrible
[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:04.420]  and keep on living and smiling and as oj is playing golf
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:08.420]  so um there is a thing that we've discovered a
[02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:15.420]  a psychogenic fugue where the mind tricks itself to hide the horror of something done
[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:18.420]  that's what i thought in fact i was arguing with some of my staff last night
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:20.420]  and they were saying it was one thing and i was saying
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:22.420]  no it's two different personalities
[02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:26.420]  well it's you know you can you can i won't say anymore but
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:29.420]  um the thing is that uh more often than not
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:33.420]  um well in the long run nothing stays hidden
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:36.420]  so uh there you go
[02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:39.420]  well i'm having a psychogenic feud right now
[02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:43.420]  because i want to get you on about all these great subjects and i'm such a big fan
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:46.420]  and you know we have some mutual friends
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:49.420]  uh one of them when i was out in hollywood a few weeks ago said uh
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:52.420]  if you talk to david lance because i talked to emilio estebes and he
[02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:57.420]  he he was you know saying how great you were and the talk you guys had had about a subject
[02:41:57.420 --> 02:42:00.420]  and then i was talking with charlie and he was saying yeah have you talked to him you know
[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:05.420]  uh or or i hope to talk to him sometime and tell him thanks uh for some things you've said
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:08.420]  and i'm having a psychogenic feud right now mr lynch
[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:11.420]  because i i'm trying to control myself and be honorable
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:13.420]  okay well good for you alex
[02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:17.420]  oh man i uh i uh
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:20.420]  okay uh tell us about the new book sir
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:27.420]  the new book is called catching the big fish meditation consciousness and creativity
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:33.420]  and it's um a book you know about you know um
[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:40.420]  my 33 years of meditation and um and how it works with
[02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:46.420]  catching ideas because i say in there that you know ideas are like fish
[02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:51.420]  and we can we can catch these ideas and if we can expand that
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:56.420]  container of consciousness we can catch ideas on a deeper and deeper level
[02:42:56.420 --> 02:43:01.420]  and it and we can get creativity flowing by learning how to dive
[02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:06.420]  within and contacting that unbounded infinite ocean inside
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:11.420]  every human being and it feeds the creativity and it feeds the
[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:15.420]  joy of doing things oh i agree in fact you're a prolific guy i mean you're
[02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:20.420]  working hard i mean on this multifaceted tour right now uh just shifting gears
[02:43:20.420 --> 02:43:24.420]  talking about you know things in your subconscious uh in twin peaks the owls
[02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:29.420]  the owls are omens of evil the owls the owls in in more western or greek mythology it's
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:34.420]  wisdom uh or the guardian of the high places but in native american it's a harbinger of
[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.420]  evil and destruction uh why did you uh why are the owls these totems of wickedness in
[02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:44.420]  your uh twin peaks mostly that came from mark frost so i don't even i
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:49.420]  don't really you know um no um but there they came and
[02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:54.420]  um there's no there's evil is a strange thing that you know to think
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:59.420]  about um there's plenty of it especially just on the surface of our
[02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:04.420]  world and and it it all you know is in a ball with
[02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:09.420]  negativity and negativity is like a dark black
[02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:14.420]  cloud you know over us we all got a bunch of negativity and stresses
[02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:19.420]  and and all kinds of things floating in us and we got it a big cloud of it on the
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:24.420]  world and if you want to blow that negativity away
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:29.420]  all you have to do is learn to dive within and ramp
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:34.420]  up that light of unity inside everyone you grow that light up
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:39.420]  and the side effect of that is negativity starts to recede
[02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:44.420]  the key to enlightenment the full potential of the human being is there and the key to
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:49.420]  peace on earth is there it's very very beautiful
[02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:54.420]  mr lynch we're speaking with legendary director and writer david lynch
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:59.420]  earlier you talked about how in lost highway you were kind of paralleling in a
[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:04.420]  way oj and how he could live a normal life and then be involved in other things
[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:09.420]  that aren't so positive any of your latest films or works
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:14.420]  is there any art type of images that in your mind are representing things happening
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:19.420]  in the world with the war in iraq or politics or the patriot act no
[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:25.420]  you know they say that all kinds of art reflects our world
[02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:30.420]  and i think that ideas come out of you know our
[02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:35.420]  feeling the world and you know hearing and seeing things but the ideas
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:40.420]  themselves that i get are separate they're not made to show a
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:45.420]  message they're not made to you know do anything it's just ideas that you get you fall
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:50.420]  in love with them and you see the way cinema for instance could translate those ideas
[02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:55.420]  and then you're rolling and a whole thing comes out and only later as
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:46:00.420]  more and more of it comes out do you see a theme or do you see a thing you know like that but you
[02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:05.420]  don't set out to tell a message i understand my
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:10.420]  listenership will crucify me if i don't at least mention the
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:15.420]  dutch tv interview that you did and you commented on
[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:20.420]  the film loose change second edition and what happened with the towers and just
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.420]  said people can't deal with that why
[02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:30.420]  why did you even bring that up or did you know they were going to bring that up you know i
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:35.420]  knew they were going to bring it up and so you know you saw what i
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:40.420]  said you know we're we're all you know like detectives
[02:46:40.420 --> 02:46:45.420]  human beings are like detectives we we look at our
[02:46:45.420 --> 02:46:50.420]  world and we keep looking at it and and and we get these
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:55.420]  feelings that there's more going on than meets the eye and
[02:46:55.420 --> 02:47:00.420]  you know this is a it's a world of clues a world of
[02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:05.420]  mystery but the mystery can get you know can get solved and
[02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:10.420]  you know but you can find these answers for you know
[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:15.420]  a lot of these things within as far as nine eleven goes
[02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:20.420]  there's you know there's things that you know we
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:25.420]  we saw that conjure questions and
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:31.420]  something doesn't seem quite right so it makes us wonder
[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:36.420]  and the next step is we need answers we need answers
[02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:41.420]  that's all well i certainly agree with you you know two months before
[02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:46.420]  nine eleven i can send you a video clip of it we ought to go post it on your website we should talk about your website you've got
[02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:51.420]  a lot of artwork there from different perspectives on nine eleven that you're allowing
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:56.420]  folks to submit and post there we've got a link to your site up on infowars.com
[02:47:56.420 --> 02:48:01.420]  right now and we'll give out that web address before you leave us in any other sites
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:06.420]  that you think are important Mr. Lynch but you know the establishment told us or an arm
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.420]  of it that this is a foundational event and now we've got Newt Gingrich talking about open
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:16.420]  martial law and the end of free speech in America so it's literally survival of my family now
[02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:21.420]  and my country to expose this and i did get the questions and i did
[02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:26.420]  talk about what was going to happen two months before it took place because i saw preparatory actions in the media and
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:31.420]  so that's why i am compelled to to do what i do
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:36.420]  exposing what happened on that day to me you say you have questions
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:41.420]  what are a few of the questions that you have concerning nine eleven i have the
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:46.420]  same questions that were brought up and all the things you mentioned and i just don't have the answers
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:51.420]  in the dutch piece you mentioned how the towers fell at the speed of one of them
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:56.420]  fell at the speed of gravity which every engineer that's looked at it says is impossible
[02:48:56.420 --> 02:49:01.420]  unless there were controlled demolitions i understand Alex you know
[02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:06.420]  there's there's there's questions arising from
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:11.420]  each of the events that day and i don't have the answers
[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:16.420]  i just have the the you know is your instinct
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:21.420]  it's no instinct means i'm hungry i want to eat intuition is the thing
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:26.420]  intuition is higher than intellect it's emotion and intellect
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:31.420]  it's a flowing of knowingness now going back to meditation when you learn to dive
[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:36.420]  within which is so beautiful an experience a human
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:41.420]  human experience you contact the ocean of
[02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:46.420]  knowingness pure vibrant consciousness knowingness intuition grows
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:51.420]  intuition is like it's an ocean of solutions and you get that
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.420]  knowingness going you know it it's it's feeds the
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:01.420]  you know all artistic processes and all creative processes nothing we
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:06.420]  do as man this doesn't you know start with it starts with an idea
[02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:11.420]  catching those ideas and seeing a way a knowing a way to
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:16.420]  translate that to make something and make it feel correct based on the
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:21.420]  idea and you know it just goes like that so
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:26.420]  there's an intuition going when we see things well also we know that
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:31.420]  only two or three percent of our intellect is focused in the cerebral cortex so the more powerful centers
[02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:36.420]  of the brain really already know the answer but like you said in that Dutch interview people can't handle
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:41.420]  what their intellect deep down is telling them at the conscious level
[02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:46.420]  yeah well there's what did you just say in the beginning
[02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:51.420]  well I was just saying that the cerebral cortex let me just tell you one thing
[02:50:51.420 --> 02:50:56.420]  about that brain of ours they say we only use five or ten percent of it
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:51:01.420]  but now with brain research they can show you that when you transcend
[02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:06.420]  when you really experience the deepest level of life the full brain
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:11.420]  is engaged and it's the only experience that
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:16.420]  brings the whole brain into you know coherence this is amazing I totally
[02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:21.420]  agree with you I call it super brainstorming do it every day and
[02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:26.420]  thinking you know doesn't do it well stay there tell us more about it in the final segment quick break

[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:23.420]  there's so much misunderstanding about meditation there's so many different kinds of meditation
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:28.420]  but there truly is a within and if you think about it so
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:33.420]  many sentences we've heard have the word within within within within the
[02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:38.420]  sense the kingdom of heaven first seek the kingdom of heaven which lies within
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:43.420]  and all else will be added unto you so the sleeper must awaken the
[02:55:43.420 --> 02:55:48.420]  sleeper must awaken and you can awaken it by experiencing that deepest level that
[02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:53.420]  kingdom of heaven within we were talking during the break and I was saying 9-11 I think the key to
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:58.420]  exposing the soul of jen and you're saying that's the surface I guess we've got to change our
[02:55:58.420 --> 02:56:03.420]  problems on the surface Alex the ocean of solutions is within
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:08.420]  enliven that the unified field of quantum physics
[02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:13.420]  atma from vedic science meaning the self there's another saying know thyself
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:18.420]  dive within enliven that and watch things get better
[02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:23.420]  people should get conscious they should be exposed believe me
[02:56:23.420 --> 02:56:28.420]  I would say that not just getting to a higher level the general public's almost mesmerized by the culture and not even
[02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:33.420]  awake at a basic level but then why did you go public
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:38.420]  and question powerfully and I commend you for your courage 9-11 we were talking
[02:56:38.420 --> 02:56:43.420]  during the break and you were saying more people need to go public why did you go public then because
[02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:48.420]  you know all they ask me questions you know is when you
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:53.420]  see that does it make you wonder about things does it seem like what
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:58.420]  we were told actually happened it just makes me wonder I see
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:03.420]  things that don't add up well you mentioned some key points you mentioned some key points and
[02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:08.420]  we all have questions I'm glad you do and I'm glad you had the courage to speak out what about Bush massing
[02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:13.420]  44,000 US troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan having a launch order to attack Afghanistan
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:18.420]  on his death two days before that was in Newsweek I mean how obvious does it have to get
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:23.420]  here's the deal there's so many problems in our world
[02:57:23.420 --> 02:57:28.420]  so much negativity don't worry about the darkness
[02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:33.420]  turn on the light darkness automatically goes ramp up the light
[02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:38.420]  of unity within help do that for yourself help do that for the
[02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:43.420]  world it was peace creating groups and then we're really doing something
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:48.420]  well it does start at home bring that light of unity all diversity
[02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:53.420]  is appreciated in the light of unity it will be so
[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:58.420]  beautiful so easy remember that's where all the power is that created the universe
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:03.420]  and runs it maintains it without a problem well I agree with you that
[02:58:03.420 --> 02:58:08.420]  it's charity starts at home we have to start changing ourselves one person at a time and I guess that's
[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:13.420]  what the new book the big fish covers exactly right Alex and you're going to be at a book signing
