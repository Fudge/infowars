[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:40.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.240]  just before i left for austin i took my family to the smoky mountains now long before the europeans
[00:48.240 --> 00:52.320]  named it the smoky mountains the chair key had a name for it and i if i pronounce it correctly it's
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.360]  something like chaconne quay which means place of the fine particulate smog no not actually
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.160]  that's what the epa wants you to think i was surprised to see this graphic on the epa site
[01:04.160 --> 01:11.040]  where they explain what pm 2.5 is they use the smoky mountains as a poster child is it really
[01:11.040 --> 01:17.600]  pm 2.5 and man-made smog that makes the smoky mountains smoky no we all know that it isn't
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.800]  but we see this kind of thing done over and over again like they did with polar bears on ice flows
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.520]  remember that and of course algor is calling us that the oceans are rising but he builds his
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.520]  nine million dollar mansion in montecito california right on the ocean side so i don't think he believes
[01:33.520 --> 01:40.960]  that either but they use these subliminal messages to try to convince us and it could be quite effective
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.280]  and speaking of bears every visitor to the smoky mountains gets a handout that looks like this
[01:45.280 --> 01:51.040]  warning you about black bears as my wife was reading that to the small children i started
[01:51.040 --> 01:54.800]  thinking a lot of the stuff they were saying about bears could be said about government
[01:54.800 --> 02:01.040]  especially about the epa let me just read a few things here uh with aggressive behavior the bear
[02:01.040 --> 02:07.280]  the epa is demanding more space if the bear or epa continues to follow you stand your ground
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.640]  if the epa gets closer talk louder or shout at it act aggressively act together as a group if you
[02:12.640 --> 02:19.040]  have companions make yourself look as large as possible don't run don't turn away and don't
[02:19.040 --> 02:31.840]  feed the epa it only encourages further problems david night for info wars nightly news i'm darin
[02:31.840 --> 02:37.360]  mcbreen with info wars nightly news and i'm here today at the texas state capitol and we're about
[02:37.360 --> 02:42.240]  to find out if the people of austin are aware that they are about to be hit by a wave of utility
[02:42.240 --> 02:48.800]  bill hikes as new epa regulations drive up the cost of energy what do you think about paying higher
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.480]  utility bills because of the epa's new regulations against power plants you know there may be some
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.120]  new regulations coming up against power plants at this point but unfortunately right now i think
[02:59.120 --> 03:05.360]  that our citizens statewide and nationwide basically over burden especially with today's
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.040]  economic uh city developments and situations that are going on i think rate hike should be at a
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.760]  minimal to at least try to alleviate some of the burden on our our taxpayers and our citizens
[03:15.760 --> 03:19.680]  nationwide and statewide i know a lot of people that are going to be not only shot but a little
[03:19.680 --> 03:23.440]  bit irritated about that as well i mean they're already i mean because it's such a hot summer
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.840]  exactly you know everybody's bills is already out through the roof you're already paying through
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.880]  the roof because the ac's are running non-stop and then all of a sudden it's like you know on top of
[03:32.880 --> 03:38.160]  that and with a downturn economy yeah it's it's doesn't seem to drive that well of course i don't
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.920]  want to pay higher utility bills they're already extremely high right now as it is well i don't
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.200]  want to pay more because because of the carbon dioxide thing that doesn't seem right especially
[03:49.200 --> 03:56.560]  if it's not even proven generally i i prefer regulations that that deter pollution and paying
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.920]  a little bit more for that than an unregulated environment it all has to be regulated some way
[04:01.920 --> 04:08.560]  right it's gonna mess our environment up i understand the tax on carbon footprints but i mean who's
[04:08.560 --> 04:14.320]  who's you know getting a new lexus you know what i mean do you think that carbon dioxide is dangerous
[04:15.680 --> 04:23.840]  i think carbon dioxide can be very dangerous okay what what do plants breathe carbon dioxide
[04:24.960 --> 04:28.640]  yeah i think carbon carbon dioxide is definitely dangerous otherwise there wouldn't be any uh
[04:29.280 --> 04:38.240]  like rules and laws to prevent it being what do plants breathe okay folks those are some excerpts

[08:24.880 --> 08:32.480]  election coming up here and well now less than two weeks away uh a week and a half away just
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.640]  amazing times that we certainly live in again i'm alex jones your host we're here monday through
[08:38.640 --> 08:44.960]  friday 11 am to 2 p.m central 12 noon to 3 p.m eastern here are some of the headlines we're
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.600]  going to be covering today that are up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[08:51.280 --> 08:59.840]  gulliford north carolina voters say ballot cast for romney came up obama on machine
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.360]  we're getting reports of that of early voting across the country uh coming up for obama
[09:06.240 --> 09:13.440]  also will anonymous bomb threat throw election for obama we've learned that there are specific
[09:13.440 --> 09:19.520]  bomb threats by so-called anonymous probably provocateurs posing as hackers because it's
[09:19.520 --> 09:30.080]  anonymous uh saying that they plan to bomb government buildings with uh high-powered explosives uh
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.320]  before the election and that dovetails with another anonymous call which is a perfect cutout
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.240]  to demonize all hackers that's the problem with anonymous is they call it anonymous then the
[09:42.240 --> 09:48.240]  government can project whatever they want onto that name uh there is a call to march on washington
[09:48.240 --> 09:55.840]  the day before the election november 4th and 5th and to storm it and and basically have
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.960]  well well well they expect to be shot and and die uh so this is clearly a provocateur operation
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.640]  we've now learned tracking this last few days before we reported on it paul watson and i'm uh
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.240]  that this has been going on for a month and is gaining steam with a lot of uh talk show host
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.480]  in people calling for storming uh you know calling for the support of the march and the
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.120]  storming uh you have different internet personalities and people and either their
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.040]  usefulity it's or their operatives the reason it leans towards operatives
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.360]  whoever's anonymously doing this and others is this started a month ago this this call that's
[10:35.360 --> 10:42.480]  gained steam to storm the white house the day before the election obviously uh to try to make
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.400]  the white house look like a victim and to have an excuse to bring in some type of emergency
[10:47.600 --> 10:51.600]  doug hagman of the northeast intelligence network who does have some really good police
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.240]  and military sources has uh you know said months ago on this show that there's a plan to try to
[10:58.240 --> 11:05.520]  stir up riots before the election not even after uh we see massive preparation for civil unrest in
[11:05.520 --> 11:14.240]  this country the 1.2 1.4 that 1.6 billion bullets bought this year uh we see the military uh digging
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.640]  in we see the military admitting they're preparing for civil unrest i hope this doesn't happen you
[11:18.640 --> 11:23.440]  know the globalists can also hype all this fear and then use it as just an excuse to clamp down
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.320]  more and more in general it's kind of internal propaganda they give different police what they
[11:30.320 --> 11:36.800]  call an authoritarian systems security forces what they give the paramilitary security forces is a
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.680]  back channel propaganda to get them all hyped up on edge and believing that there are all these
[11:41.680 --> 11:49.120]  threats that don't exist so we're going to be going over all of that today will anonymous bomb
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.520]  threat and threat to storm the white house and of course the real anonymous folks have distanced
[11:55.520 --> 12:01.040]  themselves from this but it doesn't matter because anytime something's quote anonymous then you could
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.200]  have good people involved bad people but the government can go in or other groups provocateur
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.920]  things to demonize the entire movement shea of hackers it's a very legitimate and a great
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.520]  counterbalance to big corporations and government it's kind of like people say well are you for
[12:13.520 --> 12:23.280]  occupy wall street or um are you uh against um occupy wall street well you notice that
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.320]  ad busters and other groups connected uh you know to george soros and the globalist who have a lot
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.960]  of laudable goals on the surface they began to call months before let's occupy wall street on this
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.760]  date and then it was kind of nebulous we're against the corruption then people show up by the tens of
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.680]  thousands and you know every major city the media hypes it then the democrats come in and try to co-opt
[12:43.680 --> 12:49.200]  it they wanted to be grassroots but then co-opted it didn't work first yet obama endorsing it when
[12:49.200 --> 12:53.760]  it didn't work and they woke up and were against obama and the republicans and the system and
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.560]  started criticizing the corrupt elements of wall street not just capitalism in general
[12:58.560 --> 13:04.240]  but the crony people the monopoly list well then in 35 plus cities was at 35 or one night
[13:04.240 --> 13:10.000]  they had federally run raids coming into the city and ordering the city now is the time
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.080]  you know in denver and portland and dallas and new york everywhere now go in and billy club people
[13:16.080 --> 13:24.400]  now go in and beat them up now again this has all been a coordinated operation so they're
[13:24.400 --> 13:30.400]  projecting the term anonymous giving it massive attention when people call themselves anonymous
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.520]  so they can build it up and also use it as a cyber threat to have the pentagon and globalist
[13:35.520 --> 13:40.320]  publicly take over the web that they built to begin with so that's really the process
[13:40.320 --> 13:46.480]  uh that is happening right there very important article because even abc news said the white
[13:46.480 --> 13:53.040]  house could run some type of october surprise uh romney could as well but he isn't in office he
[13:53.040 --> 13:58.080]  doesn't have that whole apparatus at his fingertips though there are neocons that support romney who
[13:58.080 --> 14:03.280]  are embedded at different levels even though they all agree on the same policies uh when it comes to
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.400]  geopolitical activities that obama does they want the power so even though they're in the same team
[14:08.400 --> 14:14.240]  basically or in the same league they're from different teams it is a better way to uh say it
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.400]  but but they're in the same league will anonymous bomb threat throw election for obama we've got uh
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.720]  joe curl who writes for the washington times white house correspondent he was at the last debate
[14:25.920 --> 14:31.040]  uh that they had uh monday night we're going to get him on to break that down for about 20 minutes
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.720]  and bev harris uh on the reports well you guys i forgot i'm sorry we pulled me the stack of election
[14:36.720 --> 14:43.680]  fraud news out yesterday that forbes article about uh hardener civic uh being bought out by uh the
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.640]  trust uh the romney trust that a lot of the votes in the country are going to be cast on i think
[14:48.640 --> 14:54.480]  that's important as well we're seeing fraud by both sides uh or or or what could be construed as um
[14:55.680 --> 15:03.360]  chicanery or or impropriety uh i mean i think it's improper if you're in politics to own voting
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.080]  machine companies uh conflict of interest would be the proper term there uh we're going to be talking
[15:08.080 --> 15:13.840]  to her coming up uh as well at the start of the next hour uh but uh youtube threat a youtube threat
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.200]  to bomb government buildings along with a plan by other members of anonymous to storm the white
[15:19.200 --> 15:26.080]  house and congress in an attempt to arrest government officials not not not not government
[15:26.080 --> 15:33.520]  servants officials the day before the presidential election could prove uh and provide the crisis for
[15:33.520 --> 15:41.440]  barack obama to secure a second term and then he has the quotes in here my white house advisors
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.280]  uh you know saying if we don't have a new oklahoma city or 9 11 we're not going to be able
[15:47.280 --> 15:50.800]  remember robert Shapiro said that the financial times one and we're not going to be able to
[15:50.800 --> 15:59.920]  to get obama reelect and uh any type of big staged event a war a new conflict a terror attack
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.360]  a storming of the white house or an attempt anything like that would make obama and his
[16:05.360 --> 16:10.880]  cohorts look like victims and they are the prime suspects and they have a history of doing fast
[16:10.880 --> 16:21.120]  and furious and other events so again they are they are prime absolute uh prime suspects uh in
[16:21.680 --> 16:27.520]  all of this this is an excellent article uh that paul joseph watson put up this morning
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.400]  that i worked on with him and it's got all the points that he need to get this out to everybody
[16:32.400 --> 16:40.480]  folks will anonymous bomb threat and threat will anonymous bomb threat and uh storming of the white
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.760]  house uh plans she'd probably be the headline but i understand needs to be short and sweet uh so
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.640]  go read the article we'll get to more of that after joe curl uh is on with us ahead of uh bev
[16:50.640 --> 16:57.760]  harris uh this is some devastating news we were following this case show often i can read the
[16:57.760 --> 17:02.080]  profile of somebody in the news and guess they're a listener we're talking to her lawyer i'm guessing
[17:02.080 --> 17:07.760]  she's a listener poor lady she was trying to fly out of tennessee they wanted to to touch her daughter's
[17:07.760 --> 17:13.040]  genitals and she said no so they arrested her and we've seen some attempts at this as well
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.360]  saying if you film they'll arrest you even though it's legal and lawful they have to admit that on
[17:17.360 --> 17:23.440]  their own tsa website uh or to say it's disorderly conduct uh if you try to leave we've seen them
[17:23.440 --> 17:27.920]  threaten to find people or you can just leave but then they don't tell you when you leave they try
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.760]  to find you now that's been thrown out of court but they found a simpering jury of bootlickers
[17:33.760 --> 17:40.480]  mom found guilty by court at refusing tsa pat down of daughter you know the word pat down is wrong
[17:40.480 --> 17:46.960]  it is a it is a groping remember three years ago we first were really breaking this our articles
[17:46.960 --> 17:50.080]  you know almost every day on drudge for a few months became the biggest story in the country
[17:50.640 --> 17:54.400]  at thanks for drudge report dot com getting it out there and our reporters breaking it down
[17:54.400 --> 17:58.000]  they say we don't touch your genitals not even on the outside show them going in the pants
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.720]  we don't take you in private rooms we don't we don't trip search whole ladies they got caught
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.880]  lying the entire time this is the incredible corruption that we're talking about and the system
[18:08.880 --> 18:14.960]  has to get this done because this is the takeover army the tsa now certifies your local police that
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.000]  they can now grope you it's like the tsa brown shirts wave a magic wand and get ready for your

[26:37.440 --> 26:43.280]  works for the government a mother says you're not going to grab my 14 year old daughter and take her
[26:43.280 --> 26:48.400]  away and grope her body don't do that and they started doing it she said stop stop and pulled
[26:48.400 --> 26:54.560]  her camera out so they had the police arrest her and call it disorderly conduct to say don't do that
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.000]  and try to tape it when the tsa's own website says you can film them for legal reasons they have to
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.680]  say that because it's a quote public place they're filming you you have a right oh let us secretly
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.040]  do something to you remember this year they got caught lying saying we don't take the clothes off
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.480]  of all women and when they got caught they said well we don't call that strip search when we take
[27:14.480 --> 27:21.600]  their clothes off okay and now truck drivers all over the country are sending us photos and video

[28:03.600 --> 28:08.960]  because i've seen footage of fallujah checkpoints and they didn't treat the iraqis with this much
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.040]  disrespect because they knew it would cause them to revolt they would just come on we're going to

[33:29.600 --> 33:34.640]  white house correspondent joins us to give us his take on the debate of monday night
[33:35.200 --> 33:39.600]  the fact that it's now coming out that obama did know that it was quote a coordinated
[33:40.160 --> 33:44.160]  premeditated a terror attack and been gauzy yet no kidding that was professional
[33:45.120 --> 33:55.200]  that's big news today we've also got more threats to riot and kill romney if obama loses that's
[33:55.200 --> 34:00.480]  finally being covered by the dinosaur media we're going to cover all that with joseph curl who was
[34:00.480 --> 34:04.960]  actually at the last debate on monday on the one before that he's been very kind to join us on his
[34:04.960 --> 34:11.360]  busy schedule uh joe where should we start here how about the so-called donald trump
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.280]  announcement i hadn't gotten to that yet i mean i tell you talk about stringing people along
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.080]  make that announcement and tell us what you think of it well it is actually dueling dueling
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.880]  announcements and publicity hogs he had gloria all read this morning going to court in massachusetts
[34:30.880 --> 34:37.840]  the unsealed some record that apparently missed romney testified in the divorce case of a of a
[34:37.840 --> 34:43.520]  colleague and they ended up pushing that back until thursday we're really not even sure what's
[34:43.520 --> 34:47.920]  in there but romney romney's lawyer eventually came on and said he doesn't care if he comes out
[34:47.920 --> 34:52.560]  or not it's testimony that he gave he doesn't care so i'm sorry there's much there and then
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.840]  uh fowler trump had said he had some great revelation everyone was speculating again about
[34:57.840 --> 35:04.320]  you know uh the board speakers from obama bursted giving itself his balance already been in involved
[35:04.320 --> 35:11.760]  in turns out when he gave me gave me his announcement at noon it was a a plea for obama to release his
[35:11.760 --> 35:18.000]  college applications and his passport application and if he did so trump will donate five million
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.800]  dollars to the charity of obama's choice so really a day of a day of high excitement with all of this
[35:24.800 --> 35:30.560]  supposed stuff happening and then in the end of the day two war shots from two publicity hogs
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.960]  and and and trump just continues to do this and the same thing with gloria all read i mean quite
[35:36.960 --> 35:45.440]  frankly uh you know romney helped out one of his friends and in 20 years of marriage obama and his
[35:45.440 --> 35:51.760]  wife almost got divorced once i mean that's probably happened to most people uh right i mean this is
[35:51.760 --> 35:58.400]  really scraping the bottom of the barrel but i think that's because both camps don't want to go
[35:58.400 --> 36:04.400]  after real corruption that's out there they always love this you know kind of one-off tabloid stuff
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.640]  yeah and again for you know again for obama you know this sort of thing you know who knows the
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.560]  coordination in between all red and even you know donald trump this is again just distracting from
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.960]  from major issues you've got all this hope about happening all the day as you were mentioning in
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.880]  the lead in there you know it turns out they have they have actual emails back and forth from state
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.880]  department people as many as 400 different people 16 are involved in this conversation going on
[36:33.440 --> 36:37.760]  live while the vengasi attack was happening including an hour after the attack
[36:37.760 --> 36:44.720]  attack concluded as far as they knew you know a claim by by a terrorist group you know immediate
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.240]  claim of responsibility which which means that the white house has known since day one since hours
[36:50.240 --> 36:58.320]  after this which makes a pre-meditated line yeah it it it it it starts to it starts to look like a
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.080]  massive massive come up i mean as much as the media wants to make it sound like obama mentioned
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.320]  terrorist attacks and terrorist groups and and that sort of thing in vengasi you really didn't
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.880]  he said as we talked about last time i was on acts of terror nothing about specifically and then
[37:12.880 --> 37:20.080]  we we spent the next 10 days up to two weeks with them blaming it on a spontaneous demonstration
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.200]  that grew out of this video that was on youtube over the summer that nobody saw so it's really
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.000]  starting to look like a massive cover up i'm shocked that i looked this morning washington post
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.480]  new york times not even on the website the story is not even there so you know millions of people
[37:36.480 --> 37:39.440]  are can even hear about this story we are listening to see tonight
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.680]  bill covers it on the on the on the major network it was broken by by cbs last night so they're
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.920]  already on top of it but today you're getting uh you know our cold shoulder from an awful lot of
[37:49.920 --> 37:56.160]  the mainstream media on this story your take uh on the last debate i guess you've been at all of them
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.840]  um again joe curl washington times joining us i have to say i mean i think they interrupted
[38:01.840 --> 38:08.720]  him it looked to me like uh obama was given more time but romney seemed a lot less combative
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.960]  and really let obama get away with a lot of stuff and not that i'm even you know here defending
[38:12.960 --> 38:18.720]  romney uh it's just that uh romney did so good in the first couple of debates it seemed to
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.240]  fizzle at the end and kind of the right wing media spun it that well you know romney was more
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.200]  presidential well they tried that the first time with obama i'll say obama looks physically ill
[38:29.200 --> 38:33.360]  he doesn't look like he looked uh four years ago and again it's kind of like rearranging
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.920]  deck chairs on the titanic but what's your overall view uh on the debate we saw yeah i think that was
[38:39.920 --> 38:46.080]  i think that was a calculated uh method by by the romney people come out of the shoe very strong
[38:46.960 --> 38:50.880]  i think they did a pretty good job in the second one because they knew obama was going to come out
[38:50.880 --> 38:54.560]  and they had to be combative and that was that was probably the most combative of the of the of the
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.400]  three but i think by the time we got to the third one they were really thinking you know don't don't
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.840]  mess this up we were we're on a good thing here the last thing you need is to get to work up about
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.840]  things to get to argumentative to to make any any major mistakes so i think they were just at that
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.680]  point being very cautious let's just you know get through 90 minutes have a discussion so the real
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.280]  point that i'll think a lot of people looked at at that debate was that was really supposed to be
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.560]  the the highlight for obama obama has been doing foreign policy for the last four years of course
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.680]  romney hasn't and no one really does he's not the president of the secretary of state so it was
[39:33.680 --> 39:40.000]  really a test on him to see if he looked as if he could handle that job and and i think you know
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.680]  whether people said he won or lost or whatever the federal numbers were he he really did look
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.600]  as if he could handle the job of commanding chief and i think an awful lot of people said yeah okay
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.640]  he can do this job and you know sure exactly because we're political junkies so we're watching
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.480]  and it's totally boring but romney understands with most people it's just how does he act does
[40:00.480 --> 40:06.080]  he smile does he look good i mean it does come down to who looks more presidential it's it's
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.440]  so ridiculous that that's what you've got to do to win that's right well and that's you know
[40:11.440 --> 40:17.280]  and the numbers were way way down and remember you had you had game seven of of the major league
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.840]  baseball you had money night football and it was a 90 minute debate on foreign policy which
[40:21.840 --> 40:27.760]  which a lot of people's eyes just blaze around that topic anyway i'm guessing that a lot of people
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.000]  watch 30 minutes of it if they watched at all and then and then puts it off and puts it something
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.400]  out because it was awful private debate it was it was it was you know it was already not going to
[40:38.400 --> 40:42.400]  be electric and exciting because they were sitting in a chair next to you know in chairs next to each
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.120]  other at the same table really didn't have the dynamics that the second debate had and
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.640]  you know about halfway through they had they had all used their talking points at least once and
[40:52.640 --> 40:58.640]  then was kind of a rehash for them for the whole you know last 45 minutes so it was it was now
[40:58.640 --> 41:04.080]  fasting but again for romney you know all they really needed to do was was get through the thing
[41:04.080 --> 41:10.160]  and obama you know really really needed to get it out of the ballpark don't think he did he did fine
[41:10.160 --> 41:15.360]  that's why it was just kind of a wash and at the end of it i think a lot of people just went okay
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.400]  we're finally done with that let's get into the next two weeks of this thing joe curl washington
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.840]  times joins us i'm asking a lot of the questions here and i've got some more i want to ask you
[41:25.840 --> 41:32.240]  specifically on the poll numbers we're seeing but before we go there and who you think is
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.480]  starting to pull ahead i mean not clearly i mean romney is surging are there any other
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.680]  points you want to make before we run out of time here well i think i think right now you
[41:41.680 --> 41:46.880]  you know you're starting to really see a shift in in some of these battleground states you know
[41:46.880 --> 41:53.280]  well brass lessons got ohio tied he's got um he's got new hampshire romney up for new hampshire
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.960]  that's a big deal because we've been the one thing that that the mainstream media just says over and
[41:58.960 --> 42:04.400]  over again is no republicans ever want a white house without winning ohio and that is true although
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.000]  actually a hundred and fifty years ago i i think i think one did but it's certainly true nowadays
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.840]  but there are a the newest number of pathways that are opening right now for romney with including
[42:16.480 --> 42:20.640]  missing it's not really in play but it's getting close six points without the play
[42:20.640 --> 42:26.640]  hey you're getting tighter and then you've got places like colorado nevada those things if those
[42:26.640 --> 42:33.920]  places move colorado nevada and uh in hampshire assuming that romney wins virginia and north
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.600]  carolina which is really looking like what's going to happen in obviously florida that's a
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.320]  pathway for for romney to get there without winning ohio sure and as you know the university of
[42:42.320 --> 42:48.240]  colorado who hadn't been wrong in several decades they they've got a sort of 76 percent chance
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.320]  that romney's going to win the popular vote but that doesn't win elections it's electoral college
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.520]  but looking at that just bottom line uh for my own novice research i know you focus specifically
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.440]  more on this i mean it looks like romney pretty much is now even ahead in the electoral college
[43:04.480 --> 43:09.280]  it does and and if you know it really we will we will know dealers out there will know
[43:09.920 --> 43:16.720]  on election night what's about to take place if he wins ohio uh romney it's probably done he's
[43:16.720 --> 43:23.520]  probably he probably will win if he wins new hampshire ohio uh north united virginia that will be
[43:24.640 --> 43:28.480]  that'll be in the eastern time zone so that'll be probably before 10 o'clock we'll have a very
[43:28.480 --> 43:34.080]  good idea of where the rest of the country's gonna go and that happened in 1980 when robert
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.400]  when reagan was pretty much in the same kind of position trailing carter by an awful lot
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.280]  a couple of good debates people started to steam his presidential remember what happened then it
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.000]  was a landslide across the country it just sort of steamrolled and there are a lot of people that
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.200]  are throwing out there right now that this may well be that kind of cake they really yeah my
[43:53.200 --> 43:59.680]  gut tells me uh that that that obama is out just because the same reason obama was brought in
[43:59.680 --> 44:04.640]  people are like hey we want the economy to do better we're just going to put anybody in there
[44:04.640 --> 44:09.680]  i mean we could have a ham sandwich running against obama right now and uh and the ham sandwich
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.480]  might win and now that people see that romney is more animated i agree with you everything shifted
[44:14.480 --> 44:21.840]  toward him so he will win minus some type of false flags some type of october surprise um
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.960]  this is just out we've confirmed over a month anonymous has been allowed with people with
[44:26.960 --> 44:30.560]  official websites and stuff so the cops could have gone there to say they're going to storm the
[44:30.560 --> 44:36.720]  white house uh on uh november 5th the day before the election we there's now videos that the police
[44:36.720 --> 44:42.000]  are doing nothing about uh saying that they're going to bomb federal buildings obviously not
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.200]  anonymous the general hackers but people probably probably provocateurs this looks like justice
[44:47.200 --> 44:54.400]  department uh false flag uh fast and furious type stuff or they're letting idiots talk
[44:54.400 --> 44:59.840]  and hoping something's happening i think that's the strategy too with all the riot talk uh you know
[44:59.840 --> 45:05.520]  just still exploding after the last debate monday calling for death and murder and mayhem
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.560]  and a very light secret service response they say they're visiting some people what's your
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.160]  concern on that i mean wildcards here joe curl uh from the washington times i mean what type of
[45:16.160 --> 45:20.720]  tricks because we know all these white house advisors robert superior told the financial
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.600]  times of london and i have it quoted in paul watson's article that that minus the new oklahoma
[45:25.600 --> 45:32.240]  city or 9 11 obama's not going to get reelected that's that's that's what's being that's been
[45:32.240 --> 45:38.480]  rumored out there when we had heard some rumors that uh obama and um was going to announce some
[45:38.480 --> 45:45.360]  sort of a chord with iran that they scorn away on their problems excuse me and that they've got
[45:45.360 --> 45:49.280]  uh they've got an agreement on on nuclear weapons that's something that's been floating around out
[45:49.280 --> 45:54.960]  there but the but the violence there's some violence and riots and and your threats against
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.000]  directly against romney they've been fascinating at how the secret service is always very quick
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.320]  to to check out any sort of thing that that has to do with barack obama and it's striking that that
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.880]  they haven't released all of the investigations they've been doing their twitter's like you guys
[46:10.880 --> 46:17.680]  have posted on on infowars twitter's just you know running away with these with these things there's
[46:17.680 --> 46:21.040]  hundreds of these different threats it seems like the secret service should be on top of that and we
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.680]  should be hearing about all of these investigations they're doing that i think that's a worry across
[46:25.680 --> 46:31.280]  the country it's just what will the response be obviously you know the urban centers are are
[46:31.280 --> 46:38.080]  much more prone to vote for democrat and barack obama so there's worry that if there's the appearance
[46:38.080 --> 46:46.560]  of uh any sort of improprieties and especially if the media sees those those speculation or rumors
[46:46.560 --> 46:51.600]  of improprieties during the election that could actually make things very bad they'd have to be
[46:51.600 --> 46:56.880]  calling for comment putting out an awful lot of information on how this has been above board but
[46:56.880 --> 47:03.360]  it's we're starting to see already in the early voting some anomalies on on voting you know machine
[47:03.360 --> 47:08.240]  in in uh in ohio somebody was trying to vote they they they pull you know they push the button for
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.200]  romney and then when they're about to vote it it switched it over to obama so we're starting
[47:13.200 --> 47:18.480]  to see reports of that and we're not is pouring into my office joe and you know i'll just report
[47:18.480 --> 47:24.080]  you know whatever the case is nonpartisan here i happen to be a constitutionalist libertarian so
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.040]  i agree with more republican you know ideas than democrats obviously but i'll i'll report just as i
[47:29.040 --> 47:39.120]  see it and all i'm getting is feedback uh that people are unable uh to vote for mit romney uh
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.600]  except for one i mean it's got to be 10 to 1 uh that that and these are people that are smart
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.040]  and know who they're voting for and it's just not even letting them vote straight republican tickets
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.040]  right and we saw a report this morning that in palm beach people are filling out um
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.680]  uh absentee ballots sending those in and then when they get there they're they're
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.520]  they're put in the hands of all the election workers and they actually have to take them over
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.880]  to machine and and put the actual vote in the machine so they know there's the real questions
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.400]  about whether that could be right with with all kinds of problems then and may have so
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.640]  we're just starting to hear these things i mean i i assume those times you're gonna have
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.560]  lawyers all over the place but that's kind of for election right you're gonna have something
[48:26.560 --> 48:32.640]  you know people have started to say upwards of 45 percent of americans vote early so you
[48:32.640 --> 48:37.520]  can have half of the voting population half of the people that will vote actually voting before
[48:37.520 --> 48:42.160]  election and that gives the system a lot and plus we've seen obama saying vote early we've seen
[48:42.160 --> 48:47.360]  michelle obama saying hey you may have an overflowing toilet vote now because we know statistically
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.920]  it's much easier to manipulate absentee ballots uh or or or early voting what about the troops last
[48:53.920 --> 48:57.840]  time i checked 90 plus percent of the troops didn't get their ballots and aren't going to be able to
[48:57.840 --> 49:02.480]  vote yeah they've they've been saying and this was interesting they've been saying that you will get
[49:02.480 --> 49:06.880]  them you know within 10 days of the election and that they're they're they're guaranteed to have
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.560]  arrived by by 10 days before the election so we're still a few days away from from now that would be
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.520]  plenty of time to get the thing and send it back but really funny thing is if you if you get to 10
[49:17.520 --> 49:22.400]  days and nine days and eight days then it's really too late for you to get so we'll have to see it 10
[49:22.400 --> 49:27.760]  days out if if everyone has these things in hand if they you know they may have all gone out in the
[49:27.760 --> 49:33.120]  last couple of days they may be on their way there they may arrive in mass to you know millions of
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.760]  people which is what they're seeing you know all these different election registrars are saying
[49:37.760 --> 49:41.680]  that's what's happening man but we'll have to we'll have to wait and see my daughter's down in
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.000]  the Virginia tax she's waiting for her absentee ballots still doesn't have it so
[49:46.800 --> 49:49.600]  well yeah i'm interested when she'll get in and when everyone else we get these things
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.360]  Joe Kerl people can go up to washingtontimes.com and see your articles and others there's one
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.440]  at washingtontimes.com emails show us officials told of militants within hours of a Benghazi attack
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.800]  uh that's uh Sean Waterman with that report uh obama says latino voters key to victory
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.280]  vows immigration reform and we know the illegals are all out there trying to vote it's just it's
[50:11.280 --> 50:17.440]  just amazing and this is all going on but but in your gut uh i mean are you concerned about some
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.400]  type of some type of trick being played i mean i just don't see an administration that would pull
[50:22.400 --> 50:30.080]  off fast and furious i just don't see them giving up power uh easily no and that's been and that's
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.240]  been sort of the frightening side of of of the of administration is you know a really sort of
[50:37.360 --> 50:42.880]  ballish and and rampant um justice department that will do things like you know threatening
[50:42.880 --> 50:49.280]  gallup organization honest honest polling techniques and and and alleging you know
[50:50.160 --> 50:55.040]  improprieties and interactions putting pressure on you know polling agencies hold on gotta
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.560]  go to break one more segment with joe curl okay erin fullen here as the food police shut down
[51:00.560 --> 51:05.840]  food co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade

[54:32.080 --> 54:38.640]  and then it's going to be phone calls and news i may be having a confirmed military whistleblower on
[54:38.640 --> 54:44.000]  about preparations for civil unrest it's confirmed he's in the military it's confirmed he is who he
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.600]  says he is and if it's accurate and we're still vetting it it is super creepy so that may be on
[54:51.600 --> 54:57.840]  the last 30 minutes today i don't know uh joe curl the washington times is our guest for radio
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.200]  listeners go to washingtontimes.com it's happening now it's the top story on the left hand side
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.840]  or if you're a prison planet dot tv viewer i'm streaming video of it right now obama says latino
[55:07.840 --> 55:12.800]  vote is key to victory vows immigration reform in 2013 and i was talking to joder in the break
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.800]  he said that's what he'd like to close with uh is that story that's actually pretty big because
[55:16.800 --> 55:24.480]  obama didn't want this uh balkanizing statement out yet uh joe give us your take on that well i mean
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.200]  and he spoke it was a fascinating sort of development all this morning he he was calling
[55:29.200 --> 55:34.000]  the the boy registered to to get their endorsements a very big endorsement in in ireland you get the
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.040]  registered endorsement it sways a lot of people so he called the um the newspaper did 30 minutes
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.840]  with the editorial board there but the white house demanded that it all be off the record so
[55:45.840 --> 55:52.800]  this morning the the warrants to wrote a sort of a snippy little editorial saying he really should
[55:52.800 --> 55:57.680]  release this we we talked with him why can't we just release what he said and the white house felt
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.520]  an awful lot of pressure enough pressure to finally go ahead and release it and what's interesting
[56:01.520 --> 56:07.600]  about it is he says at one point you know we'll fix this is off the record i can say there because
[56:07.600 --> 56:14.000]  he wants to speak bluntly and actually say what he's thinking which is i did a a really important
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.960]  thing for my reelection which was the the dream act you know basically naturalizing millions of
[56:20.960 --> 56:26.240]  young illegal aliens and the republicans have a problem with that issue i'm in good position if
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.960]  i get reelected it will be because of what you know both and when i get reelected i will push
[56:30.960 --> 56:38.960]  through immigration before so he's basically making a very you know blunt vow to do this and he's
[56:38.960 --> 56:45.040]  making a blunt admission that this is this is how he intended to get reelected despite that and then
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.240]  if he gets that it would be game over because a lot of these people coming here getting on welfare
[56:50.240 --> 56:54.080]  and as long as they get their welfare they'll vote to take my guns and that's why
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.560]  i'm against this unlimited immigration we already have the most open immigration in the world and
[56:58.560 --> 57:04.400]  i don't want to become uh latin america or i'd move down there because those are not free countries
[57:04.400 --> 57:10.080]  and you've got and you've got big things like like Los Angeles now is is is moving ahead with
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.240]  with driver's licenses for illegal aliens and and that's a huge problem because that's a
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.720]  that's an official identification document once you have one of those you can do an awful
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.120]  lot of things with that i i think that's you know has has always been i mean i managed to try and
[57:25.120 --> 57:30.960]  get a a driver's license in switzerland if you're not a citizen listen if i go to mexico i got to
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.760]  jump through special hoops to even buy land they're not going to give me a driver's license i mean
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.280]  i can't go down there and get free health care or get or go down with my wife and say
[57:39.280 --> 57:44.640]  hey i'm here to have a baby pay for it right and then this and this whole you know the whole idea
[57:44.640 --> 57:51.440]  now that hacker babies the only party that that will look after the interest of of america of
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.960]  americans from other countries and that's really where that's sort of flipped over i mean you you
[57:56.960 --> 58:02.240]  would have managed that legal immigrants to this country would not be all that happy with
[58:02.240 --> 58:06.480]  illegal immigrants they had to go to a process to get here these illegal immigrants didn't but
[58:07.040 --> 58:14.560]  the the underlying message is that the public in will will mean to the spanish and democrats
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.840]  lovers and that's not even true the republicans are trying to legalize and it even a hispanic
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.640]  issue even though that's the main group it's an issue of giant third world populations criminals
[58:24.640 --> 58:29.280]  all of it coming here joe curl thank you so much for the time with us we'll watch your reports at

[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.920]  routinely i'm going to cover this after she leaves us and then open the phones up
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:58.800]  this is really a hoax because the uh cnbc and the media are announcing we're removing the naked
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.840]  body x-ray machines no they just have even more expensive backscatter that they've had scientists
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.480]  all over the news say breaks up your dna in some cases may be worse than the classical x-rays
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.000]  but if you go to drudge report dot com we also have it up at info wars dot com
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.440]  you can see uh the miscreant uh big sis janet depolitano uh big sis pulls naked body scanners
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.640]  and i guess technically you could say that's true because it's you know these type but they're
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:39.840]  being sent to the smaller airports uh to now basically uh roast uh the people that are working
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:49.520]  there and i happen to know from good transportation uh people who who are in management and also
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.240]  some former tsa people that quit over it in fact guys i don't even have to say it from sources will
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.800]  you guys print me the uh cancer cluster at boston logan it's it's it's like boston globe articles
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.760]  from a year ago and then there's a bunch of them so i have that data pack when i get to this it's
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.400]  not just my memory um the point is they're upset and they've had meetings and they go hey we think
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.640]  being around these x-ray machines all day are bad for us really you think it might be a little
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.440]  bad for you there i've shown the local fox news piece out of upstate new york i've also seen one
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.480]  out of uh oregon where they just have on the highways big mobile trucks with huge x-ray
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.360]  wines that are so powerful i've had radiologists on there at least 10 times more powerful than a
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.280]  powerful chest x-ray they have you drive under it at least with the border patrol it's in shielding
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.560]  they put trucks on it get back it's in a room and then and then there's a conveyor belt
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:53.040]  that moves the truck or car through it to be x-rayed that's how they've had them for 30 something
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:59.360]  years now they just have national guard or tsa idiots and i'm not against the poor national guard
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.840]  or even the poor tsa people but they are idiots i mean if i was 14 years old and people told me
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.520]  run an outdoor giant x-ray machine i'd go well why does the dentist get behind the wall when he gives
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:21.040]  me an x-ray and put put put a lead shield over my my my my wavos my kikis i mean i mean it's it's
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.800]  it's real simple here i i mean i probably when i was 10 years old would know not not to do this
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.880]  in fact i've got to do a newscast uh maybe for the night or tomorrow night's news i'm doing the
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.280]  whole news tomorrow i may do it tomorrow night where we need to go and pull it's like fox news
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.640]  like four years ago out of upstate new york where it shows even the type of unit we were able to look
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.600]  it up with these big wands off the backs of trucks and they're standing around in broad daylight
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.200]  national guard not at the borders in the middle of the country going all right drive under it
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:02.240]  and it's like this system lets us see guns or drugs and or and it shows shots of you know mock
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.760]  guns in cars you can see the guns in the in the uh in the trunk news flash folks x-rays that can
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:16.000]  shoot through metal are real bad for you i don't know if i need to i mean i laugh about this this
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.840]  is just crazy so it is not the public angry at these naked body scanners that did this
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.840]  they started having cancer clusters they put them in 10 years ago at boston logan and four other
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:37.120]  airports all five airports have cancer clusters seven times or higher i mean it's a death warrant
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.000]  you work there a couple years around these x-ray machines you're going to die they're getting cataracts
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.200]  they're going blind they're getting their gums are bleeding oh i got tsa listing right now going
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:58.160]  is that why i got cataracts get out of there get away from them that's why they're pulling them

[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.360]  examining these files harris wrote an article in 2003 detailing how to bypass passwords manipulate
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.920]  election results on the diable jim's central tally system it's designed for fraud harris filed a
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.000]  whistleblower lawsuit against diable election systems and has made uh had made false claims
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.880]  when selling their system to alameda california diable paid the state of california 2.6 million
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.360]  to settle the case that's just an example of hundreds of things she's done literally hundreds
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:38.640]  digging in trash cans proving they didn't count votes catching them driving off there are so many
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.760]  different ways to engage in fraud but it's that comptroller centralized way we've got to look for
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.680]  it uh here it is folks our election system is a joke compared to many countries i don't trust
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.560]  the un to be here overseeing it they're just as bad or worse but here's forbs not bev harris
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.760]  romney family investment ties to voting machine company that could decide the election causing
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.520]  concern really you think so and you've got this going on now like senator hagel you know got voted
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:13.680]  in on machines he owned almost all the machines in the state of uh nebraska and and and this just
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.800]  goes on and on and on democrats are famous for their retail fraud voting repeatedly
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.160]  and some election fraud at centralized systems mainly locally am i wrong bev to say though
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:32.400]  republicans seem to have it down in big national thieving uh uh or is that an oversimplification
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:39.760]  well i it is complex uh and i think what we can certainly say is the good old boys
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:47.200]  from both parties uh want the system to be open for business and you know that because it doesn't
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.800]  matter how many times it's proven they don't solve anything the same exact systems that we demonstrated
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.680]  were easily hackable and hacking democracy film that you mentioned are still in use with no changes
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.640]  they know they know it's open for business you have to figure that that would maybe a
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.560]  feature that they want and i i don't know if i would even go so far as to say which party
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.920]  but i will say you know in your lead in when you talk about the romney family having ownership ties
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.960]  to heart inner civic which is now the second biggest voting machine company in the united
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:33.680]  states that is unprecedented at a national level i forget the numbers but wasn't it the
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:41.360]  election that got uh senator hagel in didn't his company that he actually founded and controlled
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.520]  didn't it count something like 92 percent of the votes or something right right uh and at the time
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:54.160]  you know i just got uh they were like how dare you report how could how could that possibly be
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:02.080]  that that's impropriety well now we have a presidential candidate whose family is into ownership
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.640]  of the machines that count his votes and make no mistake about it whether they have a paper ballot
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:12.720]  or not they are concealing the count from the public and essentially whoever controls those
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:18.160]  machines controls the outcome well it's amazing and i guess romney's argument would be i'm being
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.080]  sarcastic here is hey the illegals get to vote twice for obama so i just get the i mean it's
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.680]  amazing to see these different crime syndicates fighting over the levers well that's i'm glad
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.840]  you brought that up because when people try to say oh it's the republicans are doing it oh it's
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.880]  the democrats doing it no it's the crooks are doing it exactly and they come in uh all colors
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:47.040]  and strike incredible uh well i mean i know you've got a lot on your radar screen we'll obviously
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.520]  try to get you on right after the election uh what what's some of the main chicanery you're
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.440]  tracking right now over black box voting dot org well you know i one of the things that concerns
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:04.800]  me very much is as as you know let me just backtrack a second you watched a lecture returns on election
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:11.360]  night and you see this charade where they say oh the polls have just closed in texas and the result
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.280]  is you know they announce it within 60 seconds even with electronic voting let me tell you
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:25.120]  the result not one vote is counted in 60 seconds the results even from electronic voting don't come
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.120]  out for 20 minutes or so at the at the soonest so what they're doing is they're saying our exit
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.480]  polls have told us that we're projecting that this winner and they just aren't supposed to announce
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.560]  what their exit polls say well they have now and by the way all the news media which pretends that
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:49.280]  they're competing for the data you know it's such a joke they actually all use one firm called national
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.960]  election pool nep and so they're all using exactly the same number it's when they project
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:01.440]  well now nep which bear in mind is being paid by every major network plus the associated press
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.760]  is claiming it doesn't have enough money to do exit polls in 19 states
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:17.680]  now really wow so i'm i'm thinking we should all have our stopwatches out and watch how the
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.360]  networks handle this you know the polls have just closed in oklahoma there are no exit polls
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:30.480]  uh you know what you're not going to have any votes counted for about 20 minutes and you're not
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.080]  going to have all of those counted until about 10 or 11 p.m. sure but expanding on that are they
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.040]  coming up with this who's winning well sure let's go back to iowa what we saw in the republican
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.000]  primaries and ron paul you know god bless him i guess he doesn't look like a store loser so he
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.160]  would never say anything but even the new york times had to admit that he'd really won main and
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.280]  really won iowa i mean and then we go and then carl rove goes on and goes there were some guys
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.120]  got lost in some trucks and nobody knows where they are and and and then even that guys try to
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.520]  cue that up darin mcbreen has it you know it's where the horses are racing and all that and and
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.400]  yet yeah john benn you made that little piece because uh we had cut in as a joke with carl
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.520]  rove statement you know some kentucky derby horses and magically carl rove has a move forward but
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.800]  even even carl rove was laughing about this because they were all tallied at the precinct
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.960]  and then phoned in and posted there were no trucks in ballots and then it turned out
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.720]  republicans bragged days before on radio that they were going to cheat ron paul i mean could
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.480]  that be their downfall they're out and out airing ins well that's always the downfall of an elite
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:42.640]  that uh is taking over power is they always underestimate the common sense and the brilliance
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:49.920]  of the everyday man well what was your take on the stuff we saw in the primaries i mean oh my gosh
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.960]  well yeah i'll tell you exactly what my take was uh and i am nonpartisan i want to be able to stay
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:01.280]  obama this and romney this but the bottom line is the romney people his employees took over the
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:09.840]  iowa caucuses and ran them thing with nevada and then we saw chicanery and what my take was is this
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:19.200]  in november is going to be brutal because he's not even arm's length he just i'm sorry he just
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:27.520]  obviously tampered iowa nevada main and uh some very squirrely results came out of south carolina
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.360]  that that came off of the voting machines actually where the algorithms just looked like they just
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:41.120]  didn't make sense but you know if that's the case and then we find out that ahead of time in july
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.760]  2011 his family got involved in ownership at the voting machine company let me tell you there's
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.120]  something different about the way that heart which is the the company associated with romney heart
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.640]  voting machines are programmed in most locations in the united states they don't program them locally
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:04.560]  in the county they don't have their local it guy do it they send them directly to the heart company
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.560]  and the heart company sends them back the memory card that says here put this near voting machine
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:17.440]  so if i'm a presidential candidate and i own that company all i need is a couple of guys maybe
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:24.400]  just one because who is a technician in the plant and he basically is given the memory cards for
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.320]  the strategic counties well that's right and then we can also debate all day whether or not there
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.720]  are connections with george soros and foreign voting companies but we do know a lot of the
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.320]  companies now that operate here are far and owned so oh yeah so i mean why not have the
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:45.520]  communist chinese government run our voting machines i mean this is insane what we put up with well
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:51.280]  it's not democracy it's not a democratic republic it's just the government choosing itself that's
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.520]  what it is and once the public starts to understand that hey if we can't see the counting itself the
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.240]  original count not some after the fact you know theater if we can't see and authenticate that
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.920]  we don't have a system where we have sovereignty we don't have a system where the public is in
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:20.240]  control it's not self-government you're right it's not self-government are you thinking we're going
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:28.240]  to see a pretty big circus this year yeah yeah there's a lot of things colorado you know talking
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.920]  about these hard voting machines with ohio we're in Cincinnati and that's going to be a problem
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:40.000]  i agree but colorado is very dominated by these hard inter civic voting machines and there are so
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.880]  many strange things that have come out of colorado let me just mention the secretary of state has
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:52.000]  said let's not put seals on the voting machines this year it cost too much bear in mind the seals
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:00.160]  cost a penny okay why are they not sealing things stay there erin fullen here as the food police
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:05.600]  shut down food co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.240]  homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.880]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.880]  but frankly i'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.400]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.440]  and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today japanese eat miso
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.720]  africans eat fermented porges koreans eat kimchi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.040]  living but here's some good news south farlane americans can now discover the secrets to making

[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.480]  hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.960]  in the most shocking news story of 2012 obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:23.280]  already high power bill as much as 400 in coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.640]  just a matter of time before the lights start going out across america but here's some good news
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.800]  there's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:40.880]  end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the video at exposed123.com has already
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.680]  been banned by google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:52.240]  and keep america in the dark so watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late again
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560]  that's exposed123.com
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.680]  they came and took it all away
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.200]  yeah it was an inside job
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.920]  just like it always is well we've got a short segment here with bev harris and a big news
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.560]  blitz and your calls coming up i'll give the number out in the next segment but bev has agreed
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.280]  to come on in the days after the election which you can really track what's happening and what's
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:32.080]  unfolding but blackboxvoting.org is also supported by people who donate because she's
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.120]  got to do filings she's got to pay for things i want to get into what you're expecting in this
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.080]  election and and we were trying to say about colorada as we went to that hard break but
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:49.280]  how do people support the work you're doing they go to blackboxvoting.org and we have a physical
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:55.280]  address there and also an online donation page it's really important because coming into this
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:01.680]  election it usually costs us about $50,000 to just get the record and by the way i started to
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.200]  mention colorado they passed the last minute law that said no one can get any records until 45 days
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.880]  after the election it's suspicious as heck let me tell you but we intend to get them anyway
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:22.400]  what we need the records for is for litigation and to prove the case because we have to get the
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:28.640]  public to the point we've done a lot of proving over the last 10 years but it seems each election
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.280]  cycle we get a whole new wave of people who start to understand and get it and make and take action
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.400]  themselves. And let's remember 10 years ago when you come on my show people are like Hagel owns the
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.320]  company that 90 plus percent vote for him on in Nebraska you mean these companies can remote access
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.080]  these you mean engineers are going public in legislatures and testifying they were hired to
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.720]  engage in fraud and there's been i mean i mean you know it's come out in Ohio that was fraud i mean
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.080]  this is really going on so we've gone from most americans not knowing it's even happening to well
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.920]  i guess it's just fraud well we are getting to a tipping point we're getting closer i can feel it
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.240]  because i was there and you were there back in the day and and back then we were getting called
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.880]  all kind of label oh we were conspiracy theorists and this net well you know it's been proven by
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.320]  umpteen universities there's been you know several different cases that have uh proved
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.240]  been one in lawsuits now and it's just a matter of getting this big mammoth behemoth country that
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.320]  we have to the tipping point so that enough people really do understand it and secondly
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.320]  that they do not accept it because if we start accepting this stuff it's all over
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:44.160]  i absolutely agree with you uh i mean it's one thing to battle for people to finally
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.240]  wake up realize this is happening but then do we just accept it and go well i'm still going to go
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.520]  be part of you know the event even though it's it's not real i want to feel like i have power
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:58.400]  we need to get in and go back to paper ballots briefly uh what else are you going to be looking
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.400]  for in this election a and then b what are some of the basic things that need to be done to get
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.960]  our election system back well we have a video on the very front page the very top that gives a
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.320]  simple thing that people can do in most of the country that will help block one attack
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.120]  factor uh you mentioned earlier that some of these companies are foreign owned one of the huge
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.840]  foreign owned companies is soe software which is reporting the results not counting but reporting
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:35.040]  the results for 1400 locations in 26 states it's massive so what that means is what comes out of
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.280]  even the voting machine has an opportunity to be changed before it's reported to the public so
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.120]  that video shows you how you can block that or catch that by simply capturing a photograph
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.720]  of a specific document as the polls closed to show because you don't have to catch it everywhere
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.840]  you just have to catch it in one or two places and it's everybody out of the pool this place is
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:06.240]  changing results and i've seen different breakdowns by universities the united states has one of the
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:12.000]  least transparent rated as one of the worst systems in the world but americans don't realize we're
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.520]  now not the laughing stock people in foreign countries they know we're a joke oh yeah you
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.280]  know the carter the carter center monitors elections in foreign countries and they announced in 2008
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:29.040]  that we don't even qualify for their monitors because we have an election system that is worse
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:37.600]  than bossy over to be made worse than you get that it is a joke and uh europe understands this i mean
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.640]  there's three countries in europe now that have banned electronic voting and they're looking at it
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.720]  in the united states just saying what are you guys doing well there's a reason we live under so
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.680]  much tyranny because they know we can't get rid of them by and large i mean that that's quite a
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:59.520]  realization that we've been taken over well and we've been taken over i should also mention this
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:05.040]  isn't just the united state this is a global effort there's no question about it the same exact
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:11.360]  companies yes and s and you know a dominion is the name of the one of the ones they're also
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.640]  taking over the voting in other countries there's a big citizens movement in india now there's one
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.800]  in the philippines you know what bev i know i only had you scheduled for two segments can you do five
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.320]  more to break down the constellation of companies and what they're doing globally what time are we at
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.320]  right now it's uh 12 30 central okay yeah let's come back and finish up with that because i want to

[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:38.080]  okay beth Harris finishing up with us i'm alex jones if you just tuned in your host we're talking
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:45.040]  about black boxes run by proprietary companies with courts ruling that it's proprietary and
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:50.480]  no one in government private citizens can know what's going on with wireless modems hooked up to
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:56.640]  machines where you've got exit polls not matching admitted fraud caught over and over again companies
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:02.800]  caught going in and manipulating things i mean they've been caught and here we stand so bevin
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.760]  closing over some of the companies and what's happening worldwide and the resistance forming
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.280]  to it i mean this is how you get rid of the pesky people in their own republics or in their own
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:20.080]  democracies actually having power it's very simple if you can get your machines in and get people to
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.440]  accept it and have your prostitute media be compliant and say oh conspiracy theorists say
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.560]  there's fraud then you and i and the call your brothers and countless others prove it's a fraud
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.600]  over the last few decades and they're like okay but now there's not fraud so so so so break down
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.520]  how big this problem is and where you see it going yeah well you know first of all just understand
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.960]  that if you are a multinational corporation doing resource extraction or different uh you know things
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.400]  like that you want to be able to put your thumb on the scale of legislation because the one thing
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.840]  that can impede your profits is some pesky legislature passing laws against things that
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.800]  you want to do so you want to be able to control which politicians are in there you don't want
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.680]  to just do it in one country because you're a global multinational corporation you want your
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.160]  thumb on the scale in multiple countries so that's one thing there's about four big boys in terms of
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.520]  the voting machine companies uh also understand they're all re interrelated in terms of their
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.080]  ownership and the and the key people and then in many cases we don't know who owns them because
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.520]  they don't see they have to tell us but the big ones there's one called dominion which is
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:35.520]  headquartered out of canada which is also associated and licenses this stuff to have one called smart
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.000]  mattock which is out of venezuela and then there's uh esns which is huge globally it's all over the
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.920]  world and there is heart inter civic which is the one that's associated with romney and there's
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.680]  sidle which is one that's owned by a barcelona spain company now these different companies and
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:36:00.640]  they are interrelated guys in many cases are really pushing exactly the same concept into many
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.280]  many countries at once and the citizens in many countries are starting to figure it out it's not
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.480]  just here i'm in contact very often with guys in india because in india the government literally
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:21.680]  built its own voting machines and chooses itself and they're very aware of that there in um the
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:28.320]  philippines they have this company it's it's a joke it's out of venezuela and it licenses stuff
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.480]  from this dominion company which also runs the new york voting and you know it's it's crazy one
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.840]  election they had results show up which are out of columbia in the philippines and they're saying
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:51.920]  don't worry trust us it's okay you know so this is um it's a secret concealed voting system uh push
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.960]  and get it into all these different countries and just tell people don't worry it's a computer it's
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:06.880]  okay obviously whoever the computer controls the outcome well you've used the analogy of bank cards
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.000]  and bank security i'm going to imagine if banking security was like this nothing would be secure i
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.960]  mean it's this one area that they're just like trust us and then there's all the fraud all the
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:23.440]  anomalies all the payout payouts all the scams all the things that have come out hundreds of times
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:30.960]  and they still just smile at us and say just trust us and then carl rove goes on fox news and makes
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:37.200]  jokes about iowa and just make stuff up and then it turns out there was fraud and then they have
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.320]  republican operatives on shows bragging saying yeah rod paul's not going to win wait and see what
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:48.160]  happens next week and then that happens i mean it's just amazing well it is in your face now and one
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.760]  of the things that i think is the next step is to try to get people accustomed to it so that we
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:00.080]  accept it and so you know the the open link in the circle of control is they have to have an
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:08.000]  illusion that elections are real and they have to have acceptance of the election system that's the
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  open link that we cannot allow to close up by either saying we accept it we don't need to know what's
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:22.880]  going on if it takes 75 years to fix this thing we can't quit because this is all the marvel
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.920]  it literally is all the marvels for self-governance versus tyranny
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.960]  no you're right here in austin the polls i saw were over 80 percent were against this hospital
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.720]  district that makes us pay for abortions but not just that they want us to pay for a new private
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:51.680]  medical school and the former austin mayor kirk watson who's a state senator you know famous for
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.800]  land grabs and things under environmental fronts you know he's saying oh you know we really need
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.640]  this and then it turns out even the proposition a court has ruled is illegal but the propositions
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:08.080]  never fail because austin's famous for fraud hard-earned civics by the way is based here for
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:14.560]  those that don't know that robin right and and so so now people know you've got to beat the proposition
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.720]  in court you've got to beat it never even let it go to the ballot because they don't ever vote
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.600]  anything down here i mean i mean if they get it on the ballot to roast your newborn children
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:29.920]  every halloween uh they would i mean it would pass it's just amazing to me that's the thing and
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.400]  why are you know when you start looking at private equity companies owning the voting machine
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:39.520]  private equity companies and the same companies that own you know hospital chains and so forth
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:47.200]  it's clearly not public self-government and so we have to keep our eyes on the ball and go look
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:52.480]  we insist on the right to see and authenticate every essential step of our elections without
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.920]  need for special expertise and you can't substitute some after-the-fact procedure for being able to
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.680]  authenticate the original that's what they got across in germany using the supreme court that's
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:10.560]  been emulated in ireland that's what we need to keep focusing on here it's our ability to
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.920]  authenticate our own elections and by the way they act like we're too big a country to do this
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.360]  folks all they do in the system that works critically i'm wrong in closing with bev harris
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.640]  is all you do is you have the little micro precinct right and and they count the paper
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:33.920]  ballot then that's publicly posted on the wall everyone can see it and then you have the precinct
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.680]  add it all up that's posted then you add all the precincts up and it's actually very good it works
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:46.240]  and it's super hard to engage in any type of fraud with that right it's the concept of dispersed
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.360]  control what we're doing with voting machines is centralized control that's not what this country
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:58.160]  was founded on it was founded on the premise of the dispersal of power yeah people argue all day
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.640]  about you know what type of system of government we want we need a republic where it's dispersal
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.760]  of power and where the people uh you know have the right to make the decisions and where we're
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:14.240]  on top and they have these preachers at 501c3 churches teaching under government order basically
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:21.040]  to teach romans 13 out of context submit to caesar do what caesar says well we are caesar we are the
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:28.080]  boss right right right i mean once we get it under you know it's like we have this we have this
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:34.800]  inferiority complex which is being drummed into us and the fact is we are we created this country
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:42.080]  we made this country what it is uh using those dispersed power systems and so we need to keep
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:48.240]  that up well people need to go donate at blackboxvoting.org our listeners are incredible
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.960]  and they've donated to us over the years with once a year fund drive we've done for five years
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.680]  to help build the tv studio and do so many other things and now get satellite up links
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:01.680]  i want to thank listeners for the money bomb last week the 48 hour transmission it's important to
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.400]  support our am and fm affiliates to call them and thank them a lot of new stations picking us up
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.360]  to sponsor them of your local business it's called voting with your dollars to support
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:17.200]  sponsors you here on those stations because you know you buy nothing but chinese slave goods you
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.920]  end up deindustrializing your country you end up supporting local businesses you end up having a
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.760]  community and i can't think of anybody better to support than mev harris who's totally nonpartisan
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.880]  who's had all these lawsuits who's won who's exposed things who's got you know hacking
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.760]  democracy on hbo who really more than anybody helped break through there's been a lot of other
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.880]  great investigators but she with her dogged you know former corporate fraud investigator
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.160]  uh who's sort of looking into this in closing uh bad people can donate at blackboxvoting.org so
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.880]  important we can't wait to have you on to break down you know the what transpires hopefully won't
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:43:00.000]  be too bad this year after the election uh but in closing what woke you up to this um just a
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.560]  secrecy the fact that we didn't know who owned the companies we couldn't watch anything we couldn't
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:10.240]  get uh any way to authenticate it having been in corporate fraud and done reporting on that
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:16.000]  when you start having things go under behind closed doors you start having fraud it's it's not
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.400]  it's human nature we're not going to change human nature just because we had an electronic
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.960]  computerized machine there's going to be people who want to exploit it they're going to do it
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:31.760]  they've done it and we need to get the public up to speed on what's really going on yeah i've
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.160]  talked to executives and people and i've looked up the numbers on this but uh concur this is what
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:42.480]  you found around half of the people in corporate america they estimate are stealing and of course
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:48.960]  a lot of them get caught uh it's a recklessness and and and i i've never cheated or or sold them
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.960]  like six packs of beer out of golfers golf carts when i was a teenager and i didn't think of that
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.960]  of stealing but it was but i've never been like a thief i don't have a criminal mind i have kind
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.920]  of a straightforward mind but you know what that criminal mind is out there and now that corruption
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.320]  has just been accepted it's it's it's obviously getting worse when we take lance armstrong i
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:11.600]  ran i ran it about it yesterday saying you know the system itself was engaged in fraud too and
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.840]  allowed him to cheat because he was such a big name that's coming out and people are like so what
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:22.480]  alex everybody takes drugs i you know i smoke pot don't bash people that use drugs we're not bashing
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.480]  people that use pot we're saying cheating in sports being an icon for kids i mean we've gotten so
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:34.320]  corrupt now that people are like oh let armstrong cheat don't put down austin i mean it's just so
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:41.440]  weird yeah well and and we have to keep holding the board against that stuff because once we accept
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:47.360]  corruption uh what are we doing we're just becoming slaves and handing over our freedom to some guy who
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.240]  wants to make a lot of money while we you know look who has to follow the laws now only the little guy
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:58.400]  exactly and in mexico north korea once corruption sets in and you accept it it's over i mean
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.880]  i'll go back to this quote here and i want your take on them i'll let you go no man escapes when
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:09.120]  freedom fails the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cry the peas of peas are hanged by
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.280]  those they tried to please folks you're not gonna get ahead licking boots and groveling that's the
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:23.760]  creed of slaves who are slaves people that don't stand and fight bevaris thank you yeah that's a
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.880]  brilliant quote absolutely true and i i thank you alex for continuing to remind people of the truth
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.880]  you know the truth does have a way of bubbling up and and you've been a brilliant vessel in that
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.880]  regard well god bless you and we'll talk to you right after the election thank you bevaris thank
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.360]  you bye bye wow there she goes uh folks uh i'm going to stop right here for a moment before i get
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:50.560]  into other news and your calls uh for a midair refueling uh it is your purchase of books videos
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.520]  t-shirts ball caps high quality water filters discounted all of it that funds this operation i
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.040]  have 51 crew members uh we reached 15 million people a week now it was three million five years ago a
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.720]  week uh and we're exploding and everybody in the media that supports us uh everybody and talk radio
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.680]  that supports us ever you know you are everybody out there that helps info wars dot com and prison
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.400]  body dot com i want to thank you but we're a platform and have been a platform for people
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.200]  like ron paul to get the word out or beth Harris or other authors and researchers and countless
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:27.120]  others uh who really finally break out you know take the singing in whistleblower amber lion her
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.120]  story got a little bit of traction she came on here she's all over big shows all over the country
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.240]  now and you know she said wow your show got my story to break out that's what that's why it's so
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:44.800]  valuable you know despite my personality and and and and you know ego uh and all those type of things
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:52.320]  uh despite all of that that's a side issue that's why i'm trying to bring in other crew members other
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.160]  talk show host other researchers other uh reporters because you know it's about the information
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:03.120]  and it's about growing this operation to really be able to cover full spectrum what's going on
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.600]  because you know we stay hungry when it comes to the fight for liberty i i don't just sit here and
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.120]  and go well i'm reaching three million a week i think i'll you know stop now or oh i'm reaching
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.840]  15 million you know i guess i guess we've hit the top no no no no because the top for me is
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:24.640]  defeating the globalist it isn't about money it isn't about fame it isn't about somebody pulling
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:30.400]  my chair out for me it isn't about people telling me how great i am that is not i mean when i read
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.480]  about a mother where they were grabbing the daughter's crotch she tried to videotape it
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:39.440]  so they roughed her up and arrested her and the noxville jury uh in noxville tennessee where we're
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:46.960]  on the radio um wb cr mr grove john and others great one of our oldest affiliates i know there's
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.920]  great people there it is so upsetting to me that the judge said the police say it's disorderly
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.480]  conduct you will convict her and they took that order and did it even though the jury speaking
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.520]  out now uh in the local news saying well we didn't like what happened to her but we had to convict her
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.760]  juries judge the law as well as the facts that means you know they had juries that said you're
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.840]  going to convict this white person who helped this black person escape where they were being half
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:19.600]  beaten to death every week in a you know at a plantation and northern juries but also southern
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.320]  juries started saying you know what i don't care if there's a law saying life in prison for that
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.920]  this guy deserves a medal that's that's one of your other ways to vote they've taken a lot of the
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:35.360]  voting away there's fraud all over the country uh it's a patchwork of fraud but but it's it's
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.160]  endemic they've taken our right to vote away but we still got the right to sue these people
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:45.120]  we've still got the right to get in their face and publicly shame them we've still got uh most
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.160]  these corrupt government people are all engaged in crime you start falling around the video camera
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.800]  you start digging into their life you can destroy them we've got to get aggressive with crooks okay
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.840]  so we'll destroy them politically we'll destroy them digging up dirt on them we'll destroy them
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:05.120]  suing them and we'll destroy them with grand juries and juries fully informed movement
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.080]  that red beckman started i want to get red beckman back on he's a national treasure we got to get
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.280]  him on a few times a year he's very old now had a lot of health problems we need to get him on
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.000]  he's an icon uh the uh the jury nullification movement is one of the few things we got left
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.160]  with these with these out of control crooks that want to teach us to have a broken will but but i
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:31.600]  started digressing the point is go to info wars shop.com or info wars store.com and get the magazines

[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:12.880]  communities because it is a system of control control is the name but the good thing about it
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  is there's good and there's evil in this world so evil doesn't get to have everything at once
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:23.680]  unless it convinces you you don't have power now we played this clip last year during the

[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:33.440]  unedited from fox news but john bound put it a piece together with a kentucky horse race
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.880]  with it it's not very powerful on radio but if you're watching at prison planet on tv it shows
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.600]  horse races and then carl rove shoots down some magic emperor palpatine lightning bolts and

[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.680]  reliable source uh they made the correction in story county which moved it from an 18 point margin

[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:13.040]  outstanding precinct in the state and that it will show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for for
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.160]  mit romney which will give him a statewide victory of and from out of nowhere it's quick
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.960]  san turham uh san turham so i understand you're saying that they basically have come to agreement
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.800]  as to what the most going to be the iowa is very the they do politics there in a very polite fashion
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.440]  and if they came to a disagreement like this tonight whether they can't find the guys got the
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.080]  official piece of paper they apparently rounded up the representatives of the camp to have agreed
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.720]  yes we were there we know exactly what the vote total was and we both agreed to uh agreed to
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.680]  what it was uh one problem with that there are no trucks driving around with lost ballots it's
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.760]  all done right there at the precinct and then it's post on the wall and the phone calls made
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:57.120]  and that didn't match those and it came out it was fraud later months later uh but you're not
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.800]  supposed to challenge that you're supposed to just play the game it's like putting a hundred
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:07.600]  pound boxer in with a 300 pound super heavyweight and going this is a fair fight or it's like putting
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.880]  my grandmother on crutches in the ring with mike tyson and his prime and going it's a fair fight
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:17.680]  nothing worry about everything's okay like bill murray in the swimming pool just a candy bar

[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:23.120]  yeah good afternoon a couple things i just want to cover real quick uh first of all i got a
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:27.920]  neighbor across the street for me who works at universal studios over here in central florida
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:35.040]  it's a big theme park and he mentioned to me that they have a charity they're doing they covered
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:38.560]  like different things in a humorous thing what's going on through the year and of course they're
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:45.760]  covering the political campaign and so they're portraying obama and romney and they held obama
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:51.520]  with the bikini clad woman and romney with the real conservative you know Mormon type woman and
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:58.400]  and uh anyway what's happened is they have like people that visit there can like comment you know
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.920]  hadn't written and turn them in as they leave and he said overwhelmingly what has happened is
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:09.760]  is republican romney supporters are putting in basically doing what you've been covering about
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:14.640]  what's going on with twitter with obama support these people are putting in death threats to the
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.120]  people working there to be actors and such uh et cetera to the point where now universals had
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.000]  to actually change the way they're doing that skit and making it because they were saying you're
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.760]  making it look like obama is the favorite one and so now they've made it kind of look more like
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.680]  they're going to investigate this is this in the news uh no he said they don't want it out there in
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.880]  the public because it's you know be bad for publicity okay this is universal uh there in
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:49.200]  Orlando yes sir and he's been there six years and he's real reliable he's on board with what's
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:56.400]  going on with what you're and they uh uh say that again what what is it it's it's it's cross
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:02.720]  stressing obama and romney no what they're doing the show and guys in suits supposed to be on
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.440]  impersonating obama and romney and then they have obama with a bikini clad woman making them look
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:13.200]  like a lecherous you know fool and then romney he tells the woman you shut up and just stand there
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:17.120]  and be quiet okay i just understood i thought i kind of halfway heard the first thing on what you
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:27.440]  said uh okay so so so it sounds like it's anti-obama well no actually because uh i guess with a modern
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  american it's cool to have the bikini clad chick so romney's the bad guy yeah exactly so they've
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.480]  changed it so now they've got both of them wearing the same kind of suit and both of them with a
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.280]  bikini clad woman wait a minute so this is what they're teaching kids that married men are supposed
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:48.400]  to be with bikini women uh yeah apparently what they're putting forth there and i mean it sounds
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.600]  really weird what is the name of this i'll i'll try to look it up universal studios obama romney
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.800]  skid uh yeah it's just they do a thing covering what's going on throughout the year and they're
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:04.160]  doing a they've been doing a parody basically you know kind of making fun of both candidates but the
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:09.280]  way it's been come across you said it was obvious the people anyway you know that it looks like
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:15.600]  they're favoring obama so the republican coming republican visitors coming in oh here it is it's
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:22.880]  actually on fox news locally uh and it it says what you were saying uh that universal studios romney
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:30.480]  skid lords obama laughs at romney right right but they're getting death threats on the actors that's
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:36.080]  the one thing he and on people leaving if they were supportive of obama they were actually writing
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:41.040]  comments threatening wow that's not good well i guess the secret service has got to look into it
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:49.200]  well i guess they're they're busy you know my question here looking at this uh is why did they
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:54.720]  even come up with something like this it's just it's so crazy that they force feed us this and make
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:05:01.680]  like politics an entertainment sport erin full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.960]  amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.760]  healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.480]  war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not sure what the
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:20.640]  food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history

[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:54.800]  of the hour i've also got economic news i've got to get to proving we're going into a depression
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.640]  and again people say well don't be negative say things are getting better that'll spur it
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:03.920]  that's in a real economy being positive does help things outlook is important when it's a
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.120]  designed implosion i've had business people go come on just say it's a good economy well it's
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:13.680]  better in some areas of the country like austin where i live but in most areas it's a depression
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:19.280]  and lying to ourselves about this is not good every metric shows we're in trouble
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.160]  we're going to be looking at some of that but but right now let's go to your calls
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:29.520]  going to your phone calls here earnest in washington uh earnest goes to info wars earnest uh you're on
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:35.680]  the air welcome well thank you alex uh i just noticed uh watching you on prism planet tv this
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:41.280]  morning and i was wondering i didn't if i missed it uh did you catch the uh donald trump announcement
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:47.840]  about offering obama five million dollars for his documentation you know i did and it is just a
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:56.000]  total stunt i talked about it with joe curl of the washington times earlier uh and you've got uh on
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.440]  the democratic side you know that lawyer running around going after romney for you know testifying
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:07.360]  for his friend at a at a custody hearing and it's just all all look look look we don't really know
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.880]  who obama is we know the birth certificate's a forgery but i was never a birther because you
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:19.040]  can't it's just a quagmire i know obama said he won't just ban semi-auto rifles he wants our hand
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:25.120]  guns in the debate before last i know he told congress that nato now runs our military with
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:32.320]  the un i know he's shutting down power plants uh and uh to make more money for his buddies i mean
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:37.760]  i know obama's terrible uh but but i mean what's your take on donald trump's uh announcement
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:45.120]  well i i kind of thought it was a smoke screen myself um i i also i thought maybe it was response
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:50.720]  to uh the uh four million copies of dreams my real father going out over the key states that
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:57.920]  that i just read about uh who knows absolutely we have had uh mr gilbert on repeatedly we we
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:04.880]  sell the film but he got backers to put out millions of copies free across the country uh and uh
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.960]  uh yeah exactly it's not that he has a fake birth certificate because he's from kenya that was the
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:17.120]  old cover story he put for 17 years in his harvard publications and in books and everywhere i mean
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:23.280]  it's a fact he said he was from kenya his wife's on video twice saying it but he wasn't from kenya
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.520]  that was the old cover story he's from hawaii frank marshall davis's son i think it's compelling
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:36.480]  evidence what do you think yeah i agree ever since i saw the interviews of you know dreams my real
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:40.880]  father with you um you know that just puts everything into perspective exactly but again
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:46.800]  we can't 100 prove it so we just have to say he isn't who he says he is he's hiding his records
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:51.680]  and i yeah i should have covered the trump thing more uh you know it broke right as i went on the
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.600]  air and then i looked at during breaks and and basically have it over here in the stack and curl
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:00.720]  covered it curl on air i have to be careful because i was talking to him off air and he didn't even say
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.520]  anything off air was off record but once you wear a journalism hat i mean i wear a commentator hat
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:12.720]  a rant hat a tirade hat a researcher hat it's really what i do when i'm not on air uh just
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:17.680]  and i'll talk about myself for people to know why i do what i do but i i more and more have this
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:22.800]  journalist hat on where people tell me stuff even on record i don't want to say it unless they're
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:27.520]  saying it because they can say you said it wrong or but anyways curl didn't really tell me anything
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:34.320]  no no it was on air it was on air he said you know that trump might have done this basically he
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:40.960]  implied uh for obama to smoke screen the terror stuff that was on air uh uh because we were talking
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.480]  about the lawyer woman uh you know uh gloria all red running around going after romney and he was
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:52.400]  saying yeah she's going after romney and this trump thing might be that too and a lot of insiders
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:58.000]  like dr gerome coursey who's talked to trump quite a bit and others that i that i've talked to off
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:04.480]  record they really think trump is a democratic party operative uh that's why he's given more
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.680]  money to democrats than republicans uh and then he does this to get his casinos authorized in
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.600]  democratic crime syndicate areas like chicago yeah not bashing chicago we're on in chicago
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.520]  great people great city but you know i think chicago wants to know their governments a bunch
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:24.880]  of dirtbags i mean i love austin uh but they're dirtbags i mean our government's a bunch of crooks
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:30.640]  so uh anything else sir yeah alex says that that he could come up with forage documents for everything
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.560]  else just like he did his birth certificate just to get the five million dollars yeah it could be
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:40.400]  like some public payoff but i i i don't think obama will really even respond to this because it
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:46.800]  would be seen as unpresidential to say you know here's my uh records look i've personally talked
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.520]  on air to people that went to college with him uh it's there's news out about saying he's a cocaine
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:56.080]  dealer i haven't even gotten to i tend to just not even get into this stuff because you can't
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:01.120]  prove it one way or the other but uh you know obama the way he dressed the way he acted looked like
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:07.120]  you know he was uh having a party there in the 70s a lot of people were uh but again none of that
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.960]  sticks i mean we're all about romney who knows if it's true uh but i agree with you great points
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:19.040]  uh let's go ahead and go to joe in mississippi you're on the air joe welcome
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:27.680]  oh the rabble has a magazine and it's shiny thank you uh so so you're implying it's it's bad that
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:33.680]  i hold up uh these magazines the printed word thank god for the good mergue press and uh for free
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:40.640]  speech and it's horrible that i sell magazines at cost and i get really really excited uh imagining
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:46.000]  millions of people reading these and physically holding the articles that have big color posters
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.480]  inside if you like shiny stuff look at that big shiny poster saying you are the hope with the
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:56.720]  vifer vendetta guy in it uh but pretty evil anything else about magazines that are shiny there
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.680]  yeah that's one of my favorite parts about the magazine is is the poster in the middle
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:07.280]  it's absolutely brilliant and you guys did an excellent job during the money bomb very riveting
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:13.280]  radio oh i thought you were teasing me talking about a shiny magazine oh no i was i was being
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:20.720]  a lord banker oh good good good well i mean people do get mad at me for selling anything
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.720]  but you know what i didn't even plug this last hour but it really hit me i'm gonna put you on
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:30.000]  hold for a minute i have privately i have privately thought about how do i pitch this
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.200]  magazine that sold out the first issue close to selling out the second issue but also subscribers
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:40.640]  how do i sell it well i go well what's the truth why did you do the magazine and i thought back
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.640]  to like six months ago when i was first wanting to do it well it was really years ago i wanted to
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:51.120]  do it but really got earnest on it and it was because imagine giving these to people to wake
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:58.160]  them up and imagine getting a year subscription for your mom your dad your son your daughter your
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:04.000]  pastor your neighbor the local library the local police department the local county commissioners
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:13.760]  the uh the the state house everybody should get subscriptions 13 issues 59 95 that includes the
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:21.920]  shipping one time bam and give it to the library a lot of people do that and then the library you
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:28.320]  may get dozens to read it we're going up to 60 pages now and that is just a fabulous idea
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  to give this is a christmas gift or a holiday gift i'm sorry caller i'm gonna shut up now
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:38.480]  that you're being serious what'd you call about well i called in about the debates they i totally
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:43.440]  agree with you i couldn't even i watched the first two i couldn't even watch make myself
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.080]  watch the third one it just made my head hurt and i watched the third party debate yesterday and it
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:55.280]  was very refreshing to sing the rest of topics that they covered the spectrum is just refreshing
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:18:00.160]  yeah i didn't get enough i didn't get a chance to uh watch the third party debate i probably should
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:06.000]  have yeah i mean hey you know nothing uh groundbreaking or anything but it's just
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.440]  interesting to see the the vast difference there is between the controlled debate and the third
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:18.480]  party debate who did you like the best out of the third party debate yes sir gary johnson yeah
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:22.000]  that's probably one reason i didn't watch it is uh number one i wanted to hang out with my
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.640]  children a few hours but uh number two it's just this stuff gives you a headache after a while
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.720]  but some of them like the socialist and people on there i mean you know i just don't need to hear
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.240]  anymore of that you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean but he uh he was fiery in the debate
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:43.440]  it was is very refreshing and uh he got a lot of applause but uh what's frustrating is the fact that
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:51.200]  you know i tell people about how this whole thing's controlled and it's so fun to be fooled and to go
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:57.680]  along with the winner and that's it it's a bandwagon thing they want to feel like oh yeah my team's
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:01.840]  going to super bowl why are you making fun of sports and it's like man you're a chump
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:10.560]  yeah yeah i mean i explained it and i know for a fact that they understand what's going on that
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:17.360]  there's two sides of the same coin but apparently it's just too much fun to be going along with this um
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:26.240]  it's just be well by the way john john bound one of our reporters on the radio producers his mother
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:32.880]  was at that in chicago we should have your mom john as a reporter she's coming in friday in your mama

[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:08.560]  are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but the healthy homecrafted sources for
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:13.280]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with

[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:35.680]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant americans

[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:13.600]  US and you have got to be prepared did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:18.720]  day supply of food on hand so if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.360]  even a hint of a crisis then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:28.720]  the mob in minutes and you and your family could be in serious trouble that's why my friend just

[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:16.560]  we have to psychoanalyze ourselves and more and more i'm becoming conditioned
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:22.400]  and every week or so i see articles where the police go to the wrong house and shoot a little
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:28.800]  kid or shoot an old lawyer kill a county judge or shoot a mama and then they don't even get in
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:34.560]  trouble it's like wrong house kill everybody shoot people throw a flashbang in shut a baby on fire
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.200]  that that happens i see that story routinely where they throw it in the crib or throw it on
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:44.960]  little kid and burn them up kill them half kill them and it just shows you know i'm not here
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.640]  airing it every day or it might happen 30 times before i even cover one of them and that just
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:56.640]  shows how i'm becoming conditioned to just accept it yeah you know now they're saying they're gonna
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:03.280]  have SWAT team raids or just regular warrant service not even high risk and it's the message of
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.040]  men in black are coming to kick down your door and drag you off doesn't that scare you aren't
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:12.000]  you scared of the government let's go back to your phone calls uh denison alabama you're on the
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  air thanks for holding hey i just want to tell you that um i drive a truck and every time i pick up
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.080]  a different trailer i put a sticker on the back and when i'm out of stickers i write it in the dirt
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:29.520]  on the back door so uh info wars dot com beautiful my friend that's how you get the word out but don't
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:34.560]  let the tsa see that at a checkpoint you're not allowed to do that well that's why i was gonna
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:41.040]  ask you um i haven't seen one of these checkpoints yet but uh i don't know what to do when when they
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:48.160]  pull me over for no reason and want to you know i got nothing to hide but i i'm not into that stuff
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:56.560]  you know well here's the deal if you just search um the tsa highway checkpoints or things like that
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:00.960]  they're having them all over the country uh the biggest area is tennessee and surrounding states
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:07.120]  is where we've seen like half of them when i see it in the news um but you can run into marines you
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:11.680]  could run into army uh and a lot of times this traffic backed up for miles i mean it's like a
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:17.840]  holiday to make everybody wait governors and people get upset but they just keep doing them
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:21.760]  but we got to keep pushing back they're trying to break our will trying to condition the police
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:26.320]  everybody to accept it yeah there's an article what is that out of out of forbs the tsa is coming
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:31.040]  to a highway near you and first they try to do commercial vehicles they're also trying to just
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:37.120]  stop everybody now and discretion's the better part of valor it's good to have a camera it's good
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.960]  to video tape and it's good to educate them wow you know what happened to the tenth amendment
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:46.080]  states writes and you know sworn police officers aren't supposed to set up random checkpoints uh
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.480]  are you looking for somebody i mean is there a bank robbery in the area do i fit the description
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:56.720]  what is your emergency and by the way you're not even a sworn officer and then just be real calm with
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.640]  them and you know because first they'll try to act like you know you're doing something wrong they'll
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:05.440]  call over a cop who try to act like you're doing just go hey guys this is america this isn't funny
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  and as soon as you're not intimidated and start laughing at them generally they just say get out
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  of there move on move on they want to get the next person uh when when patriots act scared and act
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.920]  freaked out it's over you're going to jail for something i mean i'm just like wow you really
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:23.760]  want your kids growing up in the country where there's checkpoints on the highway you really
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.160]  you know the border is basically wide open and you're using this to harass us i mean they just
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:33.520]  start getting preached at and and believe me in the checkpoints i've run into and i've run into
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.840]  quite a few of them i mean the cops are just like well one time they knew who i was it's on video and
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.040]  they go oh yeah the serbs are going to invade alex get out of here i mean it was just ridiculous i
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:47.520]  never said the serbs were going to invade uh but i mean there they were running a checkpoint in
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:54.240]  kyle on i-35 with traffic literally backed up 20 miles and then later i called the police chief
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:00.240]  about it this is a long time ago and the police chief spoke uh woman at the time said uh said
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:05.120]  well it was a federal grant and the legislature had to get involved they were doing these all
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:11.280]  over it's like 10 years ago uh are more time just flies but um i mean there's your answer
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.040]  uh now obviously if you're a truck driver you're commercial so they claim you've waived more of
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.480]  your rights but you know i mean next are they going to say you got to lick their boots because
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:24.320]  you don't have any rights a weapon too and what do you do when they ask if you got a weapon you
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:28.240]  say yeah they're not they're not going to take my glock away from me you know what are they well
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:32.160]  you know that's the problem it doesn't matter if the state law says you can have it doesn't matter
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:37.760]  if you have a reciprocal concealed carry a lot of cops are are good people and actually like
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:41.680]  to conceal carry and then know it means you've been through a bunch of background checks as much
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:45.920]  as they have so they'll leave you alone uh it's not really the police you have trouble with it's
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:53.360]  these tsa people uh we've seen them in california and dallas in places get in the face of tv trucks
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:57.440]  i mean you know tv station pulls up because because they got a checkpoint going at a bus
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:02.800]  terminal or train station or highway and the tsa there's been newscast they'll march over go what
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.720]  are you doing well we're here no you're not you turn that off and then they'll call cops on them
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:14.960]  and stuff i mean that's just power mad power grabbing well keep it up man i don't have time to

[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:04.720]  and then we'll go to tim and nevada and others uh shon you're on the air hi alex uh i just wanted
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:09.920]  to comment on yesterday's topic because i have first hand knowledge about this um there's a
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:16.480]  former clippers player by the name of keith claus who um openly through some strange circumstances
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.920]  i became very good friends with this guy and i'm not going to air his dirty laundry on how that
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:28.000]  happened but this guy openly tells me that the games are are not so much fixed but they're
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.360]  guided heavily and the referees are the ones that are doing the guiding okay well let me just stop
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:39.520]  you for a moment i i'm not saying you're a liar i don't really follow sports i don't know who this
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:44.640]  claus guy is i don't know who you are so you could call up and tell me that marvin the martian's
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:50.640]  fixing you know nba games i have no doubt that stuff goes on is why we had the guest on with the
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:56.160]  fixes in but obviously you know that's circumstantial so i really can't have you go any further uh
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:00.320]  you know with specifics i mean i mean the way the call should go is again we don't screen your calls
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:07.760]  is hey i'm friends with a professional athlete and they tell me that that it's more guided rather
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:17.280]  than fixed so i mean just what is your view on all this um well my view on this is uh i know that he's
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:23.680]  gotten blackballed from the from the game and now he plays in china i mean it's like specifically
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.320]  they'll give me your take on on on how you're saying things are guided versus you know saying this
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:35.600]  guy's name um well i'm i'm i guess i'm saying i completely wholeheartedly agree with you that
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:40.480]  everything is based around the money game and uh if you make waves you're gonna get you're gonna
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:48.880]  get canned but but but but but but how is guided how do you guide it but not fix it uh what you're
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:56.160]  instructed to do by certain referees is to put different degrees of enthusiasm in your game um
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:02.800]  foul other players on purpose um and the referees are the ones who are kind of in charge of steering
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:08.080]  everything yeah that's what my well that's what my guest said to me really off air but also some
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:12.240]  on air in the tv interview we did was that it's the refs are who they everybody goes to they're
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:19.520]  like the little crime bosses i completely agree that that was my point now you've got to have it
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:23.520]  always compartmentalized with executive fraud that's the only way to engineer you can't have the
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:28.800]  you know trying to get the players to execute it all um yeah that that's why you see so many bad
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:34.320]  calls that that's why i just you know i just don't watch it i mean it's it's again folks i used to
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:40.560]  watch sports i i know a lot of people like them i i i get it uh it's just that it's it's it's it's
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:44.960]  empty you know you're leaving a friend's house after watching a day of sports on a sunday and it's
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:51.920]  like you just haven't had a life you know i mean go hiking go mountain biking go for a jog go go
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:54.880]  drink beer with friends i mean i'm not saying go out and drink that's better just sitting there
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:41:00.480]  watching tv drinking uh you know go help homeless people you're like that's boring no it's empowering
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:05.040]  or go go paint a picture you know not saying go drink beer you know what i mean i'm saying it's
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:09.920]  just it's just there's there's so many things that are more more empowering than just sitting around
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:17.440]  all day watching things that don't matter i mean you listen to this show we are a spectator society
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.680]  but i'm here dedicating my time it's not canned it's live it's real you're really here when i have
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:28.960]  to say i have guessed on uh we're not screening the calls and um you're gonna learn about stocks
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.440]  and bonds and gold and silver and geopolitical things and i mean i'm telling you this is what
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:42.480]  people that are successful do they're out there researching things as well uh it's it's loserish
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:46.640]  to just be into entertainment all day you're supposed to do entertainment sometimes to
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:52.640]  blow off steam like i'm probably too far to the extreme uh right now i've rediscovered gilligan's
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.920]  island the three seasons and i always liked it when i was a kid and i didn't get to watch a lot of
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:01.280]  television when i was a child we were always busy doing stuff or i might get to catch it
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:07.200]  every once while it was on uh so you know i've i've been kind of guilty pleasure with my children
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.360]  who don't let watch a lot of tv usually educational stuff we've been watching gilligan's island and
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:18.160]  i mean it's so healthy uh just with the gender roles and the messages and how they all work as a
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:24.400]  team and it's funny it's slapstick and it's so simple and it's good and and it's not that i'm
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:29.760]  some throwback i watch these new shows they're designed to screw you up and i and i can instinctively
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:33.840]  tell you that but i can go show you where they're funded by the department of defense different
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:40.720]  agencies to do it you know anti-family anti god anti-private property yes see i tweeted that
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:45.440]  last night while i was watching gilligan's island i said i wish modern tv was not a scientific attack
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:54.000]  system marianne's very nice lady and uh anyways i sent that out it was the episode where i was
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:01.600]  called two gingers where there's uh where um they're watching ginger do a play and marianne falls out
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:08.320]  and hits her head then wakes up and thinks he's ginger i mean that is just hilarious man anyways
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:14.320]  i'm sorry i uh people say well you're just you're just you know corny you're stupid you just don't
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:21.760]  get all the modern stuff no i get it just no attention span mindless trash and i i mean i
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.160]  can watch mindlessness it's it's just not if it's weaponized against me i could probably watch football
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:32.160]  there wasn't globalist messages during all the breaks you know that's what i'm saying this is
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:37.360]  meant to hurt us is my point gilligan's island they were just introducing people you know television
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.640]  been around 20 30 years and and people wouldn't put up with that type of garbage you know people call
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:48.160]  it wimpy to be against drones or be against murder or be against killing you know it's cool to be in
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:52.800]  the death the people i know from world war two vietnam korea who actually killed a bunch of people
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:59.280]  you know uh or saw people die i mean i've told the story of my grandfather uh they would go into
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:05.040]  town in east texas and he'd take my dad to you know see a movie or something and if there was mild
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:10.960]  violence then he'd get up and leave and i'd say now we're not watching this trash and it when he
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:15.200]  was a not really a worldly guy but he was well traveled in world he'd seen kids starve to death
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:19.280]  when you know what happened you know during the occupation when they kicked the germans out of
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:23.200]  italy and things like that and like you know been there and actually giving us food away almost all
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:26.720]  the time and lost a bunch of weight just because he couldn't stand seeing little kids starve to death
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:30.320]  but see nowadays people just all that's those kids starving you know they be i mean i'm telling you
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:33.760]  nowadays people wouldn't give their food away probably and i'm not sitting there building up
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.200]  my grandpa the point is is that he would never let anybody throw away food people say like you
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:43.600]  know the old timers you know don't waste that food that's because from the depression and stuff folks
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:50.080]  you didn't eat sometimes and i'm already digressing i said i get to this news uh it's just that
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:58.320]  people that's seen a bunch of violence it's not fun to see it like i've seen some violence
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:03.680]  i've seen some bad things uh and nothing like somebody's learned a bunch of combat and i don't
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:11.040]  think it's funny and i just noticed how there's so many empty cowardly people who are into violence
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:18.320]  like a extension of them but when push comes to shove it's all ritualized i see this with guys
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.800]  who'll start a fight with you because you know because you're mild mannered and polite at first
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:26.560]  they'll kind of come on you're like all right let's go then it's like then they back off when they
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.880]  see you turn on okay i'm ready to i'm ready to beat the living daylights out of you to the you
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.480]  know all the way buddy let's go as soon as they see oh no no no mister i just wanted to sit here
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:41.920]  and show off in front of my wife and act tough i didn't actually want to actually get this going
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:49.200]  and i just don't understand that i mean you know this is a real world we're in ladies and gentlemen
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:54.000]  we're we're real people we're really alive i was listening to dr stan monteev last night
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.800]  driving home at about six o'clock on jemesis and i knew everything they were saying was true they
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:03.920]  were reading the studies about the blubber in wales and the pacific ocean off the u.s coast
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:08.960]  is up 2000 percent it's bio accumulating and how it's bio accumulating in us and how they're kim
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:12.560]  trailing us with it and i'm just was getting it's just like my god i'm in a scientific
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:17.360]  dictatorship being sprayed and then i felt completely guilty even coming on air talking
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:24.400]  about the stupid election i mean it's just all beyond anything i can imagine and it gets worse
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:29.520]  and crazier by the minute and i was listening to dr stan monteev who's a medical doctor and i
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:33.680]  already read all the studies he was talking about and he was just listening for like 45 minutes
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:37.920]  because i was in traffic while i was doing a doesn't matter i was doing a an errand and then
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:44.320]  traffic but the point is is that for 45 minutes i was listening to this and i knew it was all
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:49.040]  true and i knew listeners tuning in to 90.1 in austin a lot of them probably like oh that's just
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:53.520]  what that guy's saying because he's not going i'm an award-winning medical doctor and author and
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:59.120]  researcher and blah blah blah he's just on there reading these studies on there and i'm listening
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:04.800]  to it and it's like making me angry it's like i'm under assault and it's like the government's god
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:10.720]  flying around up there spraying us and killing the wildlife and hurting everybody and i'm tired of it
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.760]  and then i don't even get mad at cops and bureaucrats now when they're trying to oppress me
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.080]  because they're victims too they're just idiots i'm like you're an idiot they're poisoning you
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.400]  you don't take the vaccines you know the sodium fluoride's meant to dumb you down go read a study
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:33.760]  then don't ask to search my car you got kids do you got kids uh yeah yeah well you better go look
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.880]  this up you know i mean and it's not like i'm some hero telling them this what am i supposed to do
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:49.360]  you're not a hero folks speaking out against this you're just trying to survive you understand that
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.760]  set us at flashbacks to that last night listened to for 45 minutes
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:00.880]  if he's just listed study after study study with his guest and and i'd looked at all the studies
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.960]  and i knew it was all true and i'm just like and my instinct was get home sell everything and go to
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:10.480]  the southern hemisphere because they're not running most of these programs in remote areas
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:16.640]  because it's not cost effective to wipe out small groups and then i got home and looked at my four
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:26.720]  year old daughter who is the image of innocence and goodness and here i am launching this whole
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:31.840]  operation living here sworn to stay here and go down with a ship i don't know if i can live up to
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:39.840]  that pledge i i mean i think i i'm gonna definitely moved but there's no and it's not like there's
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:44.080]  any safe political country to go to but there's places where they're not spraying aluminum to
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.760]  oxide on us and they were going over all the stuff it's doing to people and the numbers
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.640]  and the neurological disorders and the lung disorders and and and the lung cancer exploding
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:49:00.640]  after cigarettes went out i mean it is just off the charts how they're killing us and it's all
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.600]  just the standardization normalization of killing us and i am not going to sit here
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:11.920]  while they murder my children i am not going to do it i want these people arrested i want
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:17.440]  people to wake up out of their trance and to do something about this stop watching sports and stop
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:26.320]  acting tough all day i mean look at these stacks of articles right here look at these stacks of
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:31.680]  articles and i've got a whole another stack on them right here going over all of this you can
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:43.760]  look up cancer clusters and it goes over all of it in fact i had the guys print me all a whole
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:49.200]  bunch of articles about cancer clusters at the airports and then i thought i had it together
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:56.000]  here oh god with my stack here we're gonna have to skip this break i've got to cover this
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.200]  information i said i'm gonna do it i know it messes the network up and i'm skipping this
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:03.600]  network break guys i know you gave me a big stack of cancer cluster articles and i know
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:08.720]  it's here in my stack uh just start putting them on screen ap Reuters all the ones you gave me
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.920]  because i want to just put them on screen i know you printed them i had them in here like 30 minutes
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:22.800]  ago it's mixed in with all these irs can't travel articles oh here it is i found it never mind i found
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:27.040]  them this stuff gets to me folks i mean i'm i literally got lightheaded there where i was
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:31.520]  just running a little bit and i got lightheaded it's like i'm like overwhelmed i mean you know
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:36.080]  it's like almost feigning it just it just comes in on you when you don't have a governor that
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:40.720]  blocks out all this stuff and you really know reality it's like what what the i mean it's it's
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:45.120]  overwhelming they're killing us they're they're scum they brag about it they got patents on it
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:49.520]  the white house science czar writes books about it i've got one right over there and they're doing
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:58.640]  it to us and they think it's funny billa melinda gates all of them here it is cancer surges and
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:05.920]  body scanner operators tsa launches cover up and it just goes through uh all the different
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:10.320]  mainstream news articles and government documents and doc documents obtained by the electronic
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:15.520]  privacy information center epic and how for you know well at that time eight years it was
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:20.800]  a couple years ago it's been 10 years now and they put them in boston logan look at this headline
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:27.120]  tsa says boston logan cancer cluster not due to scanners they admit there's an off the chart
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:34.880]  cancer increase and so it goes over all that and so i thought i would just give you the rest of the
[02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:43.360]  story here on this today because they are announcing major airports to remove invasive x-ray body
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:50.960]  scanners and there's a bunch of lies here okay the headline is truthful but it's deceptive
[02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:56.640]  they have been ordering the backscatter that's a different type of radiation that they say is safe
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:01.280]  they said these old ones were safe the other type may even be worse because it vibrates at the exact
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:06.080]  frequency to break dna strands which is the number one cause of cancer because you start having
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:11.200]  mutations and it's a type you can't even really get around with it with even nutrition and other
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:17.280]  things uh it it's very serious and it's the same thing with the cell phones it sends out the same
[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:22.880]  thing as the cell phones basically uh and so people are mad about them saving the naked images
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:26.880]  so then they lied and said we have a computer program that overlays it and we don't save it
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:31.760]  turns out they were saving it turns out the overlay they say you see is fake it is being recorded
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:36.080]  and they pass them around to make jokes up and put them on the internet and go up and ask movie
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:40.160]  stars to sign images of their genitals i mean you you know that's all been in the news a pack of
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:44.880]  criminal liars okay i mean it's an enemy operation of course they lied to us to them they're just
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:52.640]  killing cockroaches but the tsa minions themselves here's the big enchilada the reason
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:53:01.120]  that they are pulling these out of the big airports is because they in the last few years
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:04.800]  i've talked to tsa on and off air they call them in and this was later confirmed for your
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:10.400]  releases and they say are you concerned about radiation are you concerned about
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:14.880]  you know the the the invasive patdowns and if people say yes they say thank you
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:19.120]  then they pink slip them a few weeks to a month later for something else they start riding them up
[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:24.560]  okay and they bring in people that will so the thing is the tsa wasn't bad
[02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:28.560]  ten years ago they weren't even bad six seven years ago it's getting worse now because they
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:32.880]  they're going to use them as the takeover arm and i've had tsa agents come to my protest you
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:36.640]  retired ones and people are people that got out because of it and they said it's horrible they're
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:42.240]  robbing they're stealing well all of that has come out but what's happening is because flyers
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:47.440]  are telling them about the radiation i know i do it and because it's coming out that it's lies
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:53.600]  uh that that that oh you know this is one billionth of the radiation from a cell phone
[02:53:53.600 --> 02:54:00.080]  like the los vegas guy told me last year when he was trying to put me through the the ringer
[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:08.240]  the tsa are watching people get cancer around them they're watching people with nosebleeds
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:16.320]  and teeth falling out and cataracts and because because again congress has demanded for four years
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:20.160]  that it be tested then they lied and said they had then it turned out they hadn't tested then
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:24.000]  they did fake test then they lied and said john hopkins said there was no radiation when john
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.560]  hopkins real report actually said it will give you cancer see when a report comes out from john
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.840]  hopkins saying it gives you cancer with their head radiology scientist saying a doctor their
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:39.840]  response was john hopkins says it doesn't give you cancer kind of like monsanto with aspartame
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:44.320]  in the 70s couldn't get it approved so they just took out all the monkeys that died and used the
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:50.560]  monkeys that didn't die and said and then falsified the report to get it approved and so what's
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:55.120]  happening is they can this is a huge vector for humanity they cannot get dumb enough people to
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:03.040]  kill themselves as tsa agents all they can get now is pedophiles and perverts and pure criminals
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:08.000]  that that that know they're getting radiated but are so evil because they get to exercise raw
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.800]  mindless idiotic embarrassing power and rob people some get jobs because they want to rob
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:16.720]  prescription drugs because they're drug addicts everybody who's worked in medicine knows that
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:21.120]  you know beautiful women will come in and say pull out all my teeth because i want a bottle of
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:27.200]  painkillers you know you know drug addict women will do anything you know for the drugs sex you
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:32.560]  name it well it's the same thing for men and then they've been caught over and over again
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:36.800]  literally thousands of times and everybody i know that's flown with any type of addictive
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:41.040]  legal prescription it ain't in your bag when you get off the plane they're gonna steal it
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:46.800]  because a lot of them because i profiled them as i watch the news i research it every day and i see
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:51.440]  the patterns of the biggest group are drug addicts that want to steal your prescription that's a
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:55.920]  you're sleeping pills painkillers whatever the case is that's why they really go crazy and take
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:59.600]  people that have just had surgery to a private room everybody keeps wondering why they take them
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:03.600]  there it's to get them away from their bags because now they're reporting yeah they took my
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:07.520]  bandages off and kept me back there for an hour and i missed my flight and then and then my painkill
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:12.000]  well of course they see somebody who's coming through and they go i just had surgery and you
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:18.800]  got bandages on baby there is going to be some vaikinen or some other painkillers in that bag
[02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:25.200]  you are getting a shrimp surge and you're getting your stuff stolen so that's what's going on here
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:29.600]  is that they're getting cancer they're dying and so they're going to move the really high power
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:36.320]  machines out to the small town airports to kind of rotate it to people that hadn't had any scanners
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:40.240]  to begin with so they can think you know so they can get cooked for a while and figure out they're
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:45.760]  being killed okay that's that's what's happening there but that's a lie too because the new scanners
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:51.600]  radiate you just in a different way okay it's a different type of slow motion disintegration right
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:56.480]  so that's what's going on so see there's a full spectrum analysis but it does show
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:00.640]  that incredible heat is coming in on them we've known for a long time they're phasing out the
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:07.760]  classic x-ray because there's so much medical research everybody knows x-ray oh by the way
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:12.880]  they won't get them approved they won't even get the monthly technician see if you work in a hospital
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:17.440]  doctor's office wherever monthly a private third-party firm has to come in and get calibrations
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:22.800]  and that's a good reason because if it's not calibrated right a regular x-ray can become lethal
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:28.160]  that's why they've had so many of these MRIs killing people because they weren't calibrated right
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:32.400]  man they're already high-powered but you don't calibrate them right the hair falls out you know
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:38.000]  that day then you and then you die of a brain tumor six months later so so you're in there around
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:43.760]  medical equipment so also they they cannot have them certified they won't have them certified
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.880]  by outside third-party firms they just say we wear blue you know monkey outfits we're god
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:53.440]  there's going to be no testing that's just the way it is and then people start dying of cancer
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:57.840]  okay well we'll just get these to the older you know smaller airports that didn't have them let
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.600]  them figure out you know take them ten years figure out it killed them oh we've got the new
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:05.120]  safe ones and then by the time they figure out those are killing them oh here's some new ones
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.960]  see how this works and it's just dealing with criminals governments run by criminals and all
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:15.600]  their horrible criminal mindsets and this is how they do it this is how they operate so
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:20.240]  it's really not a victory it's a small victory and that they're having to spin
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:26.480]  the fact that they're moving these out for safer scanners they're doing it because they've got a
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:30.640]  mutiny on their hands and i've got this from sources all over the place and it's in the nose
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:36.240]  over the cancer okay you think you're getting radiation the tsa agents are dead they're killing

[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:27.360]  is out of cbs news right here it's an ode to rush limbaugh just listen to rush limbaugh like 22
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:35.040]  years ago when he's first on here he'd do that he's loved it now i do it and every time i do it

[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:58.640]  but i mean this article says it all and again i already knew all this you probably knew this
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:07.440]  but to see it in cbs news just shows you how off the charts this is researching this article it says
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:18.000]  that most porn out there is amateur and that most of it is stolen and that they hack into your computer
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:22.720]  and they hack into your phone or they get your stolen phone there's a whole market for this and
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:28.240]  then it's put on big websites and it's so widespread nobody can even stop it and then meanwhile
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:31.600]  i've got poll joseph watson's article

[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:10.320]  long long long long time and when it says it's taking control of your phone there's people
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:15.760]  actually taking control of it and public schools all over the country are watching kids on government
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:22.160]  issued laptops at home and they'll announce on themselves well billy we saw you taking the drugs
