[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Can I get two and one for my vote?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Yeah!

[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  Thank you!
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Always short!
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  For wars!
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  And for wars!
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  Thank you!
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  And for wars!
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  Thank you!
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  Thank you!
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  You're welcome!
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  And for wars!
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Yay!
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  For Alex Jones!
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  For Alex Jones!
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  For Alex Jones!
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  Yeah!
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  I love you!
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Thank you!
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Thanks for your support!
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Oh my goodness!
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  I am so freaking honored!
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  I love you!
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  I love you!
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  Alex!
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  I'm staying right here!
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Thank you for your support!
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  You are the greatest thing ever!
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Thank you!
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  In the home!
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  Wait, I gotta get the info wars in the home.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Does that say info wars?
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Oh yeah, info wars!
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Young girl!
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Thank you, Vince!
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Is that how it's Katelyn?
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  Info wars is soft!
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  It's what Alex does and all Americans do.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  And I think it's just a shame
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  and a travesty
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  with Facebook, Twitter
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  and the banks.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  We're living in a fascist country.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  Info wars.com!
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  There you go!
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  Fight fake news!
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Oh my gosh!
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  Thank you!
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  Share the article!
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  Congratulations, you're my daddy girl!
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Thank you!
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  Info wars.com!
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  I would love to meet Alex.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  What would you say to him?
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  What would I say to Alex Jones?
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  Where does he come up with his ideas?
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Because he honestly says the weirdest things
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  but some of it does make sense
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  if you really think about it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  I absolutely love info wars
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  and watching for like 11, 12 years.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  You guys are awesome!
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Thank you!
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  He's still there, go to infowars.com
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  You can watch his live show on his website.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  I miss him so much.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  I used to watch him every Tuesday night
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  so I don't know what happened to him.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Go to infowars.com and click on
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  where's his radio show
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  and you can watch him every day.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Okay, cool!
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  We just want to say hey Alex,
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  wish you were here with us deplorables.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  Come on brother!
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  Info wars presents
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  The David Knight Show
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  The Alex Jones Show
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  and The War Room
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  with Owen Shroyer
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  infowars.com
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  forward slash show
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  best-selling author, is a really smart guy.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  remember when he was on last week
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  when the tankers got blown up
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  and sunk in the Persian Gulf
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  and I said the doctrine
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  in his nuclear attack
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  will be launched on Iran, fire and fury
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  and he said no, no, that's off the table.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  See, that's why he'd be like a master sergeant
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  and I'd be a general
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  because I'd done my research
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  and already knew about this
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  before it was even declassified.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  U.S. first strike on Russia,
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  Iran, you name it, with nuclear weapons
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  the Doctor Strange Love Policy
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  from the 1960s brought back
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  this has actually changed
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  under Obama under Hillary's advice
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  I got that from high level folks
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  involved with the nuclear weapons
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  I've told you that on air
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  Saudi Arabia has nuclear weapons
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  this is all confirmed now
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  and here it is, they released this
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  on June 11th
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  they pulled it two days later and reclassified it
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  here it is, the classified document
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  nuclear operations manual
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  we have a right to know about this
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  I already know about it
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  I'm going to tell you all about it
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  now why is that important
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  the Iranians admit to shooting down a U.S. Navy drone
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Trump is vowing retaliation
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  saying Iran made a very big mistake
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  it's a broadcast you might not want to miss today
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  this is the info war
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  infowars.com
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  newswars.com
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  tomorrow's news today
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  we are the real wildcard
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  we're the real ace of spades
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  fighting for America
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  fighting for free
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  fighting for you
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  info wars, the most banned network
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  in the world
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  self-supporting structure
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  that is promoting free press and free speech
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  by people getting together and supporting one another
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  and sustaining one another
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  it is the only independent press of this size
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  and scale, of this public reach
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  it is the one model that says
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  here's a way to have a self-supporting
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  self-sustaining, self-structured
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  little d-democratic structure
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  that because the audience determines what content
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  goes up, the audience determines
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  and supporting info wars
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  the audience spends there whatever it is
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  on products that they like and that they want
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  and the ability to do that and at the same time
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  support press, support speech
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  support letting the audience choose
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  and it's the ultimate American democratic
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  expression and experiment
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  and it is the celebration of free press
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  and free speech with free markets
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  We bring life
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.000]  We bring death
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  We are men
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  We are women
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  We are the humans
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  We are the planet
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.000]  We are God's creation
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  We are the future
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  Not you
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  Death
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  Death
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  Death
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  Death
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  Death
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Death
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Death
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  of the info war
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  We don't fear death
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Defending the republic from enemies
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  born and domestic
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  in the info war and say I don't know
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  what's going to happen at the end of this
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe
[06:50.000 --> 07:02.000]  Death
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  Death
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  Death
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  Death
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  Death
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  Infowars the most
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  banned network in the world
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  Death
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Waging war
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  on corruption
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  It's Alex Jones
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  of the info war
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  Well to say we've got an important
[07:36.000 --> 07:56.000]  broadcast today to be putting it lightly
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  If you're a TV viewer you can see what I have in my hands
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  Joint Publication 3-72
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  Nuclear Operations
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  New Doctrine June 11th, 2019
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  For First Strike
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  Preemptive Nuclear War
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  On Iran
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  Russia and China
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  First Strike
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  The Quote Winnable Nuclear War
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  Complete Psychotic Madness
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  End of the World
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  Now what do you think Putin was talking about?
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  The day after this was released
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  when he said he warned of the end of the world
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  and insanity and saying the US
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  doesn't even talk to us now
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  Trump is so paralyzed by the neocons
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  calling him a Russian agent
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  that no one even talks
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  to the Russians over the red phone now
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  There's no discussion
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  There's some joint military discussion
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  but at the highest levels
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  it's paralyzed
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  and the neocons
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  are running wild
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  I read in the news
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  but I don't believe leftist news most of the time
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  The Tucker Carlson privately warned
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Trump not to launch war with Iran
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  and he's one of the only people
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  talking to the president
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  link the amounts every day
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  Well I knew that Tucker
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  talked to the president quite a bit
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  and I confirmed last night
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  and I'll leave it at that
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  that Tucker Carlson and a couple other people
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  I confirmed from two people
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  very close to Tucker
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  maybe his wife gets closer
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  The point is
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  is that
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  they are fighting
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  as we speak
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  battling and the president's here
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  and the leftist kind of pissed
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  There are news articles
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  kind of pissed
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  you know
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  if you go to the Daily Beast article
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  it's got graphics and things making fun of Tucker
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  hey man
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  don't get in the way of nuclear war
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  damn conservative piece of filth
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  Tucker's also gotten documents
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  that the Koch brothers
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  have been targeting nationalists
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  and patriots for censorship of conservatives
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  and censorship of yours truly
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  that's who's behind it
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  yep you know I love how the left always said
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  oh Jones is secretly funded
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  by the Koch brothers
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  I even had a few former employees
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  literally like babe
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  like schizophrenics to my face
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  and go I know you're really getting funding
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  from the Koch brothers
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  and I'm like the Koch brothers used to be Democrats
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  they gave more money to Democrats over all the Republicans
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  and they went open borders
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  I'm not funded by the Koch brothers
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  or anybody
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  except the listeners
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  but the point is
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  is that he's got a powerful report on that
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  I have an overflow
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  of news
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  we have exclusive information from inside
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  the nexium cult
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  and it's conviction and so much more today
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  but this is such
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  a big deal on the nuclear weapons doctrine
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  and how it ties
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  into the US drone big shot down
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  of the Strait of Hormuz
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  and what Iran's doing and the double set
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  diplomacy where you've got the neocons
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  and the Democrats
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  basically trying to set Trump up
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  in Iran
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  and the Iranians
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  are acting
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  very very very bold
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  right now
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  like they know something
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  we don't know well I figured out what's going on
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  so I'm going to wait till the start
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  of the next hour
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  and then I'm going to get to all this
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  because I have Roger Stone coming on
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  breaking his silence for the second time
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  not on the gag order
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  or his court case
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  but on the nexium cult
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  which he got blamed with
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  saying oh, Roger Stone spoke to him a few times
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  he's part of it
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  they had a sub company try to hire him
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  he got in there like a week or so
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  and said this is a cult and got out
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  he said that here two years ago
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  turns out in the court documents he was a target
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  of them trying to get it Trump
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and others and of course
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  truly
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  and Hillary was involved
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  this is all a giant blackmailing scam
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  so
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  that's going to be at the bottom of the hour
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  he'll be popping in with us here in about
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  20 minutes
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  but
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  the situation
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  with the president
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  where he literally only has a couple
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  people telling him don't listen to Bolton
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  and sadly Pompeo
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  is
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  becoming more neo-connish
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  and I like Pompeo
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  but
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  Bolton is a psychotic
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  from the mold of Richard Perle
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  and all the rest of these people
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  and
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  Trump is being walked into a setup here
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  the Iranians have made double deals
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  before with elements of the deep state
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  they did against Jimmy Carter
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  they have pulled these scams before
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  and
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  there are wheels within wheels
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  I wanted to go into
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Venezuela to remove the dictator because thousands are dying a week
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  but I said we can't
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  because you can't trust the neo-cons
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  working with the deep state operatives inside the government
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  to set up our troops
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  and set Trump up in an operation
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  a la
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Bay of Pigs
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  like to do with Kennedy
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  and so that's why we're in so much trouble
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Iran down's drone
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  ready for war
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  deep fake photo
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Putin warns USA
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  that's the headlines right now
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  and the Pentagon saying that
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  it's a fake video
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  they're saying that it was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  the predator drone
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  not over Iranian
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  land and airspace
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  service to air missile
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  taking that down
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  and the video is posted
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  up on infowars.com
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  and news wars.com
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  the Iranian government news agency Press TV
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  has released that
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Iran accused of using fake photo
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  to prove U.S. drone was over its territory
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  as U.S. slams unprovoked attack
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Trump says they've made a very big mistake
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  Iran made a very big mistake
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  close quote
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Putin's now warning the United States
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  this could escalate into a wider war
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  and I'm going to cover that
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  when we come back from break for one segment
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  I'm going to really dive into it
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  and then I'm going to get to this new nuclear first strike doctrine
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  that's just biblical
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  and it's evil
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  and it's craziness
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  and it's neocondishness
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  and it's just
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  total losing the moral high ground
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  begging other countries to strike us first
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  that's exactly what Joel Scousen has been saying
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  the globalist have been trying
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  to maneuver
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  for a long, long,
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  long, long time
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  so
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  that is all coming up
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  so when we return
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  we'll break it all down
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  please do not forget that we are listeners
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  supported without you we will not be here
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  you saw the earlier video at the start of the show
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  where we go to these Trump rallies and 70%
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  of people go woo we love Alex Jones
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  we love Info Wars
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  we wish it was still on air
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  because the news announced I was off air
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  all these dozens and dozens of platforms
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  and people believe it
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  and they don't go to infowars.com
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  or newswars.com
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  but you are the smartest part of the audience
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  and you know how to get the word out
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  so without you they'll
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  win you take action we will win

[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and stronger than ever in many ways
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  because we've got the most hardcore audience
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  ever but we need to expand out to others

[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  music
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.220]  missile has shot down an American drone over the Strait of Hormuz.
[21:38.220 --> 21:40.980]  Iran claimed the drone was above its territory.
[21:40.980 --> 21:44.380]  Trump tweeted that Iran made a big mistake earlier today.
[21:44.380 --> 21:47.140]  This is breaking news.
[21:47.140 --> 21:51.460]  We had the live feeds up on satellite at the White House, so as soon as the president
[21:51.460 --> 21:55.740]  comes out to make an announcement, we'll obviously, we're going to be watching that
[21:55.740 --> 22:02.020]  very closely, we'll obviously cut right to that as this unfolds.
[22:02.020 --> 22:05.580]  I know President Trump told Tucker Carlson that, you know, don't worry, nothing's going
[22:05.580 --> 22:06.700]  to happen with Iran right now.
[22:06.700 --> 22:08.380]  He wants to make a peace deal.
[22:08.380 --> 22:14.340]  But you have Kerry and the Democrats and the neocons bat-channeling, manipulating Iran,
[22:14.340 --> 22:17.740]  telling them to sink ships to the Strait of Hormuz, telling them to be violent towards
[22:17.740 --> 22:22.420]  Trump, and then he'll back down so the nuclear deal can continue on.
[22:22.420 --> 22:24.340]  They want to embarrass Trump.
[22:24.340 --> 22:28.140]  I've said over and over again, a war with Iran is what the globalists want to kill the
[22:28.140 --> 22:31.820]  recovery, suck Russia in, and it may even be a wider war.
[22:31.820 --> 22:36.780]  Iran has sleeper cells all over the Western world.
[22:36.780 --> 22:40.980]  Putin warned that the U.S. military action against Iran would be a catastrophe for the
[22:40.980 --> 22:43.220]  region at a minimum.
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.900]  I agree with that.
[22:44.900 --> 22:52.340]  He added that it would trigger an escalation of hostilities with unpredictable results.
[22:52.340 --> 22:53.900]  So there's your headline.
[22:53.900 --> 23:03.940]  Putin warns that an attack on Iran by the U.S. will be a catastrophe at a minimum.
[23:03.940 --> 23:07.940]  And you've got the DrudgeReport.com siren going, ask if it will strike Iran.
[23:07.940 --> 23:14.500]  Trump says you'll soon find out Pentagon, Trump is operating in international airspace.
[23:14.500 --> 23:17.500]  Oil spikes 6% on this news.
[23:17.500 --> 23:20.660]  It spiked 2% on the sunken tankers.
[23:20.660 --> 23:24.180]  So that shows you this is hell on wheels.
[23:24.180 --> 23:28.900]  You know, I told folks last week this was probably going to war, and they're like, oh, Alex,
[23:28.900 --> 23:30.540]  it'll be like Iraq, it'll be okay.
[23:30.540 --> 23:31.540]  No, it won't.
[23:31.540 --> 23:36.740]  It'll be totally different if that happens.
[23:36.740 --> 23:40.500]  And hasn't Putin been proven right?
[23:40.500 --> 23:48.420]  Remember Putin last week, the day after this report came out that the Pentagon was preparing
[23:48.420 --> 24:00.020]  first strike nuclear attacks, Putin came out and said this could be the end of the world.
[24:00.020 --> 24:01.020]  Here's some of those articles.
[24:01.020 --> 24:08.260]  The U.S. says it won't rule out first nuclear strike because allies wouldn't trust it otherwise.
[24:08.260 --> 24:11.740]  Putin warns of nuclear global catastrophe.
[24:11.740 --> 24:18.100]  Once treaties expire, I thought it was the day after it was the day the Pentagon put
[24:18.100 --> 24:26.900]  this out and then removed it a few days later and reclassified joint publication, 3-72,
[24:26.900 --> 24:31.500]  nuclear operations, 11th of June, 2019.
[24:31.500 --> 24:35.300]  But it's obviously on the way back machine.
[24:35.300 --> 24:39.580]  Something put on the Internet is near impossible to take off the Internet, and it describes
[24:39.580 --> 24:45.260]  the entire doctrine that Hillary wanted and the neocons wanted, the same people, for first
[24:45.260 --> 24:49.540]  strikes on Russia, China, Iran, and others.
[24:49.540 --> 24:54.260]  Total madness because once you have that doctrine, it allows them to first strike you and not
[24:54.260 --> 24:56.540]  be the villains as well.
[24:56.540 --> 24:58.620]  It's the end of chivalry.
[24:58.620 --> 25:00.100]  It's the end of common sense.
[25:00.100 --> 25:01.100]  It's insanity.
[25:01.100 --> 25:04.780]  You know, the sad part about the London Guardian being a well-respected publication in the
[25:04.780 --> 25:10.100]  past is when they publish outright lies against me, they lose credibility when they publish
[25:10.100 --> 25:12.620]  outright lies about Trump.
[25:12.620 --> 25:20.100]  But this article from the Guardian is very, very accurate.
[25:20.100 --> 25:25.380]  Nuclear weapons experts alarmed by New Pentagon war-fighting doctrine, and then it goes through
[25:25.380 --> 25:34.580]  how it is a first strike situation and how dangerous that is and how insane all of that
[25:34.580 --> 25:35.580]  is.
[25:35.580 --> 25:40.220]  We'll be watching and waiting for the president, they say a press conference any time now or
[25:40.220 --> 25:44.100]  in the next hour, they're not being clear, saying sometime in the next hour, very, very
[25:44.100 --> 25:48.580]  soon is what they actually said, we're guessing in the next hour, that the president is preparing
[25:48.580 --> 25:53.860]  to make remarks from the White House on this all-important issue of nuclear war on this
[25:53.860 --> 25:55.860]  planet.
[25:55.860 --> 25:57.940]  The ships get sunk.
[25:57.940 --> 26:00.580]  The Iranians months ago said, if you put sanctions on us, we'll do it.
[26:00.580 --> 26:01.900]  We did it.
[26:01.900 --> 26:05.300]  I say they could be the guys that did it, you know, they're prime suspects, but then evidence
[26:05.300 --> 26:08.140]  comes out staged from people I respect.
[26:08.140 --> 26:14.860]  Remember, the neocons in the deep state, the Democrats are doing treasonous shadow diplomacy
[26:14.860 --> 26:21.380]  and policy, violates the Logan Act, so many other things, giving Iran intel, it's treason
[26:21.380 --> 26:24.140]  on how to deal with Trump.
[26:24.140 --> 26:29.340]  Will they in the world or have a war, a nuclear war, in the name of embarrassing Trump?
[26:29.340 --> 26:33.580]  Well, the New York Times has a big article out and their CEO's gone public against Trump.
[26:33.580 --> 26:39.580]  So is the Wall Street Journal saying Trump's bad because Trump dared say it was treason
[26:39.580 --> 26:48.140]  for the New York Times to lie and say that the U.S. had attacked Russia's power grid
[26:48.140 --> 26:49.140]  when we hadn't.
[26:49.140 --> 26:52.860]  That's an act of war that undermines the United States.
[26:52.860 --> 26:59.540]  That could trigger a Russian response, and it wasn't even true, and if it was, it would
[26:59.540 --> 27:05.860]  be treasonous to leak that information, but now the New York Times is bitching and complaining
[27:05.860 --> 27:06.860]  that Trump's bad.
[27:06.860 --> 27:09.220]  No, you're bad.
[27:09.220 --> 27:13.220]  You're the ones that lie so bad now that it makes my head spin.
[27:13.220 --> 27:18.980]  You're the ones that have said and done things to me personally that are total hoaxes.
[27:18.980 --> 27:26.380]  AP reports I lost a lawsuit over a Sandy Hook book I'm not even in that I've never read
[27:26.380 --> 27:29.380]  and that my name's not on.
[27:29.380 --> 27:33.060]  They say I sent child porn to the to the to the families didn't know such thing.
[27:33.060 --> 27:34.860]  I was sent death threats in email.
[27:34.860 --> 27:39.900]  I didn't open that hidden attachments to what the FBI says is child porn and I'm a victim.
[27:39.900 --> 27:46.620]  But that doesn't stop their lawyers going on TV and defaming me and saying they're probably
[27:46.620 --> 27:52.140]  going to sue me for sending them child porn so they can run the whole headline again when
[27:52.140 --> 27:56.700]  they're the ones that deposed us and asked for those emails and the blaze is like why
[27:56.700 --> 28:03.820]  Jones give them all the emails the judge ordered those emails fifty seven thousand of them including
[28:03.820 --> 28:07.420]  unopened because they have lawyers on the show they're like well you'd never give people
[28:07.420 --> 28:11.140]  unopened emails those don't matter you didn't open them exactly.
[28:11.140 --> 28:15.100]  They asked the judge to order me to open all the attachments.
[28:15.100 --> 28:17.740]  The judge didn't fall for that one.
[28:17.740 --> 28:27.660]  You will order the you will open the attachments so we can put you in jail unbelievable unbelievable
[28:27.660 --> 28:31.180]  we're going to get to the bottom of what's really going on but the point is it shows
[28:31.180 --> 28:38.620]  the climate we're in it shows the insanity we're in it shows how they'll do anything
[28:38.620 --> 28:47.700]  any time they want shows they'll engage in any lie no matter how reckless even call
[28:47.700 --> 28:53.980]  it a war with Russia did the Pentagon somebody inside send that drone that robot over the
[28:53.980 --> 28:59.260]  line trigger war or the Iranians do this precipitously.

[32:16.500 --> 32:22.180]  it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment
[32:22.180 --> 32:26.140]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders
[32:26.140 --> 32:29.780]  were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support
[32:29.780 --> 32:34.060]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[32:34.060 --> 32:37.540]  and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[32:37.540 --> 32:41.580]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[32:41.580 --> 32:46.140]  what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[32:46.140 --> 32:51.300]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[32:51.300 --> 32:54.860]  ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[32:54.860 --> 33:03.140]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[33:03.140 --> 33:31.620]  listening to the alex jones show
[33:31.620 --> 33:39.380]  one day through friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. the most band hated lot about broadcast in
[33:39.380 --> 33:45.780]  the world is live in defiance of everything the enemy to throw against us thanks to you
[33:45.780 --> 33:53.780]  standing firm with us ladies and gentlemen i am alex jones your host thank you so much
[33:53.780 --> 33:59.700]  for joining us well roger stone is a public speaker and has spoken to i think it's safe
[33:59.700 --> 34:08.740]  to say over a thousand groups over the years and he's been a speaker to the nexium group
[34:08.740 --> 34:14.740]  and keith ranier who was just found guilty of sex trafficking and enslaving women devil
[34:14.740 --> 34:19.300]  worship came out trafficking of children hooked under the clinton's all of them and it's
[34:19.300 --> 34:23.900]  also now come out and go over some of these stories that in court in closing arguments
[34:23.900 --> 34:30.180]  that the nexium trial that roger stone was a target that they were trying to infiltrate
[34:30.180 --> 34:34.860]  and control they would use the women to try to get men that they would call in to be consultants
[34:34.860 --> 34:39.540]  or speakers and then they would try to plant key loggers on their computers that they were
[34:39.540 --> 34:43.100]  doing this to the clinton's to the brothamans to others but the clinton's were aware of
[34:43.100 --> 34:49.500]  it and we're doing it back this to me is just a gateway feeder cult into these groups but
[34:49.500 --> 34:54.780]  now that this conviction has happened and now that we've learned last week in in closing
[34:54.780 --> 34:59.580]  arguments that these documents came out in the trial roger's got a clearer picture of
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.460]  exactly what went on mainstream media tried to implicate him in it and then later found
[35:04.460 --> 35:08.220]  of course he wasn't involved any of he was just a famous political speaker that spoke
[35:08.220 --> 35:12.580]  several times to them in new york where he lives part of the year will cut away to the
[35:12.580 --> 35:18.420]  president if he comes out with the press conference asked if we will strike iran says trump says
[35:18.420 --> 35:24.060]  you'll soon find out obviously iran admits to shooting down that drone it's disputed
[35:24.060 --> 35:28.100]  whether it was shot down over iranian airspace or over the street of or moose in the international
[35:28.100 --> 35:32.180]  waters we will be watching that the minute he comes out we will cut to that but roger
[35:32.180 --> 35:38.220]  thanks for coming on the second time breaking your silence to give us a inside view from
[35:38.220 --> 35:46.740]  someone who was a victim or or or or a attempted victim of this now convicted cult leader glad
[35:46.740 --> 35:53.540]  to have the opportunity we've talked about this before as frank parlato who is the crusading
[35:53.540 --> 36:00.020]  journalist who really hammered the cult nexium and ultimately gave the information to the
[36:00.020 --> 36:05.220]  new york times that busted this entire thing wide open has acknowledged i was actually
[36:05.220 --> 36:10.860]  a key actor in bringing the cult down the daily beast insists that i was a member of
[36:10.860 --> 36:18.780]  the cult that is false they contacted me about speaking on their to them in late 2003 by the
[36:18.780 --> 36:25.260]  end of 2004 i was deeply uncomfortable not because i viewed them as sex traffickers
[36:25.260 --> 36:31.180]  in all honesty i saw no evidence of that whatsoever what i saw and what they presented themselves
[36:31.180 --> 36:39.300]  as was a self help course they were charging middle aged housewives a lot of money to take
[36:39.300 --> 36:46.180]  a course to elevate their self-esteem what made me uncomfortable alex was that they were
[36:46.180 --> 36:53.500]  building the wealthy parents of a number of their adherents who i now recognize were under
[36:53.500 --> 37:00.580]  some kind of mind control to transfer literally millions of dollars from their trust funds
[37:00.580 --> 37:08.340]  what i saw keith ranieri running was a financial scam a ponzi scam and i ended up because i
[37:08.340 --> 37:14.580]  asked many questions on their enemies list we now know according to the albany times union
[37:14.580 --> 37:21.620]  they were keeping a file on me along with a number of other prominent people of both parties
[37:21.620 --> 37:28.700]  so i'm glad to have the opportunity to clear clear the air many of the news reports say
[37:28.700 --> 37:35.860]  that keith ranieri referred to himself and his followers referred to him as the smartest
[37:35.860 --> 37:42.100]  man in the world actually that's untrue i hung that title on him i actually was so
[37:42.100 --> 37:48.260]  unimpressed the one time i met him i'd forgotten meeting him i met him one time over a years
[37:48.260 --> 37:54.020]  period in which i was in contact with these people i had been contacted by nancy salsman
[37:54.020 --> 37:59.460]  who was one of the key witnesses against him of course in this trial so i'm glad to have
[37:59.460 --> 38:03.300]  this opportunity to clear the air well roger i'm glad you can come on and talk about it
[38:03.300 --> 38:07.620]  because this is a window into hollywood there's a lot of similar cults to this and they're
[38:07.620 --> 38:12.820]  always run by very unremarkable type individuals and it just shows how dangerous it is as you
[38:12.820 --> 38:17.140]  reported major new york papers uh and it came out in the court hearing are reporting that
[38:17.140 --> 38:21.540]  they were trying to recruit you as a speaker to try to compromise you with some of these women
[38:21.540 --> 38:25.460]  but over dinner i know a few years ago when this first broke you were like well number one i'm
[38:25.460 --> 38:29.140]  married number two they're not very attractive they look they look like they were all starving
[38:29.140 --> 38:33.780]  to death and we now know that was part of the cult was keeping them on very low calories branding
[38:33.780 --> 38:39.140]  them torturing them just and then and then using the women uh like basically he was their pimp
[38:39.140 --> 38:45.620]  to go out and set people up so leftist women rejecting normal husbands normal life you seem
[38:45.620 --> 38:51.380]  to love though being abused it's very sick you know during the time that i was in touch with them i
[38:51.380 --> 38:59.140]  came to know katherine oxenberg the actress a great woman a woman who has suffered incredibly
[38:59.140 --> 39:05.140]  because the cult essentially mind controlled her daughter india and took her away from her family
[39:05.140 --> 39:11.140]  took her away from her mother she's written a terrific book about this awful experience uh and
[39:11.140 --> 39:17.700]  we concluded between us katherine and i and later uh with others who had brushed up against the
[39:17.700 --> 39:24.180]  cult that we were dealing with evil again i never saw any attractive women in fact i never saw any
[39:24.180 --> 39:31.860]  young women uh at the time that i had my brief interface with them all i saw again was a financial
[39:31.860 --> 39:39.460]  scheme uh and uh i never saw the branding or the cult i think that that stuff became more apparent
[39:39.460 --> 39:46.100]  much much later they had no understanding of how our american democracy works they didn't
[39:46.100 --> 39:52.660]  understand the three branches of government they didn't understand anything about how government
[39:52.660 --> 39:59.300]  works um they represented to me that some of their intellectual property and some of their
[39:59.300 --> 40:04.820]  self-help training manuals had been stolen and i kept telling them well then you need to hire a
[40:04.820 --> 40:10.740]  lawyer you don't need a lobbyist you need an attorney a good attorney a number of attorneys
[40:10.740 --> 40:18.420]  that did work for them have been unfairly smeared as i have who who uh reproaches this as a legal
[40:18.820 --> 40:24.340]  sure but but i mean roger we know how these cults operate but but like you said they're so stupid
[40:24.340 --> 40:29.300]  in ways but not in others and what it is is they really go out and look for weak-minded people
[40:29.300 --> 40:33.140]  because they're weak-minded themselves and then they live in these delusional fantasy lands
[40:33.140 --> 40:40.180]  so i liken the nexium cult to hillary uh and to obama and and these other globalists because
[40:40.180 --> 40:45.220]  they put out their homeland show against me and statements of documents show they really believe
[40:45.220 --> 40:50.180]  i'm the homeland character they really believe hillary was going to win uh hillary attacked me
[40:50.180 --> 40:57.060]  yesterday i'm sure you've seen that no connection to reality and they just don't understand it it
[40:57.060 --> 41:02.340]  just seems like they are a cult themselves so of course hillary and shucky schumer and others were
[41:02.340 --> 41:06.980]  quote allies of the cult and interfacing with it just like they were doing with jeffrey epstein
[41:06.980 --> 41:11.140]  just like they were interfacing with any other cult they could why do you think the clinton's
[41:11.140 --> 41:18.020]  particularly and the democrats are always buzzing around like flies around honey cults it's very
[41:18.020 --> 41:23.460]  interesting because there were some very clear ties between nexium uh and the clinton gang in new
[41:23.460 --> 41:29.460]  york uh they were financial supporters of hillary clinton both in her senate race uh and in her
[41:29.460 --> 41:36.340]  presidential campaigns i find that extraordinary extraordinarily curious you know alex you and i
[41:36.340 --> 41:42.740]  are in the same club because hillary attacked me in a tweet only days ago uh of course i'm still
[41:42.740 --> 41:48.740]  facing a seven count criminal indictment by a special counsel robert moeller as you know i
[41:48.740 --> 41:54.260]  have pled not guilty i intend to take that trial in november folks who want to help me by the way
[41:54.260 --> 42:01.620]  can go to stonedefensefund.com i intend to fight to clear my name in the meantime hillary clinton
[42:01.620 --> 42:08.580]  piles on me same way they pile on you and alex i've got to say this most recent smear against you
[42:08.580 --> 42:15.140]  in which people sent you encrypted kitty porn that you couldn't open and didn't open and then when
[42:15.140 --> 42:21.380]  it gets suddenly discovered in a lawsuit against you uh it is imputed to you as if it was yours
[42:21.380 --> 42:26.740]  this is an outrageous smear and i think your lawyer robert barnes did an excellent job of
[42:26.740 --> 42:33.300]  defending you against this outrageous falsehood well we've got the big news of war with iran
[42:33.300 --> 42:39.700]  basically has already begun sunken tankers drone shot down uh trump says they'll pay i want to get
[42:39.700 --> 42:43.780]  your view on donald trump and what you think he's going to do i know you've played a lot of poker
[42:44.500 --> 42:48.740]  with mr bolton and you guys have been longtime friends but i've talked to our other longtime
[42:48.740 --> 42:54.580]  friends who are advising the president they say bolton is a sinister psychotic and is advising
[42:54.580 --> 43:00.420]  trump to perhaps even use nuclear weapons i said that days ago the globalists know
[43:00.420 --> 43:04.340]  that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[43:04.340 --> 43:11.140]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers iq it literally dumps the population down
[43:11.140 --> 43:15.700]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone
[43:15.700 --> 43:21.700]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[43:21.700 --> 43:26.100]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals
[43:26.100 --> 43:31.940]  of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying
[43:31.940 --> 43:37.780]  to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[43:38.580 --> 43:42.740]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[43:42.740 --> 43:49.220]  compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even more
[43:49.220 --> 43:54.820]  bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[43:54.820 --> 44:02.980]  discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot com mike in new jersey you're on the air thanks

[47:21.380 --> 47:22.660]  well i was just talking to the crew
[47:22.660 --> 47:26.820]  and they were saying a lot of folks are waking up
[47:28.740 --> 47:33.060]  numbers show that trump's going to win pretty big 2020 but not if they can launch a new war to
[47:33.060 --> 47:37.060]  embarrass the president and this thing can do a lot more than embarrass the president
[47:37.060 --> 47:41.460]  there's new nuclear doctrines have been issued about first strikes with nuclear weapons i knew
[47:41.460 --> 47:49.380]  that was on the table putin's warning of nuclear war john bolton will get his old friends take
[47:49.380 --> 47:54.740]  roger stone on that in a moment these guys have ranked a lot of scotch put a lot of poker together
[47:55.780 --> 48:00.100]  they're in new york and dc so we'll get his take on this but one of our other mutual friends
[48:00.100 --> 48:03.700]  has been you know publicly trying to get the president not to do this and i've talked to
[48:03.700 --> 48:06.660]  some others that have talked to the president he's like no no no i don't want to do it but now
[48:07.220 --> 48:12.900]  he's sending out messages like he is going to do something cheng iran is in a lot of trouble
[48:12.900 --> 48:16.580]  and really miscalculated we're going to give you all those quotes here's the exact quote from the
[48:16.580 --> 48:22.180]  president said to me paraphrasing it i ran made a very big mistake we'll get roger stone's expert
[48:22.180 --> 48:26.740]  take he's the guy that they admit got trump will build the wall idea and so much more he's known
[48:26.740 --> 48:35.060]  trump 40 plus years 43 years what will el presidente do from his old wingman that's right
[48:35.060 --> 48:39.380]  that's what roger stone really is his trump's old wingman uh nothing nothing to hide there in
[48:39.380 --> 48:44.180]  between divorces they double date girls so we're gonna go to roger in a moment please remember
[48:44.180 --> 48:50.500]  ladies and gentlemen you heard roger talk about how i was sent encrypted hidden child porn in death
[48:50.500 --> 48:58.660]  threats about sandy hook that i never opened then they subpoenaed dozens of search terms of
[48:58.660 --> 49:02.660]  everybody involved with sandy hook we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars going through
[49:02.660 --> 49:07.380]  nine point six million emails that's how much it costs and notice these law firms are still saying
[49:07.380 --> 49:12.420]  we may feel shoe jones or whatever he sent us child porn so we spent hundreds of thousands of
[49:12.420 --> 49:16.900]  dollars with two law firms and teams of people to go through nine point six million emails
[49:18.260 --> 49:20.980]  and they go to the judge and they say we want him to open every attachment
[49:21.780 --> 49:27.060]  of nine point six million emails well that's illegal the judge even got that because what if
[49:27.060 --> 49:32.820]  there is child porn that's a crime and big media organizations are sent this stuff and so we
[49:33.860 --> 49:38.900]  didn't do that now they sent it to a california firm that scanned it and found they had links
[49:38.900 --> 49:44.820]  and they run the headlines everywhere that i sent them child porn and then they say i'm defaming
[49:44.820 --> 49:48.740]  them when i got pissed off and said i'm gonna find out who's trying to set me up and i want to see
[49:48.740 --> 49:53.220]  him go to prison and then they said oh you're blaming the lawyers for it no i didn't do that
[49:54.420 --> 50:00.260]  but what's the old shakespeare saying i just think you protest too much no i don't think they're
[50:00.260 --> 50:05.140]  dumb enough to do that you think i'm dumb enough to send you child porn you maniacs what the hell
[50:05.140 --> 50:09.700]  excuse me i'm starting to get mad excuse me lord the fact that they will we're gonna go to roger
[50:09.700 --> 50:12.980]  here in a moment the fact that they will go this far is insane so we'll finish up with that and get

[51:50.900 --> 51:56.340]  incredible hoax uh that i wrote a book about sandy hook that i lost a lawsuit last week totally
[51:56.340 --> 52:01.220]  fake i'm not even in the book never read the book not on the name of the book uh jim fetzer is a
[52:01.220 --> 52:07.300]  professor uh just the lies that's an ap by the way they refuse to retract what do you
[52:07.300 --> 52:13.060]  think's really going on here then let's talk about bolton and the whole situation well we're now in
[52:13.060 --> 52:20.180]  this this realm where facts and truth and evidence really don't matter on in so many media outlets so
[52:20.180 --> 52:28.180]  many uh uh so supposed news organizations falsehoods are not only reported but then they're recycled
[52:28.180 --> 52:35.540]  again and again and again and you can provide them with ironclad documentation that what they're
[52:35.540 --> 52:43.220]  reporting is false and they simply refuse to correct or retract politico among the worst uh the
[52:43.220 --> 52:50.340]  new york times pathetic the washington post the absolute worst so uh i've experienced exactly
[52:50.340 --> 52:56.180]  what you're going through here and it's very very frustrating but we're in this realm in which the
[52:56.180 --> 53:03.940]  fake news media led by cnn msnbc the washington post and others no longer have any journalistic
[53:03.940 --> 53:11.380]  ethics or rules they will write total fiction if they want to and no amount of your cooperation
[53:11.380 --> 53:17.540]  and providing them with with documentation that they are wrong will change their narrative and by
[53:17.540 --> 53:23.220]  the way it's critical you just said that because the young turks retracted uh Shapiro retracted
[53:23.220 --> 53:27.860]  hundreds of others retracted when our lawyers contacted them bob and others but it was the
[53:27.860 --> 53:32.900]  wall street journal the new york times and the ap that led with the fraud to teach others to engage
[53:32.900 --> 53:37.700]  in fraud they're doing this consciously roger no there's no question the law i should mention the
[53:37.700 --> 53:43.140]  wall street journal particularly the worst a reporter there shall be holiday literally the
[53:43.140 --> 53:50.340]  single most duplicitous dishonest crooked fixed reporter probably working in media today although
[53:50.340 --> 53:56.980]  it'd be a contest i could name others uh and let's let's talk very quickly about um the countries
[53:56.980 --> 54:02.660]  moving towards the brink of war alex i want to be very clear i'm opposed to war with iran i think
[54:02.660 --> 54:08.900]  it would be an enormous mistake uh i don't have the benefit of the intelligence that the president
[54:08.900 --> 54:16.180]  does have but i fear that bolton and pompeo are trying to walk him towards yet another foreign
[54:16.180 --> 54:23.540]  war and this gives me grave pause i really i trust the president i hope that he will uh view all of
[54:23.540 --> 54:31.780]  the intelligence with a skeptical eye we have seen the deep state create false flag operations
[54:31.780 --> 54:39.220]  in the past try to inch us towards war or in many cases to keep our troops in syria the fake gas
[54:39.220 --> 54:45.220]  attacks that they now even admit were faked uh being a perfect example i pray we are not headed
[54:45.220 --> 54:50.580]  to a war at iran i really do well since you just said that they handed me a piece of paper as you
[54:50.580 --> 54:56.660]  were speaking this is really good news cbs news reports us drone shot down trump says he believes
[54:56.660 --> 55:02.340]  strike by iran was not intentional uh obviously trump wants a peace deal he was getting close to
[55:02.340 --> 55:07.460]  one of the two tankers sank uh and that's still questionable but why would iran do that it's
[55:07.460 --> 55:13.540]  insane and now he's saying he doesn't think it was intentional uh well uh the iranians said
[55:14.660 --> 55:19.940]  that it was over their airspace they admit they did it so it looks like he either knows they've
[55:19.940 --> 55:26.580]  made a deal and shadow diplomacy with the deep state carry uh the clinton's obama and the neocons
[55:27.700 --> 55:33.620]  like the ship attacks in this or it means something else what do you think this means roger well
[55:33.620 --> 55:38.180]  you know it's difficult to sort out at this point alex but i do want to point out that
[55:38.180 --> 55:45.460]  down front was elected as a non-interventionist uh and you can see that some around him including
[55:45.460 --> 55:50.180]  bolton who i think is a very smart guy and who i would like to give the benefit of the doubt that
[55:50.180 --> 55:57.460]  he would reflect the views of his boss but he has seemed to me to be increasingly bellicose uh
[55:58.420 --> 56:05.220]  exceedingly aggressive in times turns in terms of walking the nation towards yet another foreign
[56:05.220 --> 56:12.340]  war i pray the president doesn't go there on the other hand i trust his judgment he is uh uh
[56:12.340 --> 56:18.260]  he has available to him intelligence that we do not have i hope people look at it with some degree
[56:18.260 --> 56:24.260]  of skepticism because we do know that the deep state will pass on to the chief executive things
[56:24.260 --> 56:32.100]  that aren't true or that are colored uh we do not need yet another foreign war what we what we need
[56:32.100 --> 56:38.740]  is peace but peace through strength and you've got a leader now who understands the leveraging
[56:38.740 --> 56:46.020]  america's strength to get peace as opposed to launching endless foreign war it costs us billions
[56:46.020 --> 56:50.580]  in american blood well without no reason i totally agree roger i want to do five more
[56:50.580 --> 56:54.580]  minutes that you got to go catch an airplane on what what else you think they might throw a
[56:54.580 --> 56:58.980]  trump but but it's really starting to become clear that the tankers probably were a false flag
[56:58.980 --> 57:02.900]  even though i ran threatened to do it it's becoming increasingly clear that there's some
[57:02.900 --> 57:09.220]  hanky-panky going on here by how the president's responding not letting it suck him into war uh
[57:09.220 --> 57:15.060]  but he also did threaten iran and said you made a big mistake uh but now he's reversing that i
[57:15.060 --> 57:19.460]  guess as he's learning more he supposedly was going to give a press conference sometime in the
[57:19.460 --> 57:24.660]  next hour that was 30 minutes ago we have jose calvin joining us world affairs brief very smart
[57:24.660 --> 57:28.820]  cookie uh at the bottom of the next hour as soon as trump gives a press conference you better believe

[59:55.060 --> 01:00:10.980]  jones show
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:20.980]  you
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.740]  john bolton's trying to start a war he won't just keep trump from getting reelected in my view
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.900]  he could turn to a larger regional war hooten says it'll be a catastrophe at the bare minimum
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.380]  and says the world can end he said at the same day there's a new nuclear doctrine
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:42.100]  and for the united states preemptively nuke nations will be looking at that classified
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:48.500]  document it's classified coming up in the next segment yes ladies and gentlemen tomorrow's news
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.300]  today uh better believe putin saw it that day and that's why he issued that emergency statement
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.180]  so but putin is so deferential to the united states he didn't even say where he got the
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:04.580]  information that he had the classified document uh so uh roger what can we do to keep trump from
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:10.580]  not being suckered into this new war well i think the best thing we can do is is do exactly what we
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:16.740]  had been doing which is to urge him to proceed with extreme caution and to recognize that some
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:23.380]  around him are not necessarily committed to his reform agenda particularly when it comes to the
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:30.100]  foreign policy realm i've always been uncomfortable with the disproportionate number of neocons that
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:36.500]  he has chosen to surround himself with these are people who did not vote for him and do not support
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:42.180]  his foreign policies goals which of course are putting america first best thing we can do right
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:49.460]  now alex uh is pray i want to get back to what we had talked about because in the 40 years that i've
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:56.020]  been in american politics i've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:03.940]  facts and truth and evidence no longer matters i have been subjected to this myself uh but i've
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:09.620]  never seen anything quite like the situation in which you have recently been smeared the false
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:18.500]  claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the sandy hook plaintiffs uh is ludicrous as well as
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:26.180]  false it's a smear uh somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it uh it ends
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:32.340]  up uh swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:39.540]  kafka esk this is bizarre uh but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say jones sent
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:44.900]  kitty porn is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:50.100]  commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but i wonder where the big boys where's
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:55.460]  the wall street journal where's associated press when are they going to report that they made a
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:01.780]  mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate it's outrageous well that's what's incredible is
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:06.660]  they're leading in it trying to get everybody else to do it and like i said saying i published
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:11.140]  books i never published i lost lawsuits i never lost and then we contact him and they just tell
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:16.660]  our lawyers find sues we're going to go with fake headlines this is a new level i think it signifies
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:21.300]  the climate of instead of dialing their lives back they're just going to dial their lives up
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.740]  to try to take trump out and it's why i think it continues to be important for people to support
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:32.980]  info wars by either going to the enforce dot com store or making a contribution at the donate link
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:38.180]  just like i urge people to go to stone defense fund dot com how it's we are both fighting
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.900]  for our lives and the same tactics that have been used against me by the mainstream media
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:49.380]  are now being used against you is it coincidental that both of us played a key role in the nomination
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:55.300]  and therefore the ultimate election of down from i think not so we both need your help and i urge
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:01.460]  folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars roger god bless you we'll talk to you soon
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:06.260]  roger stone did nothing wrong alex jones did nothing wrong all we did was reignite the brush

[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:20.340]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:29.780]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:37.060]  president trump says iran made a big mistake by shooting down one of our predator drones
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:45.460]  hooten warns of a global nuclear catastrophe we now know why we have a classified u.s government
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:53.220]  document that confirms real that details the u.s preparing for first strike nuclear war against
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:07:03.620]  china russia iran and others yes this is the stuff armageddon's made of first let's go to this rt
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:10.980]  report to get the russian perspective here is the story that all americans should know about
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:19.220]  and be questioning and i mean with a vengeance okay the u.s is actively planning to carry out
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:28.020]  a tactical assault on iran in response to the tanker attack in the persian gulf this story
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:35.780]  first reported in israel comes from multiple sources inside the united nations it describes the
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:44.260]  military actions being considered as an aerial bombing of iran's nuclear facilities the bombing
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:52.100]  according to the sources will be massive but limited to a specific set of targets
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:08:01.140]  who is pushing this this plan this attack this bombing of iran even more so than military officials
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:10.740]  secretary of state mike pompeo who we have learned has recently traveled to sent com central
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:17.700]  command headquarters in tampa florida to meet with u.s generals there to map this whole thing out
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:24.980]  the trip squarely puts pompeo out of his jurisdiction but he is said to be getting
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:32.340]  cart blotch from president trump despite some pushback from military commanders interestingly
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:41.380]  enough also interesting is as far as the u.s news media are concerned pompeo can do no wrong
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:49.940]  he gets cover from them it seems simply because well because he's not president trump who they love
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:59.140]  but even a cursory look at pompeo's record and his past reveals a man who may not be
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:08.500]  uh may not be a real prime time player when it comes to foreign policy he is actually a man
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:18.260]  who has no problems lying cheating and stealing you know in fact who is accusing mike pompeo of
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:26.660]  lying cheating and stealing i was a ci director we lied we cheated we steal stole it's like we
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:39.700]  had went entire we had entire training courses did you hear that the cia is an organization
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:48.580]  under his command that lies cheats and steals and it is a joke let me play that for you again
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:57.460]  i was a ci director we lied we cheated we steal stole it's like we had went entire we had entire
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:04.580]  training courses so how do we know then that the comments he just made this week about needing
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:11.060]  to attack iran because they were talking tankers is not another lie or cheating or stealing how do
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:19.780]  we know most of you who watch this channel don't need mike pompeo to tell you some of these things
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:26.180]  you probably already knew that but but as we learned that he is drawing up plans literally
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:36.020]  drawing up plans to attack iran it is my job and yours to be mindful of what may be about to happen
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:44.660]  based if nothing else on what's happened in the past because as americans it's not you're right
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:52.900]  to know what's going on it's your responsibility this is the news with rick sanchez where we believe
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:59.540]  it is time to do news again iranians are saying that this drone violated iranian airspace early
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:04.260]  this morning and was then shot down somewhere south of the straight of poor moves the iranians also
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:09.060]  came out just a couple of minutes ago we just got this saying that the drone also masqueraded
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.820]  what they call its identification equipment so they're saying that it essentially
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:17.860]  shut off whatever transponding equipment was on it now the u.s has a very different take on what
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:22.980]  happened as you mentioned the u.s says that the drone was shot down over international airspace in
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:27.540]  the straight of poor moods and the u.s just coming out also a couple of minutes ago with a
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:33.460]  short statement saying that the u.s did not fly any aircraft over iranian airspace on thursday
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.620]  that is of course today but you're absolutely right the iranians very angry about this drawing
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.260]  a red line this is what the commander of the iranian revolutionary guard corps had to say let's
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:52.420]  listen in we have no intention to fight with any countries but we are completely ready for war
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.260]  what happened today was an obvious sign of this accurate message
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:06.420]  so there you have it the iranian saying this was a clear message to the united states all of this
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:11.860]  of course coming guys as the tensions between iran and the u.s have continued to flare up over
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:17.140]  the past week since those two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman the u.s blaming the iranians
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.460]  the iranians saying it wasn't them and one of the things you guys might recall is that after
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.780]  that incident took place the u.s said that around that time the iranians had also tried
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.900]  to fire or did fire at a u.s drone that was flying over the area they say that time they had
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:36.980]  missed the drone so as you can see those tensions still very very much flaring up as both sides say
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:41.540]  they don't want this to escalate into a shooting war but the iranians clearly saying they are
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:48.580]  prepared for a war so here's the reality here's the facts here's the takeaway that you cannot
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:59.140]  get away from the united states is in a war with iran right now there's been a cold war going on
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:06.020]  with them since 1979 in the islamic revolution putin is warning the united states that a strike
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:13.700]  on iran if it goes well will be a catastrophe well prices are up over six percent as we speak
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:19.780]  we don't know who sunk the oil tankers we don't know who attacked the other 10 oil tankers we
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:26.660]  don't know exactly who's shooting the missiles out of iranian controlled territory in different
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:32.820]  nations that they have Shiite presence in but we do know iran's taking credit for shooting
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:38.660]  down this drone very provocative was it really over their airspace was it in the straight of
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:44.820]  hormuz joe scousins a former naval aviator best-selling author researcher comes from a famous
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:51.540]  family that helped raise the alarm on the new world order first klingon scousen he's almost
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:58.340]  always right and he's going to give us the inside take and baseball on this when he joins us at the
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:03.460]  bottom of the hour i'm going to go to break and i'm going to come back and get into the new nuclear
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:07.860]  doctrine oh i think this is so serious and what putin has said and what others have said on the
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:14.340]  other side a very important segment but people are so used to us attacking you know iraq are going
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:22.660]  into syria or going into afghanistan or you know some other place like panama in the late 80s this
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:29.700]  is not that okay this will be a big war they've got proxy troops inside the us and other countries
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:34.100]  it's not going to be pretty of a real war kicks off and so get ready for that and our borders are
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:40.340]  collapsing our economy will go sideways this will not be popular but the neocons the globalists are
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.420]  clearly trying to orchestrate it into this that bracket i'm sure he's a smart gal of different
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:50.180]  view he's hosting fourth hour but i agree with ron paul i agree with tucker carlsson
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.900]  and i agree with ran paul and i agree with joe scousin and i agree with myself that this is not
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:03.220]  a good idea and smells like a trap looks like a trap walks like a trap if it does all that chances
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.380]  are you walk up in the woods there's a big bear trap you only stick your leg in to find out if it

[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:01.540]  in the tricom so go to infowarsstore.com it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:06.420]  arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:11.140]  of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:15.460]  by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:21.220]  independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.620]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.100]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.940]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.940]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:43.300]  been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:47.860]  hear and the infowars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.940]  founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:57.540]  been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:13.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:34.100]  i'm alex jones your host thank you for joining us this is music that i'm playing to be ominous
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:39.140]  on purpose to get people's attention that's air raid sirens that's what she'll hear
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:45.780]  for about 10 minutes when the icbms are up in space about to come in over major cities and have
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:51.940]  their nose cones pop open on reentry and deliver their payload of thermal nuclear weapons
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:21:00.740]  yes ladies and gentlemen that's what we're talking about we now know why vladimir putin came out
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:08.100]  last week on the 11th the day this happened and issued an emergency warning of nuclear war
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.660]  with the united states and the end of civilization as we know it here's the info wars dot com
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.420]  headlines that no one seemed to pay attention to even the russian news barely mentioned it
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:25.540]  putin warns of nuclear global catastrophe once treaties expire in 2021 and says the united
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:32.580]  states it doesn't even talk to russia anymore about nuclear weapons or policy and that it's
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:39.540]  unprecedented and that it's very very dangerous today putin said the u.s military action against
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:44.980]  iran would be catastrophic for the region at a minimum he had to trigger an escalation of
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:53.460]  hostilities of unpredictable types like world war three there's another report u.s says it won't
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:22:02.260]  rule out nuclear first strike because allies wouldn't trust it otherwise very very provocative
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:08.580]  and now we know i i already knew about this but i wasn't ready to talk about it the tucker carlson
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:13.460]  talks to the president every day and the deep state listens to it with extreme anger that's why
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:18.740]  tuckers had to leave to an undisclosed location and i'll leave it at that probably already
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:24.420]  said too much but that's how serious all of this is and there's only a few people advising the
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:29.380]  president that he's being set up by the neocons but he agrees with tucker and others and i've
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:34.100]  talked to two people that were very close to these discussions i'll leave it at that i'll leave it at
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:42.580]  that two people one of which was involved in the discussions this is very serious now what are we
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:48.340]  talking about you see this doctrine right here this is first strike doctrine hillary and obama
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:54.180]  admitted this was classified they changed this somewhere around six years ago to have a first
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:00.340]  strike on russia or china or iran or others this was leaked out in the press and that the pentagon
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:06.660]  was considering using smaller tactical nuclear weapons which i'm not against using if somebody
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:12.740]  attacks us that way you don't go to full scale war but you start putting in intercontinental ballistic
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:16.980]  missiles or you are submarine launch missiles where they can't tell if it's a tactical nuke or a full
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.060]  powered nuke or they can't tell if it's just a regular supersonic missile that's what putin said
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:27.780]  they're forced to respond you have a bad actor on a high tech submarine fire a missile that you
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:34.260]  believe the state actor and it's somebody like specter somebody like a leftist arm of the cia or
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:39.460]  israel or saudi arabia or somebody else all these countries do false flags but nuclear operations
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:45.540]  joint publication three dash seven two was released it's been developed in the last year
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:52.020]  was really already in place for six years according to my intel and leaks but now it's official
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:58.580]  policy it was out for one day putin responded they pulled it we were able to get it from
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.940]  the google archive it's not been taken down and it's all the doctrines we've heard before
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:12.180]  from the 1960s from this man who was the basis of stanley cubrick's film doctor strange love
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:19.700]  based on dr con nuclear weapons experts alarmed by new pentagon war fighting doctor and london
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.780]  guardian and again i don't just read this because i agree with the guardian on a regular basis this
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.340]  is accurate info the guardian can also lie so be careful the pentagon believes using nuclear
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:34.340]  weapons could create conditions for decisive results as the restoration of strategic stability
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:38.740]  oh yes real stability out of threatening to use weapons first according to a new nuclear
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.780]  doctrine adopted by the u.s joint jesus staff last week the document entails nuclear operations
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:48.180]  which was published on june 11th and was the first such doctrine paper in 14 years
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:56.180]  arms control experts say it marks a shift in u.s military thinking towards the idea
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:01.780]  of fighting and winning a nuclear war which is called total mental insanity which they believe
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:07.620]  is a highly dangerous mindset which does galzin has been warning on this show for over 15 years
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:12.420]  is their plan to set us up we'll talk about it next segment using nuclear weapons this is from
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:19.300]  the document could create conditions for decisive results and the restoration of strategic stability
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.700]  and also kill a few billion people the joint chief's document says specifically the use of
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:29.300]  nuclear weapons will fundamentally change the scope of battle and create conditions that affect how
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:34.340]  commanders will prevail in a conflict at the start of the chapter on nuclear planning and
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:42.260]  targeting the document quotes a cold war theorist herman kahn is saying my guess is that nuclear
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:46.580]  weapons will be used sometime the next hundred years but that they're used as much more likely
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:52.340]  to be small and limited and widespread and unconstrained kahn was a controversial figure
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:58.340]  he argued that a nuclear war could be oneable and is reported to have provided part of the
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:03.060]  inspiration for stanley cubrick's film dr strange love the nuclear operations document was taken
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:09.300]  down from the pentagon online site last week and is now only available through a restricted access
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:17.140]  electronic library but before it was withdrawn it was downloaded by steven aftergood who
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.500]  directs the project on government security for the federation of american scientists
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:26.580]  and it just goes on from there they always do this where they put out a document and then remove it
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:33.300]  and it's a tactic so they can try to deny it later but have it as a threat so we'll get into
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:39.780]  why has this been issued why are they saying this you talk about major escalation you talk about
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:44.900]  baby out with the bathwater you talk about giving countries an excuse to build up weapons against us
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:52.340]  and then use them first with the globalists have all their secret weapons all their super deep bases
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:58.180]  all their underwater facilities all their international facilities and this is how they
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:04.500]  want to win the world war the final world government war it because i think they're
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.140]  going to take out the chinese and the russians at the same time if they try this
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.700]  scowls and thinks we might take out the russians first and then the chinese next
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:17.540]  but again it'll be the globalist doing it it'll be the globalist doing it and then out of this
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:23.780]  will be heard and reorganized america taking over the remnants of the ui i'm not sure but
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.500]  they've got major geopolitical plans on this and their world government plan hadn't been going too
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.380]  well so it's madness it's insanity it comes right out of the chicago business school
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:39.780]  scrowlzian economics it comes right out of the neocons who are power mad trotskyites these people
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:45.620]  are just evil this is the satanic delusions of power and you look at the sunken tankers
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:50.260]  and now the drone and then trump signaling oh you're in a lot of trouble i ran earlier
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:54.100]  you'll you'll you'll regret this and now sing oh i think it was an accident when i ran says
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:58.500]  they shot it down that shows trump was starting to be manipulated and i think figured out
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:03.380]  that it was quote not not intentional what was intentional he's giving them a way out of this
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:08.420]  but the iranians are talking to deep staters who've got another agenda that's all the different
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:15.300]  angles that we're gonna walk through this is real thinking man and woman's radio not orange man bad
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:22.100]  or orange man good or hillary good hillary bad that's not what we're dealing with we're dealing
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:28.020]  with the real world and powerful interests that want global domination and that are trying to
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:32.820]  basically derail the trump administration with a war and i think that's really the main target is
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:38.740]  nationalist and patriot groups around the world the e you the globalist have said if you try to
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:44.660]  remove our world government we'll launch a new war we'll have a world war their answer is let us
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:49.540]  have world government will stop war then they'll carry out their individual war on the family
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:55.620]  on christians on everything good because they are a satanic system they're mark of the beast their

[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:03.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:14.500]  so
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:27.540]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:40.180]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:53.460]  well fitting music very dramatic times hooten came out last week on the 11th and said that
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:34:02.500]  the world is facing thermonuclear catastrophe he came back out today
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:11.300]  and said that any iran strike even if it went well would be a catastrophe and perhaps worse
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:18.100]  and now we know why there's a nuclear operations that was published only for a few days last week
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:24.020]  on june 11th talking about first strikes till scousons warned about this for a long time
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.740]  and how the globalists are trying to manipulate china and russia into a first strike we're going
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:33.540]  to be talking about that but first we're going to go over because the former naval aviator from
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:40.660]  vietnam era and of course as an expert on this and the head editor of world affairs brief dot
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:45.060]  com this has pretty much been going the way he predicted it now most experts agree the attacks
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.060]  on tankers were false flags could have even been people inside the regime working with
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.540]  the neocons and the shadow diplomacy of carrie this is all getting very very sophisticated
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:01.220]  with a lot of parts now you have this drone predator drone shot down and trump first said
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:05.540]  you're in a lot of trouble you'll regret this now he says oh he thinks it was inadvertent it was an
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:10.260]  accident but the iranians have taken credit so trump definitely doesn't want this to happen
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:14.500]  we know tucker carlson and others are the very few that talk to him daily that are advising him
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:22.180]  not to tucker carlson called bolton sinister and i've talked to others that talk to the president
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:26.980]  that say that he's a madman who does he really work for what's really happening there's a lot
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:32.580]  to cover here with the current things that are developing joel obviously but then the larger
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:37.620]  picture so how do you want to take this how do you want to break this down well first of all
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:44.580]  alex i want to explain that i think this is exactly what the us wanted you know they've got
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:51.620]  satellite imagery constantly over iran they know exactly where the military facilities are now there
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:57.700]  are these mobile missiles like the s200 system or the indigenous form of that that iran has developed
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:02.580]  the shot down this global hawk first of all i want to make a point is that you cannot tell
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:09.220]  from radar and from the air the difference between a reaper drone and a global hawk and so iran
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:13.060]  doesn't know whether or not these things are armed whether or not there are surveillance the us is
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:17.060]  trying to make the case this is an innocent surveillance but remember i think this is an
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:23.620]  open provocation to iran they know that iran has a lot of hothead type military people and that's
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:28.660]  why iran keeps trying to say yeah bring it on we're not going to start this war but if you start
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.980]  this war you're going to regret it there's a lot of hotheads in iran and i think the us is
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:41.140]  betting on that by throwing up global hawks or reapers uh near the 12-mile limit and testing
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:47.220]  that remember that the global hawk can see out to a hundred miles on either side they don't have to
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:52.580]  be over iran in order to photograph so there's no need for them to get that close that's right
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:57.540]  but i think that if you saw the digital track of this global hawk they would skirt the border
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:02.900]  they're trying to induce a strike they wanted to take this to the president and say look they shot
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:08.260]  down one of our our unarmed drones and of course the president made a big deal about that they're
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:14.740]  unarmed and if they were if we did or that unmanned if they were a man boy it would be a different
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:22.340]  story uh he did throw up that this might have been a mistake i don't think it's a mistake um i think
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:27.380]  this was a a knowing provocation by the us trying to get close to the border to induce a strike they
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:33.620]  did it with a reaper drone that was over the uh damaged tanker that they tried to blame on iran
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:41.220]  this is exactly what the us wants and i think it's going to lead to a um a military response
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:46.820]  i think that's what the briefing today at 3 p.m eastern time is with the bipartisan commission
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:51.940]  there in the white house in the situation room uh the fact that it's in the situation room means
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:58.100]  that they're going to break them on a military response well that's exactly what i thought when
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:02.740]  i saw this this morning and i was saying predator right global hawk even more advanced is that it
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:10.180]  can see so far up to 100 miles why was it right up against uh the line uh with iranian territory
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:15.060]  and that's clearly easy for the neocons and others to try to then get a response out of
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:19.220]  iran to again put pressure on trump who's shown that he wants to make a peace deal
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:22.900]  when abba went there in other ways but it appears that they're going to continue
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:28.260]  to push until the president does do something in hindsight a week later joel do we have any
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:34.980]  more intel on what really happened with those two tankers well the us uh had a show and tell
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:42.740]  for media on the um um on the courageous tanker and uh to show them you know once again they don't
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:48.100]  ask them my questions you know why put a mine above the water line if you want to sink a tank
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:53.460]  this is a clear sign of a false flag operation you want to damage the tanker but you don't want to
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:59.300]  sink it and so you put the mine on top of the water line and that's just not how a military
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:03.940]  operation if ran really wanted to sink the tanker they would have put it below the water line
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:08.980]  but that's not what happened and so this really looks more and more like a false flag operation
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:13.700]  there really isn't anything more to know other than the fact that the japanese tanker company
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:18.900]  is demanding the us provide proof that aran did this they are not on board blaming aran for this
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:25.620]  because their crew clearly saw uh missiles coming above water line and hitting the tanker joel let's
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.100]  look at this big picture when we come back but the few minutes we have here i know for the fact
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.060]  that we can get messages the president i'm not bragging it's why they want to get us off the
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:36.980]  air so much why they hate us that's why tucker carlson doesn't even live in dc anymore i'm not
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:40.820]  going to get any more details but he has to protect himself and his family they're coming after
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:44.740]  everybody that has access to the president who can even get any messages but but i know
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:48.980]  folks from the white house do listen that are good what would you like to advise the president
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:54.420]  who does listen to our guest uh he likes to take in a lot of ideas about what he should do to contain
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:40:01.540]  this and not have deep staters continue to stage these events well the primary thing is to resist
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:06.660]  the solutions which they're going to present to the president i mean they when the when the president
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:10.420]  says they made a big mistake in other words i'm going to do something about it he's laying himself
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:15.300]  wide open for a military option and what that military option is probably going to be is to send
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:22.020]  a cruise missile into some uh missile bases some some of their assets that are used to shut down
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:28.020]  or shoot down uh aircraft what they're really trying to do is get iran knowing that it's a
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:34.580]  hothead regime get iran to respond and to attack some american asset that's what they're trying to
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:40.100]  do so this first stage of military response is going to be something to a small bloody nose i
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:43.860]  don't think it's going to be the attack on the nuclear reactor i think they're going to lead that
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:49.300]  to israel this is going to be a tack on a small military mobile missile unit just to show you
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:54.500]  take one of the missiles and this is what you what you get several military experts on fox news set
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:41:00.100]  as much today and i think that's where they're going to remember it's not just tit for tat it is to
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:07.620]  try to get iran to respond and retaliate against us that can justify a full-scale war that's where
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:13.780]  we're headed looking at the players is it the neocons you think driving this a b how do the
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:18.980]  back channel carry democrat hillary access what do you think they're telling the moolas
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:28.660]  i don't know if the moolas really trust anybody in the democrats um you know there's
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:34.740]  there's one very anti-war democrat a lady who's been very very outspoken about the
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:43.220]  the disaster it would be to to attack iran but clearly it's the same globalist neocons
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.620]  that have been thriving all of these various wars in iraq i mean look at what vice president
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:52.900]  pent said at the military academy he says i can absolutely guarantee that you're going to go to
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:58.580]  war to the graduating class whether it's in afghanistan or iraq or syria or lebanon in
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:04.820]  russia or china i mean he named them all this is very very disturbing that the vice president you
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:09.780]  know is not trying to preach a doctrine of peace in the world but is preaching a war
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:15.300]  mongering doctrine basic is that being done out of the neocon ethos that they have a right to rule
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:20.180]  which they talk about ruling reality being histories actors or is it something deeper
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:24.900]  when we come back the real spirit of this thing because it's one thing to have a secret doctrine
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:30.100]  for for for first strike it's another thing to put the first that that doctrine out very provocative
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:35.940]  you have you have really hammered on this subject i wouldn't say harped on it because you've been
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:42.820]  very calm and eloquent but you've you've really noted this and now it seems that your world view on
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:46.900]  the long-term plans the globalist is coming through i mean you've been saying for 15 years
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.660]  you believe by 2025 they want to trick a first strike by russia and china we're only a few years
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:43:00.820]  away from that now please stay with us i just want listeners understand money is what allows us to
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:05.460]  beat this and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.580]  50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:15.140]  dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:19.460]  hundred thousand dollars or something and you get 20 000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.060]  the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:28.020]  dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just been a standstill
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.900]  the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and labored on this i like
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.420]  to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:41.140]  why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:46.260]  never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:50.580]  then they're really going to plant child porn on us then they're going to kill me or you or anybody
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.420]  else i mean the democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:44:01.300]  in the chai com so go to info war store dot com what you have witnessed is the biggest development

[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:27.140]  we've been in so many wars like iraq and afghanistan that are terrible and kill a lot of people
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:34.420]  but i would call them low intensity compared to this iraq could trigger a lot of big things
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.420]  and in the next segment after this one i have told us time i want to get this really expert
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:44.100]  geopolitical view on the brakes the way this could go if it goes well it's a catastrophe i agree with
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:50.180]  putin because bad it's could be end of civilization but i wanted to ask joel scowson about this
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:54.580]  military doctrine i started reading about this office from the 60s it was never adopted from
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:59.300]  what i know i know you've studied all the pdds and directives that are public and have a lot of
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:05.620]  deep sources uh but i i had seen that under obama they they changed some of this to a first strike
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.500]  capability and hillary talked about it and the first strike policy he have ordered they at least
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:17.060]  had it on the drawing boards like plan r uh from dr strange love but now to put out joint
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:22.260]  publication three dash seven two nuclear operations to put it out a few days then reclassify it
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.740]  we know they they tend to do this i guess to scare adversaries and have plausible deniability
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:34.180]  later how big a deal is this and what does this signify because you've been warning that this
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:40.180]  posture in the future would be the telltale sign uh to uh basically induce our enemies to attack us
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:45.860]  you also said a policy of saying we would absorb a strike would induce them but but but this policy
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:51.060]  also i think opens the door for people to strike us saying well you said first strikes are okay
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:57.540]  what is really happening here well the name of the game is provocation uh the angle american
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:03.940]  establishment of the globalists as we call it uh very deeply involved in a conspiracy to get the
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:09.860]  united states into a militarized global government to do that they need a war a major nuclear war
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:15.540]  to scare the people otherwise with the anti-globalist sentiment around the world with brexit i mean
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:19.860]  we're talking about almost half of the people really don't want to they've seen what happened
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:24.500]  to england and in the european union they don't want the same but i'll tell you if you absorb
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:29.060]  a nuclear first strike and you start a war with russia and china it's going to drive everyone
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:33.540]  into a global militarized global government in order to protect ourselves that's their
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:40.900]  modus operandi but in the interim period there's a lot of of other agendas going on one of those
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:46.420]  agendas is to create chaos in the middle east so to create a wave of refugees that will descend
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:52.020]  upon europe and destroy western culture and we're seeing that happen that's the same play they're
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:58.340]  making here with the flood of invasion refugees not only to change western culture because the
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:04.100]  latino culture isn't that far apart from western culture being christian based and oriented but
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:08.740]  it certainly will increase democrat make a permanent democratic majority where we lose
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:15.140]  our liberty through raw democracy that's their agenda with the invasion in america but the big
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:21.540]  agenda that they need to induce a russian and chinese military strike on america is to create
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:27.060]  the image of the us as the bully of the world and i'll tell you this strike on a ran when it comes
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:32.900]  to this war is is coming i'm telling you it's not a matter of if trump will continue to be
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:38.900]  provoked until he authorizes a full blown war part of that provocations to get a ran to retaliate
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:46.180]  in some major way after a preliminary cruise missile strike by united states forces but this
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:51.540]  bully the world image is extremely important so that the rest of the world will back russia and
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:56.740]  china say yes look at this united states somebody's got to take down this bully to stop it from
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:04.100]  intervening around the world and you know aran is not the the biggest terror sponsor in the world
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:10.820]  it's the us and saudi arabia and used to be turkey israel is involved in the provocation of terror
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:18.660]  and to to name aran for simply fighting against this phony war on terror or protecting and using
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:25.940]  hezbollah to fight against the this kind of terror in syria is just a tremendous propaganda
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:34.100]  stuff ultimately alex i would say don't joe please continue yeah ultimately i would say the biggest
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:39.460]  agenda though because this conspiracy of global is not about money and power and the people who
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:44.500]  run the global agenda are already the most powerful wealthy people in the world they don't need more
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:50.260]  money they don't need more women the more wine women's songs yachts or cabins in the mountains
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:58.580]  they've got all that this is really about corruption this is about protection uh granting people who
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:04.980]  join this conspiracy immunity from their sins and provocations ultimately it's a satanic agenda
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:13.140]  how do you get a conspiracy to go 200 years without a fault unless somebody is revealing to them
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:20.820]  at least at the highest level of the direction and ultimately that involves killing a lot of people
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:26.660]  in the world it involves the corruption of morals as we're seeing with the homosexual gay agenda
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:32.180]  gaining mainstream provocation and it involves death and destruction that comes from war
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:40.260]  but and and and all of that will give a bigger control agenda to this globalist power structure
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:45.860]  now keep in mind that there are three major predator centers all controlled i think under
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:50.980]  some type of satanic control and that is there's the angle american globalist establishment there's
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:56.580]  russia and they're china they're in a temporary alliance now but don't believe that they aren't
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:01.060]  eventually going to fight one another and they are planning on that but they want to take down the
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:07.780]  west first in a preemptive strike that the us is trying to start and a lot of people try to say well
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:12.820]  why doesn't the us get this thing going why don't they directly provoke them because they cannot
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:18.900]  make it appear as if the us is responsible for this just like iran they're provoking iran
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:26.180]  with drones tantalizing getting close to the airspace every day hoping that they'll shoot one
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:32.900]  down to be able to start the war they've done these provocations with you know putting minds
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:38.660]  above the water and and shooting missiles into them and blaming iran without any proof whatsoever
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:44.020]  this is a definite provocation and they're very wary of the gulf of tungsten thing which was an
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:50.100]  absolute falsehood starting the vietnam war in this way they've got to have something more substantive
[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:53.860]  and that's why they're doing these special operations now i don't know if the us deep state
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:58.980]  directly did it could have been israel who's in the area who did it on behalf of the deep state
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:04.980]  in terms of attacking these tankers but uh yes has been very very shallow on evidence about these
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:10.740]  things well joel pulling back sorry earlier when you were talking i was pulling up some
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:14.820]  files and playing a clip here on my iphone that i was about to ask you about and of course that
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:19.460]  press conference is coming up the next hour we'll be covering that live but joel scousen is the
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.700]  editor-in-chief at world affairs brief if you just joined us he's a renowned author researcher
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:29.140]  his whole family or some of the first folks to discover the globalist conspiracy of cesil roads
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:32.900]  the british empire and the and the whole globalist program that's now out in the program
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:39.300]  is now out in the open but but i wanted to just pull back here and just talk about big picture
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:44.100]  what do you expect them to try to do next obviously they want to get a war in there why
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:48.820]  do they want to get a war i think it's been to derail trump's popularity why do you think they're
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:59.060]  so desperate the war in iran as as its basic motivation is to destroy the one muslim country
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:05.140]  that's that's essentially become self-sufficient in weapons production iran is far more powerful
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:10.740]  than saudi arabia with its purchased weapons and dependent on the west iran has everything from
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:17.300]  submarines to missile defenses to its own aircraft production now and is trying to do more that's
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:24.900]  why the sanctions on iran is to stop the income flow from from oil you know saudi arabia saying we
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:30.580]  don't want more with iran yeah they don't want to go to iran directly they know they'd lose but
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:37.780]  they want the us to take care of iran and that's why iran is saudi arabia is playing this but it's
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:43.700]  a very insidious agenda they want to take down this one muslim nation that is actually getting in the
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:51.220]  way of the us phony war on terror which is provoked by israel and saudi arabia bachrain
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:58.500]  cutter and and yemen used to be part of the team but now it rebelled and that's why yemen is in its
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:04.100]  it's a target area but ultimately the largest larger agenda is to continue to create this swarm
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:10.660]  of refugees uh under europe and it's had a devastating effect upon europe and will continue to do so
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:15.460]  well joel sitting back as a father i know you're a father and a grandfather
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:21.060]  i've got four children it's just incredibly irritating to me to know that we're still run by
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:25.780]  globalist partially and that they're trying to trick us into offensive wars where we lose
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:30.100]  all the moral high ground and they keep getting away with it and i believe trump is a good man
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:35.380]  overall i know they admit that they steal his documents they steal his papers they disregard
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:40.980]  his orders they lie to his face you've got these different arrogant factions teamed up with the
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:48.180]  corporate media and uh big banks trying to block our populist attempt to restore at least power back
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:52.740]  to our central government and the people partially and and then you've got all the other
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:56.500]  nationalist movements against globalism happening around the world we're going to break in a moment
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.220]  but i want to come back if you have a time for a few more segments and ask you what you see right
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:06.180]  now is the state of the world and the fight against globalism and who the different factions are
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:11.460]  and how you see that playing out currently versus what some of the factions could do
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:17.620]  differently to defeat the globalist if we were able to say talk to the leader of brazil or
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:22.580]  talk to the opposition parties like lapin and because i am able to talk to my name dropping
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:29.300]  it's just true nigel ferrari's or lapin or any of these people how could we work together in more
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:35.220]  of a unified front against the globalist or would that get infiltrated is our strength that we aren't
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:40.180]  centralized that is it also our weakness joe scowls and the world affairs brief hour number three

[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:14.340]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:27.380]  transmission you are the resistance
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:32.660]  all right joel scowles in the world of first brave start gas right he's one of the smartest
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:37.940]  people we could have on uh i tell you though joel it's really scary to know that tucker carlson
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:42.980]  is the main guy talking to the president every day saying don't listen to bolton
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:47.460]  they're setting you up people don't want war it could trigger a larger deal and then they have
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.820]  leftist articles attacking tucker carlson making jokes about it uh and then i made some calls to
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:57.540]  see if it was true and then it's absolutely true and i'm not a liberator get into the details but
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:03.460]  it's worse than i thought uh and trump is just completely surrounded it's a it's a nightmare
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:09.940]  scenario but just pulling back as i asked earlier what is the state of the world right now do you
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:15.940]  think with the different factions but let me just comment first on fox news fox news is a
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:21.460]  continual stream of neocon data they have general keen on pushing it they have jennifer garner
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:27.860]  pushing war with the ran uh this is just a propaganda stunt for war and tucker carlson is
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:34.020]  the lone person who's questioning these types of things and uh so people have to be very very
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:38.900]  careful they've garnered a tremendous audience of conservatives at fox news but they are being
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:44.980]  propagandized and this leads me to my bigger problem in the big picture here i'm beginning to
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:51.940]  sadly say alex that our big problem is donald trump and the reason i said not because donald
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.740]  trump is compromised donald trump is highly manipulated because of his lack of experience
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:01.860]  because it's it comes to the white house with being unprepared he doesn't know the arguments he
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:06.180]  doesn't have the conservative background he doesn't know the proper people he can't tell who's deep
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:11.300]  stated who isn't the problem is donald trump is the 900 pound gorilla in the room and no one
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:18.020]  can capture and direct the conservative movement while donald trump is in place he has made wonderful
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:23.780]  promises and hardly any of them have been able to be fulfilled even though he's tried i mean who
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:28.180]  would have even tried to get rid of birthright citizenship but donald trump but then he completely
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:34.980]  failed us when they pushed back on him and he let it drop and so what i'm saying is that we continue
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:43.220]  to lose under donald trump but the promises are so grand the promises are so euphoric that no one
[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:48.020]  will countenance even criticism of donald trump you know what it does to your subscriber base i
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:53.940]  know what it does to mine even when i you know criticize him on principle but this is our major
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:59.780]  problem now is that donald trump is going to take us to war with iran and it's going to be damaging
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:08.180]  ultimately to his presidency but it may well get him another four years here's the danger alex if
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:13.620]  donald trump continues to capture and dominate the conservative because there is no room for any
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:19.940]  leader while he's there and he takes us through another four years it will be too late after
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:24.980]  that point to resurrect the conservative movement no i think you're right if we don't get the changes
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:31.380]  in now then it'll basically uh the two party system's over it's going to be one of the other
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:38.660]  the decision's been made well the problem is is that the democrats will have an absolute majority
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:43.780]  and a president and control of all both houses of congress and i'll tell you it's going to be
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:49.700]  like an avalanche of legislation and they've said that they said wait till we get in and 2024 it's over
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:55.620]  and look at what they're talking about this time as slavery reparations they're so embarrassed about
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:00.900]  it that the dnc spokesman wouldn't even admit that they were for slavery they just said we're for
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:05.140]  the conversation i saw that this morning with him or she said she said we're for the conversation
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:10.660]  we're for the any prester two or three times we're for the conversation but they would not
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:15.700]  say that before because this is dangerous stuff and so is all the socialist garbage whether it's
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:21.220]  the green climate deal or well let's say your grandfather shot somebody how are you responsible
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:25.780]  for what they did much less what almost no one in the country has ancestors that had slaves it's
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:31.300]  asinine that's right it's a new welfare system for blacks and it hasn't done anything for the
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:36.420]  black community look what it's done for the marriage when these women can be abandoned by the husbands
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:41.380]  and go on welfare for child support and it just for generator let's talk about it is there any way
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:46.980]  out of the multicultural globalist paradigm they brought us into the jose calzen back in 60 seconds

[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:27.860]  jones
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:35.860]  hill scowlson is our gas world affairs brief and not just looking at the u.s or trump
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:42.260]  but looking at other leaders the nation was the populist movement globalism is in trouble on
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:48.020]  some fronts but they still have the power how do you think globalism is dealing with the fact that
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:53.540]  their systems the e use in trouble everywhere their systems in trouble how do you think they'll
[02:06:53.540 --> 02:07:00.420]  deal with that joel well we're seeing how they deal with it they use their corrupt politicians
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:05.940]  to feign i mean you look at the brexit thing therese may comes out and claims that i'm going
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:10.180]  to implement the brexit i'm going to be faithful to the breakfast that may seem to just lying through
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:16.100]  teeth and i fear strongly that boris johnson is doing the same thing he's been on both sides of
[02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:21.380]  the issue on the he's talking about being strong on brexit but i think it's another betrayal
[02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:28.740]  that boris johnson gets a hit gets in take for us for us is for real mainline news admits there have
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:34.660]  been four police confirmed attempted assassinations cutting breaks taking the lug nuts off tires
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:39.700]  off wheels now the airplane crashes suspicious i mean and he was told you're we're going to kill
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:45.300]  you if you keep running for office but now he's doing it again i think for us is for real now i
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:51.540]  do too he's a powerful voice nobody can debate and nigel forage he just devastates them he's
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:58.020]  got a steel trap mine that just won't stop and that's why they won't allow him to you know get
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:04.020]  into real office on that his brexit party was really taking the wind out of the sails and that's
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:08.980]  why in fact boris johnson even joined the brexit party because he saw that as the wave of the future
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.220]  that he had to jump onto and then he quickly jumped ship went back to the conservative party when he
[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:18.420]  got to you know put in his front runner is for the prime minister oh yeah boris johnson's an
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:25.860]  obvious leftist but you know it's the deep state which is tied in directly to deep state in germany
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:31.140]  in france pulled out these this honey trap for the members of the freedom party in austria to
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:36.100]  destroy that coalition i mean these people have a tremendous amount of power and we've seen a great
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:42.100]  deal of it come forward because of donald trump they have to manipulate we get to see them do this
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:50.580]  because of the freedom party and uh french lepent uh you know the french national party but they
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:57.780]  they do their magic because they have real power and i don't think we need to we mustn't underestimate
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:04.020]  the power of the deep state they are ensconced and deeply within the cia the fb i agree and so let me
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:08.500]  ask you this question i think putting trump in putting the new brazilian leader in having the EU
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:14.500]  lose a lot of elections only enrage the establishment to move their timetable up that had been behind
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:18.660]  now i think that means more people will wake up i think that means more cracks in their system
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:23.940]  more mistakes but we shouldn't lie to ourselves that it's sleepy time and that everything's okay i
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:29.860]  think the battle has just been joined well clearly they're worried about the strength of view or
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:34.980]  that wouldn't be attacking you as they have with this planting child pornography within your uh
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:40.740]  your server so they can take you down on that you know destroying your financial base on youtube all
[02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:45.220]  of those things have directly affronts to free speech in this nation and of course that's being
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:49.380]  shut down with political correctness as we see it and we're going to be like canada pretty soon when
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:55.060]  you have ministers and pastors arrested for preaching against homosexuality but the the point
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:10:00.900]  i'm saying here is that i am my greatest fear is that donald trump's going to be in for another
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:06.020]  four years and they're going to continue to manipulate him and uh we're going to be left
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:10.980]  without a cause because he will too late four years from now so we need to either get to
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:19.220]  donald trump and help straighten him out um i don't know uh you know how we we get around all of
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:24.420]  well joe let me tell you and i'll be honest with you i'll be honest with you we're still able to
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:28.900]  get him reports we're still able to get him information but that's why they want us off the
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:32.740]  ear and i don't want to say i've pulled back because of that but it's like sticking your hand
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:40.020]  in a in a light socket i just almost get overwhelmed by that and and how should i be
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:43.780]  putting briefings together maybe you should fly to austin you should shoot a few briefings to the
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:48.260]  president i should shoot a few really professional five-minute ones that show documents that show
[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:52.340]  evidence you know how trump is it's got to be compelling he's got to see stuff he already knows
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:59.140]  is real and then we can sell him uh you know on ideas now the problem is like you said a month or
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:04.420]  so later the next person that sells him he'll go off that it's really true that he's smart and he's
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:10.260]  he knows what's going on he has a good memory but he's a salesman but you can sell donald trump
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:14.420]  people think he's hard to control and i'm not saying i ever control the president anything
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:18.660]  i ever told him he went and looked at and actually went with that's why they're so horrified and by
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:24.980]  the way i'm not bragging about that joel but i'm able to sell the president here's the problem
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:29.860]  donald trump can't remember any of the detailed arguments he can remember the big picture uh
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:35.220]  he can come out and say you know things that you know endears to him uh for depending the right thing
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:40.180]  but he can't remember any of the arguments so he can't defend himself when he gets up against
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:46.020]  these very sophisticated globalist briefers uh he just doesn't have the ability to do that so
[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:50.740]  he needs a few real advisors sitting in his side that know the full picture that's right he's like
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:55.300]  i'm not bragging joel but imagine what would happen if you were there as an advisor sitting next
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:12:00.180]  to him like that's why they want to get rid of uh you know steven miller he's not that old or
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:04.820]  knows about all of it but he's smart they want him out of there because he's advising trump on the border
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:10.740]  yeah that's exactly right so they know that they can manipulate donald trump as long as he doesn't
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:14.740]  have someone sitting by the side who can counter their arguments and i'll tell you they would be
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:20.420]  held to pay if they were put someone like me in the white house you know they would plaster everything
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:25.620]  i've said about 9 11 or any conspiracy things without giving me a chance to defend myself
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:31.220]  so that they could discredit you and and embarrass donald trump and then he'd have to
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:35.860]  remove you they've got tremendous power because they control the media in the courts
[02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:40.980]  we stopped donald trump from every executive order that he tries to put through correctly
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:44.980]  by threatening him with uh with court action let me ask you this then do you think they're
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:49.300]  going to try to destroy him or do they think they can co-opt him now because he's wildly popular
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.860]  i am fearful now that they're going to let him have another four years and the only reason i say
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:00.980]  that i've been asking in the world affairs brief for months now why are the democrats shooting
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:07.380]  themselves in the foot with 27 candidates you know why did they keep uh promoting socialism
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:12.020]  it's not even the blue collar people are going to buy this stuff they know that getting rid of
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:17.140]  automobiles and airplanes in even 30 years are going to destroy their jobs they're not going to vote
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:22.500]  for this and on this black slave reparations i mean they're so embarrassed about that they
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:28.980]  can't even commit to it openly without losing the election so i mean they've got a death wish it seems
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:35.620]  unless they have the concocted and say look uh you know if we can control donald trump we can
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:41.940]  perhaps bury the anti-globalist movement by him giving them a rhetoric and us turning them around
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.100]  to make sure that he never implements any of this that's been the history of the and that's what he
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:50.900]  does on censorship he gives us a tweet he tells us we're good we get a phone call from the white
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:55.780]  house but then the censorship just continues on so it's kind of like giving us morphine when we're
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:02.980]  at hospice now exactly alice this is this is what i fear is that donald trump is going to
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:07.380]  act as a placeholder not knowingly you know donald trump is not a controlled in it and nobody can
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:12.580]  control donald trump but he can be manipulated at the moment and if he as a sits as a place
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:18.260]  sitter within the conservative and dominates the leadership for the next four years and does nothing
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:24.020]  in terms of getting the change that we need to stop this it's going to be all over by 2024
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:32.260]  i totally agree with you and we just need people that are close to the president to do what's right
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:37.860]  like steven miller and tucker carlson and others and all of us that means on the campaign trail folks
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:42.500]  that means in emails calls the white house trump still like he used to do this building since his
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:47.140]  dad taught him this picks up the phone for like 30 minutes sometimes an hour a night while he eats
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:53.060]  cheeseburgers and it's absolutely true i'm bad too but he eats like cheeseburgers candy ice cream
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:57.220]  up to like 2 a.m and he answers the phone and reads newspapers the guy's obviously an idiot
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:15:03.300]  survive when it comes to research and things he's a dynamo at 73 but i'm telling you it's a fight
[02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:08.740]  about getting info to him and and and then him being seconded on what he already thinks but as
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:13.460]  joel said trump even admits i'm a very shallow person i go with the gestalt i go with my gut
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:18.500]  hey alex what he says makes sense what tugger says makes sense and then you know one minute i'm
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:23.780]  gonna attack iran next minute oh no i'm not it's it's it's it's it's it's actually quite frightening
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:28.900]  uh when you really pull back and realize that trump is something special joel scowles and
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:33.140]  world affairs brief dot com he's not hillary that's a great thing but think of hillary got in
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:38.740]  we'd have opposition we'd have people saying no well trump we go to sleep it's really true
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:44.980]  love donald trump but joel scowles is dead right um one man can't save us the one man is jesus christ
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:48.660]  they can do that and he's not a man he's the son of god joel scowles and thank you so much we

[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:33.540]  all right i did tons of preparation last night tons of preparation this morning
[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:38.980]  the iran situation is just dominated the whole broadcast and i'm gonna end up hosting the fourth
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:45.060]  hour with matt racken former navy seal great mind about the situation unfolding he'll probably
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:51.860]  have some different views and that's fine we're not a nexium cult or like conservative radio or
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:56.100]  liberal media it's like a talking point comes out from hillary or talking point comes out from
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:21:03.540]  torches w bush and then everyone just basically repeats that talking point over and over and over
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:10.020]  again that's not what we're doing here you know i've got a clip from blaze tv where they defend me
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:16.980]  and say no they subpoenaed his emails somebody sent hidden child porn that happens to anybody
[02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:26.900]  that gets millions of emails but then they go on in the video to make a bunch of statements about us
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:34.580]  that aren't true so it's like these backhanded defenses ladies and gentlemen they're coming
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:45.540]  after everybody that's true blue and again i have thought long and hard about this for six
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:50.020]  months while we've been losing money from all the attacks from all the censorship from all
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:55.140]  the platforming from everything trying to keep our crew here trying to actually expand for 2020
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:22:02.500]  so we can have a big effect and catch all that critical footage on tape and i've never been
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:10.500]  deceptive with our audience except i have from time to time withheld information that i don't
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:17.460]  think's good for the cause because you know it's not good for the cause that they've had an effect
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:22.580]  on slowing us down to a standstill and even having us start to contract but see there's
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:27.540]  something worse than the enemy knowing they're having an effect us being shut down right
[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:35.060]  so you notice all these years i was running around during the break my hair's all sticking up it's
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:43.460]  left of it over all these years we've done such incredible things together and we've changed the
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:52.820]  world and i'll be damned no taking the Lord's name in vain there i mean i mean that before i'm
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:59.060]  going to ever give up and the truth is i know that if you ever see me really get arrested really
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:04.260]  get set up or i've ever got my head blown off god forbid i don't want that to happen that we'd see
[02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:11.620]  support way greater than we even need but i don't want to get to that point you know i've told you
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:16.500]  that i've got intelligence agencies criminals that have hijacked our government working against me
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:20.980]  now listen you don't just think it's the child porn stuff to you
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:29.620]  no by the way i'm not a victim i'm a target tony robinson said that a year ago when they tortured
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:36.260]  him in prison for three months he lost like 12 stones or whatever i was like 30 something pounds
[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:43.140]  they put him in the islamic area by the mosque inside the area they would crap and defecate
[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:45.860]  and throw feces at him through the bars and the guards laughed at him
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:52.340]  i remember when i saw tommy on fox news on tucker carolson first
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:59.060]  tommy looked like those guys you'd seen they've been captured by the north vietnamese for five
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:04.740]  years we had that crazy look and they're all freaked out it took tommy who's tough months to get over
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:10.420]  what happened to him they left the lights on 24 hours a day they bang on the door continually
[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:14.980]  they'd shove feces and piss through the bars at him and laugh at him
[02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:22.420]  and he was in solitary confinement they let him out for three months and they were putting stuff
[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:28.180]  in his food he said it on air but i talked to him probably he ate some of the food that wasn't in a
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:36.980]  tin because once a day he'd get a small tin of tuna fish and a little small package of crackers
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:42.500]  that's all he'd eat because everything else had poison in it because he ate some once he got so
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:47.860]  hungry and food poisoning and almost died and let me tell you when you're in a cage and people
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:54.180]  are poisoning you and muslims are defecating on the floor and throwing turds at you and look how
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:25:01.060]  skinny he was when he came out of there that's when you realize your government is evil all you do
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:05.460]  stand up for what's right and kidnap little girls and he identified the guy that killed a little
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:12.420]  girl and cut her up and put solar flesh on beef kebabs turned out that guy got indicted for that
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:18.980]  and it it was true when tommy first said yeah i talked to the locals they cut that little girl
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:23.220]  up and fed her to kebabs the news like oh our little muslims wouldn't do that they wouldn't cut
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:32.500]  up a little girl into kebabs you bet they did so i don't think of myself as a victim and i haven't
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:39.300]  been in a jail cell for three months with people using it as a toilet tommy told me privately
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:44.660]  talk about it on air a little bit he said privately there would be four inches of human
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:49.860]  feces and urine by the end of the day and then every couple days they'd come in and give him a
[02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:54.260]  sweeper and say clean that up and he'd shove it out in the hall and put it in a bucket that was his
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:59.620]  time outside the jail cell with muslims just putting their butts up against the bars and just
[02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:05.140]  crapping through the food hole on him and laughing and giggling that's the new world order folks
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:11.540]  that's what they do to patriots is they go and they piss all over you and they crap all over you
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:21.860]  and the media loves it well guess what i get to put up with now the wall street journal the new
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:30.820]  york times the ap saying i sent child porn to children it's all a damn lie 9.6 million emails
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:37.620]  since sandy hook happened judge ordered them all turned over i went back seven eight times to the
[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:43.620]  cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars and said i cannot give you all my people's emails
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:49.220]  she said fine 20 something search terms all the names of people involved the net and they
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:55.460]  got 57 thousand emails and they had hidden encoded child porn on there that i never opened
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:03.380]  i know you've already heard this but imagine the news then runs with that they'll do anything
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:10.340]  but enough about that i'll be here next hour when trump gives his press conference are we going

[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:13.700]  great great great great great great granddaddy did something wrong we're gonna have a genealogy
[02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:22.260]  run you're gonna pay some money wow that's crazy us say today Africans are being sold at libyan
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:31.540]  slave markets thanks hillary clinton that's us today if our government said hey let's go free
[02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:35.140]  those people don't buy them because that puts a market out there and makes the price go up
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:40.420]  but let's go free those people if some of our military volunteered to go on missions to go kill
[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:48.820]  those slave camp owners who are black and free those folks i'm all for it but man i'm sure sick of
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:54.500]  hearing about how i did something wrong if my great great great great grandfather that only
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:35:03.940]  take you back to after slavery was a murderer let's say he killed two or three innocent people he
[02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:13.300]  didn't don't even know his name but let's just say he did how am i guilty if somebody's far distant
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:22.100]  relative who's like five percent the genetics of this person shows up and says you're great
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:28.820]  great great great great granddaddy did something hell if my daddy robbed a bank and i didn't know
[02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:38.020]  about it i don't go to jail then what type of system is but this is i haven't gotten all the
[02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:42.340]  reparation videos and i'll i'll play some of those coming up next segment and i'm gonna be hosting the
[02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:48.740]  fourth hour here waiting for trump's press conference but it's the end of due process
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:54.900]  and it it sends the forefathers and you know are we going to find out of these black people brought
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:36:01.620]  here if their own family sold them to sex slavery or slavery or whatever we're going to come out to
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:08.340]  them because they were black slaveholders in the us as well it's just crazy ladies and gentlemen
[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:14.020]  and by the way i've got all these videos coming up next segment of africans fighting mexican troops
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:22.260]  to get into mexico to get into the us so are they going to show up demand those reparations
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:27.860]  damn it i came in here and i'm going to get a reparation you're going to get that welfare
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:32.660]  and the rest of it because the state wants people under its control the state wants people
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:37.060]  that are going to show up and demand their free goodie whether they're white or black or whatever
[02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:44.260]  it is that's coming up next segment but let me go to this piece first i have never sat down
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:51.140]  and watched the hit tv series that's ending i guess around now homeland when they started it five
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:58.020]  six years ago they said it's based on alex jones it's some british actor trying to do his texas
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:07.780]  accent it's a bad southern accent and in the in the show he lies and he cheats and he puts out
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:13.460]  fake news like the corporate media does and then the corporate media comes for hillary clinton
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:19.380]  who's the president and says we'll just buy you off and i never saw the rest of the episode but he
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:24.100]  doesn't say what he wants and they tell him you're going to lose you're going to be shut down and in
[02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:28.420]  the end he is shut down he's put in prison and in the final season i don't even know what happens
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:33.460]  i've just read the synopsis of it people say why don't you watch a show it's about you well hell
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:40.100]  chris carter was pissed about homeland so three and a half years ago during the campaign he put out
[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:44.100]  the new x files where i'm the good guy and he said this character is based on alex jones and alex
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:50.180]  jones the libertarian he gets things wrong sometimes but he means well now that show had many times the
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:55.700]  viewers of homeland but chris carter didn't get picked back up chris carter wanted to meet i'm
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:58.740]  not name dropping i just never had time to go out to california i should have done it
[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:06.420]  but that's the level of it where chris carter puts out a good alex jones the show's ahead he gets
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:12.180]  canceled the relaunch of x files but the homeland show on showtime or whatever they try to make it
[02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:17.940]  ahead they did have a lot of views but nothing compared to a box show that's the reality of this
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:25.140]  so think about the world we live in in fantasy land where when i've been around democrats and
[02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:29.060]  others they believe i'm the homeland character they believe i have a thousand employees and
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:33.700]  billions of dollars and i'm funded by the cia and we're putting out lies you're here you're
[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:38.900]  watching us say what we say what we do you're you're seeing what we cover you're seeing everything
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:46.180]  we get into it's me and the crew running the show and a few camera people but the democrats
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:52.980]  are telling you who they really are with projection so in this smartsy fancy pants
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:57.460]  lawyer for hillary the female president they were getting everybody ready for her
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:04.340]  predictive programming when she's there talking to the evil homeland she uh uh uh villain
[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:12.500]  they're talking about his fake news and how he should stop it they're the people putting out fake
[02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:19.220]  news they're the ones knowingly lying to you i'm gonna even set up the studio with our old
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:25.620]  graphics and our old everything as a big joke that's all they've got but what's crazy is the
[02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:31.700]  left is so nuts they see me in public and shake in anger so here's that clip from a few seasons
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:39.300]  ago of homeland where i don't take the offer to sell out here it is well i like to think i'm
[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:46.020]  feeling a void the one vacated by the walking dead and decrepit medium come on you're smart you
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:53.300]  don't really believe that oh i do i do people are angry so he keeps saying maybe they'd be a
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:57.300]  little less angry and a little more reasonable these people if you stop peddling your outright
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:40:05.140]  falsehoods conspiracy theories yeah yeah yeah seriously you're poisoning the conversation
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:13.540]  what conversation we haven't had a conversation in this country for 50 years not since these people
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:18.580]  as you keep calling them got sent to fight the war in vietnam not since their children were
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:24.740]  bust the schools in the ghetto not since their jobs were shipped overseas not since the christian
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:32.020]  values they cherished were trashed and ridiculed in favor of every boy who thinks he's a girl or
[02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:38.100]  girl who thinks she's a boy well f**k that
[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:43.380]  fair enough fair enough
[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:49.780]  every one of those things you just mentioned is worth talking about
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:57.300]  debating here here instead you're out there accusing the president of murdering general
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:08.500]  mclendon calling for a revolution hey i serve my audience that's your answer that's the american way
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:15.780]  nothing ever got done in this country by civil discourse alone the loud get heard they always have
[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:19.220]  they also fall the hardest
[02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:28.020]  come and get me go ahead send in the storm troopers we'll see what happens
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:33.140]  the world is watching not for long what do you mean
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:40.180]  once we shut down your broadcast jammer communications you'll be completely cut off
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:47.700]  here's the truth
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:54.260]  you will never be in a stronger negotiating position than you are right now
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:41:59.300]  tell me what you want
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:08.820]  what's going to take for you to walk out of here
[02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:18.100]  and so i never watched homeland so i don't know how it ends but see that's the character they say
[02:42:18.100 --> 02:42:25.380]  is based on me that they say is me but see i told you what i want i want you to stop bankrupting

[02:43:57.860 --> 02:44:02.500]  in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the
[02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:07.620]  only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:12.340]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:18.180]  independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:22.580]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:27.300]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:30.980]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where
[02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:35.380]  they've mostly been blocked by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:40.660]  control and manipulate what news it views do a person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:45.620]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to
[02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:50.020]  the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:54.500]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:01.860]  i just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against us and
[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:07.140]  we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only like five
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:11.460]  ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:15.860]  and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.860]  you get 20 000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:24.180]  crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:28.580]  not contract and for six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and i

[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:09.460]  meanwhile the democrats are on record have another democrat leader in illinois saying they'll
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:15.460]  confiscate guns others saying they want to put us in camp so it's only democrats talking about all

[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:44.740]  get the the the political spin here of mainstream news is boiled down of what happened from time
[02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:50.580]  magazine house judiciary committee holds hearing on reparations for slavery now understand i know
[02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:56.260]  you know this but our rule of law our due process is already being shredded funneled down a toilet
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:06.180]  but if you can be guilty for some foggy ancestor ten generations ago civil wars about ten generations
[02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:12.260]  on average and less than two percent of people have ancestors and own slaves doesn't matter
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:18.500]  the government thinks oh blacks deserve this it'll next be transgenders this that well some gays
[02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:27.380]  were beat up so you know it never ends it's total mental illness and they're not going to give black

[02:57:54.820 --> 02:58:01.540]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[02:58:01.540 --> 02:58:07.860]  in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experience less
[02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:13.540]  seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:19.540]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps

[02:58:26.180 --> 02:58:32.020]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase which

[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:23.540]  i am perpetual
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:30.100]  let's get serious the washington post is reporting that senator ten cruises attacked me
[03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:37.380]  but did he really next segment will air it and then the blaze came to my defense um
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:46.180]  um oh and benjamin came to my defense uh rick wiles of of true news who's had a hard
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:50.580]  on for me for years for a while i don't know had to come to me begrudging defense
[03:01:52.180 --> 03:01:58.900]  on the fake child porn setup but they all go god we hate defending him and then string together
[03:01:58.900 --> 03:02:04.660]  a bunch of half truths and ten percent truths and non-truths so i'll tell rick wiles this because
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:10.100]  i watched his show it's pretty informative a lot of it a lot of it was wrong he said i better get
[03:02:10.100 --> 03:02:15.620]  right with god and get my soul right and that i am disturbed and then i should get out of the spotlight
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:22.180]  i agree with it all but get out of the spotlight you're right rick i'm disturbed i'm disturbed by
[03:02:22.180 --> 03:02:27.300]  babies being killed after they're born now i'm disturbed by gay pride parades openly saying
[03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:33.540]  they're having sex with children i have mainstream articles i've even gotten to i am upset rick i'm
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:39.380]  pissed i'm raising the alarm and sometimes i boil over you're absolutely right rick but you know
[03:02:39.380 --> 03:02:45.140]  what i love god i love jesus christ and i pray for god to uh cool me off like a race car that has
[03:02:45.140 --> 03:02:58.980]  you know 1500 horsepower i got a little too much juice i understand believe me but my life and my
[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:06.900]  goals and my soul is pointed at justice and jesus christ and so i'm not pissed at black people
[03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:11.300]  i'm pissed at how they've been slaves for so long in this country and now the various
[03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:15.620]  people that dead at the democrats are offering them some new freebie that's going to supposedly
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:21.220]  free them let's go to this clip of this former nfl player who they boo and try to shut down when he
[03:03:21.220 --> 03:03:27.860]  talks burgers owens when he says the democrats should be paying the reparations here it is
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:33.220]  you're not believing reparation because what reparation does it points to a certain race a
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:40.100]  certain color and and points them as evil and points the other race my race is one that is not
[03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:48.820]  only becomes racist but but also beggars i do believe in restitution let's point to the party
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:55.620]  that was that was part of slavery kkk jim crow that has killed over 40 percent of our black babies
[03:03:55.620 --> 03:04:02.020]  20 million of them that's right that's right state of california 75 percent of our black boys
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:06.580]  cannot pass standard reading writing tests a democratic state that's all by design so yes
[03:04:06.580 --> 03:04:14.180]  let's play rest restoration let's play rest restitution how about a democratic party pay for
[03:04:14.180 --> 03:04:20.980]  all the misery brought to my race and uh those after after we learn our history decide please
[03:04:20.980 --> 03:04:26.500]  give him a show they they should pay also they're complicit and every white american republican or
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:32.420]  democrat it feels guilty because of your white skin you should need to point it up also that way
[03:04:32.420 --> 03:04:37.380]  we get past this reparation and recognize that this country has given us greatness look at my panel

[03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:38.660]  all right so let's finish up with former nfl player who destroys the lies the democratic party the kkk
[03:07:38.660 --> 03:07:43.140]  who want to continue to divide this country with fake reparations will destroy the rule of law
[03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:50.660]  burgers owens destroys them and then we see the headline out of the washington post is inaccurate
[03:07:51.300 --> 03:07:55.620]  that i've been attacked by ten crews we'll play that video in a moment but here is this
[03:07:55.620 --> 03:08:01.860]  interesting point from the hearings yesterday i do not believe in reparation because what reparation
[03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:07.540]  does it points to a certain race a certain color and it points them as evil and points the other race
[03:08:07.540 --> 03:08:16.580]  my race is one that is not only becomes racist but but also beggars i do believe in restitution
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:24.500]  let's point to the party that was that was part of slavery kkk jim crow that has killed over 40%
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:32.260]  of our black babies 20 million of them state of california 75 percent of our black boys
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:38.740]  cannot pass standard reading writing tests a democratic state so yes let's play rest restoration
[03:08:39.460 --> 03:08:45.620]  let's play rest restitution how about a democratic party pay for all the misery brought to my race
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:53.380]  and uh those after after we learn our history decide to stay there they they should pay also
[03:08:53.380 --> 03:08:58.660]  their complicit and every white american republican or democrat it feels guilty because of your white
[03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:04.660]  skin you should need to pony up also that way we get past this reparation and recognize that this
[03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:09.620]  country is giving us greatness look at this panel doesn't matter how we think the fact is well
[03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:14.820]  doesn't matter our color we have become successful in this country like no other because of this great
[03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:20.820]  opportunity to live the american dream let's not steal that from our kids but tell them they can't do it
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:25.780]  that's right and and again that's why they're so scared american perfect but we were reaching to
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:31.220]  try to fix it all so how are we the best when it comes to freedoms and things gonna say we're the
[03:09:31.220 --> 03:09:35.700]  worst now when you go to any other country they're all about you go to china you're white you're black
[03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:39.460]  they're like get out of here you go to places africa you're not the right tribe no matter if
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:43.780]  you're black they kill your ass so why are we putting america down all the great things we've got
[03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:51.380]  when it when it's the best shot we've got that colman hues is a columnist got torn up as well
[03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:58.020]  and boo they try to shut him down when he said some more things here it is nothing i'm about to say
[03:09:58.020 --> 03:10:05.940]  is meant to minimize the horror and brutality of slavery and jim crow racism is a bloody stain on
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:12.020]  this country's history pause though and i can notice because he says that that's why they attack him
[03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:17.620]  like he's saying we're wrong or i'm admitting the the other guy just said this is a bunch of bs
[03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:22.580]  democrats are the slave runners blah blah blah it's a bunch of crap but this guy wants to make
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:26.740]  everybody feel good bring him together he's saying hey things haven't been perfect here
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:30.660]  that's when they see weakness because i used to have people say oh say you're sorry for questioning
[03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:35.220]  this or that i go okay i'm sorry oh my god you admit you lied it's over i'm not putting this
[03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:43.380]  guy down i've been through this where you try to say okay i'm not perfect they just use it against
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:49.860]  you here it is failure to pay reparations directly to freed slaves after the civil war to be one of
[03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:55.620]  the greatest injustices ever perpetrated that was a democratic us government good point but i worry
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:11:02.260]  that our desire to fix the past compromises our ability to fix the present think about what we're
[03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:10.660]  doing today we're spending our time debating a bill liberal slavery 25 times but incarceration
[03:11:10.660 --> 03:11:17.860]  only once in an era with no black slaves but nearly a million black prisoners a bill that
[03:11:17.860 --> 03:11:23.700]  doesn't mention homicide once at a time when the center for disease control reports homicide
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:29.780]  as the number one cause of death for young black men i'm not saying that acknowledging history
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:35.220]  doesn't matter it does i'm saying there's a difference between acknowledging history
[03:11:35.220 --> 03:11:41.620]  and allowing history to distract us from the problems we face today in 2008 the house of
[03:11:41.620 --> 03:11:47.940]  representatives formally apologized for slavery and jim crow in 2009 the senate did the same
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:56.420]  black people don't need another apology we need safer neighborhoods and better schools we need
[03:11:56.420 --> 03:12:02.900]  a less punitive criminal justice system we need affordable health care and none of these things
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:12.180]  can be achieved through reparations for slavery nearly everyone close to me nearly everyone
[03:12:12.180 --> 03:12:17.300]  close to me told me not to testify today they told me that even though i've only ever voted
[03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:22.740]  for democrats i'd be perceived as a republican and therefore hated by half the country others
[03:12:22.740 --> 03:12:27.940]  told me that by distancing myself from republicans i would end up angering the other half of the
[03:12:27.940 --> 03:12:33.940]  country and the sad truth is that they were both right that's how suspicious we've become
[03:12:34.660 --> 03:12:43.460]  of one another that's how divided we are as a nation if we were to pay reparations today we
[03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:48.740]  would only divide the country further making it harder to build the political coalitions
[03:12:48.740 --> 03:12:55.140]  required to solve the problems facing black people today we would insult many black americans
[03:12:55.140 --> 03:13:01.460]  by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors exactly and we would turn the relationship
[03:13:01.460 --> 03:13:07.620]  between black americans and white americans from a coalition into a transaction oh and we'll turn
[03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:14.660]  people into citizens into a lawsuit between plaintiffs and defendants what we should do
[03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:21.060]  is pay reparations to black americans who actually grew up under jim crow and were directly harmed
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:26.980]  by second-class citizenship people like my grandparents but paying reparations to all
[03:13:26.980 --> 03:13:34.020]  descendants of slaves is a mistake take me for example i was born three decades after the end
[03:13:34.020 --> 03:13:41.460]  of jim crow into a privileged household in the suburbs i attend an ivy league school yet i'm
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:47.540]  also descended from slaves who worked on thomas jefferson's monticello plantation so reparations
[03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:54.340]  for slavery would allocate federal resources to me but not to an american with the wrong ancestry
[03:13:54.900 --> 03:14:00.420]  even if that person is living paycheck to paycheck and working multiple jobs is incredibly
[03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:06.980]  discriminatory exactly it's you might call that justice i call it justice for the dead at the price
[03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:12.980]  of justice for the living i understand that reparations are about what people are owed
[03:14:12.980 --> 03:14:18.820]  regardless of how well they're doing i understand that hit pause we gotta go to break this guy's
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:26.500]  really smart but i mean just the the assininess that if somebody else did something 160 years ago
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:33.940]  that you're guilty unless you stole a painting because this happened in the holocaust like
[03:14:33.940 --> 03:14:37.780]  Marilyn albright she's jewish but her dad broke her jews trying to get out they didn't have the
[03:14:37.780 --> 03:14:41.460]  money he'd kill them there's a lot of jews helped run the holocaust that's been declassified it's
[03:14:41.460 --> 03:14:45.700]  a terrible thing and she had a lot of holocaust paintings worth tens of millions in her house
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:50.900]  and she'd do interviews on tv and people saw famous paintings in her house and people were
[03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:55.540]  like hey my grandmother painted that that painting and they're like well yeah my dad took it from
[03:14:55.540 --> 03:15:02.820]  or my screw you i murder you i'm mad when albright i murder people i brag about 500
[03:15:02.820 --> 03:15:08.900]  thousand dead iraqi children and say it's a good price i take your property i'm a giant toad goblin
[03:15:08.900 --> 03:15:17.620]  i rob jews i'm like george soros i'm a super goblin but it came out that she had stolen jewish
[03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:27.620]  art from murdered jews and her father murdered she's an alpha god she kills you she takes it
[03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:33.540]  now you could say reparations to that person's family because she stole the painting there's a
[03:15:33.540 --> 03:15:39.940]  direct piece of property and a direct pig goblin but people ten generations ago you don't even know
[03:15:39.940 --> 03:15:46.340]  who it is i won't pay some money for you you better get your ass straight on that that's called fraud
[03:15:46.340 --> 03:15:50.180]  that's called slavery and i'm nobody's slave we'll be right back

[03:20:11.460 --> 03:20:15.060]  when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique catalac
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:24.580]  and he was dressed like 1950 half drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to nashfield would

[03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:46.420]  songs coming out of them speakers was solid contra gold then i noticed a stranger was
[03:20:46.420 --> 03:20:54.180]  ghost white pill when he asked me for a light and i knew there was something strange about this ride
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:21:02.740]  he said can you make folks cry when you're not george straight who is that have you paid your
[03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:09.860]  dues can you moan please can you bend them guitar strings i said boy can you make folks feel what

[03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:21.620]  your country version of it's a long way to the top you want to rock and roll all right let's get
[03:21:21.620 --> 03:21:27.540]  serious i literally a couple times a day punching alex jones on youtube to see the latest incredible
[03:21:27.540 --> 03:21:34.340]  stuff good bad ugly going on and i punched it in earlier and the headline came up in the washington
[03:21:34.340 --> 03:21:40.420]  post video feed that senator ted cruz says we should stand up to voices like alex jones
[03:21:40.980 --> 03:21:47.860]  not silence them i never said ted cruz's dad killed kennedy i said the word was he was in the cia
[03:21:47.860 --> 03:21:54.020]  out of cuba was an anti-communist that's a good thing ted the media ran with that and you dropped
[03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:58.580]  out of the race a day later because the word is it's true your dad was in the cia out of cuba
[03:21:58.580 --> 03:22:03.220]  then sent to canada and we all know that and he was an anti-communist that's a good thing and i
[03:22:03.220 --> 03:22:09.940]  supported ted cruz over beto obviously i think ted's a great guy overall but and i ran into him in
[03:22:09.940 --> 03:22:16.340]  dc we had a nice talk but here's the washington post jeff bezos's operation trying to get him
[03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:21.860]  to throw me under the bus here it is to your point about fraud and knowing things are falsehoods
[03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:26.340]  and taking them down how then do you address something like alex jones uh this is somebody
[03:22:26.340 --> 03:22:31.380]  who very publicly was posting conspiracy theories about a quite a good number of things including
[03:22:31.380 --> 03:22:36.660]  the shooting at sandy hook at times it appeared like you had been defending his ability to say that so
[03:22:36.660 --> 03:22:39.620]  let's just start with the basics what are your thoughts on alex jones should he have been able
[03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:46.580]  to continue to do these things i think listen i think alex joe jones is a nut i don't listen
[03:22:46.580 --> 03:22:52.660]  to the guy i don't know what he has to say um but i also don't like that a handful of
[03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:58.180]  silicon valley billionaire suddenly decided this voice shall be silenced we the star chamber have
[03:22:58.180 --> 03:23:04.180]  spoken and his listeners have no right to hear him now part of the reason i spoke out in support
[03:23:04.180 --> 03:23:10.820]  of alex jones is because he's been a son of a bitch to me the guy goes on air and routinely
[03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:18.100]  accuses my father of killing jonith kennedy for the record he didn't do it but my dad did take
[03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:26.500]  out jimmy hoff i apologize for that um look i to be honest i don't like crackpots that accuse my
[03:23:26.500 --> 03:23:32.900]  father of murder all right let's just pause what's up with every interviewer either being a transvestite
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:38.740]  or like a weird little robot soy boy because they put out all these things i didn't say or didn't do
[03:23:38.740 --> 03:23:45.940]  do and then this person is supposed to renounce them the new york times promoted fake wmds that
[03:23:45.940 --> 03:23:51.220]  killed millions they run the whole arab spring they do all this criminal stuff on purpose they
[03:23:51.220 --> 03:23:59.380]  lie continually and they go oh alex jones jones does all these bad things i had roger stone on
[03:23:59.380 --> 03:24:06.740]  him ted and roger stone at that time ted was talking to the president and talking to
[03:24:08.900 --> 03:24:14.500]  sent com special operations command and the word is your dad was in the cia and we just brought
[03:24:14.500 --> 03:24:19.700]  that up you dropped out of the race the next day so you're you're you're recycling all this so
[03:24:19.700 --> 03:24:24.260]  you should be mad at trump if you're mad about that because we all know where it came from and
[03:24:24.260 --> 03:24:32.020]  we know trump repeated it oh but you love him now don't you i did my job buddy boy and you know it
[03:24:32.020 --> 03:24:40.660]  like getting your ass into office here in texas here he is sucking the lollipop the washington post
[03:24:40.660 --> 03:24:49.540]  let's continue like crackpots that accuse my father of murder that's why i defended his first
[03:24:49.540 --> 03:24:55.300]  amendment rights because the first amendment is about letting people speak and letting the
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:25:01.220]  marketplace of ideas decide it's precisely because i was defending someone who comes after me
[03:25:02.500 --> 03:25:07.460]  to illustrate this is not about my particular policy views being favored this is about
[03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:14.820]  a and it used to be by the way and it wasn't the soy boy is in love can we back this up
[03:25:14.820 --> 03:25:21.140]  back to these guys get a hotel room later which is fine i'm super liberal but like i think we know
[03:25:21.140 --> 03:25:26.020]  who's pitching who's catching here the dead crews have his legs up behind that guy's ears an hour
[03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:30.740]  later hotel room and by the way that's called comedy folks i'm not being serious here but
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:37.380]  i mean soy boy looks like he stepped off a little flying saucer he's maybe it's a gray alien
[03:25:37.380 --> 03:25:43.700]  being sarcastic folks it's all called comedy but but seriously ted ted you wouldn't have got elected
[03:25:43.700 --> 03:25:49.220]  we didn't support you for the senate again and you go back to your vomit you go back to these
[03:25:49.220 --> 03:25:54.660]  guys that would slit your throat in a minute as if groveling to the washington post will make
[03:25:54.660 --> 03:25:58.740]  we've already overthrown them we've already defeated them and we keep going through this
[03:25:58.740 --> 03:26:04.420]  groundhog day every time that some chicken next soy boy that no one even knows who he is and then
[03:26:04.420 --> 03:26:10.820]  you're going to just go into this prostration before him let's continue it used to be by the way
[03:26:10.820 --> 03:26:15.700]  a journalist used to be vigorous in protecting free speech it's really striking that's a good
[03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:21.380]  point now how many journalists perfectly five seconds so he does his little omnet with alex
[03:26:21.380 --> 03:26:27.060]  jones now he tells you what he really thinks i like ted cruise we had a private conversation in dc
[03:26:28.580 --> 03:26:33.780]  part of it on tape the point is i like ted cruise he could be president someday knock it off ted
[03:26:33.780 --> 03:26:40.180]  your dad was in the cia you want us to release the documents doesn't mean he killed jfk
[03:26:41.780 --> 03:26:50.100]  he was involved in new orleans knock it off we're here to protect and defend your ideas we
[03:26:50.100 --> 03:26:56.580]  like what you do so stop acting like this cocksucker next to you i'm sorry whatever he is delay that
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:27:04.260]  stop acting like this little trendy next to you is your life raft he ain't man he'll take you down
[03:27:04.260 --> 03:27:10.980]  like a ton of bricks tied to your ankles go back to him about it used to be by the way
[03:27:11.700 --> 03:27:15.460]  journalists used to be vigorous in protecting free speech it's really striking
[03:27:16.580 --> 03:27:22.100]  how many journalists are perfectly fine with the massive power big tech has to censor views it may
[03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:27.220]  be because the views they're suppressing journalists disagree with so if they're suppressing pro-life
[03:27:27.220 --> 03:27:33.540]  views look most journalists are not pro-life so what skin is it off my nose well i think that's a
[03:27:33.540 --> 03:27:40.500]  very dangerous power to hand over if you suddenly have two or three billionaires deciding what
[03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:45.860]  speech is allowed what speech is not and it's all invisible but senator this was an example of somebody
[03:27:45.860 --> 03:27:51.220]  who has a very large following that had been enabled in some ways by the social media platforms
[03:27:51.220 --> 03:27:55.140]  that later banned him to spread those falsehoods you don't think that those companies have a
[03:27:55.140 --> 03:27:59.940]  responsibility to sort of limit the spread of that if they can well look i will note by the way
[03:27:59.940 --> 03:28:07.060]  because i guess as i understand it is a radio show he's facing slander and libel litigation and so
[03:28:07.060 --> 03:28:12.420]  you do have a legal system you know if if he's spreading slanders and libels look in my instance
[03:28:12.420 --> 03:28:18.820]  he certainly is in my instance but but you know and i will confess my father contemplated filing
[03:28:18.820 --> 03:28:28.580]  a lawsuit but i told him uh you know the old line uh never roll around in the mud with a pig
[03:28:29.220 --> 03:28:34.100]  because you'll get covered in mud and the pig likes it right um that frankly was my advice to
[03:28:34.100 --> 03:28:40.820]  my dad then go with this guy but we do have a legal system we launched the whole movement you
[03:28:40.820 --> 03:28:48.500]  wrote in on you and trump my audience watched the whole wave you rolled in on brother recognize it

[03:33:03.780 --> 03:33:23.220]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:26.900 --> 03:33:32.020]  and brankin had some big old storms you know about those roll through and knock out his power
[03:33:32.020 --> 03:33:37.460]  but he's taken over in a moment and he's got a lot to say about the current escalations trump's
[03:33:37.460 --> 03:33:42.020]  press conference never happened it became a congressional secret meeting at the white house
[03:33:42.020 --> 03:33:46.900]  will during the war room we should have news we'll cover it info wars.com forward slash show
[03:33:48.100 --> 03:33:52.260]  but ted cruise as you just heard came out and said hey don't take alex jones's free speech away
[03:33:53.060 --> 03:33:56.900]  but that jones said my dad killed kennedy you know i said your dad was in the cia you live in
[03:33:56.900 --> 03:34:01.780]  new orleans he was an anti-communist and i got that from high-level sources so stop footsieing around
[03:34:01.780 --> 03:34:06.180]  with trump if you're mad at me about that now let me get to one more piece of news and that bracken
[03:34:06.180 --> 03:34:14.020]  will take over the young turks oh and benjamin um true news with rick wiles uh what are the other
[03:34:14.020 --> 03:34:24.500]  channels there are so many of these even even um limbeck's co-host with his show that he does separate
[03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:29.540]  on the blaze came out and said alex jones did not send child porn to the sandy hook families
[03:34:31.940 --> 03:34:36.900]  the judge first wanted all our emails 9.6 million to the sandy hook
[03:34:39.940 --> 03:34:43.380]  we have nothing to hide you usually get rid of emails every three years we had them going back
[03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:46.900]  it's like 15 years i was telling my dad of folks why am i paying for this
[03:34:46.900 --> 03:34:54.340]  they get them they data mine them they find hidden links in non-related death threats against me
[03:34:54.340 --> 03:35:00.660]  that we never open the fbi admits it it's in the news last week democrats get pissed they go jones
[03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:07.060]  can't be the victim here so on monday they announced that i am guilty of sending child porn to the
[03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:12.580]  sandy hook families total defamation they sued us they demand them in discovery it was hidden
[03:35:12.580 --> 03:35:17.700]  they had to have metadata to find it i said that's suspicious i'm not blaming them specifically for
[03:35:17.700 --> 03:35:21.860]  it i'm saying whoever sent it i'm gonna get you now they're threatening to sue me over that great
[03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:29.940]  line up you're gonna lose we're in a real 21st century warrior but i wanted to play the glen
[03:35:29.940 --> 03:35:37.780]  bet blaze thing because they stayed all the fake facts that i sent people to harass the sandy
[03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:44.660]  hook families and then but then they go but it's true he didn't send child porn they just got all
[03:35:44.660 --> 03:35:49.460]  these emails because jones sent too many because a lot of these guys on the show are lawyers they're
[03:35:49.460 --> 03:35:56.020]  smart they know well you wouldn't send people on open emails that's not related to a suit you never
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:36:01.940]  talked to these people the judge ordered anything with the name sandy hook or all these family names
[03:36:01.940 --> 03:36:07.940]  or all these news terms it was like 30 40 terms i forget we had to search it have law firms review
[03:36:07.940 --> 03:36:13.700]  it then they asked the judge we've had like eight hearings on this make jones open every
[03:36:13.700 --> 03:36:20.020]  attachment we check with three different data firms are like that's like 200 000 plus data firms
[03:36:20.020 --> 03:36:25.460]  wouldn't do it because you're gonna open unattached stuff you could open child porn so it gets a
[03:36:25.460 --> 03:36:30.980]  little suspicious doesn't it whoever's behind it we refuse to judge we say we're not opening all
[03:36:30.980 --> 03:36:36.580]  the attachments we never open she goes okay just give us the emails and then they find
[03:36:36.580 --> 03:36:44.260]  it 12 emails death-threading me hidden links to child porn and my point here is is that this blew
[03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:49.540]  up with her face i don't just put a good face on things everyone i talked to and and every outlet
[03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:54.500]  out there says oh my god this is a hoax this is bad except the new york times the wall street
[03:36:54.500 --> 03:37:00.660]  journal the washington post and others they still are going with the hoax because they want to teach
[03:37:00.660 --> 03:37:07.700]  underlings to lie and that means we're over the target folks that anybody could send you child
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:14.580]  porn you never open it anybody can mail a postcard a child porn to your address and you throw it away
[03:37:14.580 --> 03:37:19.140]  or you call the police they say you're guilty no the cops don't say you're guilty the democrats do
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:25.620]  so the good news is no one is buying this but it shows the hysteria level they've gone to
[03:37:25.620 --> 03:37:31.940]  so here's part of that blaze tv what's what's going back i'm not trying to be funny here
[03:37:31.940 --> 03:37:39.140]  what's this co-hosting shep or something uh point is it's it's it's it's the it's the
[03:37:39.140 --> 03:37:45.540]  co-host doing this so so here's even my enemies haven't even met the truth here it is media
[03:37:45.540 --> 03:37:50.740]  is giving a good challenge here because of this story that's going on he is currently being sued
[03:37:50.740 --> 03:37:56.980]  about the sandy hook situation and so here are the headlines from all over the media and you'll
[03:37:56.980 --> 03:38:02.100]  notice some names on here that should supposedly be much better right like i mean raw story they're
[03:38:02.100 --> 03:38:06.100]  going to write whatever headline they want to write but the new york times is on here buzz feed
[03:38:06.100 --> 03:38:10.740]  a usa today wall street journal and all of them pretty much say the same thing alex jones sent
[03:38:10.740 --> 03:38:16.340]  emails containing child porn to sandy hook victims lawyers look at new york times alex jones legal
[03:38:16.340 --> 03:38:21.540]  team is said to have sent child porn in sandy hook hoax case alex jones sent files containing child
[03:38:21.540 --> 03:38:28.260]  pornography to lawyers there's like what kind of psychopath sends child porn to the victims of a
[03:38:28.260 --> 03:38:34.820]  shooting like this is i mean even for alex jones sounds completely insane and it would be if it
[03:38:34.820 --> 03:38:42.660]  were at all true this is like i mean you want to talk about media malpractice what happened here
[03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:46.980]  is that alex jones is being sued and they're trying to get the information about how he came
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:53.780]  up with these conspiracy theories so the lawyers asked alex jones in discovery in the lawsuit
[03:38:53.780 --> 03:38:59.220]  to send him all of the files that were on the server and all the emails that were on the server
[03:38:59.220 --> 03:39:03.460]  because we want to check the emails so what he did and this you know this isn't you know i don't
[03:39:03.460 --> 03:39:09.300]  know how high quality alex jones's lawyers are but he just literally overshared he turned over
[03:39:09.300 --> 03:39:14.740]  everything so he turned over not over the only things that he was uh he was uh you know emailing
[03:39:14.740 --> 03:39:18.740]  internally which is obviously the focus of so let's get pause for a minute that that's stew i i looked
[03:39:18.740 --> 03:39:25.300]  up his name myself i'm not being catty here that's stew his co-host and and and again no i didn't
[03:39:25.300 --> 03:39:31.700]  overproduce we had like eight hearings i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and this judge
[03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:36.900]  said you'll give us everything all right and make him open the attachments like
[03:39:36.900 --> 03:39:41.060]  federal crime open them we didn't know but i said no your honor we're not doing it
[03:39:42.100 --> 03:39:46.820]  didn't matter they scanned him and found the hidden stuff so again someone mails you something
[03:39:46.820 --> 03:39:54.340]  are you guilty no you're not let's continue with stew that's his name bex co-host the public email
[03:39:54.340 --> 03:39:59.940]  addresses and everything that flowed into them so in the public email addresses people were emailing
[03:39:59.940 --> 03:40:06.340]  info wars most likely trolls trying to screw with info wars sending him child porn to try to get him
[03:40:06.340 --> 03:40:11.940]  in trouble in some way how do we know that's not a false flag up that's a great point how do we know
[03:40:11.940 --> 03:40:16.020]  i don't really because i mean that really is what should happen here we should just say it is false
[03:40:16.020 --> 03:40:21.140]  flag but no i mean so basically this guy has a public you know you know info you know whatever

[03:40:26.340 --> 03:40:31.220]  and in there are terrible files he he over shares and gives them everything and then they go to the
[03:40:31.220 --> 03:40:38.340]  press and say alex jones just sent us child porn they sent him millions of emails and in there were
[03:40:38.340 --> 03:40:45.220]  some public ones about child porn you know the fact that like that story is the real story is
[03:40:45.220 --> 03:40:50.580]  you know it's it's not even it's nothing right like that shouldn't even be in public information

[03:42:49.300 --> 03:42:56.740]  ship info wars live dot com it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the
[03:42:56.740 --> 03:43:01.940]  public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach
[03:43:01.940 --> 03:43:06.260]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some
[03:43:06.260 --> 03:43:10.580]  billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent
[03:43:10.580 --> 03:43:16.340]  of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[03:43:16.340 --> 03:43:20.660]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[03:43:20.660 --> 03:43:25.380]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[03:43:25.380 --> 03:43:28.980]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[03:43:28.980 --> 03:43:33.140]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[03:43:33.140 --> 03:43:38.420]  control and manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[03:43:38.420 --> 03:43:43.540]  the info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the
[03:43:43.540 --> 03:43:47.780]  modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[03:43:47.780 --> 03:43:54.420]  onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you only very very clear with
[03:43:54.420 --> 03:43:59.300]  everybody about all of this we're going into the season of war and they have been inches from
[03:43:59.300 --> 03:44:02.820]  shutting down the final bank accounts we have do their criminal activity and their and their
[03:44:02.820 --> 03:44:08.420]  digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year we need to in here

[03:44:17.460 --> 03:44:22.420]  their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically i'm banging heads with them and they can't help
[03:44:22.420 --> 03:44:26.660]  but attack back with lies not just brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so

[03:44:36.180 --> 03:44:40.100]  mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message to the enemy i
[03:44:40.100 --> 03:44:44.420]  want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[03:44:44.420 --> 03:44:48.820]  and that you will stand with us and i will never back down you have my commitment this only gives
[03:44:48.820 --> 03:44:52.500]  me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this

[03:47:22.180 --> 03:47:26.740]  matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:30.660 --> 03:47:36.580]  okay i've got the next 10 minutes and no time for callers but don't worry i've got plenty to say
[03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:42.580]  just winding up what alex was saying in the last segment all of those major media outlets that ran
[03:47:42.580 --> 03:47:48.660]  those uh slanderous headlines they knew what they were doing that's the whole point it's like the
[03:47:48.660 --> 03:47:56.180]  trump tower meeting the point is just to get the headline half of americans that are only watching
[03:47:56.180 --> 03:48:01.780]  the news when they're flipping from reality shows to sitcoms all they're going to see is something
[03:48:01.780 --> 03:48:09.140]  like alex jones sent kitty porn period mission that's it mission accomplished they got that what
[03:48:09.140 --> 03:48:14.500]  they wanted that's it that's all they wanted truth be damned and that's why it truly is
[03:48:14.500 --> 03:48:21.860]  fake media okay it's been a week excuse me it's been a week since the uh the tanker attacks
[03:48:21.860 --> 03:48:29.140]  in the straits of uh hormuz straight of hormuz and i guess i was a contrarian around here because
[03:48:29.140 --> 03:48:36.900]  i actually do believe it was an iranian mine uh planted by iranians and removed by iranians
[03:48:37.700 --> 03:48:43.780]  i i have a lot of reasons to think this one of them is i may be the only person that you've
[03:48:43.780 --> 03:48:50.660]  listened to all week that's actually ever in his life held a limpet mine in his hands or
[03:48:50.660 --> 03:48:57.860]  swum underwater with a limpet mine using no bubble uh rebreathers uh been a passenger on a swimmer
[03:48:57.860 --> 03:49:05.380]  delivery vehicle getting under ships planting mines climbing up on ships so a lot of what you're hearing
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:12.180]  are so-called former analysts and they might be really knowledgeable within their uh within their
[03:49:12.180 --> 03:49:19.220]  territory but when it comes to mines and ships give me a little bit of credit all right i've
[03:49:19.220 --> 03:49:25.540]  been there and done it now i've heard people say if they wanted to sink a tanker they would have
[03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:31.780]  put the mine under the waterline this shows on many levels that these so-called experts have no
[03:49:31.780 --> 03:49:39.700]  effing clue what the eff they're talking about for one thing a tanker is not a giant bathtub
[03:49:39.700 --> 03:49:49.060]  with one big uh one big floating uh pool of oil inside it's divided into dozens of cells
[03:49:49.700 --> 03:49:55.220]  putting a hole in one cell of a tanker is not going to cause it to sink whether it's above
[03:49:55.220 --> 03:50:02.420]  or below the waterline a tanker is actually within a constraints of a fairly small explosive device
[03:50:02.420 --> 03:50:10.500]  is a pretty hard item to sink but what you can do if you're very good is cause a massive fire
[03:50:10.500 --> 03:50:16.660]  that could spread through the ship and then cause you know a huge uh uh photogenic video
[03:50:16.660 --> 03:50:23.940]  opportunity for the world press so i would say out of four limpet mines on two ships the iranians
[03:50:23.940 --> 03:50:31.460]  had one success that's that picture right there the other two uh on one ship they did mine didn't
[03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:38.260]  even detonate so they had the whoops come running back and take it off anybody that says hey well
[03:50:38.260 --> 03:50:45.060]  maybe it was saudi's dressed up like iranians with an exact duplicate of an exact you know
[03:50:45.060 --> 03:50:52.100]  customized made iranian produced speedboat that came and took it off to make the iranians look bad
[03:50:52.660 --> 03:51:00.980]  listen folks let's get real just because we have deep state domestic enemies that are globalists
[03:51:00.980 --> 03:51:10.340]  they're real pos i get it they're domestic enemies that doesn't mean that our real foreign enemies
[03:51:10.340 --> 03:51:16.820]  are suddenly cuddly petty bears that are just trying to get along in the world and it's mean
[03:51:16.820 --> 03:51:23.380]  old uncle sam and donald trump who's being tricked by the neocons because i ran just once peace they're
[03:51:23.380 --> 03:51:30.660]  just wonderful guys this is such a load of crap hold two things in your mind at the same time
[03:51:30.660 --> 03:51:37.860]  yes we have deep state domestic enemy globalists that would love to that would love to sabotage
[03:51:37.860 --> 03:51:44.260]  donald trump i get it and they would love to draw us into a war i get it but at the same time we
[03:51:44.260 --> 03:51:52.420]  have long term very real enemies the guys yelling death to america uh since the the 70s and i was
[03:51:52.420 --> 03:51:59.140]  in bay root in the early 80s when they blew up a bunch of marines and it was really the iranians
[03:51:59.140 --> 03:52:06.500]  that did it okay it wasn't the cia it really was the iranians they really do hate our guts they really
[03:52:06.500 --> 03:52:12.980]  do consider us the great satan and there's an important generational aspect to this that is
[03:52:12.980 --> 03:52:19.940]  that the the leaders of the iranian revolution going back to 79 in the 80s they are getting very
[03:52:19.940 --> 03:52:25.940]  old you can say well you know they just believe in the afterlife that's true but human beings
[03:52:25.940 --> 03:52:31.460]  want to see things happen during their time on this planet and the generation that is still
[03:52:31.460 --> 03:52:39.220]  got a death grip on iran they're going to be gone they're aging out rapidly and if there's going to
[03:52:39.220 --> 03:52:47.620]  be anything happening with the great satan they want it to happen now now going back to 1988 that
[03:52:47.620 --> 03:52:53.460]  was what was called operation praying mantis that was the end of the tanker wars which lasted through
[03:52:53.460 --> 03:53:01.300]  the mid 80s concurrent with the iran iraq war the iranians were putting sea mines into the into
[03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:07.540]  the persian gulf ships were hitting them it was a low level war i know a lot about it navy seals
[03:53:07.540 --> 03:53:14.260]  were involved uh countering this they weren't just dropping mines out of of wooden dowels they had
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:21.300]  actual mine laying vessels or military vessels rolling mines off the back i know this for effect
[03:53:21.300 --> 03:53:26.740]  and let me tell you something this is what i learned that you can snipe somebody from a
[03:53:26.740 --> 03:53:31.940]  helicopter especially if you're on a you know ship that's making some noise it's got an ambient
[03:53:31.940 --> 03:53:38.580]  engine hum we can snipe people from a helicopter when the people being sniped don't even know
[03:53:38.580 --> 03:53:44.180]  there's a helicopter in the sky all right folks it's night time you're making noise you're laying
[03:53:44.180 --> 03:53:50.100]  mines the next thing you know people are dropping and bleeding around you we were in that war
[03:53:50.100 --> 03:53:55.460]  ever since then there are seals in this war now sure but they're not dressing up like iranians to
[03:53:55.460 --> 03:54:02.180]  plant fake limpet mines on ships to make the poor innocent iranians look bad hold the two things in
[03:54:02.180 --> 03:54:09.060]  your mind at the same time they really do hate us and the big weapon that iran has is the is
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:15.940]  geography geography and anti ship missiles there are articles floating around about you know what
[03:54:15.940 --> 03:54:22.980]  can the iranian missiles do against us naval vessels that's a debate sure but what they can do
[03:54:22.980 --> 03:54:29.540]  against tankers is stop tankers from going through the Straits of Hormuz they have thousands of
[03:54:29.540 --> 03:54:35.380]  variants of mobile missile launchers that are arrayed in that arc all the way around the
[03:54:35.380 --> 03:54:40.500]  Strait of Hormuz in range so they don't have to be sitting on the beach they can be a hundred
[03:54:40.500 --> 03:54:46.260]  two hundred miles back in the mountains an important lesson that everybody learned after
[03:54:46.260 --> 03:54:54.740]  Operation Desert Storm was that mobile missiles work much bigger scud missiles were being fired
[03:54:54.740 --> 03:55:01.940]  uh from from iraq into saudi arabia even as desert storm ended it ended politically a
[03:55:01.940 --> 03:55:07.780]  negotiated settlement but the missile teams were never stopped and those were gigantic fire truck
[03:55:07.780 --> 03:55:13.540]  sized scud missiles out in the open desert if you look at the map of the Strait of Hormuz you see
[03:55:13.540 --> 03:55:21.700]  it's it's very rugged terrain full of canyons and gullies uh and they're the iranians what they've
[03:55:21.700 --> 03:55:27.300]  been doing for the last 30 years since we whipped their butt with Operation Praying Manus and sunk
[03:55:27.300 --> 03:55:33.780]  half their navy they've developed their what they consider their trump card which is the ability to
[03:55:33.780 --> 03:55:40.580]  absolutely choke off the Strait of Hormuz and it's not america that is directly the target right
[03:55:40.580 --> 03:55:48.660]  now the target is europe and japan and korea so literally trump could tell merkel and uh prime
[03:55:48.660 --> 03:55:54.980]  minister abe hey it's not my problem we've got all the energy we need sucks to be you you should
[03:55:54.980 --> 03:56:00.260]  probably have a navy we're not going to go to war for the Strait of Hormuz that would be an option
[03:56:00.260 --> 03:56:04.820]  i'm sure the neocons are not going to entertain that they're going to say that would cause a
[03:56:04.820 --> 03:56:12.260]  global depression if the iranians you know start plinking tankers from their thousands of truck
[03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:20.180]  mobile missile launchers truck-borne anti-ship missiles that we literally cannot find and cannot
[03:56:20.180 --> 03:56:26.980]  stop not when you've got thousands of them in in many thousands of caves and other hiding places

[03:56:46.820 --> 03:56:52.820]  scenario that that old generation of iranians i was talking about the ones that want to see this
