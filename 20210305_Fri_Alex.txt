[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.000]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.000]  My friends, it is Friday, March 5th.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  The year is 2021 and we are now in the future.
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.000]  And we have a scientific dictatorship of mad scientists that have established world government
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  and are publicly announcing they are the saviors of Earth.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  They've scripted themselves and cast themselves as that.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  And we're all the bad guys that have to be dumbed down, stunned, and then orderly exterminated.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  That's David Rockefeller, that's Bill Gates, it's Ted Turner.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  It's all of them.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  It's Oprah Winfrey.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  So if we sit here and let these monsters do this, we deserve what we get.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  You know, they just came out yesterday in all the big publications, Wall Street Journal,
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  London Guardian, Forbes.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Oh, the U.N. has a report out and there's a big study.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  It was good to have the lockdowns that cut that evil carbon of the carbon-based life forms.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  You know, like humans and whales and trees and plankton.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  It's devilish.
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  Thank God the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are set up carbon exchanges where we pay them
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  anytime there's any type of carbon.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  It's a tax on life.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  It's like the joke in Spaceballs about a tax on breathing or having to buy cans of air.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  That's literally the point we're getting to.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  So we're going to be laying all this out today in a moment.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  Fauci, our king, our master, our lord.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  He's come out crying on TV.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  He loves you so much.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Don't listen to these states.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  Wear your mask.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  Even though he wrote a study in 2008 himself saying masks don't protect you from viruses.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's like, you know, saying you have a net for volleyball and a fly can fly through the spaces in it.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  It's all a fraud, but it's about your dirty, your bad, your evil.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  We'll play that in a moment.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  And then we're going to come back with Tucker Carlson laying out the real permanent martial law
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  and the occupation of our country we're facing.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  And then it's out.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  It's official.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  It's even in Reuters.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  I didn't need Reuters to tell me it was true.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  I don't just trust Reuters because I've done my background research.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  And it's exactly as we told you day one of the power outages in Texas.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  It was an Enron scam by Kerkot.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  That's all come out as well.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  So at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to lay all of that out.
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, here is Anthony Fauci, your doctor, your master, your king,
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  just like Bill Gates, telling you how you live your life and just so upset, wants to keep you safe, so incredibly bad.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Here he is.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  It just is inexplicable why you would want to pull back now.
[02:40.000 --> 02:51.000]  You understand the need to want to get back to normality, but you're only going to set yourself back if you just completely push aside the public health guidelines,
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  particularly when we're dealing with anywhere from 55 to 70,000 infections per day in the United States.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  That's a very, very high baseline.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  They have to keep the mask in place to teach us that we're in a permanent emergency and then, oh, you've had the vaccine.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  Sorry, you still got to wear it and you still can't go out in public.
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  And then once we've got the tracker apps on our phones, once we've got the QR codes, then if you're up to date with everything,
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  you don't have to wear a mask.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  You're like a gracious, godlike person that's behaved yourself.
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  And now there are all these videos and reports coming out of not just celebrities dying, but celebrities getting deathly ill.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  There's a flip of that with Ben Stein coming up.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  And why do I care about celebrities?
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  I don't.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  They can't cover up a Hank Aaron when he dies.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  They can't cover up all the people that have been dying after the vaccine that are well known because it comes out.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  That's why they had a line saying, oh, no, no, the coroner said he didn't die of the vaccine.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  His family said, no, he died after the second dose.
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.000]  There was no autopsy.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  So that's the level of dangerous deception we're dealing with.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  Well, they're lying now, ladies and gentlemen, at completely new levels.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  International News, again, said this week that Howard Stern did a puppet show with me.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  By the way, I love those puppet shows.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  I'm a big fan of them.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  Oh, that's actually reverse psychology.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  No more puppet shows.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  Howard Stern, I order you.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  No more puppet shows.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  But seriously, the Daily Mail took it and said that quotes from the puppet were me.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  I got to say, though, it's almost quotes from me, but they changed it around a little bit.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  It isn't that the vaccine gives you HIV.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's that it has the HIV delivery system, so it gives you a false positive for HIV, but what is it delivering?
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  If I'm delivering HIV, it's delivering a bunch of other stuff.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  They're trying to keep that very, very secret.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  That's why Australia has banned that particular vaccine that was telling people that they had HIV.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  OK, we're going to go to break.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  We're going to come back, and I'm going to play the best, most powerful Tucker Carlson yet.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  He just gets better and better, and it's so dead on.
[04:48.000 --> 05:00.000]  The permanent military occupation of D.C. has been announced.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021, and in just six days this Saturday,
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  the biggest sale ever on storeable food is going to end.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Because of the ice storms, the problems around the country are big supplier.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Highest quality storeable food at the lowest price, my patriot, is giving us the best deal ever.
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  Free shipping on all of their storeable food, and that's a big cost of storeable food is the shipping,
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  because it weighs a lot, and 10% off on top of it.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021, and then contractually they have to end the sale,
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  because they have hundreds of distributors, and they're getting mad,
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  and they were undercutting the price, and they decided to do this,
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  so it's exclusively available for just a few days left at infoawardsstore.com,
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  or paradox.com takes you right to specials. All their food, all their packages,
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  one month, six month a year, it's all paradox.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  Take advantage of it now, and it fuzzier forward.
[05:53.000 --> 06:09.000]  When I grow up I want to be a rock star.
[06:23.000 --> 06:33.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center,
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:38.000 --> 06:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, March 5th, the year is 2021.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  The entire planet and every species is under globalist attack.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  They are mad scientists engaged in a total genetic rewrite.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  Coming up next hour, I will interview live Dr. Sheri Tenpinio's major clinics in the U.S. and Mexico.
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  She has been predicting that the mRNA gene editing, gene therapy system would cause death
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  when you get the shot, and especially months after you get the shot,
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  and now her research and predictions are coming true.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  She's got bombshell lifesaving information coming up in the second hour.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Please amplify this transmission. This is a life and death situation.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  The nightmare only gets worse until we overpower the globalist with truth.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  We're doing it right now, so please share the live links to the show
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  and promote the local radio stations, and TV stations you're watching is beyond critical.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  First, in this segment and next segment, I'm going to air excerpts of Tucker Carlson last night
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  where he laid out the facts.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  General Honoré is a globalist. He's anti-gun.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  He was hired by George W. Bush, the total rhino, to confiscate guns,
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  not just in New Orleans during Katrina from high and dry areas, but all over the state.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  Honoré admits he wants to have a national gun confiscation program,
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  and he now recommends they have a permanent rapid reaction force of U.S. Army
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  or Praetorian Guard garrisoned permanently in the U.S. Capitol
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  because they fear and hate the American people so much
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  and because they've stolen the election and intend to do all this other really, really dangerous stuff
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  like in-the-dollar dominance, collapse our currency, open the borders completely.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  I mean, this is going to be so horrible as we're forced on universal basic incomes
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  and bankrupted just like they've done to poor black folks.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Now everybody's going to have that done to them.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  That's the model, is the great society of LBJ to domesticate us, to enslave us.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  And Carlson lays out how the average leftist has a disdain and a hatred for Americans
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  and for people who live in the country.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  Remember, the Biden said black people in Hispanics live in the country are dumb.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  They think everybody's dumb, but them, who are dumb enough to live in these dangerous, overpriced, scumbag,
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  newer border cities.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  And so we're not against the folks in cities. Most of them, you know, we're good.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  You're basically in a bad situation. It's just that they are coming down on humanity.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  But it's the Democrats that hate the common people.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  But the controllers above them know the common people are smart
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  and they want to force us in to these compact cities.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  So this is very, very predatory. Carlson lays it out beautifully.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  We're going to play part of it this segment and part of it next segment.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  And then it's official. We've solved it. We were correct.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  Now it's official. We know who triggered the fake blackouts to make $16 million a day.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight, liberals are a fearful group.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  The list of things American liberals are afraid of can fill an entire shelf of volume.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  So much to write them down, actually, to make an amusing reference set.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  The encyclopedia of liberal neuroses unabridged.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  Absolutely everything upsets liberals, agitates them, inflames their allergies.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  Nature itself is a terrifying experience for liberals because they can't control it.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  It's got all these sex differences and climate fluctuations.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  Liberals like this are the ones that you see sporting their little paper obedience masks
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  while they exercise outside on a windy day.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  They'll pass you on their bicycle struggling to breathe from oxygen deprivation,
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  yet feeling virtuous and protected and, of course, judging you for not wearing the uniform.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  There's nothing rational about that behavior.
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  It's totally unrelated to science, but you shouldn't be surprised by it.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  Modern liberalism is not a coherent worldview.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  It's not a set of principles or ideas.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  It's a personality type, a deeply unhappy, high-strung personality type.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  Wokeness is what you get when people are miserable inside.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  When you're a liberal, the world is a very scary place.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  But there is one fear that rises above all other fears in the liberal mind,
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  and it's the fear of the other.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  Like all primitive cultures, modern liberalism is tribal.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  Outsiders aren't welcome in the fashionable parts of Brooklyn.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  If you haven't been to Aspen, they don't want to see you in Bethesda or Newton mass.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  You're from a way. You're an alien presence, and therefore dangerous.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  That's in fact how liberals understand most of the American continent
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  as a mysterious dark space like a medieval map
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  populated by drooling Trump voters and violent illiterates with extra chromosomes.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Liberals despise people like this, of course,
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  and on some level they know they're hated right back.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  They worry that someday there will be a backlash against the people in charge,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  which of course is them.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  How long can you control everything before the people you control explode?
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  And that's liberals' main fear, a peasant revolt.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  They're terrified that someday an army of tattooed high school dropouts
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  and Confederate flag tank tops is going to rise up from the trailer parks of West Virginia
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  and take over the country.
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  They'll storm the cities with their 75 caliber AR-15 assault weapon machine guns
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  with flash suppressors, each one of which can fire over a million bullets per minute
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  when mounted on the back of an F-150 pickup truck plastered with racist bumper stickers.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  That is their nightmare.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  That is the monster under every liberal's bed.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  And a lot of liberals were certain that today, this day, March 4th,
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  was the day the right-wing revolution would finally begin.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  March 4th, they believed, was something called QAnon Inauguration Day.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  What's QAnon Inauguration Day?
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  We have no idea.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  We don't know anyone who does know.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  We bet money that not one Trump voter in a million had ever heard of it until this week
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  when the hysteria merchants on the other channels started yapping about it on television.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  They'd heard about it from Nancy Pelosi,
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  who told her bodyguards to write up a report on the threat of QAnon Inauguration Day.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  So that's what they did.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  Here's the excerpt from the bulletin put out with the top minds at DHS and the FBI.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  An unidentified group of militia violent extremists has discussed plans to take control of the U.S. Capitol on or about for March today.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Well, that sounds pretty scary.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Another white supremacist insurrection?
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  But wait a second.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Can we get some context?
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  Who exactly are these unidentified violent extremists?
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And is the threat they pose more or less dangerous, for instance,
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  than the plot by that homeless guy to kidnap the governor of Michigan,
[13:01.000 --> 13:08.000]  the FBI foiled just in time before a platoon of right-wing vagrants could abduct Gretchen Whitmer in a shopping cart?
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  We never really learned any details.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  But members of Congress were not taking chances.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  Many of them fled the Capitol today.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  House leaders rescheduled votes so that rank-and-file legislators could escape with their lives,
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  if not with their dignity.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  We should be clear this was not simply partisan hysteria.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Democrats and Republicans seem united in their shared terror.
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  Watch Republican Congressman Michael McCall of Texas tell you about the imminent threat we face from that diabolical QAnon.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  This threat is credible and it's real.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  It's a right-wing militia group that believes that the original,
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  because the original inaugural day was March 4th until the 20th Amendment passed,
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  they think this is a true inauguration day and that President Trump should be inaugurated.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  Sounds like Michael McCall has been on the Internet recently, maybe late at night.
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  That's why he knows the threat of right-wing militias, as he told CNN, is credible and real.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  That was Michael McCall's prediction yesterday.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  So the question is, did QAnon come through?
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  Did the guys in Confederate flag tank tops show up with their 75-calor machine guns to end democracy?
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  And if they did, what did they do?
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  We can report tonight that if they did try to insurrect, they did it very, very quietly and with minimal casualties.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  In fact, we didn't see a single person insurrecting at the Capitol today,
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  or for that matter, anywhere else in the United States.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Are you shocked? Don't be shocked.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  It was all just another lie.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  It wasn't so different from when they told us we would need troops to protect Joe Biden's inauguration.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  Then they said we would need soldiers to keep QAnon away from the impeachment trial.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  Then there was today's hysteria, next there will be something else, bad on it.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  Capitol police are now saying they will need soldiers in Washington for at least another two months.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  And of course, actually, the troops will never leave, as you probably figured out by now.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  The troops are in the Capitol for political reasons.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  They're there to prop up the regime.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  If this were Cameroon, that would all be obvious.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Our State Department would complain about it.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  Would say that's an offense against democracy.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  But because it's happening here in America, we have been slow to catch on.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  I hope you figured it out.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  Today, they made it easier for you to figure out, because they said it out loud.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  Fox News has learned that retired General Russell Honoré has completed his so-called security review of the January 6th riot at the Capitol.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  Honoré is an unhinged partisan extremist.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  He is nuttier than anyone affiliated with QAnon, anyone.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  Honoré was chosen by Nancy Pelosi precisely because of this.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  She knew that Honoré would justify a military takeover of Washington, and she was right.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  In his memorandum to House leaders, which Fox has obtained, that's exactly what Honoré did.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  His memorandum calls for a, quote, quick reaction force that permanently resides within the D.C. National Guard.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  By re-establishing a military police battalion and staffing it with active guard reserve troops who live in or near the city year round.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[16:06.000 --> 16:16.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[16:16.000 --> 16:24.000]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  In their own words, they admit it. So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[16:37.000 --> 16:44.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[16:44.000 --> 16:53.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.

[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:03.000 --> 18:19.000]  And we are back, my friends. I'm going to play the conclusion of Tucker Carlson's analysis last night as he rolled out the fact that they are scripting and they are casting the American people as terrorists
[18:19.000 --> 18:27.000]  and the globalists are the saviors and that protesting is terrorism, being accused shaman is terrorism, just having your own free speech is terrorism.
[18:27.000 --> 18:35.000]  And when you watch this 60 minutes piece that we're going to play clips of, the woman is like something out of a satire police state science fiction movie.
[18:35.000 --> 18:45.000]  She's like, and you were in the sacred area. It doesn't matter if you weren't violent. You're a terrorist. You deserve to be kept without bail.
[18:45.000 --> 18:57.000]  So she's interviewing him from jail. So talk about science fiction dystopia. The dystopics are doing this on purpose. I coined that term. They are dystopics.
[18:57.000 --> 19:06.000]  They establish dystopia on purpose because they enjoy dominating us and stomping on us and trampling us as George Arwell warned communists do.
[19:06.000 --> 19:17.000]  This communism itself is just a satanic system of governance. So we're going to go to this Tucker Carlson piece. It's very, very important. And this is permanent military occupation in D.C.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  The other day, 60 minutes decided to take a deeper look into this dangerous cult that's saying unapproved things about our leaders.
[19:25.000 --> 19:35.000]  Intrepid CBS correspondents sat down with QAnon's spiritual leader, not in a cave in Kandahar, but over Zoom from a conference room in jail where he's now being held without bail.
[19:35.000 --> 19:45.000]  Here, ladies and gentlemen, is QAnon Shaman. It's Chief Mullah. You may recognize him from the videos as Chewbacca Guy, stripped of his Viking horns.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  Your actions on January 6th were an attack on this country. Do you understand that?
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  Not, ma'am. My actions were not an attack on this country. That is incorrect. That is inaccurate entirely.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  How would you describe them?
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  My actions personally?
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  On January 6th.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  How would I describe them?
[20:05.000 --> 20:13.000]  Well, I sang a song, and that's a part of Shamanism. It's about creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber.
[20:13.000 --> 20:18.000]  I also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  I actually stopped somebody from stealing muffins out of the break room.
[20:23.000 --> 20:31.000]  I also said a prayer in that sacred chamber because it was my intention to bring divinity and to bring God back into the Senate.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  But, Jake, legally, you were not allowed to be in what you're calling the sacred chamber.
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  And that is the one very serious regret that I have, was believing that when we were waved in by police officers that it was acceptable.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  Do you still believe you're a patriot?
[20:47.000 --> 20:55.000]  I consider myself a lover of my country. I consider myself a believer in the Constitution.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  I consider myself a believer in truth and our founding principles.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  I consider myself a believer in God.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  Okay, so you've been taking notes on that interview with the spiritual leader of QAnon.
[21:11.000 --> 21:19.000]  Chewbacca guy sang a song, then he spread some good vibes, and then he waved at the officers in the Capitol and they waved back.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is the kind of thing that can happen in a country where QAnon shamans are allowed to roam the streets.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  And it's not just Chewbacca guy who threatens this democracy.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  The feds indicted several members of a group called the Oath Keepers.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  Those indicted included a 60-year-old woman and her 70-year-old husband. They're terrorists, too.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  Geriatric, but deadly.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee understands all this, of course. She gets the outline.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  Sheila Jackson Lee sits on the House Homeland Security Committee.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  So she knows a thing or two about law enforcement, about keeping this nation safe from threats foreign and domestic.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  In order to live without fear in America, Sheila Jackson Lee has announced, we're going to need to arrest a lot of people.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  Not just Chewbacca guy, tens of thousands of people.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  As Sheila Jackson Lee put it on Twitter two days ago, quote,
[22:06.000 --> 22:25.000]  In Washington, D.C. on January 6, where it is alleged that 40,000 protesters were in D.C. with the mindset to overturn a legitimate election and kill the speaker, the vice president, and members of Congress.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  That's right.
[22:27.000 --> 22:38.000]  This is a dystopic system. This is a dystopia on purpose by the dystopics, and they admit that that is their plan.
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.000]  George Arwell got into the highest levels of Fabian socialists. He was Winston Smith at the Ministry of Truth.
[22:44.000 --> 22:53.000]  He ran BBC Propaganda during World War II, and he realized that they were working with Stalin, and that Stalin was just as bad as Hitler.
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  And that's why the left later accused him of being a Nazi. You know, he fought against the Nazis in the Spanish Civil War, and then again as a propagandist in World War II.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  He wasn't. He was a liberal, a real liberal, and he had been involved in everything and been everywhere.
[23:06.000 --> 23:14.000]  A bit of imperial police in India, you know, gone and been homeless for years in Paris and London, gone to the highest levels of Fabian socialists.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  His family was part of the Wedgwoods and the Oxleys and Dalton's, the eugenics kings.
[23:19.000 --> 23:28.000]  He came from the inner circle. He was on the edge of the inner circle. They led him into the Fabian socialists whose symbol is a sheet with a wolf underneath it.
[23:28.000 --> 23:36.000]  And so when O'Brien's talking about, we're going to trample people and be trampled, we're going to tear humanity apart, we're going to dumb humanity down.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  Our cult is being the priest of power, Winston. Those are the real speeches that basically he got.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  I know that because he wrote essays before he died saying that these were composites of things he'd experienced and things he was projecting into the future.
[23:48.000 --> 24:00.000]  But one of his contemporaries and also related to him, Julian Huxley, wrote letters and also all essentially gave speeches saying, oh, you dummy, it won't be boots and stormtroopers.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  That's only for the small minority that don't do what we say. Everybody else will love their servitude.
[24:04.000 --> 24:14.000]  It will be so drugged by chemicals in the food and water, by what we put in vaccines and by what we do with the televisions that they will submit and love their servitude.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  So the average leftist has to understand, you think you're part of the system, you think you're part of the power structure, you're not.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  You're going along with your own complete destruction.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  And so that's why everything you do is more and more out of control.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  I mean, take the New York Times. Talk about incredible doublespeak.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Talk about incredible Orwellianism. Look at this headline right here.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  Look at that headline right there about Dr. Seuss.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  They're not book burning by wanting it removed out of libraries.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  They're not book burning by saying they don't want it sold. No, no, no, no.
[24:47.000 --> 24:53.000]  They're not, they're not bringing us a Ray Bradbury book in reality.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  No, no, they're retiring it.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  Like when an old horse breaks its leg, you shoot it in the head and retire it.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  We should call public executions retirement.
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  Dr. Seuss pushed to retire books, stirs a backlash.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  Dr. Seuss pushed. So they even call it Dr. Seuss.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  That's all written by psychologists for a person being trained in that.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Oh, it's Dr. Seuss doing it themselves and it's just retiring.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Isn't it okay if Dr. Seuss retires?
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  Isn't that okay if we have these boards, these education boards of high priest
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  and they tell you what you can have and, oh, it's just Dr. Seuss.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  Well, where did Dr. Seuss go? Oh, he just got retired.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  Oh, in the landfill. Well, people might dig it out of the landfill.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  No, no, no, we burned it or we shredded it and that's what they're recommending.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  They say have them incinerated or shredded.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  Okay, so here it is.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  Dr. Seuss pushed to retire books, stirs a backlash.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  Oh, there's a backlash because there's a push to retire these books.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  I've seen national news go, we're not banning books, we're retiring them.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  The same New York Times had an article a few weeks ago saying critical thinking is the problem.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  Don't look too deeply into things and only go with the New York Times folks.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  These are cult members following this.
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  So we have to reach out to them as the victims they are and not as the foaming at the mouth left as crazies.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  Because they're just like people brainwashed under mousey tongue.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  They really don't know what they're dealing with.
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  Now, we have officially solved the power outage crisis.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  It's exactly what we said it was. We were exactly right.
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  Now, even in Reuters, you go, wait, you listen to Reuters.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Reuters is admitting what we already said. It's confirmed.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Reuters is reporting on what the state found.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  So I'll break that down on the other side. Please don't forget only when we fund this operation, your support.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  I thank you so much for it. We have great products you need.
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  Tomorrow, we have to end the free food shipping and the storeable food, 10% off.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  So free shipping on the storeable food and 10% off.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  That has to end tomorrow.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  But the free shipping and some of the other sales will extend into next week on the other items.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  We cannot operate without you. So I thank you all for supporting us.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  The success is simple versus that.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  But I'll tell you this.
[27:10.000 --> 27:17.000]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  We have the power.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  So be the polar bears you are.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  And you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[28:20.000 --> 28:31.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[28:44.000 --> 28:54.000]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  March is here and we're running a special for only one week.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  Store rights reshipping up to 50% off on our best-selling items.
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  Free shipping on storeable food till this next Saturday and 10% off.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  Do you have any idea that most of the cost of storeable food is the shipping?
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  That is the best deal ever. Only till this Saturday.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  50% off.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  TurboForce, the 10-hour clean energy.

[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  Ultra12, the best item B12 out there.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  Take it out of the tongue.

[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  50% off.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  All of it free shipping.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  Amazing deals on all of our products.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  I'll be frank with you.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Stuff's so bad, fingers still out of control.
[29:34.000 --> 29:40.000]  I'm trying to sell everything so we actually have funds inside our coffers to keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  We're under a major globalist attack.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  Not because we're the enemy, but because we're standing between you and the globalist.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  The globalists want to bankrupt you.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  They want to enslave you.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  They want to depopulate you.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  They want to force inoculate you.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  Fund info wars and we'll take action against them in the fight.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  It's very bittersweet.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  I care about beating the new world order.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  But let's just say this.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  And then forwardstore.com.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  Do they fund freedom?
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  No, a lot of them don't.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  Owen Schreuer is about to take over in a few minutes.
[31:12.000 --> 31:18.000]  He'll be cohosting with me next hour when Dr. Sherry Tenpenny lays out life and death information.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  And only you can stop these murderers.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  Only you can expose them.
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.000]  Only you can stop them.
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  And I'm here to tell you, God expects you to do it.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  I'm not on your butt.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  I'm just telling you, you know deep in your heart and your gut and your soul,
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.000]  this is the right thing to do.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  This is war.
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.000]  This is information war.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  So it isn't just special when you share the articles or the videos and the live feeds
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  or tell folks about local stations.
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  It is victory.
[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  So just remember how important you are and how thankful I am you're there.
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  I mean it.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I'm committed to this war 110%.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  I want to win it just like you do.
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  Okay.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  Now let me lay this out.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  And again, this isn't about bragging.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  When I tell you that we predicted it exactly as it was,
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  it's because it's so easy to do this.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  The enemy runs formulas.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  They run operations and they've got different forms of operations,
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  different flavors of operations,
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  different combinations of these evil operations they run,
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  but it's all very formulaic.
[32:13.000 --> 32:19.000]  It's all written up and prepared by lawyers so they can get away with the crime.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  You understand?
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  And so we're going to lay this out for you right now.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  This is how the globalist control the planet.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  Is it just about the money?
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  It's about bankrupting who they want as a political weapon.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  And they want to bankrupt everybody.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  They want total consolidation.
[32:33.000 --> 32:38.000]  They want the future because money is power that they can make all the decisions in the future
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  with the super technologies that have been developed and suppressed.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  They don't want to give us access to those,
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  but they know technologies that they've already farmed out,
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  they've already had people discover decades ago are now being discovered by others.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  So they want world government in place so that as others discover technologies that they've already developed,
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  they can suppress through world government and through regulations those new technologies
[33:00.000 --> 33:03.000]  and keep us in a neo feudalistic dark age.
[33:03.000 --> 33:08.000]  So if you go back to the freeze of Valentine's Day,
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.000]  I was on here and I said,
[33:11.000 --> 33:19.000]  I expect major rolling blackouts and I expect them to then gouge billions of dollars per day
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  ripping people off.
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  And then they'll charge a few companies and a few executives will resign,
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  but tens of billions of dollars will be stolen
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  and then that'll be used to set the president to then raise rates overall.
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  How did I know?
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  Because Enron did it all to the west coast in other areas in the world,
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  but mainly the west coast.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  They stole energy, they manipulated, they had fake trading boards,
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  they did it all and it came out their documents that they would use fake rolling blackouts
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  to create the pretext, but there wasn't enough power
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  because in the public and legislatures they found psychologically would accept higher rates
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  and being gouged if they were told that things were maxed out.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  So they create artificial scarcity so they can charge you more.
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  It's very, very simple.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  Enron came up with a whole carbon tax plan as well in 1989
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  and you can look that up.
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  That's been in congressional testimonies.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  I cover that in my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement as well.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  So here's Reuters and yet I don't just believe Reuters,
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  it's just Reuters confirming what we already knew
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  and it's from the state legislature.
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  You can look it all up yourself.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  And what does this say right there?
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  Because I said two, three weeks ago when this all happened,
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  I said, I don't know how many billions are going to steal a day.
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  But I said, here's the department of, about a week later,
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  we also found or sent us the Department of Energy document
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  where the Texas legislature and the governor and the Texas Railroad Commission,
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  that's who runs Energy here, was saying, hey, we get federal fines
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  if we turn up these coal power plants without your authorization,
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  because the greenhouse gases, but we can turn these up ahead of the storm.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  We think we're going to have more power needed than we normally do during the winter.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  Summer's usually the high output, but this is going to be big.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  We want to turn it up.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  And the feds waited six days until the power outage began
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  and then they gave them the authorization.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  Because here's the deal, if you turn up your power output,
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  it's fines in the millions of dollars.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  But if you don't tell them in turn up power, it's felonies and they take you to jail.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  So Texas is not independent.
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  We need to get out from under this.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  Trump was unable to ever get that regulation change.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  He got a lot of it fixed, but that just shows you the big problem
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  was that Department of Energy document.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  But if you go back to the first freeze, what happened?
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  I said, you watch.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  We're going to have major power outages.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  And they're going to say it's because we have a bad grid.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  It's not part of the national grid and we need to have more windmills.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  And sure enough, they did that.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  But I said, following Enron, I don't know how many billions they're going to steal.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  But I said, they were stealing up to $3 billion a day in the early 1990s
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  when they would stage power outages.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  So I said, money's been devalued probably three times then.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  So I guessed on there, I said, I bet they were stealing $9 billion a day.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  I said, $9 billion a day.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  $16 billion a day.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  So I got it wrong, folks.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  Sorry, I said $9 billion.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  And seriously, we have an archivist who does a great job thanks to you supporting us.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  We have the money to pay an archivist.
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.000]  He's great.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  Hey, archivist, please go back to the days before, the days of the freeze,
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  and throughout where I laid this out, please.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  So the railroad commission running our energy, they got convinced under Republican governors
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.000]  that they're just as bad as Democrats in many cases to transfer regulatory systems to ERCOT
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  that's just like Enron.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  And then ERCOT goes under federal control, does whatever the feds say.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  Then there's no liability for the Texas bureaucrats because now they're not going to go to jail
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  if they make a mistake.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  So that's another reason that under all these regulations,
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  so many people want an outside corporate regulatory body to do it
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  because then you're off the hook in the criminal and civil statutes.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Oh, we have a group that manages the nursing homes.
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  Oh, we have a group that manages our state's energy.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  Oh, we have a group that manages our money like the private federal reserve for 109 years.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  No, 108 years.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Hard to believe it's been that long.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  So here's the headline, folks, exactly what we thought.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  But oh, it's an accident.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  They screwed up.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  And it's only for one day.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  They were overcharging billions a day the whole time.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  They're not sure of the numbers yet.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  They'll get back with us later.
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.000]  But they charged in the day after the power was back on and they weren't even buying it from outside groups
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  and up to 18,000 times the regular price, which of course they'd already made in deals with those people.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  So it's revolving door to pay themselves off.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  Texas grid operator made 16 billion price error during winter storm.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  Watchdog says, Reuters, Texas power grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  It's not Texas.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  It's a private corporation running out of Germany.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  Made 16 billion pricing error in the week of the winter storm that led to power outages across the state.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  Potomac Economics, which monitors the state's power market set.
[38:14.000 --> 38:23.000]  ERCOT kept market prices for power too high for more than a day after widespread outages ended late on February 17th.
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.000]  Potomac Economics said, an infinite market monitor for the Public Utility Commission of Texas,
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  which oversees ERCOT said in a filing, in order to comply with the commission order,
[38:34.000 --> 38:42.000]  the pricing interventions and raise prices to VOL value of lost load should have ended immediately at that time.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  Last February 17th, Potomac Economics said, but in just the next day and a half, they charge $16 billion.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  But wait, it gets worse.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  These are just the latest numbers.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  The numbers are a few weeks behind.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  Who knows?
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Everybody I know is still getting giant bills now.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  Why not?
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  You let them rape you.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  You wear a mask.
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.000]  You let them send convicted pedophiles and drag queen story time to have your daughters and sons bounce on their swollen genitals.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  They got pants on.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  They're like, your kids are riding on them.
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.000]  I mean, you'll put up with anything because they put us under this Enron type system, ERCOT.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  They shut down over 120 coal power plants in Texas.
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.000]  And the others that still had licenses to operate have to operate in a fraction of that unless there's an emergency.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Then they got to call mommy or daddy or big brother in D.C.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  And he's got to give them authorization.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  So there you have it.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  Go read the whole article.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  It gets worse.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  And it's exactly what we knew.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  And of course they knew damn well what they were doing.
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  That's why a lot of smaller Texas utilities that were good owned by cities, owned by counties, owned by private groups,
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  they just said, we're going out of business.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  We're just going to send the power to people, but we're not even going to charge them because this is criminal.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  And we're not going to go to jail.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  We're not going to charge some old lady in the Texas Hill Country 10,000, 15,000 times.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Their power bill is usually 100 bucks.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  And they can barely pay it on fixed income social security.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  And now she gets a $2,000 bill, a $7,000 bill.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  And so they did the right moral thing and just said, we were not operating.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  We're going to keep the power on, but we're done.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  We're bankrupt because they're passing those expenses down through.
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  So when you think it was your local utility that did that, in most cases it was not, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's ERCOT that again makes those decisions and tells everybody how to do it.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  And that's why it's so critical we stay on air.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  It's why they want to software because I understand how they operate because I've watched them so long.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  I covered Enron for years.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  It was in documentaries about it.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  But look, you understand what's going on as well.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  We need the legislatures and the people to stand up and send these folks to prison,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  or they're going to keep doing it over and over again.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  Because we hear smart this, smart that, the great reset.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  It's about running these types of scams against us on a routine basis.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  And it's being done worldwide by the globalists to impoverish us and control us while they consolidate power.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  Owen Schreuer is taking over and then Dr. Sherry Timpinney on the other side in the next hour.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  Infowars.com.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Listen, I was asking all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Why do you do that?
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  Boom, we did it.
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's popular in sex three.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  Is it better than X2?
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  You decide.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  It's different strokes, different folks.
[41:23.000 --> 41:29.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  And that is down and out.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at infowars.com and free shipping.

[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can.
[42:15.000 --> 42:23.000]  And get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  At infowarstore.com, whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.

[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  Thank you so much.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  The globalists want you dependent.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  They want you alone.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  They want you bankrupt.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  They want you starving in the dark.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  That is what their entire spirit is driving for because they want total submission.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  When you get high quality, storeable food that lasts more than a decade,

[43:22.000 --> 43:27.000]  a free shipping and 10% off, but it must end this Saturday.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  There's only a few days left at infowarstore.com.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  Their entire catalog at infowarstore.com is 10% off with free shipping.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  And with food, a big part of the cost is the shipping.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  So, unprecedented sale, it's going to end this Saturday in just a few days.
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  Infowarsstore.com takes you to the main page.

[43:56.000 --> 44:01.000]  Actually, both of these blocks, UHF frequencies.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us,
[44:06.000 --> 44:15.000]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[44:15.000 --> 44:21.000]  Now, with the infowar's privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.

[44:32.000 --> 44:39.000]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  Now, you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  infowarstore.com
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  Watchman! Watchman!
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.000]  Live from the infowar.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  And now, your host, Owen Shroyer.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Alright, I'll be with you here for this segment.
[45:30.000 --> 45:40.000]  And then Alex Jones and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny are going to break down the dangers, the lies of the COVID-19
[45:40.000 --> 45:48.000]  human genome manipulation, gene therapy, they're calling it a vaccine.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  But I've been doing so much prep today.
[45:50.000 --> 45:57.000]  I've got enough news to be live on air till 6 p.m. this evening, which is convenient
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  because I will be on air till 6 p.m. this evening.
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  So, I've got all kinds of breaking news.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  You're not going to want to tune out of infowar's today.
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  But let me do kind of a primer because we've got Biden developments, we've got censorship developments,
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  we've got the new lie, their fake insurrection yesterday didn't take,
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  so they've now released the new date for the fake insurrection.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  It's funny, liberals and leftists and Democrats announced dates
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  that supposedly Trump supporters are going to be having insurrections.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  But we never heard about this.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  We, of course, had nothing to do with this.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  We never planned any insurrection.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  It's literally all the Democrats.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  So that'll be coming up as well.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  And then they say, oh, wow, I don't know what happened yesterday.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  We said there was going to be an insurrection and nothing happened.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  Oh, I guess we lied again.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  Oh, well, don't worry, we're going to lie again about March 20th now.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  But we'll get into that coming up.
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  Let me do a primer for Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and Alex Jones coming up here.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  This is going to be one to watch.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  Now, we've been monitoring this.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  We reported on it first a couple of weeks ago.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  And I'm not so sure I'm willing to jump the shark on it yet,
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  but it feels like this could be really bad.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  And maybe Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will talk about it coming up here.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  But the story from Madonna Salazar, infowars.com,
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  mammograms find lumps in women's breasts following COVID shot.
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  Now, again, infowars is just willing to be honest about the situation we're in.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  Most other media is not.
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.000]  So when we saw the stories from weeks ago where they were telling women
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  to have their mammograms before they get their COVID vaccine,
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  or at least wait a year, and then reading into the details,
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  realizing they wouldn't admit what was really happening.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  Now they're having to.
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  You basically have false, what they're claiming is false positives coming up
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  for cancer on these screenings.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  And it's not just mammograms.
[47:54.000 --> 48:03.000]  So COVID, the COVID vaccine is causing false positive cancer screenings.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  Allegedly false.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Now, we don't really know.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  This is all one giant experiment on the entire planet,
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  and it's now been admitted by Fauci and the CDC yesterday.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  That's why they say, oh, after you get the vaccine,
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  you still have to social distance, you have to wear the mask,
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  all this stuff, you could probably still spread it.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  This is an experiment.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  They haven't done human testing, animal testing, no testing.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  This is the live test.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  And now they're realizing as part of the live test,
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  hey, some humans, it looks like they have cancer after getting the vaccine.
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  Oh, well, that's not cancer.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  We just have to wait a year, and then we'll see if it's cancer.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  But then maybe they'll be dead, but I guess we'll see.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  And see, this is pretty extreme to say the COVID-19 vaccine is causing cancer.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  So I'm not sure I'm ready and willing to jump that shark yet,
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  but boy, oh boy, boy, oh boy, could it go there real quick.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  And they'll cover it up for a year until people start dying,
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  and then they'll just hope you forget that they had the COVID vaccine.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  So we'll be monitoring this at Infowars.com, guarantee it.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  But now, into some of the other COVID nonsense,
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  Andrew Cuomo AIDS rewrote July nursing home report to conceal COVID death toll.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  So he knew something was up.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  So he's either a complete idiot by sending COVID into the nursing homes,
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  or he did it intentionally.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  Either way, he covered up, and now he's been caught.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  But see, oh, now four, what is it, four accusers now accusing him of sexual harassment.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  How nice to get him killing grandma out in the nursing homes out of the headlines.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  What a criminal scumbag Andrew Cuomo is.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  There's certain men that just put off the frequencies of evil.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  There's certain men that put off the frequencies of gangster, criminal.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  Andrew Cuomo is one of those men.
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.000]  CNN doctor says Americans should mask up and social distance every winter to beat the flu.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  There you go.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  So now they're admitting this is the new normal.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Liberals will never take the mask off.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  They love being slaves.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  It's part of the liberal psychology.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  I can't relate to it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  You can't relate to it.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  We like to be free.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  Liberals love slavery.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  I've also learned another thing about liberals, which we already knew,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  but I've reached a total conclusion now about it.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  I'll cover it later.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  But liberals just lie.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  They just love to lie.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  They just lie.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  They're not dishonest about anything.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  They're dishonest about everything.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  They're even dishonest to their own intellect.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  So it's really amazing.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  But they won't take the mask off in Texas.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  They won't take the mask off any winter.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  They love the mask now.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  They're good little slaves.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  They'll take the anal swab.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  They'll put in a butt plug if they say farts are contagious.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  You watch.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  You watch.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  Warner Media's CEO apologizes after saying COVID pandemic has been really good for CNN ratings.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Oops.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  This is kind of like how Amazon and Facebook and other executives said,
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  wow, this pandemic has been great for us.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  We've been really, we've made about like bandits.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  So we need to keep the lockdowns.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  So, of course, the people in big tech and the people in big media want to keep the lockdowns
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  because they keep getting paid.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  In fact, they're making more money now than they've ever made in their lives.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  So you suffer.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  The world suffers.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  People suffer.
[51:27.000 --> 51:31.000]  They get filthy rich and they encourage it to continue.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  Go figure.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  Guardian promotes global lockdown every two years to combat climate change.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  No, it wasn't just the Guardian.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  As the Steve Watson article at info wars.com says it was Forbes.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  It was all of them.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  But what they're doing is they're just, they're soft admitting to you what's really happening.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  You've been signed into the Paris Climate Accord.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  You now have a cap on your energy use.
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  That's why they shut off Texas's energy.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  So Biden put you in the climate accord with the Paris Climate Accord.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  So you've been used to using say, I'm just making up numbers here.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  You've been used to using a hundred watts of energy a day.
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  The Paris Climate Accord says you can only use 20 a day.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Well, they never told you what was happening.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  So all of a sudden you're going to have your power cut off and be told you have to limit your power usage.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  And they won't even tell you why.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  And that'll just turn into, well, we just have to lock everything down and shut the power grid down every two years.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  And they're admitting it.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  But it's not that they're admitting it.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  They signed us on to this deal.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  It's already signed, sealed and delivered.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  New York tests vaccine passports at New York Rangers hockey game.
[52:40.000 --> 52:48.000]  Vaccine passport system started in Israel and other countries is now here in the United States of America.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  So enjoy your slavery.
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  13 Woke corporations fighting back against Texas mask mandate repeal.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  So here's 13 places I will not be shopping in Texas.
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  Just so you know, Macy's on American traders.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Toyota on American traders.
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  Hyatt on American traders.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  CVS on American traders.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  Hyatt hosted the CPAC.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  So that's funny.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  They're probably trying to gain political points here.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  CVS, Walgreens, AMC.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  Are they even still in business?
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  Bad move by AMC.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  Everyone's going to sell now.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  GM, Alamo Draft House.
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  They're out of business.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  So I'm not sure what they care.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  Aldi, HEB on American and Kroger.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  So there are the American corporations that want you to be a good mask slave and they will be the mask Nazis.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  And soon it will be the anal swab.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  The new national anthem for the brainwash slave mind liberals.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  It's not the national anthem of the United States.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  Land of the free home of the brave.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  No, it's wear a mask and swab that ass.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  China mandates anal COVID swab tests for all visitors.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  That's coming to you.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  I'm excited for that day.
[54:00.000 --> 54:07.000]  You watch liberals are going to line up and bend over to get that anal swab.
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  Newsome urges double masking for all Californians will not make terrible mistake like Texas.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  Yeah.
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  And they keep saying this.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  Oh, super spreader event at the Super Bowl.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  Super spreader event here.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  Super spreader event at the Trump event.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  Super spreader event.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  No spread.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  No sickness.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  Nothing.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  All a giant lie and all the science that we actually have on the mask indicates that it
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  spreads disease.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  But again, liberals are liars.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  And I'll tell you, I calling me a liar or a fraud or a phony is like the most offensive
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  thing that you could say to me.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  So I don't like assuming somebody is a liar and I don't like sitting here pointing the
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  finger at somebody being a total fraud and a liar.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  But I'm sorry.
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  The average liberal is a lying scumbag.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's sad that this is the point we've reached with our fellow humans.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  Judge rips kids away from moms who get caught not wearing masks.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  Yeah.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Again, you're just a total slave to the liberal mask Nazis.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  Some people are fighting back against it though.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  Idaho rep introduces bill to ban mask mandates.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  I mean, go figure a bill that says you can breathe clean air and not carbon dioxide that
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  will kill you and give you hypoxia.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Amazing.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  North Dakota Republicans eject anti mask rep from house for trumped up harassment charges.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  When they told him to wear the mask, he said f off.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  You're not my effing mother.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  Not the hero we asked for, but the hero we need.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  And now it's coming out.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  Obesity is fueling vastly higher COVID death toll.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  No kidding.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  But you don't see anybody encouraging exercise.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Heart disease up.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  Obesity skyrocketing.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  Diabetes skyrocketing.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  There's your real problem.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  The food you're eating.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  But no, everyone gets a mask and a swab, but don't lose weight and be healthy.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M Full Wars.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  And we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  It is down and out.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of a larian root extract concentrate.
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  It's incredible.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  But world government is only the control grid.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  and obtain immortality.
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  They are playing God.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  to carry out this transformation.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  It's insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on record.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  You have been warned.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[57:45.000 --> 58:14.000]  This is The Alien Takeover of Earth.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[58:19.000 --> 58:27.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  I am Alex Jones.
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.000]  I am your host, Owen Schroyer.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  He is writing Shotgun with us as well today.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  We have Dr. Sherry Tinpinny joining us.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  A medical doctor, runs major clinics in the U.S., major clinics internationally.
[58:42.000 --> 58:46.000]  She's been on the tip of the spear for decades since she saw vaccines hurting her patients.
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  She just saw cause and effect, like all of us can see, like Hank Aaron's family.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  Yeah, he took the second shot.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  Was that a day later?
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  In his cruciating pain.
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  Media said he had an autopsy.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  He didn't have one.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  It's all lies.
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.000]  They are exterminating people.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  And I'm not a virtue signaler.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  I just told what's happening.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  The left, oh, we love black people.
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  Oh, black people are so good.
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  Everything's about black people.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  We've got to ban your books and your speech and your country for black people.
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  But then, these mRNA vaccines, I don't want to say it's doubly bad for black folks,
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  even though those numbers are coming out.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  I know black people that died after they took the vaccine.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  I mean, people all went to high school with it.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  So this is absolutely huge.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  And I'm trying to get permission from the family and folks to talk about it.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  So yeah, oh, we love black people cause they're coming to kill you.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  Whatever they say, it's the opposite.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  So I don't care if you're a white supremacist or who you are.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  We're really going to sign on to actually kill black people for no reason.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  And it kills white people too.
[59:41.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's just that it is really bad for folks with African ancestry.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  She is coming on.
[59:48.000 --> 59:53.000]  She's laid out some incredible statements about the deaths coming later.
[59:53.000 --> 59:57.000]  It's just the vaccine's so deadly, so poisonous that it kills a lot of folks up front
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  within a few minutes or a few hours or a few days.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  But that's because it's got to be so deadly to get you a month,
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  six months a year later, two years later.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  And then they're going to say a new virus is killing everybody.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  Later, it's a binary weapon.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  A lot's going into this.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  They didn't put five different viruses in this for no reason.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  But that's just the virus itself.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  It's not that deadly unless you don't have vitamin D3.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  So people live in these urban canyons, you know,
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  or dying whether they be black or white, but officially black folks have to have three times
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  the amount of sun as the average northern European,
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  a southern European needs a lot more sun than a northern European.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  For example, white people have white skin to get the sun because you get less.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  The closer you go to the equator, the darker your skin gets.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Wow, that's incredible.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  The adaptations that God gave us, the way God designed it.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  So this is a life-saving issue for everybody coming up.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  But if we could just get through the black people
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  who are left crying to mind control and say,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  hey, they don't give you welfare and try to break your families up
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  and put you in prison because they like you.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  They don't ship drugs in your neighborhood because they like you.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  They don't want to give you the vaccine first because they like you.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  They want to get rid of you.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  They want to get rid of you.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And sure, I don't like a bunch of black folks brainwashed to hate me because I'm white.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  The left does that to make white people hate black people.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  See how this works? It's called divide and conquer.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  But I'll say this again, everyone listening, I say this all the time,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  but can I get your attention?
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  We're on over 200 radio stations.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  We're on over 100 cable and TV stations.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  We're getting new ones all the time.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I don't plug them on air so they don't get harassed by the left.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  But they're out there and people can find them.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Tell people about that local station.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Tell folks about infowars.com.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Tell them what to do with newswars.com.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  And tell them you're about to hear Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  who they're banning on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or interviews.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  So we'll call this interview, you know, medical doctors.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  See, interview band of medical doctor,
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  warning of COVID-19 vaccine death or something like that.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  This is life and death, folks. This is a eugenics operation.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Hitler was dead 70 something years ago.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  This is what Hitler wished he could do.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  This is Hitler 2.0. This is the real deal.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Hitler wants everybody.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  But he got eugenicists in and racist in.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  The spirit did.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Satan, about Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Satan.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Because they're like, oh, yeah, I want to kill the brown people.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  And they get them to carry out eugenics operations
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  because they think they're hitting one group.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  They're hitting everybody, folks.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  His wife could eat no lean.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Between the two of them, they lick the platter clean.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  They always think, oh, we're only going to kill half the world population.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  We're only going to kill 80%.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  We're only going to kill 90%.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  And really, they're going to get everybody.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  It's a post-human world.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  So tell folks to tune in now on your Twitter, on your Facebook.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  So what have you been?
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  You're going to get banned anyways.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Share it on your email, your text message while you still can.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Word of mouth.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Tune in now Medical Doctor to expose the mass eugenics
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  extermination going on with these vaccines.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  These aren't words.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  This is the reality in foewars.com.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  They want to make you ashamed of that and scared to promote it.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  But you're not and you've been promoting it.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  And so if I'm going to get put in prison or killed for this,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  I want to win.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I'm not doing this to lose.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  I know we're going to win.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  My new chairman was in battles.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  He's invincible.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that,
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  because this is scary what's going on.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  The global government in the New World Order.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Now that people hold up the text, that's real.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  They won't somebody to come save them from.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled,
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  depending on the drug, once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain,
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  the energy cost, everything else.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate,
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  The swamp is deep.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I'm on the run with you, my sweet love, there's nothing wrong, contemplating God under the chemtrails over the country cloud.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Drs. Harry Tenpenny joins us.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  She's with us for the hour.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I really appreciate coming on.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  She has clinics in the U.S., clinics outside the United States.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  She's a medical doctor.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  She's a great patriot.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  And she decades ago just noticed problems with her patients with vaccines.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  And it's on the inserts they can kill you or hurt you.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And so she began to speak out and talk about what she saw.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  And now she has laid out really incredible predictions six months ago,
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  two months ago about what would happen once the vaccinations began in England
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  and then in the United States and then in Australia and Europe.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  And if you go back to those videos, and we'll put our website on screen, you can go see those, it all came true.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  It's going to really hurt the old people, going to cause miscarriages and pregnant women.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Even the British government says don't give it to us 75 now.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  But that's an advisory. They still do it.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  And so she has said that wait for the death down the road.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  You think Hank Aaron dying when he got the second shot.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Them trying to cover that up was bad.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  You think all the folks you hear about, they had a heart attack after they took it.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Even 35-year-olds.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  What's really going on here?
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  She's a medical doctor.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  And I could bring up a lot of points and I could back her up on a thousand areas.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  But instead, I'd like to give her in the next 40 minutes of airtime, 45 minutes of airtime we have,
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  if you take the breaks out.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Let her have the floor to give you this emergency presentation.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  This is real.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  It's not her a year ago saying it or six months ago saying it.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  It came true.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  They admit that you are thousands of times more likely to die in Israel of the new vaccine than you are of the COVID.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  And so to talk about where it came from, who's involved with it, how we stop it, how we stand up, what's really happening.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  But I know this, and I'm going to let her take over.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  The system, the social engineers said in December of 2019 at the UN meeting in Switzerland,
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  the front line has collapsed.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  Our doctors don't believe in vaccines.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  We don't test them.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  We're told by Bill and Melinda Gates and others what to do, Big Pharma.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  We're testing directly on the third world.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  It's illegal.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  So when their own people did that, boom, in comes COVID to cover up the last big story.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  You use another big story.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  And now they're just normalizing.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Bill Gates said, yeah, you're going to have 700,000 get sick or die.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  He said that eight months ago, probably more actually dying.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  So at one level, they admit it's killing you and hurting you and doesn't protect you.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  And life doesn't go back to normal once you take the vaccine either, which is how she says.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  But at another level, if you try to talk about it, you get banned.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  You get censored.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  So Dr. Sherry Tim Penning has been censored.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  She's been blocked a lot for telling the truth.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  She's a true champion.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  I admire her.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  I care less about Hollywood stars or sports stars.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  But getting her on, I mean, I just get butterflies.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  She's such a great lady.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  It has been such a trailblazer.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  So I'm going to try to give you the floor in the next hour.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  God bless you, doctor.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Medical doctor, Dr. Sherry Tim Penning, been interviewing you for 20 plus years.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  And it's nice to be back.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  And yes, I think we have known each other.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  I've been doing this for just over 20 years.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  It started in September of 2000.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  I've put well over 40,000 hours worth of research into this over the years.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  And most recently in the last year, since March of last year, I've done over 400 interviews.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Small ones, big ones, international ones, podcast, radio, television, just carpet bombing the
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  world to the best that I can to tell people the problems with this entire COVID thing.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Between the myth, the myth of the mask, the fraud of the PCR testing, the horrors that
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  are going to come down the road with this shot, the problems, the psychological problems
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  with the social distancing and the non touching.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  I mean, it's a really, really big problem.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  It's a big mess.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  And I do have a clinic here in Cleveland, Ohio.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  I've been here since 1996.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  I don't have clinics all over the world.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  I do speak all over the world back in the day when you could travel.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  But I just want to commend you, Alex, because I think about you often in all the years that
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  you've had prison, prison, prison planet, and you've had, you know, info wars that everybody
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  thought you were the conspiracy theory nuts.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And here we are exactly living what you've been broadcasting about for 20 plus years.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Thank you for staying the course and being strong no matter what they've been trying
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  to do to you.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Well, we'll be back at you.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  And that's the thing about, I'm not that old, but getting older, my memory remembers
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  something and sometimes it's somebody else.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  I know you've put on clinics, you've trained doctors, you've trained clinics.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  I thought you had, you didn't have a clinic in Mexico?
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  I worked at a hospital in Mexico.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  I was the director of a medical hospital there for about a year and a half.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  So that's probably what you're remembering.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  So my memory hasn't totally failed, exactly.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Because where I like to make for me, I'm not trying to get it wrong, but I don't use a
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  teleprompter, so I get quite a bit wrong.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  So thanks for correcting me.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  So we've got about five minutes to break.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  There's so many areas, the cold of the mask, the medical takeover.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  But let's talk about front and center.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Your predictions about it causing deaths, when they take it and later, it's now coming
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  through.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  How did you know that?
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Lay it out for us.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Well, I've spent hundreds of hours plowing through the medical literature, looking at
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  all of these things associated with this new type of shot.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  We can't even call it a vaccine, Alex, because it doesn't meet any of the criteria, the legal
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  criteria, of what a vaccine is supposed to do.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  A vaccine is supposed to keep you from getting sick.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  This doesn't.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And in their stated literature, they say it probably won't keep you from getting sick
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  or prevent anything.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  It may decrease your risk of serious infections, and it may cut down the duration of your symptoms,
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  but in no way says anything about keeping you from getting sick, which is what a vaccine
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  is supposed to do.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  The second thing is supposed to stop the spread of infection.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  Well, they've already said it doesn't do that.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  It's not intended to decrease hospitalizations, and it's not going to lower the death rate,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  because the death rate is already extraordinarily low, because as you know, and I'm sure you've
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  found it many times, the COVID numbers about death are absolutely fabricated, and we will
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  never be able to sort that out and know the truth.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  So it's not a vaccine, and I'm encouraging everyone to understand the only reason they
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  call it a vaccine is, number one, to get billions of dollars of funding, number two, to get the
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  protection of the 2005 PREP Act as a covered countermeasure as a vaccine, and number three,
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  to have a multi-generational indoctrination that still, beyond all the work you've done,
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  I've done, and others have done over the last 20 years, people still believe that vaccines
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  are safe, thoroughly tested, which they're not.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  They think they're going to keep you from getting sick, which they don't.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  They think they're absolutely necessary, which they're not, and they don't cause any harm,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  which is a flat out lie.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And so the vast majority of people have been multi-generationally indoctrinated to the
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  concept of vaccine.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  So when they hear about the COVID vaccine, they think, oh, it's just like another flu
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  shot.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Oh, doesn't coronavirus cause the flu?
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  So this is just like getting another flu shot.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  And if I can get this shot, please stop calling it a vaccine.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  If I can get this shot or this injection, then I can just go back to normally living life,
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  which you won't.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  They told you you still have to wear a mask.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  You still have to social distance.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  You still have to contact trace.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  It's not going to keep you from getting sick.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  As a matter of fact, and I know that we'll talk about this throughout the rest of the
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  show, I have mapped out 10, 10 mechanisms of injury of how when you get this injection,
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  when you get this messenger RNA, or you get the spike protein that's already been genetically
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  modified and made and inserted into an adenovirus for the J&J shot.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  When you get this spike protein antibody in your system, it will permanently and irreversibly
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  change your immune system.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And so I've mapped out 10 mechanisms of how that happens.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And if I've come up with 10, there's probably more that I just haven't come across yet.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Because when I first started talking about it, Alex, I said there were four, which then
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  went to seven, and now I've got it up to 10.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And as I continue to investigate and research on the problems with this anti-spike antibody,
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  which is the whole purpose of getting this injection, they're injecting something in you
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and messenger RNA or a piece of protein that is the spike protein.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  The whole purpose of having the spike protein in your circulation is to develop an antibody
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  against that spike protein.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  In theory, that means the next time that you come in contact with a coronavirus or specifically
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that antibody should block you from getting sick.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Not only does it not block you from getting sick, the antibody itself is going to turn
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  on your body and create havoc and massive autoimmune disease.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  On a cytokine storm.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  No, no, not cytokine storm.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  It's autoimmune disease.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  When the antibody itself attacks your organs by molecular mimicry, which we can talk about
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  more as we talk about this.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Well, stay there, because I'm not a doctor like you.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  I just read all these reports, and that's what Wolfgang Werdoch said.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  He said it'll cause autoimmune disorder.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  It'll also cause a big allergic reaction.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  He just said it's a nightmare, and it doesn't even work against what they're saying.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  So why are they doing it?
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  That's the big question.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  We'll get into the 10 ways it hurts you.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  But why would they trust something this bold, this crazy, and then now it's killing people
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and maiming them?
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Everybody knows people dying and getting sick.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  What's the master plan?
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Hey, everybody.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  of your life or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  of music.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  So don't worship the globalist.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  Don't worship the NFL.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Don't worship all the things in the system.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  And appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Why do you do that?
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  Boom.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  We did it.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  It's popular.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  It's X3.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Is it better than X2?
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  You decide.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  And that is down and out.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at mforestore.com and free shipping.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Secure your down and out today.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Down and out exclusively available at mforestore.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Remember, we are the most banned.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  We are the most attacked.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  This is as outlaw as it gets.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  And what's incredible is there's, again, Wilking Woodard heads of an EU advisory commission.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  The former chief scientist of Pfizer joined him on December 1st last year and tried to
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  file a lawsuit to block authorization of the mRNA vaccines of Pfizer and others.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  And now major government from Switzerland to South Africa to India are saying no to mRNA vaccines.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Australia had to stop their vaccine because it had HIV positives, false positives happening.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  And so I'm no medical doctor.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  I'm just reading this.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  And then India says we're not going to approve it.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  And then Bill Gates's news guard says it's not true, even though it's on Indian TV and did happen.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  So there's incredible disinformation.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny has been a leading doctor.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  And she's not in competition.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  She loves the cavalry with, you know, people like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  But she's been there really for 20 years because she saw this in her own clinics,
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  saw it with her patients saying, hey, we got a problem here.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Well, this isn't traditional vaccine with all of its contaminants and problems.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  We know that's a real science, though.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  This is mRNA reprogramming people's bodies and a protein that's in the placenta,
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  that's in the cells, teaching the body that's bad.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  What could go wrong?
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And then here's the question I was asking, and then get back into the 10 points, Dr. Tenpenny.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  Why would they try something this reckless and crazy knowing it's going to cause these problems?
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  They're not stupid. Please take over.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Well, you're right about that, Alex.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  These people are not stupid, and they can read the medical literature as well as I can.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  And as well as any other physician that has, and there's a lot of us that are now starting to speak out,
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  a lot of us relative to the total number of physicians who are still tiny,
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  but there are more and more physicians who are actually reading the medical literature.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Imagine that.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  And they're understanding the problems with this.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  I mean, this is a well-designed, well-designed healing tool.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  I mean, it's not a vaccine. It's an injection or a shot.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  We call it a genetic modification technology.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  And I think it's really important for your viewers to get it straight and to get it right
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  about how this messenger RNA works, because a lot of the mainstream press is saying,
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  oh, you conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccine people are all saying that messenger RNA changes your DNA,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  and it does not.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  And guess what? They're right. It doesn't.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Because how the process works, if you have DNA through an enzyme called reverse transcriptase,
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  it makes a mirror copy of it called messenger RNA, which is what gets injected into your body.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  That messenger RNA, it goes through a system called the ribosomes and creates a protein.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  That protein can get reincorporated into your DNA by a process called transfection.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  So there isn't, so the messenger RNA can indirectly change your DNA or genetics,
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  but not directly. And I think language is important.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  And everything that we say gets totally scrubbed and scrutinized these days.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  So I think to say it accurately is important.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  The messenger RNA that gets injected in with this shot co-ops a little piece of machinery in your body called the ribosomes.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  The ribosomes, think about the messenger RNA as having a recipe in it.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  That's what they, when they say it's been encoded, think about it as having a recipe.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  The ribosomes read the recipe, and as it reads the recipe, it makes this protein called the spike protein.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  That spike protein is supposed to be the same protein that's on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  and is supposed to be at least similar to the spike proteins on the circulating coronaviruses that have been out there for more than 60 years.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  We know that there is somewhere between 35 and 45 coronaviruses out there, individual ones.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  We know that seven of them can infect humans.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  And so this spike protein, what it does on the surface of the virus is it acts like a key and binds to something called an ACE receptor on the surface of your cells.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  When that virus takes its key and binds to the ACE receptor, it opens the door and allows the virus to go in and start to replicate.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  So what they're trying to do is to develop an antibody to that spike protein to block the key from getting into the lock so it can't get inside the cell and start to replicate.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  All that sounds great. It all sounds good in theory.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  The problem is that when that antibody to that spike protein is made, it's an abnormal antibody.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  It's called a non-neutralizing antibody because the antibody is not made to the entire virus.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  It's made to a small little piece called a spike protein.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  So it doesn't behave as the same way an antibody does that is to maybe measles or chickenpox or shingles or mumps or something like that.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  So that antibody has a lot of characteristics with it that causes a lot of problems.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  The other thing about an antibody, if people listen to this, if you're just listening, you're not watching, if you're just listening,
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  visualize in your mind that what an antibody actually looks like is the capital letter Y, the two upper arms of the Y are called the FAB segments,
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Frank Appleberry, the FAB fragments, and the stem of the letter Y is called the FAC fragment.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  The FAB fragment at the top is what grabs hold of viruses or particles of bacteria or things and neutralizes it and makes it go away.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  But in this case, it's the FAC fragment, the stem of that antibody that causes a lot of problems.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  For one thing, that stem of that antibody can bind to tissue in your lungs.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  It can bind to senophils, basophils, and other types of receptors that can cause anaphylactic shock.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  It can cause all kinds of problems with direct modification of your macrophages.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  It can cross-react with human tissue and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  So this antibody is the problem.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Both the FAB portion and the FAC portion, both of those individually, cause a bunch of different havoc.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  So the problem is, Alex, is that we are injecting mRNA that has a recipe in it to build a protein to make an antibody against the procreate team
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  that is supposed to keep us healthy and keep us from getting sick.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  But instead, what we're doing is we're creating a process that that antibody replication will be there forever
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  because of B-cell sensitization, and we have no idea how long the messenger RNA continues to be translated
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  and create the proteins.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  We have no idea how long that protein lasts in your system.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  So this is mass.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Wait a minute.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Go ahead.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  Go ahead.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  We have no idea how long the protein is going to last.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  We have no idea how long the antibody is going to be around.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  We have no idea how long the antibody is going to last.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  We don't know how long they're going to continue to...
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  The B-cells are going to be active.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  We have no idea because we have no long-term studies.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And every single one of those steps makes you susceptible to illness for the entire population
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  for an unknown period, maybe the rest of your life,
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  that you may be susceptible to autoimmune disease, shock, allergies, and death
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  from something that is supposed to keep you from getting sick.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  We have a long segment coming up.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I want you to get into this more when we come back, but all I was going to say is
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  illegal mass experimentation.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  They skipped the animal trials.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  I want to ask you when we come back why they did that.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor, great lady.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  You've got quite a few sides, quite a few things I've seen.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Where's the best place for people to find your suppressed information
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  that's all right on the medical literature?
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  DrTenpenny.com.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  It's DRNoPeriodTenpenny.com, DRTenpenny.com.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  All of our many different educational opportunities are social media links,
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  my podcast, all of that stuff can all be found off of the navigation bar.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Everything's now collated in one place at DRTenpenny.com.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  DRTenpenny.com.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  You can find it all.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  All right, DrTenpenny.com.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told,
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  and it's all going to pass.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  If you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists,
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  you'll understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta,
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid,
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  they are now making that move.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign,
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying,
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute,
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  And in just six days this Saturday, the biggest sale ever on storeable food is going to end.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Because of the ice storms, the problems around the country are big supplier.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Highest quality storeable food at the lowest price, my patriot,
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  is giving us the best deal ever.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Free shipping on all of their storeable food,
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  and that's a big cost of storeable food is the shipping, because it weighs a lot,
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  and 10% off on top of it.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021,
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  and then contractually they have to end the sale,
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  because they have hundreds of distributors, and they're getting mad,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  and they were undercutting the price, and they decided to do this.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  So it's exclusively available for just a few days left at infowarstore.com
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  or parallelics.com.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  It takes you right to specials.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  All their food, all their packages, one month, six month a year,
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  it's all parallelics.com.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Take advantage of it now, and it funds the info war.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date,
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  Super Male Vitality,
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  to create superior vitality in males.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses,
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  Wait for it, go to the infowarstore.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Super Male Vitality at infowarstore.com.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  It's the Alex Jones show, and we have a medical doctor on
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  under Sheridan Penny, who has done more tireless work
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  to probably anybody exposing the dangers of conventional vaccines,
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  trying to get them to clean them up and fix them,
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  and came to the realization you can't trust big pharma.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  It's like, nuclear power sounds great until they keep letting them all melt down.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  But this isn't vaccines.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  This is something entirely different, reprogramming your body,
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  mad scientist behavior.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  But I look back on this, you know, they said they did animal testing,
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  they've done a bunch of mRNA testing.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Gates and others have with coronaviruses, on pigs, on geese, on other animals.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  So why do they want to skip the animal testing?
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Because I looked at the old animal testing.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  I'm not a medical doctor.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  I just looked at it and it showed massive problems,
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  and a lot of long-term problems as well in lab rats
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  and things that we're testing on.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  So Dr. Timpinney, two segments left.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  You're gracious to be here with us.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  DrTimpinney.com, get in.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  You started getting into it before the break.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  The ten ways you've identified this foreign, bizarre reprogramming, which is brewing.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Like you said, if I'm in a restaurant, I order a steak.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  They go back into the kitchen, they cook the steak and bring it to me.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  So technically, I'm not cooking steak, but it gives the order to the ribosomes,
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  or as you were saying, to then go make the steak.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  So technically, the DNA can change.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  But if we just say, oh, this is changing DNA, they can then technically say,
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  oh, there's also this thing as chemtrails.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  So what we're doing in geoengineering, we don't call it chemtrail.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  So we call it chemtrails.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  They then discredit it.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  Same thing here.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  We say, oh, it's changing the DNA.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  No, it's telling the body to do that.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  So please continue, Dr. Timpinney.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Well, I don't have time to get into all ten of these,
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  but there is information on some of our websites,
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  and there's a whole bunch of material that'll be coming out within the next week.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Our boot camp just launched last week, and we've got over 500 people in our boot camp,
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  and they're going through all of this individually with us.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  I'm going to drill down on just a couple that I think I can explain pretty quickly
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  so people listening can get their head wrapped around it.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  The first one is that the coating around the mRNA.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  So the mRNA, actually, that little strip of genetic material is pretty unstable.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  So in order to get it injected into your body, they had to put a wrapping,
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  a lipid coating around the outside of it.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  So think of it like they put it in a bubble.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  And in that coating of that bubble is something called polyethylene glycol.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  Polyethylene glycol, we've been sensitized to that through many, many different products
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  that have been used since the...
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  Well, that's one of the ingredients, but we don't generally drink antifreeze.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  There are hundreds if not thousands of other products that contain polyethylene glycol.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  I'm not usually a big fan of Wikipedia,
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  but if you want to see a really down and dirty, quick list of all the things that have polyethylene glycol in it,
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  go to Wikipedia and put in polyethylene glycol.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  You'll be shocked because the medical literature says that people now have allergies
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  or sensitizations to polyethylene glycol.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  But since the 1960s, it was about 2% of the population.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  Now it's somewhere between 70 and 72% of the population.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  And so when you get polyethylene glycol, when you're sensitive to that,
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  that means you're allergic to it.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  When you inject this shot that has this polyethylene glycol on the coating on the outside of it,
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  that is what is leading to anaphylactic reactions, shock, and death.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  That is the one and the primary of the 10 reasons of how this...
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  I said I wouldn't interrupt, doctor, but I have to.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  I was told by high-level medical sources that this is a binary weapon to look into it
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  that causes autoimmune problems.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  You just said binary weapon.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  If we already have this propylene glycol in us, it's in most of us, we're already allergic to us,
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  they then inject it, that's a binary weapon, is it not?
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  Yeah, it's kind of like a good analogy for people to understand.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  It's sort of like if you were bitten by bee stings, by several bees maybe 10 years ago,
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  and now you've been sensitized, your immune system's been primed,
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  and then you can get another bee sting and you go into anaphylactic shock.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  So it's the same thing with the polyethylene glycol, which is a chemical that is in your body,
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  it binds to albumin or other proteins, and then you make an antibody against that,
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  so now you're primed.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  And as soon as the polyethylene glycol comes in through this shot,
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  which is in both the Mondera and the Pfizer shot,
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  it's one of the things that can cause anaphylactic shock.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  And all of these things that we...pictures we've seen on the internet of people with these rashes,
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  these vesicles, these weepy rashes, these big reactions on their arms and things like that,
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  it's an acute allergic reaction most likely to the polyethylene glycol
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  that you've been previously primed and sensitized to.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  The second type...
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  The second reaction that I think is really, really important for people to understand
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  is this whole concept of re-exposure.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  So when you get this, like I've already explained, you get the spike protein,
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  you develop an antibody, it looks like the letter Y, you develop an antibody,
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  the anti-spike antibody, when you get your shot.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  These are all the people that fall into the category of,
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  I got the shot and I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with me, I didn't have a reaction to anything,
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  until they get re-exposed to a coronavirus.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  And it doesn't have to be the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  it can be any of 37 different coronaviruses that are floating around out there in the universe.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Is that when you have the acycine storm then?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  No, that's only the third one, I promise Alex, I'll get to that one.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  So what happens then is when you get exposed to that, when you get re-exposed,
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  that's when you set up the autoimmune disease,
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  that antibody can do one of two things, it can attach to the virus,
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  bring it inside of the neutrophils, release the virus,
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  the virus starts to replicate and goes into massive infection,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  and a worse infection than you could have ever had without having the shot.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  That's been documented.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  The second, that's called antibody dependent enhancement.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  And that's what happened in all of the studies that have been going on since 2005,
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  because they've been trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine since 2005,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  because coronavirus flu has a big burden of illness worldwide.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  About 20% of influenza-like illness that happens every year is caused by coronaviruses,
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  not influenza viruses.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  So as a vaccine manufacturer, there's a real need to get a coronavirus vaccine.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  They could never get it passed out of safety studies,
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  because all the animals that they tested this on,
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  they tested a coronavirus vaccine on, with the full virus,
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  what ended up happening is that the animals,
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  they tested on rats, rabbits, ferrets, hamsters, and monkeys.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  They all got extremely sick, or they died.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  So the FDA would never allow them to move forward out of animal trials,
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  because they couldn't prove safety, because as soon as they got the shot,
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  they were personally okay,
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  then they got re-exposed to the virus and they all got sick and died.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  They failed on both safety and efficacy, because the whole purpose to get a vaccine
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  from a pro-vaccine perspective is that when you get re-exposed, you don't get sick.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  They could never prove it.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  So they didn't have to redo the animal studies.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  They knew what was going to happen.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  And so they knew that this was the type of thing that was going to happen.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  So they just went right directly to human trials.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  So this is the key. I want to get more into the science.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  But why? They're going to get caught.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  This is like mass murder. This is genocide out in the open.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Pretty much.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  Well, these people are really smart, Alex.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  And I've said this on a lot of the interviews I've done.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  They're really smart.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  They have all the money in the world.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  They have billions and trillions of dollars.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  There, that's a really good picture.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  I really like that graphic. It's really good.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  That's the spike protein that just got created.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  That's very good.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  And what actually happens is that they're really super smart.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  They're very smart people.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And if they themselves aren't smart because they're businessmen,
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  they can hire the best, the brightest anywhere in the world.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  This is a very well-designed genetic modification tool.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  We can't, I don't like that some people have been calling it a therapy
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  because calling it a therapy implies that it does something therapeutic,
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  that it does something good for you.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  They're introducing gene rewriting.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  They're just introducing a genetic takeover to us like it's no big deal.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  This is a revolution.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  One of the other things that that spike protein does
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  is that that and the antibody can cross the blood-brain barrier
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  and it can convert two proteins in the brain
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  and make those two proteins in the brain malfunction.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  When those proteins in the brain,
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  and they have really long names, I'm not going to repeat them,
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  but two proteins in your brain get corrupted.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  One can lead to ALS,
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  and the corruption of the other one is frontal temporal lobe degeneration.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Alzheimer's.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Yes, and lack of, and dementia.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  All right, stay there.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Final segment if you know.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  We got to go to break our share at Timpenny.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  DrTimpenny.com, incredible.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  She could talk 10 hours, folks.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  That's why the beggar to come on will be right back.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  I'm a little bit longer, but she's busy.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  She's got her own thing.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  a new product that we know you're going to love,
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  It is down and out.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue,
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  It's incredible.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  at M4WareStore.com, 40% off out of the gates

[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  I don't know, M4WareStore.com.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  I don't like coming to you
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  So please pray to keep M4Ware on the air
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  At the same time, go to M4WareStore.com
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  while you still can and get a book,
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  get a film, get a t-shirt,
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  get some supplements because it's that money
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  and your family's lives every day at M4WareStore.com.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Whether it's high-quality coffee or supplements
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  All of it empowers humanity.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  March is here and we're running a special for only one week.

[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  Do you have any idea that most of the cost-storeable food is the shipping?
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  That is the best deal ever, only till this Saturday.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.

[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Amazing deals on all of our products.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I'll be frank with you.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Stuff's so bad, fingers still out of control.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  I'm trying to sell everything so we actually have funds inside our coffers
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  to keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  We're under a major globalist attack, not because we're the enemy,
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  but because we're standing between you and the globalist.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  The globalist want to bankrupt you, they want to enslave you,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  they want to depopulate you, they want to force inoculate you.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Fund info wars and we'll take action against them in the fight.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  I care about beating the new World War.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  But let's just say this.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  And then forwardstore.com.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever saw.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  We're going to get that set up right now.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  She's laying out the science.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  She's laying out the facts.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  So in the ten and a half minutes we have left other areas.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  This is dangerous.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Other warnings to people.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  A big picture.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Why you think they're trying this?
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  It's so arrogant.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  It's so reckless.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  I guess they get everybody on board, though.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  Mothers, fathers, businesses, companies.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  When there is death and disease from it, everybody just kind of goes,
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  well, we're pretty good.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  So it seems like they're corrupting us.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  They're creating something too able to fail.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  Spend a few minutes on a big picture, doctor,
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  and then get back into the science force.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Well, I'll finish up on the science of what I want to say about it today
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  for the sake of time, because I want to address your issue
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  that you've mentioned several times about cytokine storm.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  Because that does happen.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  But not because of the antibody enhancement that we've been talking about
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  for the first part of the show.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  One of the things that this antibody does,
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  well, let me back up one step.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  The type of white blood cells that fight infection in your body,
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  actually, in your tissues, are called macrophages.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  Macrophages are kind of like little Pac-Men.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  They're little garbage eaters.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  So after you've, when you've had, like, say, pneumonia,
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  or you have an infection, say, in your hand,
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  you have a deep cut that's getting all pussy,
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  it's the macrophages that are doing that work.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  There's two types of macrophages.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  And interestingly enough, they're called macrophage type 1 and type 2.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Macrophage type 1 is when you initially get an infection.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  When you start to get sick,
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  your body calls a bunch of macrophage type 1s to that pathogen,
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  and the macrophage type 1 starts to release cytokines,
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  because that's what they're supposed to do.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  The cytokines are pro-inflammatory.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  They cause a fever.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  They call in a bunch like natural pathogens.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  They cause a fever. They call in a bunch like natural killer cells.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  So the macrophage type 1, that's what you want them to do,
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  is they start, they're there to fight off the infection.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  But as the infection starts to resolve and starts to go away,
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  the macrophage types 2s come in,
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  and they're like, they're like the firemen.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  They come in to the fire hydrant,
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  and they put water on all of those hot cytokines,
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  calm down that whole inflammatory process,
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  and then they start to clean up the cellular debris in the mess.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  So the type 1 macrophages increase cytokines,
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  which is what you want early in an infection,
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  and type 2 macrophages come in kind of after the fact
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  and kind of calm things down.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  But what this antibody does to the type 2 macrophages
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  is it kills them.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  The FAC fragment of that antibody
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  attaches specifically to receptors on type 2 macrophages,
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  so the firemen never show up.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  And the cytokine storm goes on and on and on,
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and can the fire...
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  So there's no off switch, there's no off switch.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  There's no off switch.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  So that's where I've come up with this expression saying
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  that there's an on switch but no off switch,
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  and that's how the cytokine storm happens,
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  because we kill off that antibody that's supposed to protect you,
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  attaches to the M2 macrophages,
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  and makes them inactivate them.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  They migrate into the area where they need to be,
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  and so the M1 macrophages continue to create cytokine,
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  cytokine, cytokines, storm, storm, storm, fever, fever...
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  And they all know this.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  It's in the literature.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  It's not just you saying it.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  It's top scientists.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  I met, because I ran into him in a law a few months ago,
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  and then saw him again,
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  a top biotech company owner that makes antibodies for cancer.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  They've proven they can cure as much as these cancers,
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  but they won't let them use it.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  It's not approved.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  The guy's well-known.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  I'm not going to say the name,
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  because I'm not supposed to,
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  but I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  It's a fraud.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  It'll kill you.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  He goes, don't take it.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  He told the lawyers I know that he was meeting with,
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  you don't take it either.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  The lawyers finally listened to me once he told them this.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  This is a top genetic engineer saying fouchies nuts,
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  gates as nuts, and he goes,
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  they're destroying themselves.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  He goes, I don't know what they're doing.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  This isn't going to do what they say it's going to do.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  It's going to cause autoimmune diseases, everything else.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  And the third thing is the new J&J shot,
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  which we have very little information on,
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  is what it does is it bypasses that manufacturing process
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  of the messenger RNA creates a spike protein.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  It takes the spike protein
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  and puts it inside of an adenovirus,
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  which is a common cold virus,
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  which then can bind to your cell
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  and open up and deposit the spike protein
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  and a body inside of your cell.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  So the end result is the same.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  Does that get into your DNA?
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Does that get into your DNA?
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  Yes, because it's the protein
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  that's injected directly into your system.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  The delivery mechanism is different.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  On the Pfizer and the Modera vaccine shots,
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  the Pfizer and the Modera shots,
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  they inject the messenger RNA that makes the protein.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  The J&J shot has the protein already embedded
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  inside of an adenovirus, which binds to your cells
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  and deposits the protein into your body
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  where you start to make the antibody.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Take your time and talk about that.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Explain that. That's a big deal.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Well, the end result is that all three of these shots
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  end up putting spike protein antigens into your system
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  that you make these antibodies for
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  that we've been talking about
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  that are going to be so destructive.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  In fact, Alex, there was a study that came out
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  from a very well-known immunologist.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  I've known the lead researcher on that
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  for more than 20 years.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  And what they did was they said,
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  well, once we've got this antibody to the spike protein,
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  does that antibody cross-react with other tissues?
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  They tested 55 different tissue types.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  And what they found was that antibody cross-reacts
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  with, I believe, 28 of them.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  And so that means that there's 28 different organs
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  in your body that can be attacked by that antibody.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  That's why if you have 100 people standing in front of you
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  that all got these shots,
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  you could have 100 different sets of symptoms.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  It all depends on where that antibody attaches you.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  This is a very well-designed killing tool.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  And then it's perfect to cover up.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  It's perfect to cover up
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  because there's a bunch of different ways people are dying.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Exactly.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  And the adenoviruses have, in some papers,
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  have shown that adenoviruses themselves,
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  there's more than 100 different strains,
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  but that some of the adenoviruses,
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  that when they get into your system,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  they can turn on oncogenes.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  They can turn on genes that can cause cancer.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  In fact, I was reading a paper yesterday
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  that said, in the body of the paper,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  it said, we do not understand
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  why more people haven't paid attention to the fact
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  that adenoviruses can be oncogenic,
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  meaning cancer-causing.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  And so they've known this.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  And so, I mean, Alex, think about this.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  I mean, I'm an integrative medicine physician
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  in Cleveland, Ohio.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  I've been studying problems with vaccines
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  for a little over 20 years.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  I've read thousands of papers, literally.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  And I've dug all this stuff out of peer-reviewed,
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  mainstream medical literatures.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  It did not come from conspiratology.com.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  If I can read it, they can read it.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  They've got access.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  They've got teams of people that could be reading
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  10 times more articles than I can.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And so if I can come up with 10 mechanisms of injury
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  for this shot and this spike protein,
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  there's probably more.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  That's just as many as I've been able to find so far.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And they know all of this.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  They know this.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  They're smart people.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  So that's my final question.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Probably the other bigger picture is,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  Bill Gates says I want to depopulate you
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  and that he's behind this and it kills people.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  My God, this is just open mass murder happening.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  It pretty much is.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  I mean, we've seen so many reports now
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  of thousands of people, you know,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  VAERS as of October, I'm sorry,
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  as of February the 18th.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  The VAERS report has over 1,000 reported deaths.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  We know that that's about 10% of reports.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  So add two zeros to that.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  It could be anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 deaths.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  We've had over 19,000 reported adverse events.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  Add a zero or two behind that.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  It could be anywhere from 190,000
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  to 1.9 million adverse events.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  And that's as of February the 18th.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  We started this on December the 10th.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  So in a little over two months,
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  we've killed, we have documented evidence
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  of reports of people that have died
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  that maybe tens of thousands of more people.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  We know what's happening all over Europe.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  We know the lawsuits that are being filed
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  to try to stop this.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  And quite frankly, Alex, the FDA and the CDC
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  have violated three areas of federal law
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  to be able to authorize this emergency use
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  of this shot at all.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  First of all, there are other therapies
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  that can be used to treat this infection.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  Ibermectin, hydroxychloroquine,
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  high-dose vitamin C, zinc, D,
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  all of those things can treat it and prevent it.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  The second thing is, in order to get
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  an emergency use authorization,
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  the product that you're giving emergency use to
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  without any studies or long-term studies at all
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  has to be safer and less deadly
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  than the infection itself.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  We know that the death...
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  And the survival rate on this virus is 99.91%.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  You got a survival rate...
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  We only have one minute left.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Dr. Tim Penney.com.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Let me just ask this really quickly.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  You said on other shows you did
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  with the death early on or one thing,
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  you expect a lot of massive death later.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  What's the timeframe on that from your study
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  just in 30 seconds?
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  It takes at least six weeks
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  from the time you get your injection
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  for the spike antibody to start to develop.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  So somewhere between three months
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  and quite frankly, 19, 20 years.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  The immunologist that I've spoken to said,
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  over the next 10 years, we're going to see this
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  go on in perpetuity because it can take anywhere
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  from two years to 19 years
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  to get full-blown autoimmune disease.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  I think we're going to see massive injuries
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  and a lot more deaths start somewhere
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  between four and 18 months from now.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Incredible. Dr. Sherry Tim Penney,
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  Dr. Tim Penney.com.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Thank you for your courage.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  Thank you for the truth.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  And God bless you.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  I look forward to speaking to you more in the future.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Hope folks will take this interview
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  with this archive demand video and share it.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Thank you so much, Dr.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  What an amazing lady.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  That's the truth, folks.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  You just heard it. We'll be right back.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Lister's asking all the time,
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  Why do you do that?
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists,
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  they say, hey, a lot of people love
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  deep-earth pure crystal iodine,
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  but you should put one out with deep-earth crystal iodine
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  and the two other types
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Boom, we did it. It's popular.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  It's X3. Is it better than X2?
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  You decide. It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  and that is down and out.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  but they don't compete with each other.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas,
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  at mforestore.com and free shipping.

[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  and while you're sleeping,
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Down and out exclusively available
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  at mforestore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Throughout history,
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  there have been two basic forms of civilizations
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  and different mixes of the two.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened,
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  focused people with an ethos and a culture
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  America is transferring out of a system
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  That's why the globalists tell us
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  They point out one of our evils
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave masters.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  A global permanent lockdown is here
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  that is already causing millions and millions
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  to starve to death.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  in England and a top general have come out and said
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  That's the facts.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Maybe I didn't treat you
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Quite as good as I should
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Maybe I didn't love you
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Maybe I didn't love you
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Little things I should have said and done
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I'll just never take the time
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  You were always on my mind
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  You know, I was really mean to my dad's mom.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  And she tried to take care of me for a couple years
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  when I was in trouble down at the ranch.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  I was really mean to some other people in my family
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  and I would say that same thing.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  You were always on my mind. I love you.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  And I appreciate humanity as well.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  It's all we've got, folks. We've got to come together.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  And, you know, we just laid out some incredible...
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  That's a medical doctor. That's all literature.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  They are putting out deadly poison on purpose
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  to see how we react
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  and to see how much media control they've got.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Because just like that globalist I happened to want to flight with
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  many years ago, one of the head of the big three banks.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  He said, Jones, you don't get it.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  You're going to adapt to being a slave.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  You're not going to adapt to beat us.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  People are going to adapt to go along with this.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  That's true. We're just going to adapt to our kids dying
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  or parents dying or our neighbors dying.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  They're like, oh, we don't know. It's a new virus.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  You know, this new virus came out.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  That's the reason everybody's dying.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  And it's not going to be the new virus that hits in a year or two.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  It will all be locked down when it was the first shot killed you.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  And show that footage of Bill Gates recently.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  I mean, look at that. I mean, folks, that...
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Would you buy a car from him?
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Would you let him babysit your children?
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  No. That's a murderer right there.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  That's a devil.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  And I can snap my fingers right now.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Those guys will give me $500 million to leave them alone.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I'm not going to do it because my soul ain't for sale.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And I expect they'll have me in some dungeon strung up.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  Hey, that's good because that's only for a few months or a few years.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  I will not be in God's gun sights forever.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Because I fear God because I don't know how powerful God is.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  I am not in God's gun sights. You are Satanist.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  You are in God's gun sights and you're going to burn in hell.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  You understand that? You're going to pay you sneaky murderers.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  People go, well, God, why are they doing that? They're going to get caught.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  They can't help it.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  You listen to these murderers and child molesters.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  They go, I just couldn't help it. I had to grab that woman a strangler.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  I had to torture her.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  These demons run me and I wanted to rape a little kid for six months.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  It's a trip for them. It's a power trip.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Bill Gates, he saw him five years ago. You've seen an interview.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  He looked like he was tortured.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Hi, I'm Bill Gates.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Because he's a demon possessed, folks.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  But once he starts killing, you see him on TV.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  He just looks like he's having an orgasm every 15 seconds.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  He's a demon.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  He's the opposite of grandma bringing you a chicken fried steak
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  and potatoes and green beans. She loves you. She loves seeing you.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  Have a good time. Eat that big old steak.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  He wants to kill your ass. He wants you to die of cancer.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  All hospitals he owns sucks every damn dime out of you, big guy.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  But God's not going to deliver us if we don't have courage.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  We've got to have the courage and step out in faith
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  and God will deliver us.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  But it's not like some Joel Olsey thing
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  where you just walk around all candy ass like Joel Olsey.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  The world's all fine. Never challenge abortion.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Never challenge Satanism. Never challenge sexualization of children.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  Just tell us all day about how Jesus loves us.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  You think Jesus is going to hear the call of cowards?
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  No.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  But here's how it works at the end.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  All of you that have been on the fence,
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  because I love my regular listers, they're great and I love you,
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  but I'm talking about the new listers.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  You think you're going to go along in a system like that
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  and you're not going to get hurt, you're a liar.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  You're lying to yourself.
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  All right, Noah Troyer is going to host the fourth hour,
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  as well as you're going to host for two hours.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Then I'm told he's going to host part of the war room
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  and I appreciate him sitting in while I'm on the road
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  because of any technical difficulties.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  I don't want to say, but that's very tempting to interview.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  He needs 10 million views. He's 100 million views.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  It's life and death, folks, because let me tell you,
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  God's looking at you, not me.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  God's looking at you and deciding how serious
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  really are you about this.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  Because the universe is a long time, folks.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  Infinity is a long time and then a long time again,
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  then a long time forever.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  You better decide which side you're on.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  The devil's real. God's a lot more real.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  We'll be right back on the other side with Owen Troyer,
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  infowars.com tomorrow as soon as today.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  The globalists want you dependent.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  They want you alone. They want you bankrupt.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  They want you starving in the dark.
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  That is what their entire spirit is driving for,
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  because they want total submission.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  When you get high-quality, storeable food that lasts
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  more than a decade, you are buying food insurance
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  that you and your family and your neighbors and friends can eat.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  We have the best sponsor when it comes to storeable food out there.
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  And now they're running a limited special
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  because the ice storm is a few weeks ago,
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  a free shipping and 10% off,
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  but it must end this Saturday.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  There's only a few days left at infowarsstore.com.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Their entire catalog at infowarsstore.com
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  is 10% off with free shipping.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  And with food, a big part of the cost is the shipping.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  So, unprecedented sale, it's going to end this Saturday
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  in just a few days.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  infowarsstore.com takes you to the main page.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  The parallelx.com takes you right to the subpage
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  where you can order and get this food delivered to you.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  They're ready to ship to you right now
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  and your purchase funds the info warrant.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  MUSIC
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  All right, we're now in to our number three.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Very honored to be here.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  And I hand the baton right now to Owen Schreuer.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  And there's a sea of disinformation.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  There's all these thousands of voices.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  And the enemy wants to keep us balanced
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  because we got the enemy's number.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  And what you heard with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  was an hour of powerful truth
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  that we have a responsibility to get out to other people.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  I don't know how you're going to do it,
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  but you're smart, you're inventive.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  Do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  Owen Schreuer, host of The War Room,
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  three to six p.m. weekdays.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  Takes over the next two hours.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  Owen Schreuer.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  Alex, hold it right there, though,
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  because I want to talk to you about something
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  that you brought up with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  that I think is a very important subject for us to discuss
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  and why Infowars is so important.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  You talk about how they're basically about to get away with,
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  essentially, mass genocide.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  I mean, people watch the videos of the Alex Jones show
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  from 10 years ago and all this other stuff.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  They're like, wow, how did all this come true?
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  Well, this is that next video.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  That interview is the next 10 years down the road
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  of that video that's going to open people's eyes.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Wow, Infowars, next decade's news today.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  But it's the old cliche, Alex.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  They're going to get away with this.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  Absolutely 110% they're going to get away with this mass murder
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  because they own the media, Alex.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  The media will never report it.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  They'll report all day long on any COVID case.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  They will never report, ever, ever, ever report
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  on the vaccine side effects or the death from vaccines.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  So they are going to get away with this, Alex.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  They're going to get away with it whole cloth.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  And the only hope we have is that Infowars is still on air
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  because no one else will have the courage to call it out.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Totally.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  Well, I was just telling Rob, during the break,
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  I'm not a violent guy.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  I'm not the guy that leads military operations.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  You know, we're set up at the Capitol.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  That's like as smart as I am politically.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  I know when you actually try to lead actual things in the field,
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  it's 10 times more difficult.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  I, as a man, though, feel bad that I'm not in my mind.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  Like, they're assaulting us through a legal medical template
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  of death.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  And so just everybody needs to know they're coming.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  They're killing people right now.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  And there's this deep down thing like, well,
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  there are too many people.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Well, grimoire had a nice life.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  Folks, if they get you on board killing black people
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  and old people, they're going to get you.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  They want you.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  They want everybody.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  They can convince black lives matter to attack white people.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  They can convince the KKK to attack black people.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  It's all getting us to attack each other
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  because it's a satanic alien attack, the Bible tells us.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  It's a fallen fricking angel.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  Call whatever you want.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  It's here.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  It wants to kill us.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  So we need to fight black racism, white racism.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Remember, the left controls all that.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  So it's all crap anyways.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  Dr. Seuss is evil.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  All the rest of it.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Pure bull.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  Dr. Seuss ain't putting stuff in you
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  that'll give you cancer in six months or a year.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  And so they are implanting soft-kill bombs,
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  weapons in everybody.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  And listen, I already had my grandmother.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Incredible lady.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  Not the one I was being to, not my dad's grandmother.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  Me too.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  But they didn't go sticking with my mom's parents
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  when I was bad when I was 16.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  That would have even worse.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  My god, they wouldn't have put up with me.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  But her doctor told her she got the second polio shot.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Oh, there's a new strain.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Get it?
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  She got paralyzed a week later.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  They told her, sorry, Benny Grace Hammond.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  My mother was four years old.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  She said, you got paralyzed from that.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  And before she died, she said, it doesn't matter.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  I forgive those doctors.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  They didn't know, Alex.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  And I said, me mom, it was the people above them did it.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  I've talked to some of the doctors that were given people stuff with the cancer viruses
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  and the polio viruses.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  She says, it doesn't matter.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  Jesus is going to fix it all.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  So she was a beautiful woman, smart, everything.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  Four-year-old daughter, 10-year-old son, ravaged in a wheelchair the rest of her life
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  in incredible pain.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  And she forgave them.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  Well, there's no, I don't forgive them.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  I'm not Jesus.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  And I don't think it's funny.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  And I'm not going to take being assaulted anymore, Bill Gates.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  You little son of a goddamn demon.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  And delay that, people get mad when I say it.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  I'm not saying the Lord's saving the pain.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  I want God to damn him to hell.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  I'm asking God to bring vengeance down.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  But I'll tell you this.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  God says, did you fight against the abortion?
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Did you fight against the Satanism?
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  Did you stand up?
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  Because God doesn't do anything until we take action.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  So yeah, I mean, I am tired of it.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  I'll tell you, I'll take great satisfaction in knowing.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Bill Gates is the most hated person I know.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  And I talk to random people, don't even know who I am.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  I go, what do you think of Bill Gates?
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  I hate him.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  He's the guy who wants to kill us.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  I mean, I literally talk to people at the grocery store.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  People at the tanning salon.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  People on the street.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  They don't know who I am.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  They hate Bill Gates.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  So we got that spirit on.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  We know who the enemy is, Bill Gates.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  Oh, Bill Gates.
[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  Oh.
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  Oh, gosh.
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  I don't even hate Bill Gates.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  I want to live.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  My force of one lips.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  Oh, Bill Gates.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  Oh, Bill Gates.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  I'm just.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  Oh, Bill Gates.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  You monster.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  You piece of filth.
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  You want to play God.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  You are going to be damned in the Ninth Circle of Hell forever.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  You already know it.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  You want to take us with you and you, Stephen Colbert is going to go with you.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  And so just burning hell, burning hell, burning hell.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  Bill Gates, you will burn in hell.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  I know they hate it when I say it.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  You will burn you monster.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  You will pay.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  God's real.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  You're not God, you monster.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  You will be in prison for attorney for your crimes.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  All right, I'll take over.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  It's funny, too.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Bill Gates is like the clone twin of Michael Moore.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  They look like they're both probably bred in the same clone broth from the Nazis or something,
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  now here to take our freedoms.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  Yeah, he's the big fat obese pedo version.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Exactly.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  He looks just like...
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  You're right.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  If you look at his face, it looks like Michael Moore.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  I'm telling you, Alex, I'm like jumping shark.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  I mean...
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  I think aliens did this.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  You know, I think they did kidnap people and create hybrids.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  I think he's a freaking hybrid.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  No, Alex, I'm serious.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  Things are so out of control now.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  It's like we have to even take our own approach to the next level to even deal with it and start looking outside the box.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  But you know, here's what people need to understand.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  And again, this is why it's so key for Infowars to be on air.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  All these people are looking at Dr. Seuss getting banned and can't buy the book on Amazon or eBay.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  And they're pointing out, they're like, oh, look, I can buy this.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  I can buy a dozen books on how to make bombs.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  I can buy books on how to be a domestic terrorist.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  I can buy books like what the weather underground was reading.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Oh, I can buy Hitler's books.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  Why can't I buy Dr. Seuss' books?
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  Because there's an international cabal that is in control of everything.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  They decide what you can buy.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  They decide what you can't buy.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  And there's an agenda behind all of it.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  And so that's what brings me to the point that I brought up earlier, Alex.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  They will never report on the vaccine side effects.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  Millions of people will die from the vaccine side effects and they'll never report on it.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  And they'll keep telling you that COVID is going to kill you.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  They'll keep telling you that COVID is going to kill you.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  The thing about Dr. Seuss is, it's got weird rhymes and weird things.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  There's always a funny joke in it.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  So it teaches kids there's something hidden.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  And it gets you to think third-dimensional.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  They don't even want third-dimensional thought.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  It's not even that exactly.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  And if they can ban that, they can ban anything.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  So I just hope people understand that they're just now realizing how crazy this world is.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  It's not about Dr. Seuss.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  I mean, it is about Dr. Seuss in one lane, but it's about understanding that they just decide,
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  like overnight, oh, Dr. Seuss is canceled.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  It's about the power of an academic group of communists to say,
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  we don't like Dr. Seuss in a week later, it's banned.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  So they'll say, oh, you can talk about COVID being deadly for the next 10 years,
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  but you'll never hear about the vaccine side effects.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  You'll never hear about the messenger RNA.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  You'll never hear about any of this.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  You'll only hear about vaccines.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  So, you know, your question is, to Dr. Sherry Tenpenia, how can they get away with this?
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  They're planning mass genocide, mass human kill-offs.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  Look at that photo of Bill Gates.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  And look at him. He's like out of the shell now, like from a caterpillar to the demon he is.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  He's been upset looking tortured for the whole time I've seen him in my life.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  Now he looks like he's like, I love it. I'm killing everyone.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  I mean, he's literally dancing around on us. My God.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  No, he has.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  And he was sent here to kill us like a missile.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  He has, for whatever reason, decided to become-
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Look, for a reason, he's talking about total collapse.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  Nothing ever coming back.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  And look how excited he gets when they say it.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  For whatever reason, Bill Gates has decided to put himself up there as the face of the New World Order genocide of humanity.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  I mean, he's made that decision.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  But I'm serious, Alex. I mean, look, we don't get too off the cuff of the esoteric stuff like we could.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  But I mean, I'm almost ready to get to that point because it's just so out of control.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  I mean, is Bill Gates a Nazi clone?
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  Was Bill Gates and Michael Moore like Nazi clones?
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Bill Gates has built- Bill Gates got all the IBM money on record. His mother ran IBM.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  IBM created the Nazis.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  So Hitler was just a test case they did on purpose.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  British intelligence signed a deal with him.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  He set up the EU.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  Edward VIII was supposed to take over. They set Hitler up.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  Now that Hitler was good, they set Hitler up.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  This has all been declassified.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  And so literally, he is the prodigy of the command group.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  I mean, he is literally a 200-year project. He is it.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  People go, well, he's not really in charge.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  He's the front guy of those people.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Like, you know, it the clown is the demonic thing the spider puts out as its figurehead.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  So it the clown, you know, the big spider in the mine shaft sends out Bill Gates.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  So yes, Bill Gates is this little puppet that doesn't look human.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  To you, you're like, it doesn't look human. It doesn't look friendly. I don't like it because you're a human.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  But it's the face of the thing telling you it's killing you.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  He is the alien. He is Satan.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  He's Satan's pinky finger reaching out to crush you down to the ground.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  I'll enjoy the tech solvers they was.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  The people are awakening.
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments,
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  because it's another business.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars.

[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  It is down and out. We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  It's incredible.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  40% off out of the gates with free shipping while supplies last.

[2:12:49.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  All right, I got a bunch of news that I'm going to be covering here for the remainder of the show.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  But what I'm actually going to do is cover some of this news.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  So I've got all this news on the desk right here.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  I'm going to cover all of this during the remainder of the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  And then, see this completely separate stack of news right here?
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  I'm going to cover this on the war room for three hours.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  So I may set a record today for most news stories covered in one day of broadcasting.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  So that's all going to be coming up.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  But I'm going to dedicate the entire fourth hour today, and maybe we can get into it before that, to your phone calls.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Your response to the Dr. Sherry Tenpenny interview.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  And then some of the other news that we've covered or that I'm about to cover here today.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  In fact, let me put out the phone number now so that we can get everybody on the line.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  And then I'll probably start taking calls either next segment or the segment after that.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  But definitely the entire fourth hour.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  So the number to call in, 877-789-2539.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  We'll get your calls aggregated on the board.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  We'll start taking them and then taking the rest of the Alex Jones show.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  But I will cover some of this other news.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  But then total news focus on the war room this afternoon with my normal news prep there.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  We have not even plugged today.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  Other than the fact of just saying, hey, Info Wars needs to be on air. This is why.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  So I believe, guys, is it the last day or there's two days left, folks?
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  We have the best deals on emergency foods, okay?
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  We already have the best price for the best quality on emergency food bar none.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  We did the market research. We found that nexus. We sell it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  We have two days left on the Fortify Your Supply emergency food special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  Two days left, 10% off, 10% off the emergency food supply.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  And we have free shipping store wide.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  So heavy items like storeable food or water filters or air filters.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  We are covering those shipping costs.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  So great time if you don't have storeable food yet, emergency food supplies.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  It's a great time to do it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  Also the air filters, also the water filters. It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  I highly recommend all of it. I have all of them in my house as well.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  And I will tell you, you know, I don't even have pets.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  But when I go clean out my Alexa Pure Breeze, I shouldn't say I don't have pets.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  I don't have pets that shed. I don't have dogs or cats or anything like that.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  No furry creatures running around.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  But when I go and I clean out my air filters, the Alexa Pure Breeze air filters,
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  I'm just stunned at how much dust
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  and just particulate that it sweeps up in the filtration process.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  Again, like, I don't have pets.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  I mean, you'd expect some dust and some, you know, some particles and stuff.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  But I mean, it's like, it's kind of gross.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  And my house is very clean.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  And I go clean that thing out about every other month or so.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  And it's just like, wow.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  So that would normally be floating around in the air.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  You're breathing it in, getting into your lungs, probably not the best thing.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  We have the studies, by the way, that say the average U.S. home is as polluted as a major metropolitan area.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  So don't be living in a house that is polluted.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze air filters from infowarstore.com.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  You'll be surprised at how much cleaner the air is in your house.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  And you will be very happy with that purchase.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  It's on sale at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  Okay, let me finish up some of these COVID vaccine headlines.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Get some of the other stuff.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  And then I promise the rest of the broadcast, I'm going to dedicate to your calls.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  And then really have my news-oriented coverage broadcast on the War Room today.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  American children 10 times more likely to die from suicide than COVID-19.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  That story is at infowarstore.com from Kelly McBreen.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  But see, it all comes back to media narrative media control.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  The international criminal cabal that runs the media decided you're only going to know about COVID.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  Nothing else is happening.
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  There was no tuberculosis outbreak after Obama opened the borders, except there was millions of cases.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  There is no suicide happening right now.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  Suicide isn't up because of the COVID fake pandemic.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  No, it is up.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  It's up very badly, in fact.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Especially with young kids who can't go back to school and are just having their whole way of the world turned upside down.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  And in the future, see, now they've set it up where, oh, all these people die and they can just say it's from COVID.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  Because you get a COVID test, you may test positive for COVID, you may not.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  If you die from getting run over by a car or from cancer or from anything else, you died of COVID.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  And so in a year, if people are dropping over like flies from the side effects of the vaccine, they'll just say, oh, that's COVID.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  See, right now in the interim, it's a little too soon to be honest about that with people like Hank Aaron and others dying immediately after getting the vaccine.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  So they just kind of ignore it and don't report on it.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  And yeah, most people in the military, most nurses, most doctors don't want to take the vaccine because they're smart.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  And it's really beyond the political divide that's usually haunting us in every other walk of life right now.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  These are just doctors and nurses that it's not even political folks.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  They see the side effects.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  They know the side effects.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  They've injected the vaccine and immediately seen people go into convulsions, seizures, paralyzed.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  And they've even had people die.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  So yeah, they don't want that poisonous vaccine and they know COVID for 99% of people isn't deadly.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  They have access to the same CDC numbers I've access to.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  And you know, I was explaining this to an individual who was curious about my work.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  Well, you know, they call me a conspiracy theorist.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  He's like, oh, you mean like, you know, 9-11 inside job stuff? I was like, yeah, that's not really my bag.
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  But, you know, I'd probably be called a conspiracy theorist if I told you this was a fake pandemic.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  And it's kind of just like, oh, you know, you shrugged the shoulders.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  And I said, I can prove to you right now with numbers that there was no pandemic.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  So my point was, oh, okay, conspiracy theory, you think about 9-11.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  Well, I'm not going to sit here and get into the ins and outs of what happened on September 11th or the lies we were told
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  or the trillions on wars that never end or anything like that.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  But hey, look, here's the numbers on COVID-19.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  Here's the numbers on the flu and pneumonia. What do you notice?
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  Huh, that's weird.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  As soon as the numbers started going up for COVID-19 where they never existed before, so it went from nothing.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  It says, oh, look at these graphs. Look at the COVID-19 spike. Well, you went from zero to whatever you say.
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  But what happened to the flu? What happened to pneumonia? Zero cases, zero cases, zero cases.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  That opens people's eyes. That gets people thinking.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  I say, hey, let me show you the death rate. Let me show you the death rate of the United States and the world.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Deadliest pandemic of your lifetime, right? You'd expect the death rate way up.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  You'd expect millions more dying than a normal year. Yeah, I would.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  Show them the numbers. Death rate hasn't gone up to remain the exact same worldwide.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  That's eye-opening.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  You see, they'll never show you any of that on the mainstream news.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  They'll never show you any of that on cable news.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  And quite frankly, even most alternative news people are too afraid to say anything about the COVID vaccine
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  or anything about a stolen election because they're afraid they're going to get censored.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  So now you're constantly living in fear of a virus or of something?
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full-worses
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  at your paying attention, you know, we've done together.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance, so now is the time to understand
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  and everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crises, under such a load,
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula,
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  prostate guard, or whether it is the super high-grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra-12,
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ-10 in DNA force, or the pure Deep Earth crystal iodine X2,
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  these are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  of high-quality products after, and it funds the InfoWare.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  So even if these products weren't high-quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWare
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  so you can't lose. InfoWare delivers in spades.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  Please visit InfoWareStore.com and get the products today.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  I'm beating the new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility,
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  We're going to see this through to the end, where we'll stay on air as long as we can.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it,
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  No, there's now financial reasons, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  Democrat COVID bill gives $21,000 hand out to federal employees
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  if their kids' schools aren't open in person. Wow.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  See how they just hand themselves cash payments under the table with your money?
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  Hey, why don't the Democrats when our schools open? What is going on?
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  Well, it turns out they get $21,000.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  If their kids aren't in school, wow.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  Oh, now I know why they don't want the schools open.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  It's always a lie with the Democrats.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  It's always a lie with the liberal media.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  Always, always, always lying constantly makes me sick.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Meanwhile, as the average human has less prosperity and less financial freedom,
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  every country on planet Earth increased its defense budgets during the pandemic.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  In fact, the number highlighted in the Infowars story,
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  relinked from Pravda, the world spent $1.83 trillion on defense in the year 2020,
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  an increase from the year before.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Kind of like how the Democrats don't want you to have a secured border,
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  but they've secured DC. That's for damn sure.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  By the way, the latest numbers from January are in.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  Double. This is just what we have on record.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  Not what, you know, when you talk about the southern border,
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  not people get across southern border and then it's off record, nobody knows what happens.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  On record, in January 2021, from January 2020,
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  you had double the amount of illegal border crossings.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  Double. Double.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  Now imagine if that keeps up.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  By the way, usually May, April and May are the biggest for illegal border crossings.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  So the border is wide open under Biden.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  They don't even get COVID tests.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  Now Greyhound bus once they figured out they're not getting COVID tests.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  And now the federal government is getting Greyhound bus to come bus these people to all these different cities.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  It's well known. You cross the border illegally.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  And then you hop on a Greyhound bus and they just take you wherever you end up.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Well, Greyhound found out that they weren't testing these people.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  So now Greyhound is having to implement their own testing.
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  So yes, Joe Biden has laid down and allowed this country to fall.
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  Joe Biden has opened the gates for all of America's enemies to come in.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  A wide open southern border, tapping our energy use and letting China determine our foreign policy.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  Wow. Pretty infuriating, isn't it?
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  And then you can't even deal with it on a real level and we can't even come together as Americans
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  because the average liberal Democrat is a two-faced, phony, lying scumbag.
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  And I'm sorry that that's the case, but it is.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  So we can't even properly deal with the insurrection from the Joe Biden administration.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  We can't even properly deal with the treason from our politicians in Congress
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  because we have a population that is so brainwashed and in such a state of...
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  I've had a brain fart. What is it when you believe you're a pathological liar?
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  These are pathological liars.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  And they won't even be honest about their own approach to things.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  Take a look at a mask mandate. Boil it down to something simple.
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  Are you pro-freedom or pro-government?
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  Now, on its face, who would actually say they're pro-government?
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  If you just ask, are you pro-freedom or are you pro-government, who would actually say they're pro-government?
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  Well, a liberal would be lying to you if they said that.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  So they probably would, but they'd be lying just like they do about everything else in their lives.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  So that's the new debate here. Somebody says, oh, we need masks.
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  You ask them, are you pro-freedom or pro-government?
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  It's a long pro-freedom. Really, then I want the freedom to not wear a mask.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  Well, you can't have that. Well, what about my body, my choice?
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  Well, you could kill someone with a virus. I don't have a virus. Doesn't matter.
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  So it's not your body. It's all of our bodies.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  But what about the 60 plus million aborted babies that had a heartbeat that you cheered for their deaths?
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  So a progressive liberal Democrat is just a bold-faced liar.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  And it's sad. They lie to themselves. They lie to you.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  And so now we're having to deal with this.
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  And we can't even actually have a sum of the people's response to this.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  We can't even have real intellectual debates to this because most of the population is either completely brainwashed
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  or just two-faced, lying, phony liberal Democrats.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  So, you know, it's a famous thing Dan Bongino has been saying for a while.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  Republicans may not be the answer to your problems, but Democrats and liberals are the problem.
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  They are the cause of all your problems.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  All right, we've opened up the phone lines.
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  And so we go to the phone lines now.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  We start with, let's start with Mark in Wisconsin.
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  Mark, go ahead.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  Oh, and thank you very much. Can you hear me?
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  Yep.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  Awesome.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  I just want to say that I agree with everything you just said.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  I don't believe that they think freedoms come from the government and not from our creators.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  So, I think they just start off wrong.
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  But I guess I called because I wanted to, I just listened to Dr. Tim Penny.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  And that was like the most revealing, just put in a way that it just totally made sense.
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  And I think that video needs to be produced and sent out to everybody because it just, it was truly eye-opening.
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  But the main reason I called, I've been telling my family, friends, not to take the vaccine, but ultimately they get to choose.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  If they, you know, they're informed, they get to consent.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  I just get to tell them about the dangers of it.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  But I had my mother, who's 84, and kind of another lady who is kind of like my second mom.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  They both got the vaccine the first round.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  And I told both of them, I'm like, when you go in there, ask for the insert.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  And they both asked what that was, and I explained to them what it was.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  And they both went, got their vaccines, no problem yet, but they're only on the social ones.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  But they both came back with the fact sheets.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  And it wasn't the insert, because I've seen the insert before, and that's why I...
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  So it wasn't the medical insert that's required, it was just like a little brochure, like a pamphlet, promoting it almost.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  They just had all those recently asked questions.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  They asked me, why should you give it?
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  Nothing about what's in it, what kind of testing they'd done on it, none of that.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  And I guess I was going to see if anybody else has noticed that.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  Well, I obviously have not even had anybody try to give me the vaccine.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  So I mean, I guess I could go to a local place here and ask for the insert and see what happens.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  And they'll probably just give me that fact sheet.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Who knows, they might not even have the inserts at these places.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  Just because the vaccine manufacturers don't even want you to get that.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  So they may not even be sending out the actual inserts, even though legally they're supposed to.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  But this whole thing is unlawful anyway.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  But you know, I'm serious, I mean, I wonder what's going to happen.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  God forbid, Sherry Tenpenny, I mean, believe me folks, she wants to be wrong.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  God forbid though, she's right, and people start dropping dead from this vaccine in, you know, six months or whatever.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  And the media will cover it up and they'll say it's all COVID because big pharmaceutical owns the media.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  That's why every commercial break, what do you see?
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  An ad for a big pharmaceutical pill.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  So pretty crazy, but this is the reality we live in.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Why do you do that?
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  Is it better than X2?
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  Well now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  And that is down and out, it's super strong, way stronger than knocked out, but they don't compete with each other.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates at M4store.com and free shipping.

[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  Down and out, exclusively available at M4store.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  So please pray to keep M4Wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  At the same time, go to M4WarsStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at M4WarsStore.com.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  And in just six days this Saturday, the biggest sale ever on storeable food is going to end.
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  Because of the ice storms and the problems around the country, our big supplier,
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  highest quality storeable food at the lowest price, my Patriot, is giving us the best deal ever.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  Free shipping on all of their storeable food, and that's a big cost of storeable food as a shipping
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  because it weighs a lot and 10% off on top of it.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021, and then contractually they have to end the sale
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  because they have hundreds of distributors and they're getting mad that we're undercutting the price.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  They decided to do this, so it's just closely available. There's a few days left at infowarstore.com
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  or parallelics.com. Take sure you write the specials. All their food, all their packages,
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  one month, six month a year, it's all parallelics.com. Take advantage of it now, and it funds the info war.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and recording
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  Now, with the info warst privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Excellent. Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want,

[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  Support the info war and get your info wars privacy pouch today.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  infowarstore.com
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  So we have a crew here that is hungry for truth, just like I am behind the scenes working,
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  and they were saying how, when I was talking about the insert and the fact sheet,
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  they were trying to find the insert online on all the different vaccine manufacturers' websites
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  with all their COVID information.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  So we have a crew here that is hungry for truth, just like I am, behind the scenes working,
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  on all the different vaccine manufacturers' websites with all their COVID information,
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  and it is not publicly available.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  You can't find the convenient fact sheet though.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  It's just basically like a brochure promoting the vaccine,
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  but oh, that insert that warns you of the side effects and the Guillain berets and the syndromes,
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  but oh, you know what, they might not even have it because this whole thing is on trial level anyway.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  So here's the deal, the earth has been conquered.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Okay, you're living on conquered planet earth, you're in a prison planet,
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  you're cattle to whatever it is that's conquered us.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Call it aliens, call it demons, call it liberals, call it the Illuminati, I don't really care,
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  except the reality, the earth has been conquered, you're going through a massive worldwide experiment
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  right now with a foreign substance being put into your body,
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  and the average liberal Democrat has Stockholm syndrome,
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  and has their own authoritarian bent that they love it.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  The same reason why they promote abortion,
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  because their daddy, Satan, loves death.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  And you see, my body, my choice, should be the Achilles heel of the liberal establishment.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Now it never would be, these people are beyond reproach, these people are beyond reality,
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  they're beyond logic and reason.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  They live in their own La La Land.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  But see, my body, my choice should be the total Achilles heel of the Democrat liberal progressive movement.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  Because everything they propose is anti-freedom.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  Everything.
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  But then they want you to listen to them when they say my body, my choice when it comes to them killing their baby.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  This is a giant satanic cult that we're dealing with.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  It is a death cult.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  No.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  The Democrat liberal progressive bent party is a death cult.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  They want you to kill your baby with abortion,
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  and they want you to die because you're causing global warming, which of course is a lie again.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  Democrats lie about insurrection on the 6th.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  Democrats lie about global warming.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  Democrats lie about everything.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  I'm no Republican, I'm not here promoting the Republican party, it's a failure as well.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  But I mean, my God, the Democrat party operating procedure is lie, lie, lie again, lie bigger, and keep lying.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  And the average liberal progressive American falls for it every time.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  Okay, I'm very frustrating.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  Trey has dialed in from North Carolina. Trey, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  What's going on? How are you today, brother?
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  You know, I'm okay, but I'll tell you man, I just, it's like a constant evolution of trying to figure out how to deal with this evil.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  I can definitely feel you on there, brother. The one thing you gotta remember though is that we do win in the end.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  Well, God wins in the end. I hope that we're worthy.
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  I mean, absolutely, if you're on the winning team with God, I know you are just like I am.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  But I really want to speak to you about today with these vaccines.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  Everything Mark was saying was exactly true.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  My wife actually worked at a nursing home and they were trying to afford her to get the vaccine.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  And pretty much by my due diligence, by doing the research, listening to y'all guys and giving her the information,
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  she was able to actually refuse to get the vaccine at her job because it was trying to fire her at one point in time.
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  Until I told her that they couldn't do that, yeah.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  But see, but isn't that, doesn't that come back to kind of the base level?
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  I mean, this is like my new foundation here.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  Everybody should approach every, every issue should be approached from this base level foundation.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  Are you pro-freedom or pro-government? That's a decision.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  You decide. Are you pro-freedom or pro-government?
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  So your wife is pro-freedom. She doesn't want to take the vaccine.
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  She has reasons for that. She presents it.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  She should not be forced to take the vaccine. She's pro-freedom.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  That's a pro-freedom approach.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  But isn't it sad that the pro-government approach is what's always assumed,
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  oh, you have to take this vaccine, not the pro-freedom approach, which is, hey, do you want this vaccine?
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  What's even worse is you're right, because we definitely are pro-freedom.
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  What's even worse is that her co-workers actually started haggling her.
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  And we're saying that you're the reason why we can't open back.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  You're the reason why we have to wear a mask.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  She had to break it down. So I'm like, did you notice where the mask after the vaccine?
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  Did you know you still have to social distance after all of this?
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  And they're like, no, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  And see, God bless your wife's heart. And I want to know how her response to this is because, again, Trey, this is what's so frustrating.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  Your wife is approaching these people like they actually want to listen,
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  like they're actually free-thinking individuals that are reasonable and well-meaning.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  They don't care about the facts. They don't care about anything.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  All they care about is telling you what to do. All they care about is dominating your wife's life.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  And so it's like, hey, look, here are the numbers. Hey, look, look, they're saying you can't take off the mask.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  Here, look, they're saying that you may not even stop the spread if you get a vaccine.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  And we're in a trial phase of it right now, and I just don't want it.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  And it's just like, she's bad because she's free-thinking.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  And that's why the liberals are always dishonest.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Just be honest liberals. You want to dominate us. You're authoritarians. Just be honest about it.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  Just be honest about it. You want to force Trey's wife to take the vaccine because you're a totalitarian freak.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  Just be honest about it. But they won't, Trey, because they know if they were honest about that,
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  they would be totally, fully rejected by society.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  Everybody right now is just hypnotized by Bill Gates and the Fleshy Pink Floyd.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  Everybody's under his spirit right now for whatever reason.
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  Everybody needs to know that. He says he wants to depopulate everybody.
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  He's been saying that he wants to lock everybody down off of carbon.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  He's been saying he wants to lock everybody down off of COVID.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  The whole thing is a hope. They said it hasn't been isolated.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  It doesn't exist, and people still want to believe it. It doesn't matter.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  It's unbelievable. Trey, anything else?
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  The only thing I want to say is, man, God bless y'all. Y'all keep fighting. I'm fighting with y'all.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  Just keep doing y'all things, man. God bless.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  God bless you, Trey. We have the best callers in the audience, man. It's just amazing.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  Let's go to Chris in Massachusetts. Chris, you're on The Alex Jones Show. Go ahead.
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Hey, everyone. How's it going?
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  Just about what you guys were telling us, this isn't what I wanted to say,
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  but when you're talking about people being, you know, they're ignorant,
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  I don't think that most of them are doing it on purpose. Some of them are,
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  but I think most of them are literally that brainwashed.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  But what I wanted to bring up is David Eiches, I was listening this morning,
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  called the Statement on Virus Isolation.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  There's three doctors that I'll bear with me because I'm not a doctor,
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  but it basically is saying that it gives you the process of how you isolate a virus.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  And then it goes on to say how they've actually been doing it since 1954,
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  and it's not the proper way. They're not actually taking the virus out of someone
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  and seeing if it can live out in the atmosphere by itself.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  So at the end, when they went through the freedom of information
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  after trying to get the answers to this, the response was either
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  they can't find enough virus in a human body,
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  or the virus only lives inside the cell and not outside of the cell,
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  which to me means that you literally can't spread it.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  And Chris, I just want to be clear about something here.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  Now, what you're talking about, is this something new or something older
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  because I remember this story broke some time ago,
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  and David Eich and others were covering it,
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  and it's exactly what you're saying, how all the claims that they're making,
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  that they are making about COVID, which would require all this sort of scientific research,
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  they've literally not even done it.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  They've never isolated the virus.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  They've never even proven human to human transmission.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  They're just assuming all of it.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Right, in this paper, he said also, this is for every virus.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  This is what blew my mind.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  And this is why people are like, they think that viruses just altogether are a complete hoax.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  I mean, you can find doctors and medical professionals that say,
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  there's no such thing as virus because they've never isolated it.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  It made me think and made me believe that your body, if you're unhealthy, can create a virus,
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  and it's probably supposed to.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  Well, who knows?
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  They probably put it into us with their vaccines when we're kids.
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  That's true too, but say they didn't, right?
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  I mean, you build it up yourself because you're not healthy and then you're able to beat it or whatever.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  But I've my whole life, I've been around somebody, if I'm around someone that's sick,
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  I don't change my behavior.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  And I never touch the sickness that they have, but I get sick myself sometimes.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  So this blew my mind.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  Like, what if you can't even transfer a virus?
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  Oh, but see, Chris, you're engaging in logical thinking.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  This is actually a great point.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  I mean, think about it.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  You're sick as a kid.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  Your mom is sick.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  Your sister's sick or whatever.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  And then other people in the house don't get sick.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  I've been sick.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  I've had people come take care of me.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  They don't get sick.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  I mean, people at the hospitals, yeah, there's maybe some increased sickness there,
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  but overall it's like sick people coming in all day.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Nurses aren't dropping dead from COVID.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  It's just unbelievable, man.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  I just, I don't know how to wake people up anymore.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  I don't even do this research for myself because I would never take the vaccine
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  for this 99% survival rate anyway.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  But I do it for other people because when I tell them that, they're like,
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  oh, I don't believe you, so I get more information.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  You know, it's kind of like, you know, you go about how do we wake people up?
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  I mean, at a certain point, like if you've got a buddy and you've got a golf tee time
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  and your buddy's just not getting out of bed,
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  eventually you just quit trying to wake him up.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Like, okay, you're not playing golf today.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  So it's almost like we're almost at that level with these people.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars,
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  especially if you're having trouble sleeping.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  It is down and out.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  It's incredible.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at M4WareStore.com.

[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  Wayne's World, Wayne's World.
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  Even before I had an access to a show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  and thought, man, that looks fun.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  To speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd,
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  you're still entertaining because you're real.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  That, for me, is really set down and disgusting.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole M4Ware's crew
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  that we will never join the globalists.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  Alright, I want to hit a couple more news stories here before we go back to your phone calls.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  What a crazy time to be alive.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  You know, here's one thing, too.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  I still want, like, I still want to be able to enjoy life.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  I still want you and the audience to be able to enjoy life.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  And so you have to try to find a balance here.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  But I mean, when you stare down the reality of what we're facing,
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  you almost feel guilty trying to enjoy life.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  And so that's why, like, for me, if I step away,
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  I can't even think about this stuff because I just feel guilty that, you know,
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  I'm not fighting against it.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  That's why when Alex goes out of town, he can't stop working.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  But when I see Democrats now using racism as an excuse to keep pedophiles out of jail,
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  and these are people that are just watching porn on the Internet,
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  like maybe watching a child rape video on the Internet.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  No, these are the actual physical abusers of children.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  And I'm not making this up, folks.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  We've relinked the National Files story at Infowars.com.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  Democrat lawmaker opposes Arizona Bill that raises sentences for pedophiles
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  because it would hurt black people.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  Right now, if you're convicted of a sex crime against the children,
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  you get 12 years.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  The proposal would make it a live sentence.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  Who would be against that?
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  Well, I know, a pedophile.
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  That too.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  Look at that.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  Hamela, powers, handling.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  Let me tell you something.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  You know what?
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  I'm almost done with any, because, look, I'm on air.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  We've got millions of viewers.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  You have to be responsible with that power.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  But, you know, the mainstream media lies all day.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  Why would I not just go with my gut instinct?
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  That's a frickin' dude.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  That's a dude. That is a transsexual pedophile dude
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  who doesn't want there to be punishments for pedophiles
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  and then says it's racist,
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  probably because he knows that he's guilty of those crimes.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  But, hey, what do I know?
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  I'm sure this person that wants to protect child rapes, child rapers,
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  I'm sure that that's the person we should be listening to.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  And I'm the bad guy.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  Michelle Obama urges Senate to vote for HR1.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  That is the bill that would allow the Democrats to steal
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  every election from here on out in human history,
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  basically the end of free and fair elections.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  So call your local senators, call your local representatives,
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  send them emails, messages, do not vote HR1.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Do not vote HR1. Do not vote HR1.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  There will never be another election in this country's history
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  if they pass HR1.
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  It'll all be selection.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  They'll have a billion mail-in ballots at their disposal every four years.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  eBay ban sale of Dr. Seuss books.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  That's nice. What's next?
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  YouTube deletes CPAC speech from Trump.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  They'll never censor President Trump.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  It's just those crazy people at InfoWars.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  It's just Alec Jones and it's just Owen Schreuer.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  No, it's Trump. It's Dr. Seuss. It's you.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  And Ben Carson calls this poison in our system.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  You know, look, I'm still kind of on the fence
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  of whether I want Trump to run in 2024 or not.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  The only reason I would even go with it is because that seems to be
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  where the populist opinion is, so that's okay.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  I'd rather someone else step up, but let me tell you,
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  the shortlist for Trump's vice president should be Christy Noem,
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  Ben Carson, Ron DeSantis,
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  and what was the other name I put out last night, guys?
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  Skipping my head, and I think it may have actually been my favorite one.
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  Oh, Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi Gabbard.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  That should be the shortlist for Trump's vice president picks
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  if he does want to run.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  By the way, in New York City right now, as I speak,
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  and you're not allowed to broadcast this anywhere
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  because everybody who would has been banned off the internet,
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  including right-side broadcasting,
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  there has been a huge event happening in New York City today
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  outside of Trump Tower.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  They revealed a Trump 2024 president campaign flag or whatever
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  in front of Trump Tower, and tons of people showed up.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  So again, oh, Biden got 80 million votes.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Can't get a million people to watch his inaugural address.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  We're now months after it.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  Can't get 1,000 people to tune into any of his live streams.
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Doesn't have rallies. Nobody shows up to his events.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  Trump has just a spur of the moment in New York City.
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  Everybody shows up.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  March is here, and we're running a special for only one week.
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  Store rides free shipping up to 50% off on our best-selling items.

[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  Do you have any idea that most of the cost-storeable food is the shipping?
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  That is the best deal ever.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  Only till this Saturday.
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  50% off.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  TurboForce, the 10-hour clean energy.

[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  Taking it out of the tongue, it's incredible.

[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  All of it free shipping.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Amazing deals on all of our products.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  I'll be frank with you.
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  Stuff's so bad, tickers so out of control.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  I'm trying to sell everything, so we actually have funds inside our coffers
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  to keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  We're under a major globalist attack, not because we're the enemy,
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  but because we're standing between you and the globalist.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  The globalists want to bankrupt you.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  They want to enslave you.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  They want to depopulate you.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  They want to force inoculate you.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  Fund info wars, and we'll take action against them in the fight.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  Alright, I can sit here and rant all day,
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  but I'll get too much into my own head,
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  and I want to go to your phone calls now.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  So, we go back out to the phone lines.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  Final hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  By the way, I will be hosting all three hours of the War Room,
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  and I will get into my real news coverage with my stack of news here.
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  We'll be doing that coming up, but back to the phone lines we go.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  Brian has called in from New York,
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  where they had a huge rally for President Trump today in New York City.
[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  Nobody covered it.
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  Everybody that's there is banned from the Internet.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  More people showed up to that event than any Biden rally that's ever happened.
[2:59:56.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  But yo, I'm sure Biden won, though.
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  I'm sure, Brian.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:03.000]  Yeah, yeah, not.
[3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  It's great. First of all, thanks for taking my call, Owen.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:09.000]  I constantly watch your show, man.
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  I've been probably watching for over probably 16 years,
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  and I love you guys.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  I pray for you daily.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  I pray for the spiritual warfare that we've protected from you all, guys.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  And listen, man, I really appreciated you guys getting Dr. Tenpenny on, too.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  I saw, actually, an interview with her a few weeks ago,
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  and it's amazing because she is just not a great patriot,
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  but she's very dedicated to her work.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  She actually, you know, when I first heard her a few weeks ago,
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  she had only found four areas of our body that that's attacking.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  Now she's up to number 10.
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  So I just appreciate that, man.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  And I hope and I pray for her that nothing happens to her.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  We all know what happens to the truth-seekers these days.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  What a sweet lady, too, because you hear her breaking this news,
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  and it's like, yeah, it could kill you this way.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  It could do this harm.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  And now she's like, wow, so this could kill people.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  And she's like, yeah.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  She doesn't like finding this stuff out, folks.
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  Hey, so on this Bill Gates thing, you know,
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  he truly is the walking devil.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  I saw, I got hooked up to a video, another interview,
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  where this Dr. Astrid Stuckelberger, she's over from Germany,
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  and she's part of the who.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  And that man actually had the audacity and the arrogance
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  to approach the board and wanted to be an elected official on the who board.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  And they absolutely struck him down.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  So what he says now, and she's got this all,
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  there's a video out there you can find.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  I think if you just did a search on Dr. Astrid Stuckelberger,
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  you'll probably find it.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  So he goes around the back of the who,
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  and now is approaching all countries separately with his own contract.
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  And they can't touch this man.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  If it's proven that he's killed millions and millions of people,
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  he has absolute undeniable immunity.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  They can't go to his house.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  They can't take his computers, which will be most of the evidence.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  They can't do any of it.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  None of it.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  Hold on.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  Are you talking about Bill Gates?
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Yes.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  Yep.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  Okay.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  And you're saying it's that doctor?
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  Guys, pull that doctor back up.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  Ashley Stuckelberg is trying to expose this?
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  Astrid.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  Yeah, her name is Astrid Stuckelberger.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  So she's the one who's getting all this information out as much as she can.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  She's a whistleblower from WHO who she's actually in a conference,
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  on a Zoom conference, speaking to a board of different people.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  And they seem like they're all in Europe.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  But she did.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  She brought right out the fact that he approached the board.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  He wanted to get voted on to this board of the who.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  And they said, absolutely not.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  You can't have that.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  But now he just goes around that and just approaches these countries.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  And he gets them to sign contracts which continues his total immunity.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  It's disgusting.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  It's disgusting.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  Imagine, though, if you're an evil genius and you have a chip on your shoulder against
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  humanity, you hate humanity for whatever reason growing up.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  And so you plot with this chip on your shoulder to get back at humanity.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  And then finally, you're in your victory lap.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  You're in your victory stages.
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  You're finally getting back at humanity.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  What would happen?
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Well, you'd go on TV celebrating it, smiling and smirking about how everyone's about to
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  die either from a virus or a vaccine.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  Amen to that.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  You're exactly right, Owen.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  You're exactly right.
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  What?
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  Who does it sound like I just described?
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  Yeah, Mr. Bill Gates.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Otherwise, I like to call those corporate guys Richard Craniams.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  Get it?
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Yeah.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  But one last thing, you know, the guy who stole the White House, it's amazing.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  I found a huge document back from 1992, and he addressed the Senate.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:33.840]  And it's a probably about an eight to nine page long document where Joe Biden is pressing
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:40.760]  the Senate on how the United States needs to be in the New World Order.
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:42.400]  And I mean, he takes it all back.
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:46.360]  He takes it all the way back to Woodrow Wilson.
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:51.560]  And that Woodrow Wilson wanted us to be in this New World Order all the way back then.
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:55.800]  And we know it goes back, back as far as we could see.
[3:04:55.800 --> 3:05:01.640]  But just the fact that he put this onto the Senate and said he was going to do this the
[3:05:01.640 --> 3:05:03.120]  whole week.
[3:05:03.120 --> 3:05:04.120]  And he did.
[3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:10.120]  And it's probably about an hour each time he presented this to the Senate and was, I
[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:15.480]  mean, just annihilating them with all this information and all the pressure and actually
[3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:19.520]  stating that the American people want this.
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:21.840]  It's in this document.
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:26.200]  I could probably say I should have had the link for you guys.
[3:05:26.200 --> 3:05:33.800]  If you go out there and do a search for 1992 New World Order addressing the Senate, Joe
[3:05:33.800 --> 3:05:35.720]  Biden, you'll find it.
[3:05:35.720 --> 3:05:36.720]  You'll find it.
[3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:37.720]  Brian.
[3:05:37.720 --> 3:05:38.720]  Brian.
[3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:39.720]  Yep.
[3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:40.720]  Thank you so much for that call.
[3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:45.040]  Let's go to, again, we have the most informed audience since our audience is in a five minute
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:46.040]  phone call.
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:49.200]  We'll give you more information and you'll find on any cable news program, most likely,
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:50.520]  except maybe two or three of them.
[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:52.720]  Let's go to Cass in Wisconsin.
[3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:54.360]  Cass, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:05:54.360 --> 3:05:55.360]  Go ahead.
[3:05:55.360 --> 3:06:01.240]  Hey, big old Matic, I have a wild conspiracy theory regarding Bill Gates, a COVID vaccine
[3:06:01.240 --> 3:06:03.960]  and his recent large farmland purchase.
[3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:10.920]  I think Bill Gates is going to put COVID backs or future vaxes in the food using DARPA, GMO
[3:06:10.920 --> 3:06:11.920]  tech.
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:18.360]  Also, do you think there is a literal witches brew in the Cabal Kool-Aid vaxes, causing
[3:06:18.360 --> 3:06:23.400]  demonic possession, hallucinations, even in little babies?
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:24.400]  Go ahead.
[3:06:24.400 --> 3:06:30.880]  So there is a leaked video of, it's a, I forget what it is, I believe it's at the Pentagon
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:32.920]  and it does appear to be Bill Gates.
[3:06:32.920 --> 3:06:40.120]  Now it's been widely debated, but it's a leaked video where they're talking about vaccines
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:46.920]  and chemicals, but specifically killing the quote, unquote, God gene and how they can
[3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:52.960]  use vaccine therapy or whatever to attack the God gene, as they call it.
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:57.880]  And so I won't go off in too much of that, but it's basically what makes you spiritual,
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:00.200]  what gives you your instincts to be good.
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:01.760]  You're conscious.
[3:07:01.760 --> 3:07:07.720]  And so again, it looks like Bill Gates, it's been debated if it's Bill Gates or not, talking
[3:07:07.720 --> 3:07:13.000]  about how they can use vaccines to kill the God gene.
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:16.080]  Now they all say, oh, well, see, here's the problem.
[3:07:16.080 --> 3:07:21.520]  Yeah, here's something that the crew found there, COVID-19 vaccine, they've killed God.
[3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:22.680]  And I can't feel God anymore.
[3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:23.680]  My soul is dead.
[3:07:23.680 --> 3:07:26.520]  That was what somebody said after getting the vaccine.
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:28.600]  So what they do is they demonize God.
[3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:32.120]  They demonize religion and they say, see, religion is the problem on the earth.
[3:07:32.120 --> 3:07:33.120]  It causes war.
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:34.120]  It causes this.
[3:07:34.120 --> 3:07:35.120]  So we have to kill God.
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:36.440]  That's the problem.
[3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:43.480]  And so that's their excuse, but really they're just trying to act as God and kill off humanity.
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:44.760]  It's all very dark and twisted.
[3:07:44.760 --> 3:07:48.240]  I don't know if the crew can find that video or not, but it's interesting to think.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:51.640]  I mean, there's something about Bill Gates buying up all the farmland.
[3:07:51.640 --> 3:07:56.120]  He didn't do that just for fun.
[3:07:56.120 --> 3:08:00.880]  On a different note, did you see where the Mars, since Mars is hot right now, did you
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:06.760]  see where the Mars rover landed, the Preserverance rover landed, the name of the crater landed
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:07.760]  in it?
[3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:08.760]  No.
[3:08:08.760 --> 3:08:12.760]  It was a Gisero, J-E-Z-E-R-O.
[3:08:12.760 --> 3:08:19.360]  The only word in England on planet Earth that's Gisero is a Serbian Balkan word, meaning
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:20.360]  lake bed.
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:22.800]  And the rover landed in a lake bed.
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:27.960]  I just found it weird that there is all these Serbian references everywhere from where the
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:32.240]  NASA rover is landing to Wanda, Vision, and Sokovia.
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:39.080]  Yeah, I didn't really get too much into that Mars landing stuff.
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:40.720]  People were saying how it looks fake and everything.
[3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:45.280]  So I don't know, I don't trust NASA quite frankly, and I don't really care to go to
[3:08:45.280 --> 3:08:46.280]  Mars either.
[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:49.920]  I'd like to live on Earth, but I guess if the globalists conquer it, maybe we should
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:50.920]  move.
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:08:55.920]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're the starmasters.
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:09:02.360]  They're a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires,
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:07.720]  wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, that are setting up a false
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:14.000]  famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:21.400]  radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:25.360]  can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:30.280]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the noose is only
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:32.680]  going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:36.680]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:40.400]  not only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order, but at the end of the
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:43.800]  day it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:48.360]  end of the human system as we know it, and all its ashes and nightmare being built, only
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:50.760]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:54.520]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:09:57.120]  Why do you have multiple high quality ionines?
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:09:58.120]  Why do you do that?
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:02.200]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:06.680]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal ionine, but you should
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:10.440]  put one out with deeper crystal ionine and the two other types because some people can't
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:15.600]  absorb pure ionine, boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3, is it better than X2?
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:19.840]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks, well now we have a compliment to knockout
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:26.160]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and that is down and out, it's super strong, way
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:30.400]  stronger than knocked out, but they don't compete with each other, different strokes

[3:10:54.000 --> 3:11:07.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:15.280]  Well, Biden or his handlers have just put out a tweet saying that we have a new safe
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:20.640]  and effective vaccine, it's the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, yay!
[3:11:20.640 --> 3:11:24.720]  So Biden probably doesn't even have a clue what's going on, actually we don't know if
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:29.840]  it's safe or effective because they haven't run testing on it, they've done no trials
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:37.000]  on it, and yes it's been released to the public with no trials, remember, this is the same
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:42.960]  Johnson and Johnson company that knew they had asbestos in their baby powder formula
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:49.380]  for decades, remember that little goodie, Johnson and Johnson poisoning your baby for
[3:11:49.380 --> 3:11:57.440]  decades knowingly, aww, and now they're gonna vaccinate you, ooh yummy, and Joe Biden says
[3:11:57.440 --> 3:12:01.560]  it's safe and effective even though Johnson and Johnson admits they haven't done trials
[3:12:01.560 --> 3:12:07.320]  and they're actually running their first series of trials right now on infants, boy they love
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:13.440]  to go after those babies don't they, hitting them with the asbestos for decades and covering
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:20.120]  it up, now hitting them with that untested vaccine, oh but don't worry, they're above
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:25.840]  the law, so if every infant they inject with that Johnson and Johnson vaccine dies, they'll
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:33.320]  have no legal repercussions because that's how the law works for the vaccine manufacturers,
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:41.680]  isn't that nice, oh and this is just a week ago this story was in the news, Johnson and
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:48.240]  Johnson sets aside 3.9 billion amid baby powder lawsuits, oh so I get it, so you poisoned
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:54.160]  babies for decades at Johnson and Johnson and now you're basically broke because of
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:12:58.680]  all the lawsuits, so now you're gonna try to sell a vaccine to make up for those losses,
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:05.320]  I get it, I get it, that's how it, okay, now I'm really confident in this system, alright
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:10.400]  let's go back out to the phone lines, Trish has called in from the state of Washington,
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:14.640]  Trish you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead, yeah hi Owen, thanks for taking my call,
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:19.600]  I wanted to talk a little bit about what Sherry Tempenny was talking about the vaccine
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:26.840]  side effects, one of the big issues is if you have something that may resemble any kind
[3:13:26.840 --> 3:13:32.600]  of side effects or anything after you take a vaccine, if your doctor denies that it's
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:38.240]  from your vaccine it doesn't get reported and a lot of things are under reported when
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:46.480]  it goes to the CDC and I know that the informed consent action network, what Del Big Tree
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:52.800]  works with, they actually sued the CDC several times on that because they're under reporting
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:59.840]  all of those side effects no matter if it's a COVID vaccine or a regular vaccine and just
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:10.440]  recently the CDC removed the, on their website how the vaccines don't cause autism and then
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:17.160]  they put it back, now the important consent action network, they went and they sued, they
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:24.480]  just did it on the 2nd of March, they're suing the CDC again regarding that, so these vaccines
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:31.680]  are you know, the side effects are not being properly reported because if your doctor doesn't
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:37.560]  agree with it, it doesn't get reported and another thing is I know for personal experience
[3:14:37.560 --> 3:14:46.480]  with this COVID vaccine, Kaiser, my medical insurance, they emailed me a digital consent,
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:54.520]  they wanted me to consent digitally to get the COVID vaccine without any type of information,
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.800]  now that's really shady.
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:03.520]  So I'm confused, did you like request to get a vaccine and get it to insurance or they
[3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:04.520]  just sent this unprompted?
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:09.560]  No, just every once in a while my insurance they send me emails or whatever but I got
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:14.040]  an email a while back and they said hey you know if you want the COVID vaccine, you know
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:18.880]  you can consent to have it, you know your COVID or your flu shot, you go on your web
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:24.880]  portal you know that you personally have with your insurance and there was a wait, yeah
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:31.000]  it was a digital consent form when you went there and there was actually no data, it gave
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:35.880]  you no, you know like you have, there was no fact sheet, there was no nothing, so you
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:40.120]  know like when everybody says you know you can get the, you know the vaccine insert,
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:45.680]  they don't give you that information and so I'm asking, hold on, hold on Trish, Trish,
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:48.640]  what are they, what are you consenting to exactly?
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:58.960]  They wanted me, Kaiser wanted me to consent digitally on their website to get a vaccine.
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:02.080]  But I mean are they saying like, but I'm saying what are you consenting to, are they
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:05.520]  saying if you have side effects like that they won't be held responsible or something,
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:09.240]  I mean what is the, like what is the sign off, why do they want you to sign this?
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:13.480]  Well I believe it was just, you know like when you go in the doctor and you get a vaccine
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:17.800]  and you have that little piece of paper that you know you have to sign the piece of paper,
[3:16:17.800 --> 3:16:23.640]  it's like a consent for a vaccine, that was what it was, but it was digitally, so they
[3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:28.000]  assume everybody's going to get the COVID vaccine, they just hey this is easy, you can
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  digitally consent for it and then go and go into Kaiser and get your vaccine and you
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:37.720]  know you don't have to stop any paper, look at that, we have this thing here, oh my gosh
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:42.480]  this is insanity, hold on go back to the top though, all right sorry to the, they admit
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:47.960]  Pfizer biotech vaccine, I mean folks they are telling you this is a, oh my gosh this
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:55.280]  is a, Trish thank you so much for the call, honestly I just, I'm so overwhelmed by this
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:17:05.840]  and I mean I, how this responsibility to give you this information lands on my lap is just
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:21.280]  I mean folks they are literally doing a worldwide trial, they are literally doing human experimentation
[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:30.400]  with a brand new technology biotech, so look dude, they faked a pandemic, they're trying
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:42.720]  to get you to take a trial vaccine worldwide, a whole experiment around the globe, I mean
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:45.720]  it's overwhelming, all right let me squeeze in another call, Margaret in Massachusetts
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:51.520]  you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead, hi Owen it's nice to speak with you again,
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:56.400]  I've called in the past, I want to do in the audience to know I'm a nurse, a registered
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:03.240]  nurse with over 25 years experience, I have a bachelor's degree, I have a master's degree
[3:18:03.240 --> 3:18:11.520]  and I did not know about all the toxins and animal and fetal tissues that are in vaccines
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:19.160]  and I learned a lot over the past 11 months by listening to info wars which led me to
[3:18:19.160 --> 3:18:25.400]  such great doctors and physicians like Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, you know there's a bunch
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:32.840]  of them, Dr. Wakefield, Dr. Polovsky, I learned so much more about these vaccines on this
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:39.200]  past 11 months, doing research, listening to Dr. Tenpenny, way more than the Harvard
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:46.240]  affiliated Boston hospitals that I worked at ever, ever taught me, you know the propaganda,
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:49.640]  it's corporate propaganda and it's-
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:53.280]  But Margaret don't you see how that's why for me to be sitting in this chair with this
[3:18:53.280 --> 3:18:58.080]  microphone in this audience, it's like, it's not even like, oh I'm not worthy, it's just
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:05.360]  like, I mean I don't know how to explain it, it's like I didn't ask to be telling you that
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:06.520]  there's an agenda to kill you.
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:12.280]  They should get, God asked you, God asked you, God is asking all of us, he's opened our
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:19.480]  eyes for whatever reason this year Owen, you know your collar earlier Trey, he was great,
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:27.080]  I really empathized with him and his wife, the high pressure tactics, I was fired, I
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:28.640]  was fired, just, well-
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:32.400]  Hey Margaret, hold on the line, I gotta take a break, I wanna hear about this, it's just
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:37.160]  so incredible, folks again, look I'm Owen Schreuer, I'm from St. Louis, Missouri, I'm
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:41.200]  not that great, okay, for whatever reason the mainstream media won't tell you, this
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:47.040]  is a giant worldwide human experiment and it could potentially just kill you, okay, so
[3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:50.720]  there it is, I don't know what else to say.
[3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:55.920]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large, the population has been trained to submit,
[3:19:55.920 --> 3:20:00.560]  do what you're told, it's all gonna pass, but if you study authoritarians, if you study
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:03.840]  the globalists you'll understand that they reach a point where all the training is just
[3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:08.440]  beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved and because the globalists
[3:20:08.440 --> 3:20:13.040]  see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move and they are collapsing
[3:20:13.040 --> 3:20:17.200]  the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that
[3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:23.480]  the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:28.120]  to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:34.120]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:39.560]  Schwab was saying and Bill Gates was saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the
[3:20:39.560 --> 3:20:45.440]  UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank
[3:20:45.440 --> 3:20:50.080]  money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:53.720]  The globalists want you dependent, they want you alone, they want you bankrupt, they want
[3:20:53.720 --> 3:20:58.840]  you starving in the dark, that is what their entire spirit is driving for because they
[3:20:58.840 --> 3:21:00.320]  want total submission.
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:04.600]  When you get high quality storeable foods that last more than a decade, you are buying
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:09.040]  food insurance that you and your family and your neighbors and friends can eat.

[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:54.320]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:59.680]  Cell phones are an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld but big tech,
[3:21:59.680 --> 3:22:04.240]  large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially
[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:09.960]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:14.800]  they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's
[3:22:14.800 --> 3:22:17.080]  going to happen in mass movements.
[3:22:17.080 --> 3:22:23.600]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:27.920]  In their own words, they admit it, so I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:30.000]  and things like that for more than a decade.
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:33.480]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:38.400]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:43.520]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:45.800]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:53.120]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[3:22:53.120 --> 3:23:04.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:04.920 --> 3:23:11.520]  This is really incredible.
[3:23:11.520 --> 3:23:18.480]  It's just total madness.
[3:23:18.480 --> 3:23:35.040]  So you've been sold out to China by all of our major institutions and you've been sold
[3:23:35.040 --> 3:23:46.080]  out to the devil by most of our media and politicians and Hollywood here in the United
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  States.
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:51.120]  I held over Margaret here folks.
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:24:02.920]  I'm just overwhelmed because I don't know how to explain it but it's weird that it's
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:12.240]  like a burden and that you're somehow on an island because you just want to tell people
[3:24:12.240 --> 3:24:22.640]  the truth and you still want to have a free human race on planet Earth.
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:26.360]  So I don't know how this is going to go.
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:29.560]  I don't know if people are going to look back at these broadcasts in 10 years when everybody's
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:33.440]  dying from the COVID vaccine or whatever other vaccine or who knows what else is going on
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:39.520]  or they're in total Chinese death camp or something.
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:43.760]  And just look at it like wow info wars boy they were like profits or something no folks
[3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:46.280]  I'm not a profit okay.
[3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:50.880]  I'm 31 years old I'm from St. Louis Missouri I came up in sports media I've been on the
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:57.600]  radio hosting talk shows since I was 21 years old and as soon as I found out how the media
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:03.160]  was lying to me and as soon as I found out how serious it was the implications well that's
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:11.040]  how I ended up right here in this seat hosting the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:18.120]  When all I do is just take my quite frankly probably addicted obsessive compulsive disorder
[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:23.680]  that I have for media consumption and then have the constellations building up in my
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:28.400]  head with data points so that I can then sit here and tell you the constellation.
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:35.480]  We are in the middle of a worldwide human experiment.
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:41.940]  The first level was to release the virus and see how it would spread and study it.
[3:25:41.940 --> 3:25:47.080]  Now we're in the trial of the quote unquote vaccine.
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:54.040]  Now you didn't sign on to this I didn't sign on to this we can try to avoid this as much
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:26:03.880]  as we can but it's nearly impossible now it will be totally impossible in five ten years.
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:08.240]  I don't know what the solution is my instinct is to warn people about it and hope that they'll
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:12.040]  wake up and take action against it but you know maybe there is no solution maybe this
[3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:15.200]  is just our ultimate destiny.
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:20.000]  To which then I'm wondering if I'm insane for even trying to stop this from conquering
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:26.140]  planet earth whatever this force of nature or humanity is that is currently conquering
[3:26:26.140 --> 3:26:30.160]  earth right now off world different dimension.
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:40.680]  I don't know okay but I can't even get a fellow human to agree on basic stats and basic facts
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:47.760]  because they've been so brainwashed and they've been so turned over to Stockholm syndrome
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:54.280]  and believing that their slave masters will save them it's just crazy I mean like I said
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:26:59.800]  the last thing I want to do is to be an insane person thinking people care hey maybe people
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:09.400]  want to be slaves who am I to stop them from being a slave I don't want to be a slave
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:15.240]  and so that's the disconnect hey hey liberal progressive dumbass if you want to be a slave
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:19.400]  be a slave I don't care in fact I got some laundry in my house right now you go do it
[3:27:19.400 --> 3:27:24.520]  for free go clean my bathroom go do all the stuff I'll give you a free vaccine if that's
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:31.600]  really what you want your destiny to be that's what Bill Gates wants your destiny to be he
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:38.080]  won't be so kind to you that's what China wants your destiny to be they won't be so
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:47.520]  kind to you oh boy and so we take the callers and they're the best callers we have Margaret
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:53.720]  a nurse called in who I mean how dare you Margaret who's been a nurse for decades and
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:27:58.400]  has a master's degree how dare you be educated on the truth how dare you know about these
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:10.760]  vaccines how dare you want freedom of choice and so now they're threatening to fire you
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:17.040]  when I said that I learned a lot this past year I really mean it I used to give flu shots
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:23.920]  I used to do flu shot clinics and those little package inserts hardly ever read they are
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:31.240]  almost the font is so small you they're almost illegible it's really difficult but again
[3:28:31.240 --> 3:28:37.640]  just for matter of time I did not know all the things that are in vaccines now from
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:41.840]  a religious perspective but isn't that crazy like when I I almost don't even want to tell
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:46.480]  people hey you know there's dead baby parts in the vaccine yeah you know there's fentanyl
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:49.760]  and some of that it's like I don't even want to tell it it's so out of control it's like
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:56.120]  I don't even want to say it I know I honestly honest to God I didn't either I would have
[3:28:56.120 --> 3:29:01.720]  never been vaccinated I would have not let my daughter get vaccinated but um anyway
[3:29:01.720 --> 3:29:08.040]  the pediatric hospital that I worked for took a hard stance to share what they demanded
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:12.120]  everyone get a flu vaccine and it didn't make sense because everyone's got to wear
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:17.760]  a mask and so and by the way according to the CDC there's zero flu anymore so we've eradicated
[3:29:17.760 --> 3:29:22.560]  the flu so why would you need that vaccine exactly that was something else that was a
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:28.520]  point that I tried to bring up but they they took a hard stance and I I said no this goes
[3:29:28.520 --> 3:29:34.800]  against my religious beliefs I'm sorry I've taken these vaccines in the past but I didn't
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:39.800]  know what was in them and now that I know what's in them I'm not taking them and I'm
[3:29:39.800 --> 3:29:45.320]  not compromising and I actually had the HR representative say well usually when we you
[3:29:45.320 --> 3:29:51.760]  know kind of crush the issue people cave I said well not this one so I was fired last
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:29:57.800]  week because I will not take a flu vaccine and the main other reason about this I took
[3:29:57.800 --> 3:30:03.080]  such a hard stance is because I knew if I kept giving in and everyone keeps giving in
[3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:07.640]  the next thing that's going to get mandated is the murder injection and there's no way
[3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:14.080]  in hell me or my family are taking that but it's okay I have a very supportive husband
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:19.480]  you know if this has given me an opportunity for a new beginning I'm going to become an
[3:30:19.480 --> 3:30:25.560]  activist I am going to fight this tyranny and I really mean this God bless you and Alex
[3:30:25.560 --> 3:30:32.000]  and the brave doctors like Dr. Tenpenny I'm part of her boot camp by the way where she
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:37.440]  does a lot of education because if I didn't learn what I learned in this walk down which
[3:30:37.440 --> 3:30:44.120]  actually worked against the corporate new world order I probably would have taken that
[3:30:44.120 --> 3:30:49.320]  murder injection and I probably would have had my daughter and my husband take it but
[3:30:49.320 --> 3:30:55.840]  I learned a lot this year and you know sadly I try to educate some of my co-workers every
[3:30:55.840 --> 3:31:01.960]  single one in the department took that injection and it broke my heart and I fear for their
[3:31:01.960 --> 3:31:09.080]  lives and I pray for them but all I can say is I'm glad to be out of the corporate hospital
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:15.840]  system and I'm going to do everything in my power to educate this people on this and
[3:31:15.840 --> 3:31:20.520]  to fight it so thank you guys for the opportunity to tell everyone that.
[3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:25.600]  Well thank you for the call Margaret and I mean look folks believe me I'm just like
[3:31:25.600 --> 3:31:31.680]  you maybe in some ways even worse I want to go play 18 holes the golf I want to go have
[3:31:31.680 --> 3:31:38.040]  a hot dog and a cold beer at a ball game I want to go to the beach and have the sand
[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:43.440]  in my toes and the sun on me like I want to be a human I want to enjoy this creation
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:49.080]  of God I love it it's awesome but the damn devils here are trying to take all of it from
[3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:53.980]  us they hate us and it's like I was thinking about this because the crew flashed something
[3:31:53.980 --> 3:32:00.960]  on the screen here's the problem you're a good person you don't assume the worst about
[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:07.320]  somebody in fact you're the opposite you assume the best about somebody but we have to accept
[3:32:07.320 --> 3:32:14.160]  this and I would say in fact I'll predict in five years this will be basic basic brain
[3:32:14.160 --> 3:32:22.200]  functioning basic thought processing here in our own intelligence systems folks a democrat
[3:32:22.200 --> 3:32:27.720]  a liberal is lying to you period end of sentence done they're lying assume it anything a democrat
[3:32:27.720 --> 3:32:31.520]  says is a lie anything a liberal progressive says is a lie and I'm thinking about this
[3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:35.040]  because apparently I guess Jack Dorsey is going on the Joe Rogan show remember when
[3:32:35.040 --> 3:32:40.240]  you had Tim Poole and the Twitter lawyers in the studio that day everything they said
[3:32:40.240 --> 3:32:45.040]  was a lie they just lie right to your face they have no qualms about it nothing holds
[3:32:45.040 --> 3:32:49.200]  these people back they are lying scum and they're going to force you to take a vaccine

[3:35:38.960 --> 3:35:44.880]  point out we try to stop us so prepare yourselves america you're going under a judge but just
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:51.720]  like all the children that were aborted this is the truth this is the info war you know

[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:04.040]  about that I care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility

[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:06.680]  show all right i'm going to cover so much more coming up on the war room here in the
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:12.520]  next three hours i'm going to finish up with your calls on the alex jones show but no sooner
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:16.720]  as i'm sitting here ranting about how democrats just everything they say is a lie it's just
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:21.960]  that's their operating procedure there's a group of migrants at the southern border i'm
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:25.040]  going to play this coming up on the war room they're all wearing biden t-shirts and they're
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:30.040]  all saying biden said he would let us in biden said we could get in and get free stuff and
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:39.160]  now we're being held up at the southern border what's going on he's a liar i'm telling you
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:44.040]  it'll be five to ten years maybe too late by then but within five to two years people
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:48.280]  will finally get it everything a democrat tells you is a total lie it's a total inversion
[3:37:48.280 --> 3:37:53.480]  reality and then at the sub level of that the democrat voters the liberal progressives
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:38:01.040]  out there uh... they're just stockholm syndrome uh...
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:06.360]  is it's it's it's kind of like a lesser of a lie like they kind of believe it even though
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:11.200]  they have their own repercussions there you know kind of written in their own head they
[3:38:11.200 --> 3:38:14.640]  just go along with the big lie because they want to feel like they're part of something
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:19.640]  bigger
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:26.200]  quick couple headlines here policy claims capital is under threat from all of trumps men
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:30.000]  oh yeah but they admitted that they just faked another insurrection yesterday nothing happened
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.840]  and so now they've said march twentieth is the big day wait we had it wrong it's going
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:34.960]  to be march twentieth where all the trumps were going to go
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:37.680]  uh... nobody's talking about this trumps not talking about this i don't know a single
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:38.960]  trumps were talking about this
[3:38:38.960 --> 3:38:42.360]  not a single trumps were i know everyone's to go to dc ever again in their life
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:48.040]  and you know i'm so soon you know i don't even wanna
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:50.120]  i'm just gonna say this
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:51.880]  if you're listening to
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:54.800]  i see i don't want to make blanket statements but
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:57.080]  most conservatives in dc
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:00.720]  they're kind of just getting popular now look they like to die their beards
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:05.080]  they like to have their hair perfectly clothed and combed and gelled and they
[3:39:05.080 --> 3:39:09.400]  wear the big fancy suits and they get their new podcast now and they get to go
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:12.320]  to the dinners and events in dc and they get their
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:15.000]  they still have their twitter accounts and they still have their youtube
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:16.060]  they know
[3:39:16.060 --> 3:39:20.240]  everything that info wars talks about here on air is true and they'll never say
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:24.120]  anything because they're too comfortable they like looking fancy they like having
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:27.560]  the prestige they like their paycheck still coming in and they like getting
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:30.760]  the invites to the white house dinners and all the other stuff
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:34.040]  so they will never tell you the truth
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:35.560]  they censor themselves
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:38.480]  not here
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:42.080]  fake news a bc desperately tries to drum up controversy after four trump's
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:45.720]  border show up to plan march forth insurrection so project people showing
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:48.400]  up in trump at just because they're in dc or their tourists and then they say
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:52.920]  all there's the insurrection for tourists in trump hats see we told you we
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:53.600]  needed
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:39:55.800]  offense
[3:39:55.800 --> 3:39:58.640]  all and they've also now extended the national guard for another sixty days in
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:00.160]  dc
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:02.920]  here's a heartbreaking story from the gateway planet

[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:46.320]  i'm gonna play more of it coming up you had it yesterday where they had to cut
[3:40:46.320 --> 3:40:48.040]  off the white house
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:51.920]  feed on wednesday because he was falling apart he had to ask nancy polosi's
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:40:54.320]  permission to take questions

[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:29.960]  going on
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:33.040]  but after the attack on in iraq
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:36.000]  now the u.s. is saying yeah we may have to get further involved in the middle
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:36.600]  east again
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:40.640]  all who would have seen that coming from the globalist pawn joe biden
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:43.360]  and the washington establishment to put him in there that's never seen a war
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:45.480]  that they didn't want to get involved in so hey
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:47.200]  what makes the money in stocks

[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:53.440]  bowing and uh... poor at that your bottom dollar by this is involved in the
[3:41:53.440 --> 3:41:55.400]  middle east you can see some nice returns there
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:57.000]  all right let's go to george
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:01.160]  in that i mean if you like profiting off death that is i'm not want to do that
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:02.560]  but they you know what you might want
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:07.240]  all right george in chicago you're on the alice joe show go ahead
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:10.600]  they all think they have me on again love you guys
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:12.360]  they might not even need a stage
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:14.920]  a false flag to ignite a civil war
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:18.000]  they just require mandatory vaccination
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.800]  for those of us who don't get it becomes like a class citizen
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:24.520]  the same way that they do platform anyone who's pro truth
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:27.440]  pro freedom online they could just do that where
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:31.360]  they stop you from being a functioning member of society
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:33.240]  so
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:36.640]  yet they're already doing that kick in
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:40.120]  and see here's the amazing you look at a group like the amish
[3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:44.200]  i mean who who just were traditionalist or saw all this coming
[3:42:44.200 --> 3:42:46.840]  so just built an off-grid society
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:48.640]  the the
[3:42:48.640 --> 3:42:52.440]  political establishment is now coming after the amish
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:54.120]  so you think you live on a free
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:56.760]  planet you think you live in a free country ask the amish
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:42:59.080]  who are probably have everything in their way of life
[3:42:59.080 --> 3:43:00.080]  shut down
[3:43:00.080 --> 3:43:04.040]  because of a fake pandemic and it just shows you know these are totalitarian
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:07.960]  the nature of our government is totalitarian there is no freedom for
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:12.120]  you until we push back against it
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:16.880]  exactly i'm ready to go on a summary to go off the grid i'm ready to go retro
[3:43:16.880 --> 3:43:20.600]  and if i mean i can live without social media i can live with all all this
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:22.560]  advancement of technology
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:25.280]  uh... what but you're telling me that
[3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:29.000]  entertain you know entertainment markets gymnasium that's not around for
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:32.560]  thousands of years you're telling me i can't go to these places
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:35.240]  but i don't care if you can you get me off social media but you're telling me i
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:38.440]  can't go to the grocery store can't go to the gym in primal instinct in a kick
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:42.680]  in it and you're going to start seeing brawls at airport oh yeah three stores
[3:43:42.680 --> 3:43:44.400]  oh you're already doing that
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:46.800]  now here's what's going to be interesting though george
[3:43:46.800 --> 3:43:50.880]  uh... with texas set to reopen in mississippi and i and connecticut and
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:55.040]  then in west virginia just announced today that they're totally reopening to
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:56.040]  uh...
[3:43:56.040 --> 3:43:59.080]  so so there's going to be a move
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:02.720]  by the globalist by the criminal international cabal
[3:44:02.720 --> 3:44:06.760]  to put us getting up at the back in our place i i i i don't know what it is but
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:10.840]  i can sense it man they don't like texans being free they don't like americans
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:15.240]  being free they don't like these governors lifting all the the fake pandemic
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:19.120]  uh... shutdowns so there's going to be a response to the uppity
[3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:21.080]  people wanting to be free again
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:25.480]  uh... i don't know what it's going to be but they're going to respond somehow
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:28.600]  whatever that is is going to be a response because if you're going to
[3:44:28.600 --> 3:44:30.400]  accept the
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:33.200]  i mean you're going to put your destruction if i feel like
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:37.120]  the same way they want to abolish gender i feel like that's an agenda to
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:41.240]  have a human hybrid merged with this new a i machine
[3:44:41.240 --> 3:44:45.080]  and they're trying to get used to get you to accept you know the smart home
[3:44:45.080 --> 3:44:48.480]  mark meter smart this smart watch the thing we have a chip on your credit
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:50.560]  card i feel like they want to merge that
[3:44:50.560 --> 3:44:54.080]  all well sure wearable like a smart watch they want to merge that i want to
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:55.560]  get you to the idea of having
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:44:59.200]  technology on your body and then eventually have it inside of you that
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:01.880]  that's what they've always wanted and they've been slowly premiering it but
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:04.760]  the question is how do they really get you to take it or how do they force it
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:09.720]  all fake a pandemic make people think they need it and then boom you've got it
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:12.760]  they make it think that it's about how it's about your own
[3:45:12.760 --> 3:45:14.720]  well-being they care about you
[3:45:14.720 --> 3:45:17.920]  about getting every book making every sure everybody
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:21.440]  because you're sick they decided when you're sick on your not thick
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:24.280]  i have no symptoms in your kid you're calling me crazy you're telling me i'm
[3:45:24.280 --> 3:45:27.960]  sick but again here's here's here's our ultimate hurdle in dealing with these
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:29.040]  people there
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:32.360]  they they will never be honest about who they are
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:36.560]  these are totalitarians that are pro-government and anti-freedom
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:40.440]  and if we could just get them to admit it it would be game over that's why they
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:42.280]  lie about everything they do
[3:45:42.280 --> 3:45:45.720]  we are dealing with people that are pro-government and anti-freedom folks
[3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:48.560]  and they lie about it because they know if they were honest about that you
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:51.600]  wouldn't follow a damn thing that they said thank you for the call george let's
[3:45:51.600 --> 3:45:56.600]  go to jefferson in virginia you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:45:59.640]  i want to talk to you
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:02.280]  kudos ditto
[3:46:02.280 --> 3:46:05.600]  you know the lying leftist liberals will tell you
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:08.680]  that your your favorite colby gabard
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:12.600]  is ineligible to be vice president because she's not natural born
[3:46:12.600 --> 3:46:13.840]  oh why she
[3:46:13.840 --> 3:46:17.480]  why is she not natural born
[3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:20.680]  well uh... why
[3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:23.720]  uh... i guess because her parents weren't americans when she was born i'm not
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:24.920]  sure actually
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:28.640]  both of her parents were americans but she was born
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:31.360]  in american samoa
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:35.680]  okay so it's not like it's not like malta harris is a different situation
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:38.880]  i'm just i'm trying to illustrate the point that they don't care what the
[3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:41.040]  definition of natural born is
[3:46:41.040 --> 3:46:45.200]  they will use it to their advantage anyway they can wait a second old jefferson
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:49.720]  what you're telling me that liberal democrats are liars and phonies
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:46:54.400]  i don't know i'm saying we fall for their lives
[3:46:54.400 --> 3:46:58.960]  what makes a lie a big lie is how many people are willing to tell you the same
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:46:59.680]  lie
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:01.600]  it's not how big the offense is
[3:47:01.600 --> 3:47:05.400]  it's how many experts will line up to tell you something that is patently
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:06.240]  false
[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:09.960]  how is it though that gabard ran for president without anybody bringing that
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:12.840]  up isn't that funny
[3:47:12.840 --> 3:47:16.160]  people will bring it up but it never reaches the level that it's actually
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:19.320]  talked about people brought up the fact that kamala harris was not a natural
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:22.080]  born citizen but it was never brought up in the debate
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:24.920]  how does it feel though that how does it feel knowing that polosi and kamala
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:28.520]  harris are basically the acting president right now
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:33.440]  well i think it's susan rice and uh... ron clain and uh... james
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:35.960]  all right that doesn't for the alice joe show i'll be right back
[3:47:35.960 --> 3:48:01.720]  law
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:02.520]  right
