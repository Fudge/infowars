[00:00.000 --> 00:16.440]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[00:16.440 --> 00:26.840]  Jones show and now your host Owen Troyer Well, we kick off another week here.
[00:26.840 --> 00:35.600]  News, groundbreaking coverage, the great crew, the great audience, all of it, born for this
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.480]  moment in the Info War.
[00:39.480 --> 00:43.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've got tons of news today and obviously the big
[00:43.720 --> 00:50.840]  stories being the midterm elections, shenanigans, if you don't at least doubt what's going on
[00:50.840 --> 00:54.320]  or have questions at this point, you're just lying to yourself, you're lying to everyone
[00:54.320 --> 00:55.320]  around you.
[00:55.320 --> 01:03.640]  We've come back, but we always had that feeling about you liberals.
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.200]  And then there's the FTX scandal that really is just the icing on the cake.
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.880]  And it's the icing on the cake that just shows how the American left ignores all their
[01:13.880 --> 01:20.840]  own crimes while pointing the finger at conservatives with their made up crimes.
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.420]  And then, okay, that's just between us.
[01:24.420 --> 01:27.920]  Then there's the government approach where they're all focused on going after Elon Musk
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.360]  right now and you watch the FTX guys will probably get ignored.
[01:33.360 --> 01:35.800]  The one guy was still tweeting as of moments ago.
[01:35.800 --> 01:42.040]  So here's a special report from Greg Reese with all the swamp connections, all the swamp
[01:42.040 --> 01:48.880]  filled muck that the entire FTX Democrat money laundering through Ukraine scandal has involved
[01:48.880 --> 01:51.520]  with it, and we'll come back and get to the news.
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.120]  Here's a special report from Greg Reese.
[01:56.120 --> 02:06.880]  FTX founder, Sam Bankman Freed was the largest donor to the Democrat Party second to George
[02:06.880 --> 02:15.080]  Soros for the spurious 2022 midterms, nearly $40 million, which reportedly came from crypto
[02:15.080 --> 02:17.040]  donations to Ukraine.
[02:17.040 --> 02:23.480]  FTX was partnered with the World Economic Forum as one of Klaus Schwab's stakeholders.
[02:23.480 --> 02:31.480]  FTX's founder reportedly used a secret backdoor to steal over a billion dollars from the customers
[02:31.480 --> 02:35.440]  of the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange.
[02:35.440 --> 02:40.600]  But there's more to the story than Sam Bankman Freed and a money laundering slush fund for
[02:40.600 --> 02:42.600]  the failing Democrat Party.
[02:42.600 --> 02:50.200]  The CEO for FTX was Caroline Ellison, whose father is Glenn Ellison, head of the MIT Economics
[02:50.200 --> 02:51.200]  Department.
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.800]  Glenn Ellison hired Gary Gensler to head the cryptocurrency department at MIT in 2018.
[02:58.800 --> 03:06.120]  And in 2021, the Biden administration nominated Gary Gensler as the chair of the U.S. Securities
[03:06.120 --> 03:12.080]  and Exchange Commission, who has been laser focused on gaining control of cryptocurrency.
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.360]  While the SEC has been routinely combative towards cryptos, they have treated FTX like
[03:18.360 --> 03:25.640]  family, causing many to argue that FTX was being groomed and set up by the SEC to monopolize
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.640]  the crypto market.
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.360]  FTX was an exchange that had a bright sheen on it.
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.520]  It was led by a CEO that was often on Capitol Hill and being photographed with regulators
[03:37.520 --> 03:39.400]  and lawmakers.
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.520]  And so there was a sense that the exchange was very buttoned up.
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.400]  Cryptocurrency has the potential to strip power from the central banking system.
[03:48.400 --> 03:50.800]  And that makes it a major threat.
[03:50.800 --> 03:56.640]  As the story unfolds, don't be surprised if this mess becomes the catalyst for government
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.120]  overreach into cryptocurrencies.
[03:59.120 --> 04:04.880]  The journal reporting the CEO allegedly using customer money from FTX to fund risky bets
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.200]  at his other company, a hedge fund called Alameda.
[04:08.200 --> 04:13.640]  Many people believe that this will definitely set back the crypto industry for years.
[04:13.640 --> 04:16.400]  You know, this is a tale as old as time to some degree.
[04:16.400 --> 04:22.600]  Some young charismatic guy and Bermuda shorts with a floppy hair, charmed the 20 best investors
[04:22.600 --> 04:23.600]  in the world.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.480]  Rebecca, the big question here, was this a mistake by the founders or a crime?
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.920]  Well, that's a question the regulators will ultimately have to answer here.
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.440]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.360]  Was it a crime?
[04:38.360 --> 04:39.360]  Well, of course not.
[04:39.360 --> 04:40.360]  It was Democrats.
[04:40.360 --> 04:41.360]  It was liberals.
[04:41.360 --> 04:44.360]  And it was Ukraine.
[04:44.360 --> 04:46.360]  No crime here.
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.360]  No crime at all.
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.000]  And your elections are totally fair.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.120]  There's no shenanigans.
[04:53.120 --> 04:54.880]  There's no cheating in your elections.
[04:54.880 --> 04:57.280]  And there was no crime with FTX.
[04:57.280 --> 05:04.760]  Go back to sleep, America.
[05:04.760 --> 05:09.120]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[05:09.120 --> 05:15.280]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[05:15.280 --> 05:20.800]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[05:20.800 --> 05:27.200]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars, because we know the globalists
[05:27.200 --> 05:31.720]  the number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.720]  them down peacefully.
[05:32.720 --> 05:38.040]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.200]  highest quality for your immune system and more.
[05:40.200 --> 05:42.160]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.

[06:01.880 --> 06:06.960]  You've expected the speediest, Joan, we're all in here.
[06:06.960 --> 06:17.080]  And honor and a privilege to be with you here on this Monday, November 14, 2022, live transmission
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.400]  of the Alex Jones show.
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.200]  We got great guests coming up today.
[06:25.200 --> 06:29.720]  We've got Matt Baker, who's boots on the ground in Arizona, talking to voters down
[06:29.720 --> 06:32.040]  there about what they saw at the polls.
[06:32.040 --> 06:37.520]  He's going to give his account of what he saw that day and beyond as they continue to
[06:37.520 --> 06:41.600]  count its election season now at last months.
[06:41.600 --> 06:46.880]  We count votes until all Democrats win, and then we declare the winner.
[06:46.880 --> 06:53.840]  Joe Hoft with his deep dive into the election systems and how they're being used to rig
[06:53.840 --> 06:55.520]  elections.
[06:55.520 --> 06:58.800]  That went Joe Hoft from the Gateway Pundit at 12.30.
[06:58.800 --> 07:09.800]  And then Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, big crypto expert to join and discuss the FTX
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.280]  scandal.
[07:13.280 --> 07:19.720]  But there's so much breaking now on all these different fronts, and I think that the average
[07:19.720 --> 07:24.800]  American is really beginning to wake up and realize what's going on.
[07:24.800 --> 07:32.480]  I think between FTX scandal, money laundering for the Democrat Party, and all of these election
[07:32.480 --> 07:38.680]  shenanigans that always favor the Democrat Party, the average American is waking up and
[07:38.680 --> 07:41.840]  realize who are the bad guys, who are the good guys.
[07:41.840 --> 07:47.280]  The brainwashed people who are just in a total trance at this point under complete mind control,
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.560]  they're just gone.
[07:48.560 --> 07:51.800]  They just are in the reality that is force-fed to them.
[07:51.800 --> 07:57.000]  They are in the reality that is presented to them, and they consume it every day without
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.720]  any second thought.
[07:59.720 --> 08:02.000]  So that's an incredible phenomenon.
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.080]  But to the rest of us that can still think, that can still see, and still have a will
[08:08.080 --> 08:15.120]  to be free and prosper into the future, I think things are getting pretty clear.
[08:15.120 --> 08:24.440]  And what is amazing about the current dichotomy of the American political debate is that the
[08:24.440 --> 08:37.000]  conservative side is frustrated and upset that the leftist liberal side will not react
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.600]  to the truth, whether it's the Hunter Biden story, whether it's all the election shenanigans,
[08:44.600 --> 08:53.080]  whether it's this FTX deal that will be the latest thing, conservatives are frustrated
[08:53.080 --> 09:02.440]  that liberals won't recognize and react to the truth, whereas liberals, leftists, Democrats
[09:02.440 --> 09:08.840]  are angry, frustrated and upset that you won't react to their lies, whether it's Russian
[09:08.840 --> 09:15.480]  collusion or you're an election denier when they have denied every presidential election
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.960]  that they've lost in the 21st century.
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.160]  So the average American, the person that can still see, can still think is realizing this.
[09:24.160 --> 09:28.000]  Now that doesn't mean they're going to become right-wingers or conservatives or anything.
[09:28.000 --> 09:29.800]  They're just going to know who the bad guys are.
[09:29.800 --> 09:32.160]  They're just going to have their eyes open to start asking the right questions.
[09:32.160 --> 09:40.120]  And maybe getting the answers, Elon Musk might be a good example, which is why they're going
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.400]  to be going after Elon Musk, the Justice Department, the Biden administration is going to be aggressively
[09:45.400 --> 09:53.000]  going after Elon Musk more so than they will after the FTX deal with those criminals because
[09:53.000 --> 10:03.120]  they were Democrats and Elon Musk has said as much recently in public statements.
[10:03.120 --> 10:09.480]  So we'll be covering that and they do have basically some anvils over Elon Musk's head
[10:09.480 --> 10:17.720]  right now that my guess is behind the scenes, some form of a government entity or Democrat
[10:17.720 --> 10:23.400]  entity is basically giving Elon Musk the wink and the nod saying, look, you play ball with
[10:23.400 --> 10:24.400]  us.
[10:24.400 --> 10:28.000]  These anvils we have over your head here that we could cut the rope at any minute are going
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.320]  to fall and crush you if you don't.
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.720]  So I'll explain that coming up.
[10:35.720 --> 10:41.160]  But what is it about U.S. elections that take months now?
[10:41.160 --> 10:43.080]  And yes, it is months.
[10:43.080 --> 10:44.080]  It is months.
[10:44.080 --> 10:50.600]  In fact, I don't know when early voting officially opened in Texas, but my guess is probably
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.120]  about a month ago, probably about October 14th or so.
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.160]  So or you can go better yet, look at Arizona.
[10:59.160 --> 11:00.160]  Probably the same thing.
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.640]  In fact, guys, see if you can find out, let's find out when Arizona opened early voting
[11:05.640 --> 11:07.320]  for the 2022 midterms.
[11:07.320 --> 11:15.080]  So you have month long elections now and we all know the system, which is we just count
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.400]  votes until the Democrat wins and then we stop.
[11:19.400 --> 11:20.920]  That's how we play.
[11:20.920 --> 11:22.920]  That's the game we play.
[11:22.920 --> 11:30.320]  And the Republican leadership of the McLoosers, McConnell, McCarthy and McDaniel, the McLoos
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.640]  team, they're more focused on getting rid of Donald Trump.
[11:35.640 --> 11:39.600]  And for the last two years have been working behind the scenes, trying to figure out how
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.600]  to get rid of Donald Trump after the midterms that they let Georgia slip out of their hands.
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.480]  They let Arizona slip out of their hands and they're letting Nevada get stolen in broad
[11:49.480 --> 11:50.480]  daylight.
[11:50.480 --> 11:52.160]  They've already given up Pennsylvania.
[11:52.160 --> 11:54.040]  They've already given up Michigan.
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.880]  Miracle win in Wisconsin.
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.800]  But I think there's a reason for that we'll explain with Joe Hoft.
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.060]  There was a strategy there.
[12:03.060 --> 12:06.960]  But the good news is, and we will be mentioning or getting deeper into the story today, is
[12:06.960 --> 12:14.000]  that the Republican leadership that is has now an expiration date of yesterday.
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.760]  And we opened up the milk carton and took one whiff and said, yep, this is rotten.
[12:20.760 --> 12:22.080]  This is spoiled.
[12:22.080 --> 12:23.680]  Give it the toss.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.080]  And so Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy and Ron McDaniel really thought they could pull
[12:27.080 --> 12:28.800]  this off.
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.080]  They really thought that they could have a complete disaster of a midterm elections
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.720]  that sort of been much more successful for Republicans.
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.800]  And then immediately on the Wednesday after the election day, take the long knives out
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.200]  for Donald Trump.
[12:42.200 --> 12:43.920]  You really think we wouldn't notice that.
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.520]  You really think we wouldn't realize what you were up to all of these years and why
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.160]  you abandoned us in Arizona and why you abandoned us in Georgia and why you abandoned us in
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.800]  Nevada and why you've just given Pennsylvania and Michigan to the Democrats.
[12:57.800 --> 13:04.160]  Now we know why because Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy and Ron McDaniel all were scheming
[13:04.160 --> 13:05.920]  how to get rid of Donald Trump.
[13:05.920 --> 13:12.400]  And Kevin McCarthy was in there like a little rat cozying up to Donald Trump.
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.540]  He's a rat.
[13:16.540 --> 13:17.800]  And so here we are.
[13:17.800 --> 13:19.040]  They're still counting votes.
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.720]  They're still stealing Arizona.
[13:22.720 --> 13:24.320]  And the Republicans are in on it.
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.000]  But there will be a change of the guard.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.480]  There is a new breed of a Republican.
[13:29.480 --> 13:32.120]  There is a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.480]  And now, quite frankly, it appears that the establishment has made the decision even easier
[13:37.480 --> 13:45.760]  for us moving forward, which is in this current window of time, we've got to support Donald
[13:45.760 --> 13:47.760]  Trump.
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.240]  And I'm not saying he's the best candidate and I'm not saying he hasn't made big mistakes
[13:51.240 --> 13:58.480]  and I'm not saying that we got issues to clear up here, but clearly at this point, the deep
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.240]  state and the establishment want Trump out of the picture.
[14:03.240 --> 14:11.280]  And more importantly, he is going to have to be the one that is the head of this hostile
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.200]  takeover, this populist takeover of the Republican Party.
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.360]  And thank God, Ron DeSantis never took the bait.
[14:20.360 --> 14:25.520]  And God Ron DeSantis is just keeping his head down, doing a great job in Florida.
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.560]  And Trump is basically just puffing up his chest and he's like a bull in a china shop
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.320]  at this point.
[14:32.320 --> 14:35.640]  And so maybe it's not the best way to go about it.
[14:35.640 --> 14:40.080]  But here's what I think the long term plan is.
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.440]  If they can't separate Trump from his voters and his base and they can't get a DeSantis
[14:46.440 --> 14:52.320]  or a Junkin or someone else to step up and run against Trump, the Democrats will go for
[14:52.320 --> 15:02.280]  an indictment and an arrest probably in this within the next year.
[15:02.280 --> 15:03.720]  But the awakening is on.
[15:03.720 --> 15:04.720]  Everybody's watching what they're doing.
[15:04.720 --> 15:11.200]  Oh, let's just count votes until the Democrat wins in Arizona where Katie Hobbs didn't campaign,
[15:11.200 --> 15:12.200]  had no energy.
[15:12.200 --> 15:18.680]  The few rallies she did have had less than 100 people, Lake had massive rallies.
[15:18.680 --> 15:20.000]  So people are just watching now.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.200]  They're watching, they're finally paying attention, they've kind of looked away from the football
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.800]  game and looked away from the bread and circus and looked away from the Kim Kardashian butt.
[15:28.800 --> 15:31.800]  And they're watching how their country's being stolen.
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.740]  And they're watching how Democrats are above the law.
[15:35.740 --> 15:38.520]  And more people are now putting skin in the game.
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.200]  So despite all the bad political news, I do think there's a silver lining to all of this.
[15:43.200 --> 15:45.160]  And it always had to get to this point, didn't it?
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.680]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[15:53.680 --> 15:54.680]  Here's why.
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.640]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[15:58.640 --> 16:03.680]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.880]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[16:08.880 --> 16:12.800]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.720]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.480]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.760]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.760]  too.
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.400]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[17:05.360 --> 17:08.160]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:08.160 --> 17:09.160]  The best part?

[17:14.440 --> 17:18.680]  coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.

[19:41.480 --> 19:49.480]  Take action now.
[19:49.480 --> 19:58.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:58.920 --> 20:15.680]  I'm going to get into all of the headlines now involving the 2022 midterm elections that
[20:15.680 --> 20:17.600]  are ongoing.
[20:17.600 --> 20:21.080]  You thought elections worked like this.
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.080]  You show up.
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.080]  You vote.
[20:23.080 --> 20:24.480]  Your vote is counted just like everyone else.
[20:24.480 --> 20:27.800]  Wrongo, wrongo.
[20:27.800 --> 20:28.800]  You show up.
[20:28.800 --> 20:29.800]  You vote.
[20:29.800 --> 20:30.800]  Maybe your vote counts.
[20:30.800 --> 20:31.800]  Maybe not.
[20:31.800 --> 20:34.480]  Maybe it's canceled out by some moronic brainwashed sheep.
[20:34.480 --> 20:36.320]  Maybe it's canceled out by a machine algorithm.
[20:36.320 --> 20:39.960]  Maybe it's canceled out by a mail-in vote from a dog.
[20:39.960 --> 20:45.200]  And we just keep counting votes till the Democrats ahead, and then we declare the winner.
[20:45.200 --> 20:48.560]  That's how the elections go in the United States of America.
[20:48.560 --> 20:54.480]  Anywhere else the UN would move in and take over and say this is clearly a fraudulent election.
[20:54.480 --> 20:55.480]  But not here.
[20:55.480 --> 20:57.040]  It's just par for the course.
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.840]  And the American liberal, the American leftist doesn't even bat an eye.
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.400]  Doesn't even bat an eye.
[21:03.400 --> 21:09.520]  But they'll fall for Russian collusion and Russian interference and meddling.
[21:09.520 --> 21:12.160]  Yes, they will, won't they?
[21:12.160 --> 21:15.120]  Well, they already have.
[21:15.120 --> 21:17.320]  Here's the news.
[21:17.320 --> 21:20.360]  As the story is ongoing, Democrats will take the Senate.
[21:20.360 --> 21:23.320]  They're fighting for the House right now.
[21:23.320 --> 21:29.120]  But are they really going to get away with such a big steal in Colorado and Maryland?
[21:29.120 --> 21:35.520]  GOP didn't lose the midterms because mail-in ballots are better than in-person voting.
[21:35.520 --> 21:40.360]  The GOP lost because the same corrupt election activities happened again.
[21:40.360 --> 21:41.360]  That's Joe Hoff.
[21:41.360 --> 21:42.360]  He's going to be joining us.
[21:42.360 --> 21:44.880]  He's got a lot of great stories right now that he's going to be joining us on.
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.240]  But here's what it comes down to.
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.440]  And I think here's the debate that the Republican Party should be having moving forward because
[21:51.440 --> 21:57.600]  they're never going to win another election nationally, probably, with the current structure
[21:57.600 --> 21:58.600]  in place.
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.440]  And they're certainly never going to win Pennsylvania.
[22:00.440 --> 22:01.520]  They're never going to win Michigan.
[22:01.520 --> 22:03.080]  They're never going to win Georgia.
[22:03.080 --> 22:06.360]  And now it appears they'll never win Arizona or Nevada either with the current system
[22:06.360 --> 22:08.800]  in place.
[22:08.800 --> 22:13.200]  And so they can sit here and we can talk about voter fraud and election fraud and all this
[22:13.200 --> 22:14.200]  stuff.
[22:14.200 --> 22:15.200]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[22:15.200 --> 22:16.200]  That's clear.
[22:16.200 --> 22:17.200]  That's clear.
[22:17.200 --> 22:18.200]  The message has been sent.
[22:18.200 --> 22:19.200]  They will steal the election.
[22:19.200 --> 22:20.200]  They will rig elections.
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.920]  They will do whatever shenanigans they can.
[22:21.920 --> 22:22.920]  And that's it.
[22:22.920 --> 22:23.920]  That's how it's going to go.
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.520]  So the debate for the Republican Party now needs to be, are we going to stop this and
[22:28.520 --> 22:38.520]  are we going to have a serious push for in-person day of voting paper ballots, which is the
[22:38.520 --> 22:44.400]  only way to stop this from continuing this madness, this month-long election season madness,
[22:44.400 --> 22:48.360]  where we keep counting votes until we like the outcome?
[22:48.360 --> 22:55.560]  Or does the Republican Party say, okay, that's an unwinnable fight.
[22:55.560 --> 22:56.560]  Let's not even try it.
[22:56.560 --> 22:58.840]  Instead, let's just play by the new rules.
[22:58.840 --> 23:04.040]  And Republicans just send out millions of mail-in ballots to everybody and their dogs.
[23:04.040 --> 23:09.560]  And what the Republicans should have done this midterm election season, but they don't
[23:09.560 --> 23:10.760]  listen here at Infowars.
[23:10.760 --> 23:14.040]  They don't listen to the voices out there that give them good advice.
[23:14.040 --> 23:18.440]  They keep going back to the same establishment hacks that suck their toes.
[23:18.440 --> 23:23.240]  No, what the Republicans should have been doing is exactly what the Democrats were doing.
[23:23.240 --> 23:30.320]  This is why they brag about the youth turnout for Democrats because they had all of their
[23:30.320 --> 23:37.240]  candidates campaign on college campuses, specifically targeting that vote.
[23:37.240 --> 23:42.120]  And then they had voting registration booths set up, and they had early voting stations
[23:42.120 --> 23:45.160]  set up right there at the event.
[23:45.160 --> 23:47.600]  That's what you do now.
[23:47.600 --> 23:55.760]  So if you want to give up the hope of fair elections, one person, one vote in-day voting,
[23:55.760 --> 24:04.840]  which sadly might have to be the case, then you have got to take the same measurements
[24:04.840 --> 24:13.960]  and actions that the Democrats are to drum up as many votes they possibly can from people
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.720]  who normally wouldn't vote and before Election Day.
[24:17.720 --> 24:24.480]  And by the way, if you play this game, you win because the biggest rallies for Democrats
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.240]  were happening on college campuses with the youth.
[24:29.240 --> 24:30.640]  They did pretty well at those events.
[24:30.640 --> 24:33.480]  They would usually get a couple hundred people.
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.600]  And again, like I said, then they register you to vote and you go vote early right across
[24:37.600 --> 24:39.360]  the street.
[24:39.360 --> 24:47.000]  Now Republicans have rally sizes 20, 30, 40 times bigger than Democrats.
[24:47.000 --> 24:53.720]  So imagine a Trump rally with Scott Prezler outside registering people to vote and across
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.760]  the street an early voting center at a Trump rally.
[24:57.760 --> 25:04.040]  You just got 30,000 Republican votes, just like that.
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.120]  And the Democrats are doing this across the country with their midterm candidates, but
[25:08.120 --> 25:15.800]  in particularly the college students that are voting for the first time.
[25:15.800 --> 25:25.240]  And they probably were able to siphon about 1,000, 1,500, maybe even 2,000 votes with
[25:25.240 --> 25:31.640]  this phenomenon at college campuses that they went to like University of Texas Austin.
[25:31.640 --> 25:35.840]  So that's the debate the Republican Party, if it wants to find a way to win, should be
[25:35.840 --> 25:37.480]  having right now.
[25:37.480 --> 25:48.000]  Do we push hard to actually return our elections to being fair with in-person voting, day of
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.120]  voting, paper ballots, or do we just say, no point in trying to save that system, let's
[25:54.120 --> 26:01.060]  just cheat like the Democrats and be better at it than they are?
[26:01.060 --> 26:02.060]  This is a big story.
[26:02.060 --> 26:05.120]  I might just come back and read this whole thing.
[26:05.120 --> 26:09.360]  Anonymous Wisconsin heroes demonstrated how to collapse the Democrat ballot gathering
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.360]  apparatus.
[26:10.360 --> 26:12.400]  So again, there is a way to push back against this.
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.400]  This one is key.
[26:13.400 --> 26:16.400]  I may just come back to that and read the whole thing honestly.
[26:16.400 --> 26:17.400]  It's that good.
[26:17.400 --> 26:23.000]  Despite only 17% Democrat turnout on election day, Katie Hobbs and Democrats are winning
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.480]  over 50% of Maricopa County election day totals.
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.880]  And you know, I feel bad for the people on the Hopium out there.
[26:30.880 --> 26:32.280]  And that's okay.
[26:32.280 --> 26:34.040]  That's okay.
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.800]  Info wars is always crossing the threshold first.
[26:37.800 --> 26:41.400]  Info wars is always crossing the barbed wire first.
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.520]  Alex Jones has always been the canary in the coal mine.
[26:44.520 --> 26:53.080]  So I don't have a kind of, you know, I'm not laughing at them, but at the same time, it
[26:53.080 --> 26:54.760]  is kind of sad to see all the Hopium.
[26:54.760 --> 26:57.000]  Oh, oh, Kerry Lake has the vote.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.800]  She has the numbers for sure.
[26:58.800 --> 27:00.320]  She has the numbers.
[27:00.320 --> 27:02.160]  Do you really not get it yet?
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.080]  I mean, you don't know what the Democrats are doing.
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.040]  You don't think that they're going to give you the exact number of percent that you think
[27:09.040 --> 27:13.480]  Kerry Lake needs, and then it's just going to be a little bit short of the end.
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.440]  You haven't figured it out yet.
[27:16.440 --> 27:17.760]  Okay, fine.
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.840]  Well, you enjoy learning it for yourself the hard way.
[27:22.840 --> 27:24.200]  But that's good.
[27:24.200 --> 27:25.200]  That's good.
[27:25.200 --> 27:26.320]  This is the awakening process.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.240]  This is people realizing they've been lied to.
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.600]  This is people realizing their elections are rigged.
[27:30.600 --> 27:32.040]  We realized it decades ago.
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.680]  You realized it decades ago.
[27:33.680 --> 27:34.680]  This is good.
[27:34.680 --> 27:35.680]  This is good.
[27:35.680 --> 27:37.120]  And this is what all the people would lambast.
[27:37.120 --> 27:45.800]  Alex Jones and Info Wars for talking about, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you get it now, do you?
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.600]  Maricopa dropped shocking Sunday numbers claim only 50 percent for Kerry Lake from Election
[27:50.600 --> 27:52.320]  Day and independence went to Hobbs.
[27:52.320 --> 27:53.320]  The steal is on.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.320]  Yeah, nobody's buying this.
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.760]  But see, oh, what I, oh, oh, 54 percent.
[27:56.760 --> 28:00.240]  Oh, you thought you'd get 65?
[28:00.240 --> 28:03.960]  You thought you'd get actual representation?
[28:03.960 --> 28:12.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.600]  Yeah, you did.
[28:13.600 --> 28:15.840]  What happens when a criminal doesn't get arrested for his crime?
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.280]  Well, he commits the crime again.
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.280]  Video montage.
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.600]  Arizona Republican voters describe how ballots were not counted.
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.640]  Ballots were tossed in a box and people were not allowed to vote.
[28:28.640 --> 28:33.040]  Maricopa County Election Judge believes the machines were programmed to reject ballots
[28:33.040 --> 28:38.640]  on Election Day.
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.080]  The Democrats are stopping voter fraud, guys.
[28:41.080 --> 28:43.640]  The Democrats are protecting our elections, guys.
[28:43.640 --> 28:44.640]  Come on.
[28:44.640 --> 28:45.640]  That's Stacey Abrams told me.
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.080]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of awkward
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.760]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[28:53.760 --> 28:54.760]  Here's why.
[28:54.760 --> 28:58.600]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[28:58.600 --> 29:03.800]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.960]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.880]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[29:12.880 --> 29:16.800]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.560]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[29:21.560 --> 29:26.800]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[29:26.800 --> 29:27.800]  too.
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.440]  That's MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[29:46.120 --> 29:52.280]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[29:52.280 --> 29:58.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.600]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[30:01.600 --> 30:05.120]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations as exposed.
[30:05.120 --> 30:06.120]  It's came over.
[30:06.120 --> 30:11.120]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[30:11.120 --> 30:15.800]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[30:15.800 --> 30:21.720]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video, or infowars.com, or newswars.com,

[30:41.080 --> 30:50.360]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[30:50.360 --> 30:54.720]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[30:54.720 --> 31:00.880]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[31:00.880 --> 31:06.400]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America but worldwide.
[31:06.400 --> 31:12.760]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars because we know the globalist
[31:12.760 --> 31:17.440]  number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them
[31:17.440 --> 31:18.440]  down peacefully.

[32:48.960 --> 33:05.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:05.640 --> 33:17.720]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:17.720 --> 33:27.120]  There was a shooting at the University of Virginia last night, three killed, and the
[33:27.120 --> 33:29.520]  suspect has now been arrested.
[33:29.520 --> 33:33.880]  It looks like it may have been a targeted shooting of football players because all three
[33:33.880 --> 33:37.720]  of them were football players getting off a bus.
[33:37.720 --> 33:44.240]  But I remember seeing this on social media last night, but nothing on the news.
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.680]  And there's pretty much been a news blackout on this today, we'll see if anybody covers
[33:48.680 --> 33:49.680]  it tonight.
[33:49.680 --> 33:52.800]  Oh, well, mass shooting, college, university, three dead, you'd think they'd be all over
[33:52.800 --> 33:54.000]  the story.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.240]  Well, folks, they won't be.
[33:58.240 --> 34:01.880]  And if you know why, you know why.
[34:01.880 --> 34:03.840]  This really fit the narrative, this one.
[34:03.840 --> 34:05.160]  So they'll move on from that.
[34:05.160 --> 34:06.560]  I mean, do I need to check?
[34:06.560 --> 34:11.320]  I mean, guys, should I go ahead and plug it into a Google search, violent Chicago over
[34:11.320 --> 34:13.400]  the weekend, go ahead and put it up.
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.360]  But hold on, no, because I have to cover this so often.
[34:16.360 --> 34:18.680]  This is how sick I am.
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.760]  Let's give you the Vegas odds over under numbers probably down.
[34:24.760 --> 34:31.640]  It's getting a little colder over under 65 shot and 2.5 dead in Chicago this weekend over
[34:31.640 --> 34:32.640]  under.
[34:32.640 --> 34:34.680]  All right, guys, give me the numbers.
[34:34.680 --> 34:39.160]  Let's go ahead and pull them up now because, you know, we want to stop gun crime and we
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.040]  highlight the gun crimes and we blame the Republicans and the NRA and we say we should
[34:43.040 --> 34:44.040]  take the guns.
[34:44.040 --> 34:49.280]  But we never mentioned what goes on in Chicago every weekend because it doesn't fit the
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.280]  narrative.
[34:50.280 --> 34:54.560]  Oh, five, that hits the over easy, doesn't it?
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.200]  Five this weekend, including 12 year old girl among 20 wounded.
[34:59.200 --> 35:04.800]  So under on the shot over on the killed, sad, sad thing.
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.120]  Every weekend in Chicago, I'm a sick person for making a joke of it.
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.720]  But it's every weekend in Chicago, folks.
[35:11.720 --> 35:16.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be here with you today and I have to tell
[35:16.640 --> 35:22.400]  you I've got a little bottle of Brain Force Ultra right here and you may notice that it's
[35:22.400 --> 35:23.400]  almost empty.
[35:23.400 --> 35:25.400]  I did a big chug.
[35:25.400 --> 35:29.360]  I did a big chug about 10 minutes before going on air, probably did too much.
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.200]  You're not supposed to drink that much, but it's okay.
[35:31.200 --> 35:32.600]  I'm an expert.
[35:32.600 --> 35:33.840]  So do not try this at home.
[35:33.840 --> 35:39.640]  I'm just the Brain Force Ultra expert and with a big, big juicy brain, it needs a little
[35:39.640 --> 35:40.640]  bit of extra.
[35:40.640 --> 35:43.480]  I'm being facetious, of course, but I love the product.
[35:43.480 --> 35:44.640]  I think you will too.
[35:44.640 --> 35:45.640]  Give it a try.

[35:48.240 --> 35:54.240]  I love to take it before I go on air for mental focus, mental clarity, mental energy.
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.320]  And if you're out there listening, you got a big work project, a big presentation, perfect
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.280]  to take to get prepared for that or before the presentation.
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.240]  If you're in school, you got a big exam, a big final, a big project, forget about those
[36:07.240 --> 36:10.840]  pharmaceutical drugs that are so bad for you, your doctor wants to prescribe and make money
[36:10.840 --> 36:11.840]  off you.
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.800]  Go to infowarestore.com, try the Brain Force Ultra for yourself.
[36:15.800 --> 36:22.840]  It's 50% off or the Brain Force Plus, that's the capsule version, 60% off, both exclusively
[36:22.840 --> 36:28.720]  available at infowarestore.com, telling you once you've tried it, you'll never go back.

[36:32.920 --> 36:36.160]  Plus and Brain Force Ultra at infowarestore.com.
[36:36.160 --> 36:42.560]  All right, let's get back into the election headlines here.
[36:42.560 --> 36:50.800]  Maricopa election officials launched a pack in 2021 to stop MAGA candidates.
[36:50.800 --> 36:57.520]  And that's the Republican establishment that was also working with the Democrat Party in
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.240]  the midterm elections to make Trump backed candidates look bad.
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.920]  And that attack is ongoing today with Trump backed candidates that actually did well in
[37:08.920 --> 37:16.760]  the midterms, now having their house races, the vote still being tallied conveniently
[37:16.760 --> 37:19.960]  right up until the Democrat takes the lead.
[37:19.960 --> 37:22.840]  And so now you hear them saying, oh, the Democrats might take the house.
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.960]  Well, sure, they're counting votes for, wait, we're now a week later.
[37:27.960 --> 37:30.960]  They just keep finding Democrat votes, it's amazing.
[37:30.960 --> 37:36.360]  It's like, oh yeah, look, the Republican won in Maryland, not so fast, Democrats are
[37:36.360 --> 37:37.360]  finding votes.
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.840]  Oh yeah, look, the Republicans won in California, not so fast, Democrats are finding votes.
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.840]  Oh yeah, Lauren Boebert held her seat, not so fast, Democrats are finding votes.
[37:44.840 --> 37:47.720]  Come on, guys.
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.000]  It's Monday, November 14th, the week after the election, and we got to keep counting
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  those votes.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.080]  I'm surprised Democrats aren't running ads saying, still, it's not too late to vote.
[37:58.080 --> 37:59.080]  Go vote.
[37:59.080 --> 38:00.480]  You're a local Democrat in the midterm.
[38:00.480 --> 38:02.960]  We will make sure it counts.
[38:02.960 --> 38:10.240]  Here's an amazing story from Joe Hoft, he's joining us later at the Gateway Pundit posted
[38:10.240 --> 38:16.160]  by Jay Valentin, anonymous Wisconsin heroes demonstrated how to collapse the Democrat
[38:16.160 --> 38:19.800]  ballot gathering apparatus.
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.400]  Ballots and votes, these two words seem synonymous, yet infer opposite ways to choose a government.
[38:25.400 --> 38:28.280]  There's a big difference between votes and ballots.
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.440]  The Republicans focused on winning votes, the Democrats focused on gathering ballots,
[38:32.440 --> 38:33.600]  the ballots won.
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.640]  When election day became election month, mail-in ballots replacing in-person voters, the electoral
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.480]  world changed forever, and it's not changing back.
[38:42.480 --> 38:46.920]  Democrats, experts, and anything government related drove states to change laws, increase
[38:46.920 --> 38:53.400]  voting delays, and loosen voter standards Republican leadership dozed.
[38:53.400 --> 38:58.240]  Democrats, non-governmental organizations, leftist big tech invented every conceivable
[38:58.240 --> 39:00.320]  way to manipulate the ballot process.
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.560]  Collect ballots, drop into street side bins, fill them out if the voter doesn't.
[39:04.560 --> 39:07.600]  This is a ballot gathering strategy, and it worked.
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.840]  Republicans remain stuck in the same voter strategy for the last decade.
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.840]  Blood signs, fundraising, obscure websites, TV ads, the raw material of the ballot gathering
[39:15.840 --> 39:19.000]  strategy is the phantom voter or address.
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.120]  Every ballot needs to tie to someone, even if only a name on a list.
[39:24.120 --> 39:30.720]  Live voteable ballots accumulate at addresses where the indicated voter does not reside.
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.040]  Those ballots gathered are the inventory of electoral victory.
[39:35.040 --> 39:38.240]  He who gathers them can vote them.
[39:38.240 --> 39:43.400]  The ballot gathering system was frictionless until 2020, thousands of phantom addresses
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.200]  inhabited every state's voter list.
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.360]  Clever leftist built a national system, Eric, now used by about 30 states to make sure voter
[39:52.360 --> 39:55.080]  rolls protected phantoms.
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.840]  Using in-your-face messaging, Eric claimed it was a resource to keep voter rolls clean.
[39:59.840 --> 40:03.440]  No friction, no challenge, after 2020 everything changed.
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.200]  The once frictionless ballot gathering apparatus was challenged in every state as voter integrity
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.720]  teams, citizens at kitchen tables, picked apart voter rolls.
[40:12.720 --> 40:17.080]  They quickly found tens of thousands of dead or moved voters.
[40:17.080 --> 40:21.080]  There were innumerable addresses where no voter could possibly live.
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.960]  For the first time, there was pushback against ballot gathering.
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.400]  Citizens demanded voter rolls be cleaned and addresses be real.
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.760]  In too many cases, affidavits with photographs of an empty lot where several voters claimed
[40:32.760 --> 40:36.480]  to live failed to convince a judge to action.
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.400]  Not in Wisconsin, a Wisconsin voter integrity team found after reviewing scores of counties
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.480]  and localities, the number of ballots and votes cast lined up.
[40:47.480 --> 40:51.720]  Democrats know how many votes they need and cast them during the forever campaign time
[40:51.720 --> 40:53.640]  in the name of phantoms.
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.880]  Their ballot inventory comes from real ballots sent to fake addresses then collected by someone
[40:58.880 --> 41:02.160]  never a Republican and voted.
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.240]  In evaluating any system, one asks, is there an inherent contradiction?
[41:06.240 --> 41:14.400]  Is there something in the system that when pushed to scale and will make it that the
[41:14.400 --> 41:16.800]  rest of my story disappears?
[41:16.800 --> 41:18.000]  How about that?
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  Wow.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.320]  I don't know what happened to the rest of the story, but it's not attached here.
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.320]  But that's okay.
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.640]  You get the point as we're up against a break anyway.
[41:26.640 --> 41:32.560]  So they cleaned up the voter rolls in Florida and what do you see, massive red wave.
[41:32.560 --> 41:35.160]  They made an effort to clean up the vote rolls in Wisconsin.
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.680]  Democrats couldn't steal the Senate seat.
[41:38.680 --> 41:41.600]  So we know that this is what goes on.
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.160]  It got caught in 2020.
[41:45.160 --> 41:52.240]  It got caught by Project Veritas and other journalists where dozens of ballots would
[41:52.240 --> 41:58.400]  go to a parking lot where nobody resides.
[41:58.400 --> 42:03.560]  And this would happen hundreds of times over.
[42:03.560 --> 42:10.640]  And then you can trace those ballots and those ballots end up being cast as mail-in
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.760]  ballots at one of the mail-in ballot drop boxes.
[42:14.760 --> 42:21.080]  I mean, if you can't see how mail-in ballots and mail-in ballot drop boxes are being used
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.400]  for fraud and cheating, you're just not being honest, are you?
[42:26.400 --> 42:29.000]  You're just not being honest whatsoever.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.640]  But here's the amazing thing about the liberal left that I do give them credit for.
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.240]  They are somehow spiritually, cosmically connected because they all lie together in
[42:38.240 --> 42:41.440]  unison and they don't even have to communicate while they do it.
[42:41.440 --> 42:44.520]  They all know they're cheating in these elections, but they don't have to talk about it.
[42:44.520 --> 42:47.840]  They just all know it.
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.920]  I'm pointing my finger at you, and I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[42:52.920 --> 42:54.920]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[42:54.920 --> 42:56.960]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[42:56.960 --> 42:58.720]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[42:58.720 --> 43:01.080]  You forget to take BNA Force Plus.
[43:01.080 --> 43:04.720]  You forget to take DX3, and you know it makes your life better, and you know it makes you

[43:43.640 --> 43:47.880]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[43:47.880 --> 43:49.120]  Why is this taking so long?
[43:49.120 --> 43:52.600]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots, and they're done in a day.
[43:52.600 --> 43:53.920]  Why can't we do this here?
[43:53.920 --> 43:56.400]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[43:56.400 --> 44:00.360]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald
[44:00.360 --> 44:02.520]  Trump or Governor De Sanctimonius.
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.320]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.200]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[44:06.200 --> 44:08.120]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[44:08.120 --> 44:14.000]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.680]  is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.720]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[44:22.720 --> 44:26.440]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[44:26.440 --> 44:28.280]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.920]  That's why infowarstore.com is so damn important.

[45:52.880 --> 45:57.800]  to persevere against the tax never before seen in the western world against independent
[45:57.800 --> 45:58.800]  media.
[45:58.800 --> 45:59.800]  That's what keeps me in the fight.
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.520]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times
[46:04.520 --> 46:07.920]  and kept info wars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.280]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them, and
[46:12.280 --> 46:13.280]  I need your support.
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.080]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me to the spot

[46:30.000 --> 46:34.640]  This whole phase of their attacks, foyers in the making, is almost over.
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.880]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[46:38.880 --> 46:42.520]  So please, if you support what we're doing, and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[46:42.520 --> 46:49.920]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[46:49.920 --> 47:04.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.040 --> 47:12.560]  So as I'm continuing to cover all the election news, and we'll continue to focus on Arizona
[47:12.560 --> 47:18.920]  with Matt Baker coming up, and then the overall election with Joe Hoft as well, Biden is embarrassing
[47:18.920 --> 47:28.100]  himself in the country, meeting with Xi Jinping and fumbling around and muttering and stumbling
[47:28.100 --> 47:34.800]  through press conferences is just a total embarrassment.
[47:34.800 --> 47:36.240]  So just know that's going on.
[47:36.240 --> 47:40.400]  We might have some time to get to some of those clips, but let's continue to focus here
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.120]  on the election news.
[47:43.120 --> 47:47.400]  Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs to launch leadership challenge against Kevin
[47:47.400 --> 47:49.760]  McCarthy.
[47:49.760 --> 47:55.200]  Now here's what I see going on right now with, there's not going to be much, there's
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.240]  pretty much going to be almost no support for Mitch McConnell to stay leadership in
[48:01.240 --> 48:04.480]  a leadership role with the Republican Party in the Senate.
[48:04.480 --> 48:07.000]  Mitch McConnell pretty much has no backing.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.520]  Kevin McCarthy does, Kevin McCarthy sidled himself up next to Donald Trump, pretended
[48:11.520 --> 48:18.800]  to be an ally, and then basically just went mute and went limp when we needed him the
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.320]  most.
[48:20.320 --> 48:26.200]  That's what Kevin McCarthy is, he's impotent.
[48:26.200 --> 48:34.400]  And so maybe he's friendly with Trump, and maybe he's at least not going to bash Trump,
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.200]  but he's certainly no leader.
[48:38.200 --> 48:43.000]  I do think there will be a struggle for the ouster of McCarthy, and it's going to be Gates
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.880]  and Biggs apparently leading that charge.
[48:45.880 --> 48:50.920]  And it needs to be done, whether Kevin McCarthy is a snake in the grass, trying to get himself
[48:50.920 --> 48:57.640]  close to Trump, or whether he is just, he likes Trump, but he's just a weak Republican
[48:57.640 --> 48:58.640]  squish.
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.840]  Either way, he's got to go from a leadership role, but I think there'll be a struggle there.
[49:02.840 --> 49:06.040]  With McConnell, I don't think McConnell will have any backing, McConnell's pretty much
[49:06.040 --> 49:08.240]  done his final deed.
[49:08.240 --> 49:16.440]  McConnell's last deed as the Senate Minority Leader was to sabotage MAGA and sabotage Donald
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.600]  Trump and sabotage the Republicans in the midterm to blame Donald Trump.
[49:21.600 --> 49:24.480]  So congratulations Mitch McConnell.
[49:24.480 --> 49:32.240]  That will be your ultimate legacy, a turncoat, a traitor, a feckless coward that stabbed
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.080]  America in the back.
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.560]  Congratulations Mitch McConnell, that is now your legacy.
[49:37.560 --> 49:45.400]  And we will make sure that that gets stamped on your political forehead because we will
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.400]  not forget not as much what you did, but also what you didn't do.
[49:50.400 --> 49:51.960]  But we know what you did with the money.
[49:51.960 --> 49:53.960]  We know how you sabotage Trump candidates.
[49:53.960 --> 49:59.360]  We know how you sabotage good candidates like Masters and Joe Kent and others.
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.680]  And so Mitch McConnell's final legacy is the MAGA populist Republican midterm election
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.000]  saboteur, saboteur.
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.360]  Now, I'd like to see Rand Paul replace him, but there might be some other good candidates
[50:15.360 --> 50:16.360]  there.
[50:16.360 --> 50:18.240]  We'll see.
[50:18.240 --> 50:19.680]  And I suggested this the other day.
[50:19.680 --> 50:22.840]  I also heard others suggested it looks like it may come true.
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.600]  Lee Zeldin is taking calls about replacing hapless Ronna McDaniel after she blew two
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.880]  landslide elections.
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.560]  Yes, Ronna McDaniel ended up being a real zero.
[50:32.560 --> 50:39.280]  I actually had high hopes for her in 2016 when she was kind of gaining popularity and
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.000]  working with women for Trump and stuff, but she pretty much squished out and was entirely
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.560]  worthless in the midterms, if not a net negative in the midterms.
[50:50.560 --> 50:56.240]  And so Lee Zeldin, who's popular and had huge victories in New York, impossible to defeat
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.520]  the Democrats in New York.
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.520]  Just impossible.
[50:58.520 --> 50:59.960]  90% of the vote in New York City.
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.640]  So it's just game over before it even begins, but he did very well.
[51:04.640 --> 51:10.880]  And he, I think, would be a good candidate to take over the RNC from Ronna McDaniel.
[51:10.880 --> 51:13.360]  It's time to get rid of the McLuzers.
[51:13.360 --> 51:18.600]  Josh Halley's on board, Senator Josh Halley, time to bury the Republican Party, build something
[51:18.600 --> 51:19.600]  new.
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.280]  Now, I don't know if Rand Paul has any interest in being a Senate leader, but Josh Halley does.
[51:25.280 --> 51:28.320]  And I think he'd be a fantastic one.
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.520]  And he's right.
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.400]  It is time to bury the old Republican Party and build something new.
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.640]  He gets it.
[51:36.640 --> 51:38.000]  He gets it.
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.280]  And so that's why, you know, I haven't really gotten in, I've covered the third party phenomenon
[51:44.280 --> 51:50.600]  every once in a while, but the self-righteousness of libertarians over the last week has been
[51:50.600 --> 51:55.080]  extremely distasteful, specifically from the libertarian leadership.
[51:55.080 --> 51:59.800]  I don't mean to make a blanket statement because some libertarians got the big picture like
[51:59.800 --> 52:05.800]  in Arizona, where the libertarian a week or two before the election bowed out and endorsed
[52:05.800 --> 52:07.120]  Blake Masters.
[52:07.120 --> 52:14.040]  That would be the classy thing to do if you were the libertarians at this point.
[52:14.040 --> 52:15.040]  Run your campaign.
[52:15.040 --> 52:16.040]  That's good.
[52:16.040 --> 52:17.040]  I respect that.
[52:17.040 --> 52:18.560]  I understand why the third party exists.
[52:18.560 --> 52:22.480]  I understand why people don't want to trust Republicans and Democrats.
[52:22.480 --> 52:23.800]  And so they go third party.
[52:23.800 --> 52:26.360]  They get it totally legitimate.
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.240]  But then for the libertarian to puff their chest out and say, ah-ha-ha-ha, Republicans,
[52:30.240 --> 52:31.480]  you couldn't beat Democrats.
[52:31.480 --> 52:35.600]  Ha-ha, Republicans, you couldn't put any good candidates up coming from the party that's
[52:35.600 --> 52:37.120]  never won a single election.
[52:37.120 --> 52:39.600]  Give me a break.
[52:39.600 --> 52:46.920]  Puffing your chest out because really I think the libertarian leadership knows that in states
[52:46.920 --> 52:50.240]  like Georgia and Pennsylvania where the libertarian vote could have put the Republican over the
[52:50.240 --> 52:55.080]  edge and instead a Democrat gun grabber tax raiser got in, I think they genuinely feel
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.080]  bad about it.
[52:56.080 --> 53:00.280]  And so their copium is to sit here and point at Republicans and lash out.
[53:00.280 --> 53:04.800]  But no, the libertarian party should have dropped out of their races, endorsed the Republican
[53:04.800 --> 53:08.560]  candidates even saying, hey, we don't really like the Republicans.
[53:08.560 --> 53:09.560]  They've done X, Y, and Z.
[53:09.560 --> 53:10.560]  But you know what?
[53:10.560 --> 53:13.840]  They align closer to our values with Democrats and we don't want to elect Democrat gun grabbers
[53:13.840 --> 53:14.840]  and tax raisers.
[53:14.840 --> 53:18.240]  No, instead they said, ha-ha, Republicans, you couldn't even beat Democrats.
[53:18.240 --> 53:22.640]  You couldn't put up bad candidates.
[53:22.640 --> 53:29.600]  But see, this is the way the populist movement hostile takeover politically of the Republican
[53:29.600 --> 53:30.600]  party.
[53:30.600 --> 53:31.600]  That's what needs to happen.
[53:31.600 --> 53:33.280]  We've already got a beach head in.
[53:33.280 --> 53:34.880]  We've already got a reformation in.
[53:34.880 --> 53:36.920]  We've already got the people behind us.
[53:36.920 --> 53:42.720]  This is the way I believe.
[53:42.720 --> 53:49.680]  Then the left wing media now is coming after Biden, so long, Biden was the biggest negative
[53:49.680 --> 53:53.000]  for Democrats in midterms would be a disaster in 2024.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  You know, this is hilarious.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.120]  This is more liberal Democrat double speak that they just get away with and don't even
[53:58.120 --> 53:59.120]  think twice about it.
[53:59.120 --> 54:04.400]  Oh, Biden's so great, Biden saved the economy, Biden great, Biden this, Biden that.
[54:04.400 --> 54:06.160]  They tell you how great everything is.
[54:06.160 --> 54:09.800]  And then in the next conversation, they tell you what a disaster he is and he shouldn't
[54:09.800 --> 54:11.440]  run in 2024.
[54:11.440 --> 54:14.080]  Which is it liberals?
[54:14.080 --> 54:19.160]  Which is it Democrats, 84 million votes, most popular of all time, saving the economy, saving
[54:19.160 --> 54:22.760]  the country, returning us to normal?
[54:22.760 --> 54:23.960]  Which is it?
[54:23.960 --> 54:31.080]  Which is true about Joe Biden, 84 million votes, saving the country or a complete disaster
[54:31.080 --> 54:32.640]  and shouldn't run again.
[54:32.640 --> 54:33.800]  Which is it Democrats?
[54:33.800 --> 54:34.800]  Well, it's both.
[54:34.800 --> 54:37.880]  They don't need logical consistency.
[54:37.880 --> 54:42.720]  They're Democrats, they're liberals, they're mentally deranged, they have mental disorders.
[54:42.720 --> 54:45.640]  Now they're even doing specials with Michelle Obama.
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.280]  They're dusting off that old thing.
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.080]  And they're doing specials where she talks about how she's going through depression and
[54:53.080 --> 54:54.800]  how she has all these mental disorders.
[54:54.800 --> 55:01.160]  Oh, you don't say liberalism is literally a mental disorder.
[55:01.160 --> 55:03.800]  They've had studies out for years.
[55:03.800 --> 55:07.640]  Half of liberals have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[55:07.640 --> 55:10.720]  Diagnosed, diagnosed.
[55:10.720 --> 55:14.880]  Another half probably haven't just haven't been diagnosed.
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.200]  So yeah, liberals don't need logical consistency.
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.920]  Liberals can have double think, double speak all day long, Biden, 84 million votes, saving
[55:21.920 --> 55:22.920]  the country.
[55:22.920 --> 55:25.720]  Biden, complete disaster during the midterms needs to go.
[55:25.720 --> 55:27.000]  Which one is it liberals?
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.400]  Doesn't matter.
[55:28.400 --> 55:29.800]  They lie for a living.
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.520]  You think a little double standard, you think a little double think, a little double talk,
[55:34.520 --> 55:37.800]  you're going to bother them, heck no.
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.240]  But see, here's where it gets interesting, the entire establishment is coming after
[55:42.240 --> 55:43.240]  Trump again.
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.920]  And I'll just say this, in the dream world, because here's the problem though, you can't
[55:48.920 --> 55:50.320]  assume anything in the future.
[55:50.320 --> 56:01.840]  But in the dream world, I think the best way to go about this, taking things at as much
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.160]  of face value as you can, which is almost zero.
[56:06.160 --> 56:14.920]  But for the sake of this argument, I think the ideal situation is Trump 2024 should win
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.560]  and then DeSantis 2028.
[56:18.560 --> 56:26.680]  And now you're looking at at least eight or 12 years of Republican Party rule that will
[56:26.680 --> 56:34.160]  boom the economy, take care of the southern border and just get us back on the right track.
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.280]  And so that's why the entire establishment is coming after Trump right now.
[56:37.280 --> 56:40.960]  Nancy Pelosi says a Trump 2024 bid would be bad news for the country.
[56:40.960 --> 56:44.560]  Oh, my support of Trump just goes up a little bit.
[56:44.560 --> 56:47.840]  Trump wanted IRS investigation of his foes.
[56:47.840 --> 56:54.320]  Top aide says, whoa, Trump support goes up even more.
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.280]  Yeah, you're damn right that these politicians in this country need to be investigated by
[56:58.280 --> 56:59.280]  the IRS.
[56:59.280 --> 57:00.280]  They're going after Trump.
[57:00.280 --> 57:01.280]  Why not everybody else?
[57:01.280 --> 57:03.640]  They're the real criminals.
[57:03.640 --> 57:10.720]  Mike Pence to David Muir and ABC, Trump's words on January 6 endangered me and my family
[57:10.720 --> 57:11.720]  and everyone at the Capitol.
[57:11.720 --> 57:13.440]  Oh, okay, Mike Pence stab him in the back.
[57:13.440 --> 57:15.640]  Now I like Trump even more.
[57:15.640 --> 57:19.600]  New York Post with the Murdoch, they continue to publish anti-Trump news every day.
[57:19.600 --> 57:23.760]  Boar Donald Trump has gone and lost his swing.
[57:23.760 --> 57:27.040]  So now the Republican establishment, the media establishment, the Democrat Party all coming
[57:27.040 --> 57:32.800]  for Trump and boy, oh boy, despite his shortcomings and problems, every time they swing at him,
[57:32.800 --> 57:39.120]  my support for him goes up.
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.440]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[57:43.440 --> 57:49.640]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[57:49.640 --> 57:55.120]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[57:55.120 --> 58:01.440]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is info wars because we know the globalist
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.200]  number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them
[58:06.200 --> 58:07.200]  down peacefully.
[58:07.200 --> 58:12.360]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the
[58:12.360 --> 58:14.560]  highest quality for your immune system and more.
[58:14.560 --> 58:16.480]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.

[58:31.400 --> 58:36.400]  your body.
[58:36.400 --> 58:38.960]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[58:38.960 --> 58:40.200]  Why is this taking so long?
[58:40.200 --> 58:43.720]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[58:43.720 --> 58:45.000]  Why can't we do this here?
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.520]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[58:47.520 --> 58:51.800]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[58:51.800 --> 58:53.600]  or Governor DeSantis.
[58:53.600 --> 58:57.480]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[58:57.480 --> 59:04.240]  to deny us Arizona, and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[59:04.240 --> 59:09.800]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[59:09.800 --> 59:13.840]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[59:13.840 --> 59:17.560]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[59:17.560 --> 59:19.400]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[59:19.400 --> 59:23.040]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[59:23.040 --> 59:26.440]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[59:26.440 --> 59:28.560]  People need to get behind info wars.
[59:28.560 --> 59:33.760]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[59:33.760 --> 59:39.440]  We need more of these communications, not less.
[59:39.440 --> 59:58.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.120 --> 01:00:23.000]  A democratic platform that said your increasing poverty doesn't exist.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.720]  But what they've done is they've taught people the word inflation, right?
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.880]  People who would have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now because
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.320]  they've been taught it.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.920]  Those machete attacks.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.760]  In Malibu, this homeless man was recently arrested after attacking a man with a machete.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.520]  Daylight homicides and subway rapes.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.040]  The attack was brutal, it was wicked, and the worst part is when the people were watching.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040]  Well they never happened.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.280]  Kathy Huckle believes that the only crimes that are being committed are these crimes with
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]  guns.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.840]  You've got people who are afraid of being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.440]  They're being stabbed, beaten to death on the street with hammers.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]  Okay.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.960]  Anyone who commits a crime under our laws, especially with the change we made to bail,
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960]  has consequences.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.640]  I don't know why that's so important.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.920]  We will make owning a home and retirement impossible for subsequent generations.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.600]  When I was born, the median price for a house was $108,900.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.280]  Now it's $337,200.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.400]  And if you account for inflation, that's about a 45% increase in cost.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.720]  The overwhelming evidence of vaccine deaths and injuries are a figment of your conspiratorial
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.120]  imagination.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.000]  And we're here with a simple message.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.920]  Get vaccinated.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.440]  Update your COVID vaccine.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.880]  Something like one in a thousand people have died.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.080]  We don't know how many more will die.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.640]  But we're into double figures of millions who've definitely been killed as a consequence
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]  of this policy.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.360]  I've not been a religious person, but I'm absolutely clear in my mind, the only people,
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.200]  the kind of planning and thinking it takes to have done what has happened are people
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.840]  who would worship Satan.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.660]  This was the Democrats' message.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:11.600]  What factors led to this train wreck of the corporate credit district of criminals' country
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:21.600]  club mirage of our constitutional republic?
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.720]  Was there a generational factor?
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:30.880]  Gen Z, the 18 to 29 age group, gave 28 points to the Democrats, swayed by the fear-mongering.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.960]  Gen Z was more than happy to trade what's left of their future to their Marxist boomer
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:41.720]  counterparts who promised them student loan forgiveness and will now wag slavery in the
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  form of universal basic income in their faces.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.280]  Have you thought about where this is heading?
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.840]  This is heading to you having no life.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:57.360]  To you spending your income on needs rather than treats and desires, because you won't
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.440]  have any spare money left for those.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.960]  They don't view you like a human being, these people.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:10.200]  What we've got left is a government that's a middle management team for some higher power.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.360]  And I think ultimately we will have to have some kind of universal basic income.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:21.640]  Local and working classes will be eroded and replaced with robots, AI and big corporations.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.720]  And given a basic income, the old world is not coming back.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.480]  A group of billionaires are deciding how the rest of the world should live and they have
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.240]  the air of the government that claims to represent you.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:39.120]  The abortion factor saw 37 points go to the Democrats from unwed mothers and did Trump's
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.360]  shadow loom too large over a Republican party rising from his ashes.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.880]  There are these merely excuses to distract the CNN exit polls results that reveal that
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:57.520]  75% of voters said the country is on the wrong track and an overwhelming majority are angry
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.680]  about inflation and the economy.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.440]  Biden and company will now ramp up the threats on anyone with an unshakable gut feeling after
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:12.000]  they witnessed once again the blatant, antiquated and openly rigged, quote, incompetent end quote
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  voting system.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.440]  So you're telling me I should vote John Federman, I should vote Joshua Shapiro, that'll make
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.600]  all of them other Democrats, you only got one against one.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:28.880]  Project Veritas action journalists were told who to vote for just mere feet outside a polling
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.720]  center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.840]  This is referred to as electioneering.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.480]  So you have to fill out the ballot properly.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the full John Bowne report can be found at band.video,
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.440]  where the audience is growing, folks.

[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.360]  You forget to take your brain force plus.

[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:06.840]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840]  war.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:14.840]  And now your host Owen Troyer.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:33.800]  All right, we are now joined by Matt Baker, slave to liberty and he is out in Arizona,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.960]  Maricopa County and he was boots on the ground talking to voters out at polling locations.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.840]  So I just wanted to bring him on today.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.400]  Talk about what he learned, what voters are saying, what's the vibe, their boots on the
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400]  ground.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.040]  Matt Baker, give us the breakdown.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:55.560]  Well, it's not good, and I mean, Arizona out here has been a very red area.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:00.080]  I mean, a lot of people move from California to escape California, not to come here and
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.200]  build a new California, but to actually escape all of the crazy leftist wackness.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.840]  I'm actually here at my buddy's house.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.640]  I built this fireplace behind me and he's very well on the red side and everyone around
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.960]  here is most people are very almost like Texans, they've got pickup trucks, they've got guns,
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.840]  they've got, you know, everybody's, everybody's really a very Republican person out here.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.600]  And it's funny that you say that because, you know, I'm sitting here in Texas looking
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:33.160]  at the Democrat after it turned Texas blue, I was proud of Texas, we showed out, we didn't
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160]  let Beto win.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.440]  But I mean, I was sitting here kind of looking like, okay, if Beto gets in, I don't know
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.720]  if I can live in this state anymore, that's how bad it was.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.000]  And I'm thinking like Arizona looks pretty good, Arizona's looking like it's going red,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.440]  looking like good leadership.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.520]  But no, no, it looks like the Democrats are trying to stop that out.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.240]  Like, I mean, I, you know, it's very hot out here.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.000]  So I live in the perfect climate of California, which is the breeding ground and why they
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.040]  can get away with so much crap in California, because they know people don't really want
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040]  to leave.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.720]  Now out here, they can say, hey, come over here, we've got all these great laws and we're
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.760]  not a bunch of leftist scumbags.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.400]  And so people were moving out here and dealing with the high temperatures and the high electric
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.080]  bills from cooling their houses.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.480]  But I got to tell you, the place is really nice.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.920]  The idea that they can't vote, count these votes is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.160]  The infrastructure here is like some of the best I've seen around, like the roads are
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]  perfect.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.200]  There's a lot of new infrastructure.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:33.840]  Yeah, it's not like they're trying to gather, you know, votes from old Mary Sue's chicken
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.600]  coop and bring them on down the road to Bob's, you know, you know, little shack and count
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600]  them.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.760]  I mean, they have beautiful infrastructure, beautiful roads.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.840]  I mean, the idea that they can't pull this off like a first world is absolutely BS.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.000]  And the only reason, as we all know, is because they're going to count until they win.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.240]  You know, it's just absolute crap.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:59.440]  So what are people on the ground saying about their experience boating with any of the anomalies,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]  the machine breakdowns?
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.240]  I mean, what's the word from the people on the streets when you talk to them?
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.880]  Well, I've met several people that have said that they had trouble giving their vote to
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.920]  scan and it was put into so-called box three.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.680]  And then these votes have to be, I think they're called shield because they may have to go
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.440]  through and check them for signatures in the SNAP.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.840]  The problem is the human beings who are then now in charge of counting those votes in these
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.280]  different precincts.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.920]  I actually, it's funny after our little chat the other day, I haven't listened to Michael
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.520]  Savage in a long time, but I just turned into him the other day and he had this amazing
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:37.800]  thing on about how the voting machines can be made to swing one way or another simply
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.960]  by just making the sensitivity of the camera for the dot.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.440]  If you say, oh, it's got to be above this resolution or below that resolution.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.480]  If they tweak that in the different counties to make it more sensitive, it kicks out more
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480]  balance.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.960]  It sounds like we were listening to the same podcast because it also talks about how they
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.480]  can use these little tweaks, like for example, the felt pen, right?
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.160]  And then the machine doesn't read it correctly.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.160]  And then a human has to count it.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.040]  And oh, if there's no oversight of that human, all of a sudden they can just mark those
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.680]  ballots ever they want.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]  Yeah.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.920]  And then they inevitably do it in these democratic centers.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.440]  Like if you go downtown, the place that I went, I don't know if you see the rest of
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.880]  that video, right around the corner from this counting place, is this massive sheriff's
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.680]  department which literally looks like a battleship, like the front of it is coming at you.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.320]  It's very dystopian.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.120]  And then one block from there is the largest homeless encampment.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.480]  I don't know, maybe I've seen it as big in LA, but nothing quite like this because usually
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.760]  in LA there'll be a street that goes on and on forever.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.800]  This is like a full on like blocks and blocks with cross streets and like a whole area of
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.000]  a swap meet of homeless people with like pigeons eating trash off the street, people yelling
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.400]  and screaming at you if you slow down to like videotape and stuff.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.400]  It was scary.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.280]  I mean, it was block after block.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.640]  And like I say, cross streets and not your normal one in a row people on a street.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:09.000]  Like it was like six deep tents all the way down the street and cross street, cross street,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  cross street.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.520]  So the liberals have already taken control of this area.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.560]  Like, I was joking with my girlfriend.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.000]  I was like, Hey, well, now they've taken control pretty soon, you're going to start seeing
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  homeless people.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.960]  I guess I just wasn't in the right area.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.920]  And so this area that they are doing the vote counting, as you can see, has been infected
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.000]  with this liberal scum concept that it's a good idea to have people living on the streets
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.160]  in squalor as part of their human rights or something.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.600]  Wow, that's amazing.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.160]  I never had seen this type of footage from Arizona.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.920]  You know, it's odd you think about the homeless phenomenon that's extremely sad.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:48.240]  I mean, people die in Chicago, they die in DC in the Northeast when they're homeless.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.240]  You're wondering why they're homeless in these cold cities, why they don't end up in Arizona,
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.360]  but that's a whole other story.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.680]  Now I have been saying here that I don't expect there to be much of a fight in Nevada.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.800]  I don't expect there to be much of a fight in Georgia.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.840]  I don't think the Republicans have a spine, a backbone to fight there.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.360]  But Arizona, I see it differently.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.880]  I think that Fincham and Homaday and Masters and Lake have a have a fight in them.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.720]  And I think they got a nice, strong support base and group behind them as well that's
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.720]  going to fight.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.960]  I know they got a legal team and everything that's going to fight, but where do you think
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]  that fight stands?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.160]  I mean, they're still under the delusion that Kerry Lake is going to win.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.960]  I'm quite frankly not.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.240]  Even if she does, the whole thing still needs to be investigated.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.680]  Where do you think the fight stands in Arizona right now, almost a week after the election,
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.160]  they're still counting?
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:44.360]  Well, I do think that they're going to magically find out that Katie Hobbs won, of course.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:50.000]  They say that Kerry Lake is going to have to get 58% of the remaining, still 100,000
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.080]  votes are actually out.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.080]  And apparently a lot of these were the same day drop-offs of ballots where apparently you
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.160]  vote early, but you drop off.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:06.200]  And I found this interesting statistic, 88% of all the votes were early ballots mail-in
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.800]  or early drop-off ballots, 88%.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:15.400]  And when you consider that before COVID, that wasn't a thing unless you had to be out of
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.000]  the state, you had to be sick, you had to get a specific ballot, you had to apply to
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.120]  vote not in person and not on the day.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.640]  Now, a lot of the local patriots were complaining that I had seen some footage of that were at
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.600]  that ballot location area the day before.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:36.920]  One was quite articulate, he kept on mentioning they had a bill, it was HB 2289, which was
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.520]  going to make it to or was only in person voting on the day of, and it was going to
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:49.680]  limit it down to only people who are in the military or people who are in hospital or
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.720]  something of that nature to where they physically cannot show up and vote.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.920]  And apparently one of the senators, what's her name, Wendy Rogers, was supposed to be
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920]  on board with that.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.160]  And she actually called for this protest and then didn't even show up.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.200]  And when the local sheriff threatened her with the bill for all the extra police he
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.200]  was going to have to bring in because it was dangerous, then she basically called them
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.320]  off and they were all sitting there like idiots in the street going, what did you do?
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  You called us here.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.080]  It was kind of reminiscent of the drum thing.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.320]  You call us here and then you like hang us out to dry.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:28.640]  And this Wendy Rogers didn't back the SB 2289, even though apparently they had the signatures
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.120]  to have and it was all, they had the votes apparently in the signatures to at least put
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.760]  it on the ballot and get it to move forward so that they could have real elections.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.280]  I think maybe Florida may be able to maintain because it's almost too late for some of these
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280]  areas.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.640]  You're saying, oh, we should get an electoral college for the states, which I think was
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.480]  an amazing idea that you had.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.080]  However, those states are already run by Democrats and they're going to be like, yeah, we're
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]  good.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.080]  We don't need that.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.080]  What about voting on the same day?
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.240]  No, we're good.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.600]  What they're going to do, and I think I've actually read that they've already started
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.760]  doing this, they're going to lower the voting age.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.260]  They're going to go lower the voting age.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:12.160]  Yeah, it's not going to work, but yeah, they'll try.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.560]  Well, when they run everything, we'll see what they're going to do, but like, oh, you
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560]  voted for it.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.840]  Well, Owen Schreuer actually likes the idea, he voted for it.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.480]  Yeah, and so did the dog that died 12 years ago.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.040]  And your dead grandmother too, she's on board.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.680]  Well, you know how it goes.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:37.280]  I mean, God love my grandmother and she voted Republican every day till the day she died.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.280]  Now she's voted Democrat in the last four elections.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.800]  It's amazing from the grave.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.440]  My grandma would dare do that to me.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.400]  Of course, the joke is we know all the dead people vote Democrat.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  It's amazing.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.520]  You want to go find a Democrat rally, just go to your nearest graveyard, you know, and
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.680]  you'll find it.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.680]  Your voice counts.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.680]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.280]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.800]  They know you're angry.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.280]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.280]  got.

[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:00.760]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.080]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.200]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.760]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.160]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.640]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.640]  And I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.520]  But I couldn't have done it without your support, and now because we've been so successful
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.720]  warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.720]  when it comes to globalist agenda.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.400]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful infill wars has been
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.040]  because of your past support.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.880]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, it's a critical juncture of the battle.

[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.920]  for your support.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:10.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:24.720]  I believe there's going to be a battle for Arizona.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.560]  I don't think we're going to get the results we want, but I do think there's going to
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:34.360]  be calls for audits, recounts, review of the law, the voting process, everything.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:39.280]  Because the Republicans in Arizona, Kerry Lake, Blake Masters, Mark Fincham, Abe Hamaday,
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280]  they have a fight in them.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.960]  They have a will in them.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.160]  I don't see that in Nevada.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.720]  I don't see that in Georgia.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.760]  It's gone and dead in Pennsylvania and Michigan, sadly.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.240]  Now, maybe that can change, but that's the way I see it right now.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.000]  And you were mentioning in the last segment, Matt Baker with us, Slave to Liberty, you
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.280]  were mentioning the rally where Wendy Rogers invited people out and didn't show.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.200]  Not sure what was going on with that, but I'm seeing that there are multiple rallies.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.040]  There's been a lot of on-the-street activism, a lot of on-the-street rallying and protesting
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.480]  in Arizona, nowhere else.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.080]  In Brazil, they're out by the millions.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.720]  In Arizona, they're out by maybe the hundreds or the thousands.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.800]  But what about that?
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800]  What about the people?
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.320]  Because a lot of these videos are making their way around the Internet.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.600]  People saying, we don't trust the election.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.600]  It was rigged.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.600]  I went to vote.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600]  It didn't work.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600]  The machine shut down.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:35.000]  So what do you make of the street activism and what do you make of the Republican candidates
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.700]  and how do you think this fight is going to go in the coming weeks when they finally
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.560]  declared that not a single Republican won in Arizona?
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.640]  Well, they're going to have to take it to court.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.880]  The problem is, who's going to be the judge?
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.760]  And they already, when the votes were getting kicked out of the machines, they already called
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.600]  the judge and said, oh, shouldn't we have some extra time to have people vote because
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.560]  a lot of these people weren't able to vote because they were in line and they got told
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.840]  to go home because the machines either didn't have paper or they weren't counting the votes.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.840]  And then the judge says, oh, we're good.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]  We're doing fine.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.680]  And so when they come and they say, hey, what about these voting anomalies?
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.680]  What are they going to do?
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.000]  Just say, well, we're good.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.240]  So I mean, in the end, I think it really is up to the people and we're going to have
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.800]  to do even better than these small gatherings that have been out there.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.480]  I believe that in Arizona, there's a heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy contingent of right-wing
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480]  people.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.360]  And you have no idea what you're in for.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.280]  Because you think it's just, oh, it's red, it's blue, no, this is going to be a big
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280]  problem.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.960]  Your kids are going to be getting told about transgender stuff and the race, the critical
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.720]  race theory is going to be pushed hard.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.440]  My buddy, who I'm here for, I used to work on his house in San Diego and he left because
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.480]  he couldn't deal with the schools in San Diego.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.320]  Now he's out there left as a refugee, bought this beautiful house, we're fixing it up,
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.440]  and now the politics is going to change.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.560]  He's going to be basically without a country because his kids are now going to be, this
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.920]  stuff is going to start infiltrating into the schools and the economy.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.840]  And I wouldn't be surprised if the housing market might actually take action.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.840]  He doesn't want his house price to go down, but I mean, a lot of people might be considering
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.080]  moving out now and where to go because this wads the haven from the West Coast.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.760]  I mean, the West Coast now, you pretty much don't know where to run to.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.120]  But if you don't go to Texas or Florida, I mean, I don't know what your plan is at this
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.680]  point in the game.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:41.800]  Anyone who is in red states or even a tiny town, you have to make laws to make sure that
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.040]  the counting gets done.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.320]  Don't just say, oh, that's been done forever and it's okay because no, they're going to
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.840]  get a Democrat weirdo in there and they're going to start taking over that little town
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.800]  and they're probably going to use money from these crypto Ponzi schemes that they have around
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.920]  the world to buy off officials and pay off different things.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:02.040]  All of this Ponzi scheme money laundering stuff that's going on, it's like trickle down
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:07.160]  economics with like Reaganomics, it's trickle down tyranny, the infinite amount of fake
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:14.320]  money and the infinite amount of all of this tyranny is just that the free money and the
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.680]  Ponzi scheme and the money laundering is basically the fuel for tyranny and it just keeps pushing
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.680]  it.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.240]  They advise off local towns, local judges, local mayors, so you have to hold the line
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.640]  in any place that you have, you still have a voice, you have to make sure like they did
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.200]  in Florida, it's a pass law saying you can't vote, you know, we need voter IDs, we need
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.140]  voting on the same day, we need people to actually make sure that they're the real people
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:42.440]  who are actually voting, that they're qualified to vote, you know, I mean, you have to do
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.720]  everything you can to save these remaining areas and if we can possibly flip some of
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.640]  these other areas back in the smaller areas that they're not paying attention to.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.360]  One thing I got to say is people, we always say on that right, well, Democrats are dumb.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.080]  No, the Democrat foot soldiers are dumb because they believe whatever their overlords tell
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  them.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.400]  The people that run the Democrat Party are the most conniving, manipulative scumbags
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  ever to walk here.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.360]  Oh, they're very politically savvy criminally, yes.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.120]  And I think to get back what we were saying the other day about the Santas, and by the
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.000]  way, I love you Laura Luma, I was a little bit heated the other day about that, but I
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.320]  think we got to be very careful when we talk about the Trump dissantus thing, because for
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.840]  all we know, they're just trying to push pressure on the base to now throw dissantus under
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.960]  the bus, and then they come out and indict Trump, and then now who we got.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:38.640]  When we know that dissantus is a candidate, we know Trump is a great candidate, and if
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:44.080]  it was all to poll, Trump would probably just win and he'd be the candidate anyway, and
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.520]  we're not going to be voting whether it's dissantus or Trump in the general election.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.040]  We're all going to vote for whoever the right-wing candidate is anyway.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.320]  So if they battle it out, may the best man win, now if they can just do it without destroying
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:02.240]  each other's careers in the meantime, because they could very easily just have all a lot
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.920]  of right-wing people I know are already going the, well, dissantus is dissantus, dissantus
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.400]  is that, and they're doing all the opposition research to undermine him as a great candidate,
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.160]  which could be our only hope if Trump gets defeated or taken out or jailed or something
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.400]  by the state.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.760]  So once they get that, and we have to be very careful, don't call names to our fellow candidates,
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.320]  don't do anything with anything, just say we support Trump for now, but dissantus is
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.240]  a great person and don't get in the weeds, because we can't do it, thank God dissantus
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:37.760]  didn't buy onto that, Trump did, I mean, technically, I understand if Trump did actually
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:43.760]  save dissantus, then technically, as an honorable man, he owes it, not necessarily the people
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.280]  or the world, but he owes it to the honorable to give Trump a percent.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.400]  Well, Trump took the bait or he's chewing through the buffet of bait like, you know,
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.440]  like Lizzo or something, but I think it might be a political strategy of his to just get
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.840]  this out of the way ahead of the primary process to just come in swinging and say, all right,
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.840]  who wants to fight me?
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.840]  You want to fight me?
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.160]  We're going to fight for me, because he wants to be the president.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.440]  That shows me Trump really badly wants to be the president, that he's coming out swinging
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.200]  already, taking on the Republican establishment, he really wants to be president again.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.960]  I think it's a good sign, even though it looks bad on the surface.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.120]  Matt Baker, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.120]  Great coverage as always.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.440]  And, you know, he mentioned another great point there too, the phenomenon of people
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.920]  leaving the Democrat cities, moving to Republican areas, it's like, how do they, I'm glad that
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.360]  didn't happen to Texas, but it's like, how does that happen to Arizona?
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.640]  That's another amazing phenomenon.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, before we come back with our next great guest, Joe Hoff, remember
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.560]  infowarstore.com is how we do everything we do here.

[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.200]  for great products like vitamin mineral fusion.

[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.120]  right here.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.040]  Vitamin mineral fusion, infowarstore.com, I start every day with vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.880]  I like to mix it with a little juice, and then I chase down my supplements with vitamin
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.560]  mineral fusion every morning, infowarstore.com.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.720]  Put a big pitcher in your refrigerator, the kids will love it, and they won't be drinking
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.640]  the toxic energy drinks or soda pop, they'll be drinking vitamin mineral fusion, and you'll
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.640]  be supporting free speech in the process by shopping at infowarstore.com.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.200]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.280]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.120]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it, I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120]  That's not negative.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.960]  I'm not living in denial.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.800]  And so think of globalism as being hidden, as an infection that we feel yet, but now
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.200]  it's come to the surface, that's actually a positive thing.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.480]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job, they stole the election, we can't get down
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.560]  about that.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.400]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.760]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed, they're scared.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.160]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened, no we're
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.760]  a bunch of winners, they're trying to suppress us, let our life of truth shine and tell everybody
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]  what's happening.

[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.160]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:14.680]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:21.040]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is info wars because we know the globalist
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.720]  number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them

[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.360]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.600]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.120]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.440]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.920]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.200]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter where the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.000]  or Governor DeSantis.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.880]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:22.640]  to deny us Arizona, and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:28.200]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.280]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.120]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else, communications are the
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.800]  reason why we did well.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:43.000]  That's why infowarstore.com is so damn important, that's why they're so desperate to take you
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.840]  off the air, Alex.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.960]  You don't need to get behind info wars.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:52.160]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:33:22.000]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.480]  Well, it's incredible folks, as we sit here, they're still counting votes in Oregon, in
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.440]  California, in Colorado, and Maryland, in house races where Republicans have a stronghold
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.440]  and are winning.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.240]  But magically, the perfect number of votes are coming in for the Democrats to win, and
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.520]  they might take the house too.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.440]  It's totally legitimate, don't ask any questions or you're a racist, terrorist, bigot.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.000]  Now, the great Joe Hoft from the incredible Gateway Pundit joins me here.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.080]  They are just all over this story.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.800]  Here's a couple of the headlines I want to open up here with Joe Hoft.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:06.040]  Despite only 17% Democrat turnout on election day, Katie Hobbs and Democrats are winning
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:11.000]  over 50% of Maricopa County election day totals, nobody thought that would be the case.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  And here we are.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.160]  Maricopa County election judge believes the machines were programmed to reject ballots
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.160]  on election day.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.960]  I wonder who's ballots they were rejecting.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.280]  And GOP didn't lose midterms because mail-in ballots are better than in-person voting.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.520]  The GOP lost because the same corrupt election activities happened again.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.760]  So I want to begin the conversation right here with Joe Hoft.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.400]  Joe, it's an amazing thing.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.760]  The Democrats don't have to have rallies.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.000]  They don't have to campaign.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.960]  They don't have to have debates.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.320]  They don't have to do anything.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.880]  And then somehow they win in Arizona.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.720]  I mean, how obvious is this one?
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.800]  To me, it's a pretty obvious one because Arizona was a really energized red state.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.680]  I mean, they were excited for their candidates, excited for this midterm election.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.440]  And yet somehow the entire state falls flat and goes blue.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.280]  I'm not buying it, Joe.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.280]  Yeah.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.200]  I mean, either it's a travesty of what's happening there.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:11.080]  And Jim had that great post that you just mentioned a few moments ago about Arizona.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.800]  So on election day, which is what they told all the Kerry Lake and all the conservatives,
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.040]  don't mail in your ballot.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.040]  They'll switch it.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.160]  And we don't know what sort of monkey business they'll do with it.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.600]  They'll throw it away.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.360]  So come in on election day vote.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.520]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.840]  And apparently that strategy worked for Kerry Lake in the primaries.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840]  And so people do.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.200]  And then all of a sudden the election day is a mess.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.400]  And then all of a sudden here we are on almost a week later now.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:43.600]  We're still counting, and then like Jim reported this morning overnight, you know, according
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.560]  to a Democrat, there was 17% turnout for Democrats on election day.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:59.520]  And yet we're seeing the results being, you know, 54% for Katie Hobbs, this corrupt, not
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.960]  likable woman who certified the stolen election of 2020.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:10.240]  And still the Secretary of State overseeing this gubernatorial race.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240]  Yeah.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:16.440]  She should have refused herself long, long time ago, but of course she's a Soros girl
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.840]  and they have to make sure everything gets corrupted rightly so they can steal all these
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]  races.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.840]  And Arizona is really important.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.720]  I think that's the, you know, the deep state, once they steal a state, they want to, you
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.720]  know, they want to lock it in.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.760]  And Kerry Lake is a threat to, I think the thing about Kerry Lake is a lot of people
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.920]  think she's a vice president, if not president material.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:46.320]  She's very polished, very smart, very mega, a big Trump supporter, and just a logical
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.640]  perhaps person if he runs again as a vice president.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:55.240]  So if not even a president candidate, so they're trying to knock her out and it doesn't make
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.240]  any sense.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.880]  And so, you know, you know this, so I want to share this before with you.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.920]  I was a corporate auditor, I've done audits around the world, maybe two, 300 audits.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:09.080]  I was stationed in Hong Kong for a decade overseeing an audit team over there, done
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:14.720]  fraud audits, financial operational, I've earned 10 degrees designations, and it's really
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.720]  easy to see first step in auditing is kind of look at your population, get a good definition
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.040]  of what it is and what the process is you're looking at in the systems.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  And again, it's the same story from 2020.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:34.280]  These high numbers immediately shock you and they're like, how can this be if 17% dims
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:40.800]  are showing up and yet you're getting 54% carry for what's her name, we don't even know
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.800]  her name.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.800]  No.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:43.800]  Yeah.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.200]  I mean, she's repulsive to the ladies got real squeaky little girl voice.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.080]  It's just she's, she's weird and there's nothing attractive about her.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.760]  So kind of like Fetterman, I guess Fetterman's the other obvious, you know, anomaly.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.680]  It's like, who was who's going to vote for that guy, especially after that debate?
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  Yeah.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.880]  Here's the problem with the Pennsylvania, Arizona dichotomy is that, I mean, yeah, I
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.480]  believe Pennsylvania was stolen.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.080]  There's no way Fetterman could actually win.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.280]  But what's the point of contesting that the Republicans aren't battling for that.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.000]  The Democrats own Pennsylvania.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  They've stamped it.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.600]  There's no chance the Republican wins in the state ride election in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:20.600]  The Democrats just own it.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.360]  So it's like, okay, I'm not going to focus on a futile fight here.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.000]  But I have hope for Arizona.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.140]  No matter the results, I think Lake and Masters and Fincham and Hameday, they're going to
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.140]  fight it.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.140]  They're going to sue.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:32.140]  They're going to call for audits.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.140]  They're going to call for recounts.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.640]  I think they're going to fight this deal.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.280]  Well, I think they should, you know, and I think they should, I think they ultimately
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.360]  should ask for a new election because this was fraudulent.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.760]  Now, what I've heard about what happened on election day, I got a piece yesterday from
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.520]  some individuals and there's an IT guy out there that looked at this.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:57.040]  And what appears that they changed the size of the boat or the ballot, and it previously
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.400]  was 19 inches long, now it's 20 inches.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.960]  And so that worked fine for all these mail-in ballots.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.240]  They had the machinery that would handle them.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:10.280]  But on election day, these machines that they're using on site apparently would only handle
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.880]  19-inch paper.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.920]  So then they had to shrink the images down to 19 inches, and then they tried to run
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.920]  through the tabulators.
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.680]  The tabulators couldn't find the circles in the right spots or everything was getting
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.840]  spit out.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:29.240]  So it appears to be something intentional, just a mechanism to mess with and steal the
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:34.080]  election because then they tell people, throw your ballots over here, we'll be sure to get
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.080]  to them later.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.800]  You don't know if they are, you don't know where these ballots are going, and then you
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.240]  end up with 54% for hire.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.680]  And maybe you haven't heard this because I heard that news about the new ballot length.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.680]  It was kind of breaking this weekend, and this maybe gives you a better idea.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.560]  I know that in Travis County where I voted in Texas, they had the same thing where they
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.320]  expanded the length of the insert that you put in.
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:04.200]  But they knew that in advance, and so they knew they had to print out more paper than
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]  they normally do.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200]  So they had that ready to go.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.440]  And even though the machines would run out of ink quicker because of the bigger paper,
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.960]  they had it all ready to go, I witnessed it in real time, it happening.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.800]  And they were able to get everything lined up so that all the images were read properly.
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.880]  So it wasn't only Arizona that changed the size of this, it was only Arizona that had
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.880]  problems.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.360]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.520]  So they didn't adequately address it.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.560]  And I saw somebody else send something out on Twitter overnight too.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.080]  I haven't written about this, but they're pointing out in the manual all these things
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:39.000]  that are missing and conveniently, and then they didn't prepare properly.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.440]  So who would have guessed it, especially knowing that the Republicans are the group that's
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.760]  going to show up on election day, because we can't trust these people.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.480]  And I guess that strategy worked for Kerry Lake in the primary.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:55.400]  So it was a good strategy, but they had to figure out a way to mess it up.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.400]  And now here we are on day six or whatever of this counting that's outrageous.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.000]  And we know that she won.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.720]  She probably won really big.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.320]  I believe all these candidates did, but they're just monkeying around with stuff.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.680]  And this is what they, you know, sounds like a communist technique, monkeying around, eventually
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.200]  they're going to call it for the dim and then, you know, and it just demoralizes you.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.680]  And that's part of their efforts to try to demoralize you.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.920]  And, you know, I guess for myself, I stepped in with this election, I'm not too demoralized
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.280]  because I kind of knew they'd do it.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.640]  And with that, because it's not enough to change, there's belief and a lot of people
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]  worked really hard.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.800]  I don't want to discount that, but we didn't change the core issues.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.560]  And that's kind of like auditing one-on-one too.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.440]  And I've seen this where auditors will go in and do an audit and they'll come up with
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.840]  a recommendation on how to change things for the better and it doesn't address the root
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:53.840]  cause.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:59.240]  And the root cause in our elections is those machines and the, and of course these absentee
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:05.480]  balance and the voter rolls and the people and the processes.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.560]  Everything is broken and we didn't address some of these big things.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:14.560]  That's why we're seeing these massive boat drops throughout the country and many of these
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.440]  key races where it's like, and they're always for the Democrat.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.600]  You'll see this when you look at this Edison data feed that shows that up-to-date results,
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.440]  you'll see all of a sudden, Democrat gets massive drop of balance, 20, 30, 40, 50,000
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:35.400]  balance, compared to the Republicans, you know, reaction of that amount we saw.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:41.680]  Like we saw in 2020, and of course, if you went through that with a fine tooth comb,
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.400]  you probably found out that the neighbor's dog Buster voted for the Democrat.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.120]  You probably found out your great aunt voted for the Democrat.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:53.120]  You probably found out your other neighbor's pet cat, you got a little pet cat voted Democrat
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.280]  too, if you went through it, you probably find that.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.360]  I'm pointing my finger at you, and I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:05.760]  You forget to take your multivitamins, you forget to take your vitamin D3, you forget
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.200]  to take your Brain Force Plus, you forget to take DNA Force Plus, you forget to take

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.720]  constantly forget, and when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.320]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:11.080]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.160]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:21.280]  That's why it's so essential today, down more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:18.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.320]  Got Joe Hoff with us here, another segment, I want to continue with the election coverage
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.840]  if we get an extra minute here, maybe get his opinion on the FTX Democrat money laundering
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:34.240]  situation as an expert auditor himself, but there's two things here, I'll throw one out
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.920]  there just because we've mentioned it in the last segment.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:42.600]  Clearly the incompetence of Katie Hobbs as the Secretary of State is showing here with
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.520]  this disaster during the election, that clearly shows her incompetence, she shouldn't be the
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:52.920]  governor if that's the level of leadership she has, but you mentioned something earlier
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:48:00.160]  that resonated with me because I feel the same way and I'm not feeling near the amount
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:06.480]  of frustration that the mean of the Republicans and their voters seem to be facing because
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.120]  we knew this was coming and it seems like the frustration is really going downstream
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:12.240]  now Joe.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.520]  It seems that the frustrations that we've had for decades dealing with the corruption
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.160]  in this country is almost numbed us to an extent or were punch drunk maybe in this fight
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:27.440]  and the frustration is now downstream and so you kind of mentioned that earlier, maybe
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.240]  expand on that a little bit because that's what I'm saying is that the average Republican
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.240]  voter is now viewed as a conspiracy theorist because they're asking basic questions about
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.560]  why their elections don't work or how it's possible that a candidate that doesn't even
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:44.960]  campaign or do rallies or a debate can beat a candidate with huge momentum and energy
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.560]  behind her, Hobbs versus Lake, so it seems to me that the frustration is moving downstream
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:57.320]  which what happens with that is the frustration hits first and then the reality hits second
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.440]  and then the activism is what the conclusion finally is.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.640]  That's kind of the process I'm seeing here.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.640]  What about you?
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.000]  Yeah, that's great and yeah and then to clarify too, we've had some of these leaders in the
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.160]  Republican Party and over the last couple of days and some have said terrible candidates
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:21.960]  which I thought was horrible especially if I was one of these guys who ran and gave up
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:28.640]  a year of my life trying to win one of these races then to be told by some slime ball that
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.840]  I wasn't good enough and that's why I lost.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.600]  I'd be really offended by that.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.720]  I don't think that strategy is smart but then there's others like Molly Hemingway that came
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:45.480]  out and said, well, we have to join this absentee ballot, mail-in ballot strategy and change
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.200]  our strategy and I thought, well, that's not real either.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.520]  That absentee ballot stuff is massive fraud.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.120]  We can't do that and I don't think she fully understands it because this isn't because
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.720]  that they've figured out how to get their people to mail in their ballots.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.240]  It's that they've figured out that they can do more fraud when they do mail-in ballots
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:12.680]  and I don't think Molly Hemingway understands that and yet this is the same people that
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:18.560]  did the Mueller exam on Trump for four years and attempted coup d'etat on President Trump.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:23.320]  It's the same people that have been involved in so many corrupt activities over the last
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.480]  few years, decades.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:32.360]  The list goes on and on and on and the 2020 election and now here we are 22, the same
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.000]  thing.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.120]  That's not the answer.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.200]  The answer is we've got to first get rid of these bogus names off of these voter rolls
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.240]  and there's a group in Wisconsin that wrote to me and I put it up this morning at the
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.800]  Gateway Pundit and they're bragging about their work but Wisconsin goes, well, I asked
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:54.000]  them, they said, well, because they wouldn't accept our changes in their voter rolls but
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.560]  in the states that did, we clearly cleaned house which Texas is one of them I guess.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.880]  Yeah, Texas and Florida.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:05.400]  Yeah, and so they were able to get those voter rolls up today so they can't steal because
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:10.640]  I swear to God, you were saying before the break about somebody's cat, somebody's dog,
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.640]  they're on the list.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.520]  I mean, I think they just make names up.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:16.840]  I don't even, you know, they just say unknown names and stuff.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.800]  It's the ghost of, you know, it's the ghost of Cornwallis.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:25.440]  It's the ghost of George Washington, you know, yeah, exactly.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:31.640]  So they make that stuff up but then it's the machines as well like we talked about and yeah,
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.840]  you know, this is appalling.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.320]  This deserves our rage.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:41.720]  This is really bad and we're seeing how to maybe handle this from the people in Brazil.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.200]  Well, yeah, they're not on the streets by the millions.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.560]  By the millions and they even followed some of these, you know, I'll call them whatever,
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.400]  slime dogs, whatever, to New York City.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.000]  They're there the next couple of days and they're protesting them in New York City.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.480]  And there were a bunch of New York City, thousands of them in New York City.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.480]  Brazilians.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.480]  And that's what you do.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.720]  Look at that picture.
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.720]  It's just amazing.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.040]  There's a video that goes with that.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.000]  It's just amazing, massive crowd.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.360]  This is over the weekend.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.480]  People in Brazil, you know, know that their election was stolen.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.360]  They know how important it is and people here have been silenced and our media has done
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.800]  this incredible job of, you know, stealing the true picture except for outlets like yours
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.400]  and the Gateway Pundit and others that are trying to get the truth out.
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.400]  And you know what?
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.480]  We're doing a great job because people know that this election in 2020 was stolen and
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:36.160]  they know this and they're sitting back saying that here we go again, saying same thing.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.520]  And so it's, you know, it's good what we're doing.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:45.280]  It's just that we've got, you know, we've got a major issue here that we've got.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:46.280]  We've got to address.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:51.360]  Well, and, you know, you bring this up because I do think this is the debate and I think
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.520]  Hemingway is kind of throwing the red meat out there.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.480]  But I do think this is the debate here.
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:03.200]  If the goal is to get us back to in-person day of voting paper ballots, well, then you
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.280]  have to measure out the best path to get there.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.000]  And so I kind of throw this out there to have the debate.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.640]  I'll get your take on it, even though I kind of already know where you stand.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:15.400]  I mean, I think the quickest way to get there would be the Republicans need to do what the
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:18.960]  Democrats are doing and they need to have big Trump rallies.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.960]  Okay.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.720]  So the Republican rally, 20, 30,000 people have a voter registration booth right there
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:28.000]  at the rally and have it right across the place from an early voting center and just
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.880]  send 20,000 people to vote at early vote at every Republican rally.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:35.680]  Oh, the Democrats will be against it then, won't they?
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.680]  Yeah.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:39.880]  Well, I think that, I think quite frankly, I think that's a great idea.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880]  That's what they're doing.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.480]  And fill out the ballots, mail them in, and here's what we found out too, these new devices
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:49.880]  that they have for when you walk into a polling place and they're calling, it looks like an
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:56.240]  iPad, I think it basically is, probably paid about 100 times what it's worth because they're
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.240]  calling it something else.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.280]  And those things are connected to the net.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:05.440]  They know real time who's voted and I think that helps them then when they try to steal
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:11.560]  the ballots, they know which voters haven't voted, they can figure that out with a simple
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:19.840]  query and then they drop 100,000 votes for a candidate or 10,000 or whatever is needed
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:28.720]  and they know who to register on that voter system and show that they voted and it's just
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.720]  all a big sham.
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.720]  It's a joke.
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:35.360]  So yeah, I agree, you know, but the thing that grabs me like about Hemingway and stuff,
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.240]  I don't think she recognizes that this election was stolen.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:43.880]  She wrote that book rigged and I think her summary thesis was that, well, Zuckerberg
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:47.640]  paid more money and he just outpaid the Republicans.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:53.520]  You know, that wasn't it, Molly, it was stolen, there's massive fraud in there.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:55:00.280]  Joe Biden, again, big picture, gets 81 million ballots and yet he couldn't get, I'm telling
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.920]  this, he couldn't get 2,000 people in his rallies leading up to the election from Labor
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:05.920]  Day to Election Day.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.920]  No, it's a total joke.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.440]  It's just like in Brazil and now it's just being proven again with the millions of people
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.440]  in the street.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:15.080]  The one difference between Brazil and their stolen election in ours is that the military
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.680]  is actually on Bolsonaro's side, whereas here, not so much with Trump.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.480]  But let me just get your two-minute analysis because you talk about the theft and the money
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:23.880]  and that is involved with this too.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.320]  We just found out with FTX, the money laundering that the Democrats did through Ukraine and
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.360]  FTX to just take your money, put it right back in their own pockets, just clear money
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.480]  laundering, I mean, literally the standard for money laundering, your two minutes on
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.480]  that situation.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.160]  Well, thanks, and you guys have done a great job keeping up on that too.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  I noticed some articles years over the weekend.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.880]  So the way I look at it, this guy created this FTX and took people's money, promised
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:57.800]  that he was investing it in whatever cryptocurrencies they requested, then basically used the money
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:03.360]  for something else and then he creates a big investment arm and then he's working with
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:09.840]  all the Dems and you've got him at the Clinton Foundation at a recent event sitting right
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:15.320]  next to Bill Clinton and then you've got him donating $40 million to this election, maybe
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.560]  more than anybody other than maybe, I think, George Soros at this election.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:28.000]  You've got him donating to the Bidens and I think that's really the smaller part of
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  the story.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.280]  I think the bigger part is that we were sending billions of dollars over to the Ukraine and
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:37.760]  then somehow Ukraine gets involved with FTX.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:44.160]  And then we end up working, they invest, they say, in FTX and how many billions of this
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.600]  whatever, 60 now billion that went to the Ukraine actually landed in Ukraine and helps
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:50.600]  the people there.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  I doubt much.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:58.760]  I think the big story here is that of these billions that went overseas, a lot came back
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:05.080]  through cryptocurrency, which is then hard to follow and track and there's a lot of people
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:13.080]  with some big, big bank accounts and or cryptocurrency wallets full of this Ukrainian dollars that
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.040]  we sent over there for the Ukraine and people in Ukraine, no wonder they're getting crushed
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.560]  by Russia and that which our media won't report.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.520]  Yeah, our media is lying about that too.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:24.040]  We got more developments there.
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:25.040]  We'll cover later.
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.000]  Joe Hoff, the Gateway Punnett, great stuff as always.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.640]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.640]  Thanks.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.360]  And folks, people will say, oh, you can't say the Democrats are money laundering in
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  Ukraine.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.360]  That was back in April.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  Oh, really?
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.360]  I can't?
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  Oh, how'd I know?
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  How did we know?
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.360]  They were money laundering.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  How did we know?
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.360]  I don't know.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.600]  Oh, it's a mystery.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.960]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:58.160]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging and bullying and
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:03.640]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:10.000]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  number.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  We know their operation.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.880]  We know their modus operandi and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.880]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.040]  highest quality for your immune system and more.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.000]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  Black Friday comes early.

[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.320]  Biggest sale of the year, promo code 1776, up to 60% off.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:41.480]  Take action now and empower your body.
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:47.480]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:48.480]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:52.200]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.520]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.000]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.280]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter where the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.120]  or Governor DeSantis.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:05.960]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:12.680]  to deny us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:18.280]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.320]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.040]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.880]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:31.520]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:34.920]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.040]  People need to get behind infowars.
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:42.240]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:48.320]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[01:59:48.320 --> 02:00:16.280]  We're about to be joined by Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto to get into the FTX situation.
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:21.960]  Let me hit some of these headlines ahead of that, though.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:27.080]  First of all, guys, let's just be very clear.
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:35.920]  The images that you see on the screen here, the FBI images of pedophilia symbols that
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:42.480]  appear to be in the Almeida research symbol and appear to be in the SBF Twitter profile.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:45.160]  Folks, that's just a coincidence, okay?
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:46.520]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.680]  Don't pay attention to this.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.160]  Don't even look at this at all.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:54.920]  Just merely a coincidence that these symbols happen to be all over the Democrat Party politics.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.520]  Please, folks, please.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.520]  Just ignore this.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.840]  Don't look at this.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:00:59.840]  Just a coincidence.
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:00.840]  Nothing to see here.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.280]  Now, here are some of the headlines.
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:09.240]  Bahamas Police and Bahamas Securities Commission looking into FTX activities for wrongdoing.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.200]  Will they find 10% to the big guy, Joe Biden?
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:14.200]  10%?
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.200]  10%?
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.200]  10%?
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:21.200]  I think the Democrats are getting closer to 100%?
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.200]  10%?
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:30.440]  Yeah, Joe Biden, he doesn't even know what planet he's on, though.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.840]  How much of the billions to Ukraine was laundered back to U.S. politicians via FTX?
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.040]  Will we ever get a fair investigation?
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.040]  I don't know.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.360]  They're busy looking into Elon Musk.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.680]  He's a Republican voter now, so you know how that goes.
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.200]  It is amazing, though, isn't it?
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.840]  I mean, truly, folks, truly.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.520]  People in the corporate world, people in the political world know, you come out as a liberal
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.960]  Democrat, you're above the law.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.240]  They know it.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.920]  They know it.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.200]  You come out as a liberal Democrat, you donate to liberal Democrat causes, you are now above
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.200]  the law.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.800]  So they'll investigate Elon Musk for the next two years dealing with the Twitter thing.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.280]  They'll investigate Tesla and SpaceX and all those other endeavors, and they will do nothing
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.560]  to the people that just stole billions of dollars and gave it to the Democrat Party
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.560]  and laundered money through Ukraine.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.560]  Yeah.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:26.320]  FTX facing criminal probe by Bahamas authorities, but Musk counters will be no investigation
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.160]  of major Democrat donor.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.680]  And he's right.
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:30.840]  He'll be right.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:31.840]  They'll let him off.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.840]  They're all searching for themselves.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.000]  They all knew it was going on the whole time.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.320]  Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office probing FTX collapse.
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.320]  That's Democrats.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.480]  They'll find nothing.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:46.400]  U.S. Senator threatens Elon Musk, Edward Markey over the weekend, and it's the Biden
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:47.400]  administration.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:48.400]  It's Jake Solomon now.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:52.920]  They're all saying they're going to go after Elon Musk because he supports free speech.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.400]  Elon Musk should have been working to launder money for the Democrat Party.
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.640]  Don't you see how it works?
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.920]  But Elon Musk knows that he knew the risks.
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:05.920]  He knew they were going to come after them and he's taking it all in stride.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:12.600]  So here it is, landmark trial involving Tesla autopilot weighs if man or machine at fault.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.120]  Elon Musk trial opens to decide fate of his $56 billion Tesla pay.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.480]  And then there's an issue they're investigating with SpaceX and everything.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.080]  So here's the thing that Elon Musk has over his head.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:30.000]  He's got these legal battles that are like anvils sitting over his head right now with
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.480]  Tesla, SpaceX and other things.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.920]  And the deep state and the Democrats are basically saying, if you do what you're intending to
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.080]  do with Twitter, we're going to cut that rope and that anvil is going to smash you on the
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.680]  head.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.640]  And if you continue to go anti-liberal, anti-woke, we're going to cut the other rope and that
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.280]  anvil is going to smash you on the head.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:57.000]  And if you ever think that you're going to return free speech to Twitter, just know this.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.480]  The moment you let Donald Trump, Alex Jones and others back on Twitter is the moment that
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:06.000]  we will remove you from the Apple App Store and the moment we will remove you from the
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.320]  Google Play App Store.
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.520]  That's their plan.
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:13.520]  That's what they've already done.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.120]  That's what they've done in the past.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.680]  That's what they've done to Info Wars.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.920]  It's what they've done to others.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.400]  It's what they will do to Elon Musk.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:27.840]  Now the good news is, Elon Musk seems to be ready for this fight and Elon Musk may or
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.640]  may not be the richest man in the world.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:38.560]  But we'll see how that fares in the coming weeks, months and years as the Deep State
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.520]  looks to destroy Elon Musk and he looks to return free speech to Twitter and continue
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.760]  to innovate the world of space travel and engineering on planet Earth.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:59.040]  Coming up next to get into the FTX scandal, Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, don't go anywhere.

[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:05.640]  You found it.
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:14.480]  The tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jojo with Owen Troyer and we're joined now by
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:25.080]  Ben Armstrong, BitBoyCrypto.com, BitBoy underscore crypto on Twitter and I mean we knew the Democrats
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:26.680]  were laundering money through Ukraine.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:33.680]  That was pretty obvious to anybody paying attention but never saw the crypto exchange
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.040]  FTX being the money laundering front organization to do this but you know Ben now that I'm kind
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:44.000]  of looking at and investigating it and you know I've never really been a big crypto commentator
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.880]  myself but when I'm looking at it now it was so obvious from the beginning wasn't it?
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:54.080]  I mean now that we're looking back on this was the whole entire FTX scandal not sitting
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:57.160]  out there from the very beginning that this is going to be the case?
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.160]  Ben Armstrong your take.
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.160]  Yeah absolutely.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:04.200]  I mean it was sitting right in front of our eyes right on our noses the entire time and
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:08.560]  that's why a lot of us have a lot of anger on our face in the crypto world just for buying
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:13.200]  in to what Sam Bankman Freed presented himself as you know he always tried to present himself
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:19.480]  as like can you figure is he good is he bad it was hard for us to ever really know until
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:24.840]  now and you look back if you look back at several of the projects that launched on FTX
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:33.760]  ICP, TASPR, Aptos, New Genesis protocol that was on liquid you look at all these projects
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:39.400]  and you realize that there were so many signs that this stuff was going on there were so
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:44.120]  many projects that Sam Bankman Freed destroyed by shorting them to zero and creating a counterfeit
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:46.320]  supply on the exchange.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:51.280]  It was a scam from the very very very beginning and we're really just kind of getting down
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:55.440]  the rabbit hole I mean you know once right now what we're focused on we're focused on
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:00.200]  like cracking the egg here on what actually happened with the scam itself and of course
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:04.880]  you start moving into the Ukraine situation and the politics and the fact that look doesn't
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:09.600]  matter if you're a Republican or Democrat what matters is is that Sam Bankman Freed
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:14.840]  was literally using your customer funds to support both sides obviously heavily tilted
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.920]  Democrat there but he was supported Republicans with Democrats money were supported Democrats
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:23.960]  with Republicans money and that right there is an absolute scam and a fraud within itself
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:27.720]  that should change some you know election donation and contribution loss.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:33.240]  Well and we'll see if it does but just just so the layman understands this because not
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:38.560]  everybody is really up to date on how crypto works and all this stuff so explain it to
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:45.400]  the layman here and myself included investors invest in crypto they give their dollar their
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:51.880]  US dollar to FTX exchange they're supposed to have this big mass of capital that can
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:55.720]  at least back up some of their exchanges if people want to trade out or trade in or all
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.280]  of this stuff and I guess organically a bunch of people were demanding to pull out at the
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.240]  same time and they realized that there was no reserves or how did that go no that doesn't
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:10.440]  what happened at all actually we we have been sounding the alarm bell on this you go back
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.160]  to October 29th there's a tweet that we put out where we begged people to close their
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.440]  accounts and take money off FTX we certainly think that we did have a certain amount of
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:24.040]  people that did withdraw to the point that they felt the crunch but what actually happened
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:30.600]  is is that with a lot of these changes they just get so greed hungry that they end up
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:36.400]  borrowing the customer funds to make low leverage trades that they think will never go bust but
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:39.680]  the thing about leverage is you know you're always at some point going to going to meet
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:44.640]  a liquidation you know or crazy stop loss is going to set you off so what you're looking
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:49.320]  at is when you're on FTX and you are looking at the overall pool of funds on there you
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:54.440]  actually did not there was actually not assets there supposedly there was nine hundred million
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.280]  dollars worth of real assets and they were nine billion dollars in the hole to understand
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:04.080]  FTX Fiasco you have to understand Alameda research which is their VC arm that actually
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:09.000]  really got FTX funded and rolling in the beginning that set off you know Caroline Ellison and
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:14.560]  you know as Sam Bateman free to their kind of you know to the stage here is that there
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:20.240]  was a backdoor built into FTX so that when Alameda was hurting for funds or needed funds
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.760]  they could reach into those customer assets and pull them directly over to what they
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.760]  were doing with their trades make the money back and then put it back you know as your
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.280]  classic Ponzi scheme is what it turned into and eventually they couldn't put the money
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.000]  back so what happened is we have been front running this story for weeks because just
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.520]  a fluke on how we ended up kind of getting getting wind of all this while CZ who is the
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:45.400]  founder of Binance the largest exchange in the world well he got wind of the same stuff
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:51.240]  that we had gotten wind of and when he found out he immediately dumped I think it was five
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:57.880]  hundred million dollars worth of FTT token so FTX was the exchange they had a coin called
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:02.440]  FTT that they created that really didn't serve a purpose on the website and people were like
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:06.360]  well you know why is this really even a thing well what they would do is they would wash
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:12.800]  trade FTT back and forth between FTX and Alameda research every time they would do that they
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:18.160]  would pump up the price a little bit and that kept their their overall assets at a much
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:22.800]  higher amount because they were wash trading it if you actually pulled FTT out of their
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.560]  portfolio their portfolio would look very weak because there was so heavily invested
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:30.800]  in this coin that they pumped up the price of basically the same thing the fiat system
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.720]  does in America they just print money out of nothing and so that's what they were doing
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.200]  well when CZ found out about this he dumped his FTT tokens and destroyed the price it
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:45.400]  went from twenty two dollars to three dollars in a 24 hour period and then all of a sudden
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:50.200]  basically FTX didn't have the windfall they didn't have those FTG tokens value to be able
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.240]  to prop themselves up and everybody woke up to what was happening people started withdrawing
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.880]  their funds at that point and it was already too late you know by the time that people
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:03.280]  started pulling their funds out you know it was already frozen we had millions of dollars
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.160]  and thousands of accounts closed in the weeks leading up to this because like I said we've
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.400]  been warning people about this for about you know six weeks or more so it sounds like you
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.560]  probably saved a lot of people a lot of money on that deal now given the information we
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:23.600]  have now do you think this whole thing was set up for failure for the from the beginning
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.400]  to eventually target crypto for regulation and government control or do you think you
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.920]  know there was a level of organic human activity here that forced us into the position we're
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:39.960]  in now and now they're just using it to regulate crypto where do you fall on on that debate
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.680]  yeah I certainly think that Washington has been totally fooled here by Sam Bateman Freed
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:48.360]  I think Gary Gensler in charge of the SEC he's been meeting with Sam Bateman Freed to
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.480]  talk about regulatory loopholes they can close and you know kind of how this whole thing
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:56.760]  started between me and Sam is I actually had a bill or I do have a bill we're still trying
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:00.480]  to get funding for that creates a mechanism for smart crypto regulation hopefully will
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.880]  be public by the end of the month and we went to FTX for funding for our bill it's like
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:09.840]  $3.6 million to get this bill rolling and through us contacting them is actually how
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:14.080]  we discovered what they were doing with regulation we're trying to create a federal bit license
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.520]  bit license in New York worst piece of crypto regulation in history Sam wanted to control
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:25.440]  and corner the market on licensure for centralization in the United States meaning centralized exchange
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.520]  CEO he gets all the benefits peer-to-peer transactions and anything decentralized will go away and
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  that's really what you know like a hound dog put us on this case in the very beginning and
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.480]  so no we've been told that basically people in Washington thought Sam Bateman Freed was
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.560]  the adult in the room when it came to crypto how ironic right I don't think this would
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:50.760]  set up to be to bring in crypto regulation I think quite the contrary I think him trying
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:54.960]  to set up crypto regulation and then finding out what a scammer he is I think it ultimately
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:59.280]  kind of helps crypto in the end I think we are going to get some smart crypto regulation
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.800]  what we want in crypto is we want the ability for us to have our leaders of our leaders
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:09.000]  in the movement to be able to say their piece about what we feel like things need to look
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.640]  like in crypto at least have a seat at the table that's what my bill basically does
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.880]  however we are going to see on the negative side of this we are going to see Gary Gensler
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:22.240]  in them try to manipulate and use this for their advantage but I want to say this Gary
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.560]  Gensler is the person who has cost more loss in the crypto world than anybody else his
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.560]  entire job at the head of the SEC is to create clarity and crypto regulation that makes sense
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:37.200]  he's done literally zero of that literally zero and what that means is you have companies
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.880]  like FTX that have to operate offshore and escape regulatory compliance here in the United
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:47.360]  States they are going to continue to stay offshore until you create a mechanism that
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.520]  makes sense for crypto regulation so if you really want to go back to who is responsible
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:56.840]  for all of this it's really Gary Gensler with his dereliction of duty as head of the SEC
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.880]  and let's talk more about that on the other side of this break because what I'm seeing
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:07.080]  happening now is whether or not there was an intention at the outset to use this to
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:13.520]  go after crypto regulation this story I think has become such a it's gone from what would
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:21.200]  be a keyhole into political money laundering to now like a three story sliding glass window
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.960]  that even mainstream Republicans who try to be neutral like Greg Abbott are saying hey
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:31.600]  wait a second Democrats money laundering millions maybe billions of dollars and then funding
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:36.800]  their campaigns in the midterms I mean this should be massive criminal investigations and
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:40.080]  whether Republicans involvement too I mean the whole thing should be investigated so
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:45.360]  I want to get your response to that how you think this investigation should go and then
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:48.520]  I mean there are a lot of people listening in right now that have crypto that probably
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.880]  are wondering hey what what is it looking like for us right now we'll get into all of
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:55.560]  that with Ben Armstrong don't go anywhere if you're concerned about the power grid and
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.560]  want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most important
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:06.000]  message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.240]  back in stock these emergency backup systems provide a life-saving backup power when you
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:17.400]  need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:22.880]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:27.360]  whether power grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.960]  through painful power outages again even better all this week radio listeners get over seven
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:38.300]  hundred dollars in free off-the-grid bonuses to go to my solar backup dot com to learn

[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:09.040]  answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.960]  nominee is Donald Trump or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny us Michigan they're
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:18.800]  going to deny us Pennsylvania they're going to deny us Arizona and I can't come to two
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.640]  hundred and seventy electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:30.560]  is an America first majority in every single one of them so we need to keep fighting for
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:36.080]  reform of the system Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else communications

[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:25.640]  or not this entire thing was planned for collapse as the excuse to bring in crypto you know from my experience when they have
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:34.440]  something planned like this as a planned collapse for control they have all their eyes dotted and and T's crossed and they
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:40.480]  did not have it on this deal folks I mean there's real political blowback and there's going to be real political consequences and I
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:46.160]  mean it was just so obvious I mean you can look back and say wow this was so obvious but I mean they steal elections right in the
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.960]  broad of day they make viruses in a lab and release it in the broad of day that's obvious to they get away with it so it's not
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:58.840]  so okay it was obvious well okay they do a lot of things that are obvious but it's it's the direct connection to Ukraine and the
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:05.600]  midterm elections that was so close to the chest you feel like they did not plan on this thing going down so I would air on the
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:12.840]  side of no this is this is a real organic blowback this is real organic pushback this is going to have real organic political
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:20.280]  consequences here and of course the deep state the government's going to try to use it to regulate as well but when it comes to the
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:28.440]  investigation we're with Ben Armstrong here BitBoy Crypto when it comes to the investigation how do you see this going I mean the
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:34.800]  FTX the Almeida people they're already flying all around their jet setting all around they're trying to hide you know that the
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:41.440]  government is going to try to protect its own like like you know Gary deep state Gary so so where do you see this
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:48.760]  investigation going and I mean when is it really going to kick off what do you think it's going to look like yeah well first and
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:54.680]  foremost you know that there's a lot of people have been seeing this sentiment a lot is that well same thing been freed he gave
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:02.080]  so much money to Joe Biden that he's going to get off scot free here don't buy into that same thing been freed screwed and he is
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:09.640]  basically going to end up being the fall guy for this entire thing was he totally responsible for it no is he a bad person yes
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:14.720]  absolutely did he know what was going on yes absolutely did he show no mercy to people consistently throughout the the
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:22.360]  history of FTX absolutely but he wasn't the only one acting here there is another player in this game that people must know
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:28.960]  well there's two really Gary Wang who is a lot of people considered to be kind of the ghost in the machine if you will the
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:36.920]  expert hacker at FTX basically he's someone who you know there's a lot of speculation has CCP ties Gary Wang is someone to
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:43.320]  definitely pay attention to if you went to the FTX page and looked up his bio he's the only person that has his back turned
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:49.680]  to the camera you only see him over the shoulder looking at a computer screen and that tells you anything the second person
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:58.160]  is Dan right Dan Friedberg this guy it was the general counsel for FTX this guy there's Gary Wang right there you can see
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:07.480]  it how how weird is that all the other photos are front-facing when I was kidding so Dan Friedberg he's a general counsel
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:15.240]  for FTX the lawyer for SPF and here's what's so interesting about this guy he's done this model before this isn't if you look
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:22.160]  at the similarities between this and the ultimate bet hokers candle from the early 2000s they recruited fell help you to
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:28.600]  Mike Mattis out to gigantic poker players to promote it and what happened is Dan Friedberg was in charge of setting up the infrastructure
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:34.840]  in the architecture of the shell game who was ultimate bet ultimately kept a lot of that powerful people there from getting in
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:41.720]  trouble what they did was they created a software called God mode where they could see the other players cards they would literally
[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:47.840]  call up these professional poker players and say hey do you want to play heads up 101 and Mike Mattis I would say yeah sure of course and
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:53.520]  then he would go play against these people not knowing they could see his cards from the inside that a lot took a million dollars
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:24:00.520]  from him in these heads up games so this all comes out well Dan Friedberg was in charge of the entire thing he's in charge of the
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:08.800]  general counsel of FTX number one shell game architecture creating all these companies where you can't touch the people at the top that
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:16.760]  was number one number two the idea of being able to look at other players cards in God mode that's what FTX was exactly FTX from the
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:23.000]  inside and Alameda could see all of the customer's trades before they went through they could see where their sell orders were where
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:29.600]  their buy orders were where their leverage was they could see where their you know their liquidation points were they could see it and
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:36.800]  they traded against it number three one of the things is delete all the evidence that's what ultimate bet did well if you look at the
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.920]  giant hack from FTX the other night all the money went to all these places it didn't really make sense because the money trail is not
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:51.000]  what is important FTX was built with a failsafe inside where they could send money out and destroy evidence and destroy you know trails
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:58.160]  that would lead investigators to the ultimate top here and then number four the fourth you know thing they have in common is find a
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:05.720]  fall guy make sure he's responsible for everything and we will dip out Dan Friedberg did not even lose his license in the state of
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:13.000]  New York from the largest poker scandal in history if that tells you anything so these are two players people need to know that are
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.760]  involved in this it's not just SBF SBF is going to take the fall for all of this I mean you know I'm certainly concerned about
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:25.320]  Epstein type situation with him because he knows so much and he's so you know he's so naive and then you start looking into the
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:34.400]  ties of you know whether it's SBF's mom that was you know for a political lobbyist group mind the gap I think it was called Caroline
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:43.200]  Ellison the CEO of Alameda you know she obviously her dad is Greg Ellison who is direct boss to one Gary Gensler at MIT and
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:48.600]  start digging into all those connections you start to find a lot of these people are kind of like their ghosts look into
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:54.800]  Greg Ellison you can't really find anything about this guy who was the leader of the finance at MIT he started figuring out a
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:00.240]  lot of this stuff has been scrubbed intentionally and it continues to be scrubbed that's why we continue to be the mouthpiece of the
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:04.400]  people here make sure that people understand who these characters are but where they're able to scrub their images off the
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:12.120]  internet so then I guess what you're you're kind of leaning into here but we don't have the answer is who is the wolf of
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:21.880]  crypto who is the wolf of FTX and we don't know because the wolf is like an apparition it's just nobody's real nobody really is
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:27.400]  the wolf you look and you climb the ladders and it's just oh there's nothing here it's another ghost so they got that
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:33.160]  they were doing was illegal correct oh absolutely that what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to pin it on
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.520]  what they're calling the gang of four which is Caroline Ellison Sam bankman freed Gary Wang and I believe Amy Wu is the
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:45.320]  fourth piece there they're going to try to tie those people together and say they were responsible for everything while
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:50.240]  you're Dan Friedberg's and whoever's above him get off Scott free and we get we're allowed that not to happen
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:56.520]  well let me let me pause you right there because that's where I wanted to go next and this was I was first doing my my
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:03.080]  commentary on this last night because again I'm not really the crypto guy so I had to do a lot of digging just to
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:08.840]  kind of get a better understanding of this but my initial response I was saying last night was clearly freedmen and
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:14.520]  that the people you just mentioned clearly they've been set up as fall guys from the very beginning they've been
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:20.240]  propped up as fall guys I mean no offense to freedmen and the girl but I mean look you take one look at them folks
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.240]  they're probably not all there I mean I'm not trying to be rude but they're probably on a spectrum they probably maybe
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.640]  have some learning disabilities or something they're not well it's interesting you mentioned that it's
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:34.160]  interesting you mentioned that because there's actually a lot of evidence that points back to all these people met
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.560]  it's more called the the Center for Autistic Effectiveness or something like that if people really want to start
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.480]  digging off you know pulling on that thread you'll find that it was almost like all of these people came
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:50.480]  together at the same time it was orchestrated even before any of this was launched well let's dig into that we're
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:55.480]  about to go to break here in 60 seconds but I mean again I'm not trying to be rude I've got friends that have
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:00.480]  had learning disabilities and everything but I mean you can tell I mean you can tell they have tics they
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:07.480]  have certain mannerisms even sometimes affiliate physiology they have them all and so you look at this now and
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:13.480]  now that you're realizing hey wait a second they were propped up as the face they were propped up as the
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:17.720]  guys here but now you're looking behind you're saying wait a second they were just fall guys they probably
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:21.880]  couldn't have come up with this on their own they couldn't have financed all of this on their own they
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:26.200]  didn't have the experience they didn't have the connections now you start digging you find out okay here
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.520]  are the connections here are the people with experience and now here they are being set up
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:36.600]  personal so I mean really it's even worse folks we're not talking about just normal Ponzi schemes money
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:42.520]  laundering political influence now we're talking about these same people taking advantage of potentially
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:49.240]  impaired and disabled people so I mean this is about as evil as it gets and of course there it is all
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:53.560]  tied into the midterm elections and war in Ukraine it's the same it's just the same crap we deal
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.720]  with if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid

[02:32:53.400 --> 02:33:00.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:17.880]  and now the tip of the spear wielding the fight to take back the nation it's
[02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:26.200]  olyn treuer you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:32.520]  well of course ben armstrong from bitboycrypto.com has all the information here every angle that i
[02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:38.120]  go to he already has the info and so i just want to kind of retouch on the issue of the fall guys
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:45.080]  here because i think it really illustrates the next level of evil we're dealing with we're not
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:51.320]  dealing with some maybe some younger people some innovators that get involved with a trending
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:55.400]  thing right now like cryptocurrency and find ways to make money or maybe they think they're
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.760]  going to spread the wealth or whatever maybe they think it's good causes they're helping to
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:06.920]  no clearly there were people on top of them using them leading them on and again you just take one
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:12.600]  look at these individuals that are going to be used as the fall guys now and and maybe successfully
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:17.080]  so and it was pretty obvious so let's just talk about that one more time here who you think is
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:21.960]  going to be the fall boy why you think it was always set up that way but do you think that
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:27.000]  that's how it's going to finish up or will the real criminals be uh involved in the investigations
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:33.160]  here as well yeah that's a great question um you know i certainly think that you know one thing
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:40.360]  that's different now than uh you know scandals in the past is the voice of social media is so
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:44.840]  amplified now now of course there's deep political corruption you can't really touch right but when
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:49.720]  it comes to these criminal cases especially something that you know definitely looks like uh
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:55.320]  you know it was not meant to happen you know like you said it wasn't pre-planned out for regulation
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:58.920]  it doesn't look like they're going to use it for that but it looks like there were some big mistakes
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:04.840]  made here is that our voice on amplifying the criminals involved in this like your Dan Freedbergs
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:10.760]  and your Gary Wings i think it's enough to put push these people into the spotlight and you think
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:16.280]  you know uh you know pressure pressure is going to be felt uh by Gary Gensler you know he's going
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.440]  to feel the pressure we've already got Tom Emmer out there talking about having hearings questioning
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.320]  him about his meetings with SPF he's got a lot of egg on his face and so he's going to be really
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:31.560]  amped up to try to make sure that there are some fall guys not just SPF because if SPF is the only
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:37.720]  fall guy if SPF is the only villain here then how bad does Gary Gensler look and so he's but having
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:42.920]  meetings with him time after time one of only basically two people uh Joseph Lubin of uh you
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.400]  know consensus another guy who has been able to meet with Gary Gensler you can't just call Gary
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:52.280]  Gensler and get on the list so the fact that SPF was of that level and having these kinds of meetings
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:56.920]  with him i think it really shows uh you know the the lack of judgment from Gary Gensler and he's
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.720]  going to be really itching to nail people down for this so i think i do want to make one correction
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:08.920]  here uh there is an account on twitter called uh autism capital uh and that supposedly is ran
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:14.680]  by Sam and also some of his buddies that works there uh what i was actually referring to earlier
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.440]  where all four of the founders of FTX met it was actually the center for effective altruism not
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.000]  autism altruism they did all meet there and somebody's laid out a pretty interesting scenario
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.200]  it's kind of like almost like the the movie 21 of the card counting scandal where basically a teacher
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:34.600]  tied together all of these uh you know people are able to count cards and pull them into its
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:40.920]  criminal scheme uh that maybe that center for effective altruism was used as a lynchman to
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.400]  bring all of these people in uh that had you know not all of them have autism but we do believe
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.880]  you know probably carolina in SPF and like you said you know it just is what it is i mean we're
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:55.080]  not trying to to you know put front of these people what we're saying is they were very easily
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.920]  used by people in power and people with authority so i wonder when you look and when you listen to
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.880]  SPF some of the things that he said especially if you look at you know this this clip of him with
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:11.640]  tom brady like it looks really it's really hard to believe that this was the guy who was in power
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.680]  in charge of the whole thing when you listen to clips of him talk about altruism and wanting
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:22.040]  good and wanting effectiveness you know it really makes you wonder like somewhere deep within that
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.080]  center for effective altruism was this basically brainwashed into these people's heads so you
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:30.600]  could get out and say the right talking point meanwhile the people behind the scenes were
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:36.920]  doing all the dirty work yeah and you know it's interesting too because you wonder how much
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:43.240]  he was aware of what he was doing was illegal you wonder of how much you know he was told
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:47.800]  oh you'll be fine oh don't worry about it oh we've got your back whatever and then the people that
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:52.840]  end up you know disappearing stabbing him in the back it's interesting though he did he did flee to
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:58.200]  the Bahamas that was probably a decision that he made whether or not that was for to go down there
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:01.560]  and do something or he just thought i need to get out of the states because i'm about to be
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:09.320]  arrested or investigated uh we may not know but i mean moving forward i see a situation here where
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:16.360]  if i am his lawyer that would be my play i would say hey look i've got a client here who suffers
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:23.320]  from a learning disability or has some sort of um you know spectrum autism here and he was taken
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.360]  advantage of and so we want the individuals that took advantage and to be called the task here
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.400]  i don't know how much of this you know spf will be thinking about but that would be my play as the
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:39.000]  lawyer because i mean that is it i think that that's a real element of this not to get him off the
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.880]  hook but just to say hey let's you know let's look at all the players yeah man like you look at look
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:49.160]  at you know jeffrey dommer they they try for the insanity plea i mean it's a good way to go to be
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:54.040]  able to try to not get the harshest uh you know sentence or consequence you can get and in this
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:59.640]  case it actually be used as a way to point fingers above above him and i think that this is really
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:05.880]  where it gets kind of dark because we're looking at spf being portrayed as the fall guy here
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:12.120]  here and you're looking at if you were really to point fingers at the people behind the scenes
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:17.560]  that were really running this what kind of jeopardy does that put his life in yeah you know like they
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:22.600]  can certainly use this angle of i was used but at some point you gotta say who was using you
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.600]  and when you go up the ladder so far you know as well as i know you like there's some names on my
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:30.600]  channel y'all are a little braver than me there's some names on my channel i won't say uh because
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.520]  i've got a family and uh you know i i don't want to see myself get obscene or made unalive uh so
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:41.000]  because of that like there's only so so many things that i can actually put out there if you
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.640]  start going down this rabbit trail and really who's in charge of all this thing it could get
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:51.720]  pretty scary and pretty deep when you start really touching on the ukrainian situation i shared a
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:57.480]  new york times article from i believe april 2021 on my twitter last night you really start getting
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:03.960]  into how the ukrainian government is tied in with a top crypto exchange and how easy the money
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:07.400]  laundering is and then you look at some of the things they actually brag about doing in that
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.600]  new york times article it gets very dark very quick and so i definitely think you know watching
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:17.240]  that pipeline of money in between ukraine united states it is something to watch and really when
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:22.120]  you here's one thing that people really have to understand we we have a video that we've been
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:29.720]  showing um on various articles of uh dan friedberg explaining that they literally counterfeited
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:34.840]  tokens on the exchanges when you really start looking at how these flywheel coins were set up
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:39.880]  how they counterfeited tokens and then the money that was given to the democratic party
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:47.000]  joe biden specifically what you realize is they found a mechanism to print money out of nothing
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.200]  to make political donations with and that's not even counting the money laundering aspect of this
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:59.480]  so you're looking in my opinion you're looking at counterfeiting tax evasion uh riko laws racketeering
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.000]  when you really start adding up all the laws that were broken here i mean this is going to turn out
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.400]  to be a very massive case well and you get into that i want to come back and get into the ukrainian
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.880]  issue on the other side but when you get into the idea here and i you know maybe there's an
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:17.880]  analogy but for people to understand i mean folks they literally made up a currency they literally
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:23.960]  made up a cryptocurrency that was their own in-house exchange currency and they knew that
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:29.240]  they were just going to use it to inflate the value of their currency and then to basically
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.720]  launder money in and out inflating the value with every transaction as you mentioned earlier
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:39.640]  and so again now you go back to is that really sbf's idea was that really ellison's idea or was that
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:44.360]  a master money launderer who gave them that idea and said this is how we're going to do it
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:50.200]  yeah well i my best guess is dan freeberg is the architect here he's the mastermind behind
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:56.040]  all of this and like i said we know this because the ftx game when you really look at it it looks
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:01.800]  different it's package different but it's the exact same game the ultimate bet used previously
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.680]  about 20 years earlier so when you really break that down it makes sense that he's the puppet master
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:12.840]  that the question is is there someone above him because you're right i mean it just doesn't really
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:18.120]  seem like all of a sudden you know sbf just came up with all these ideas usually when you have an
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:23.480]  exchange here's what's unique about ftx when you have an exchange that creates its own token uh like
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:28.680]  bnb for binance uh if for example it does something like when it was first launched on
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:34.440]  binance you've got utility you got cheaper trading fees for using that coin to pay your
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.920]  trading fees with a more natural way to inflate the price i guess you could say we're supposed to
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:45.160]  the fdt it never did a single thing it had zero utility on the platform i mean they're basically
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:50.680]  selling the equivalent of plastic coins and diamonds folks i mean it'd be like a kitty toy a
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:43:00.120]  plastic gold coins that you sold for real money i'm pointing my finger at you and i'm also pointing

[02:46:54.600 --> 02:47:06.440]  right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:32.920]  final segment here with ben armstrong bitboycrypto.com on twitter at under a bitboy underscore
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:41.960]  crypto a couple other questions i have for him here now in dealing with ukraine and we have some
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:47.480]  of the numbers they say i think was 40 million dollars to democrats 200 000 to republicans
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:53.720]  there's some other numbers we see going out as well but i looking more into this i don't think
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:57.960]  this is the full picture i don't think we're getting the full story here because when you hear the
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:04.520]  numbers of 1 billion 2 billion uh in supposed capital that they had 400 million or 40 million
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.720]  rather is barely a drop in the bucket i feel that they would have reached in with a much larger
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:15.160]  scoop if you will than just a little 40 million do you think we're getting the full numbers do
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:20.200]  you think we're getting the full story as far as how much money was actually laundered and spent
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.080]  during these midterms or do you think there's still more to be discovered here no i mean i
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:30.600]  certainly think that there is a lot more to be discovered here i think one thing that's really
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:35.720]  interesting when you when you start digging into this and you start realizing um you know how long
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:43.160]  this could have potentially uh been going on when you look at how much money was raised in crypto alone
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:52.040]  for the the war there in ukraine um it's 135 million dollars and when you start thinking about that
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  you start wondering okay how much of this money actually came from uh you know how much of this
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:02.760]  money actually came from ftx and around about way uh the total amount that they raised in fiat
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:08.360]  for the ukrainian effort uh this article goes back is a coin desk article uh back in june
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:15.240]  was about 600 million dollars do you think about 25 percent of uh those of that money raised
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:21.080]  came in through crypto at a time when crypto was dropping dramatically making it much less
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:27.880]  advantageous for someone to send crypto as opposed to sending uh you know fiat or or us dollars so i
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:32.920]  think really digging into these numbers and especially when you say okay 40 million versus
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:39.000]  200 000 that doesn't sound quite accurate so i think this these are things i'm actually this is
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:44.040]  something i'm on the investigation trail of right now uh people can tell from this uh this new york
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:49.080]  times article i posted last time on twitter that i referenced uh you know i'm starting to really get
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:54.120]  into this ukrainian angle and trying to figure out what happened here because look at this point
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:59.160]  i don't think there's anybody out there that believes that this did not happen it is just a
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:03.880]  matter of trying to figure out the trail of where what money went where who it came back to
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:08.920]  in the amount uh is definitely something that uh you know we got to start looking into and
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:14.600]  there's something i'm digging into now and of course it was our government uh washington dc
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:21.400]  the white house that said no no no no no we're not gonna be no but no oversight of the funds no
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.160]  oversight no audit to the funds we're sending all the money to ukrain you don't get to know where it
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:32.280]  goes none of that oh okay maybe now we know why um who are the victims of this crime ben
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:37.400]  i mean the victims of this crime are the holders you know the victims of this kind of people that
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:43.640]  have funds left on ftx and not just ftx but also the the companies that have been left in the wake
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.960]  including block five and other large lending platform here in the united states that you know
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:53.480]  tons of large your anthony pompaliano's and your petam or cornix a lot of your really large kind of
[02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:59.960]  bitcoin primarily influencers we're really saying you know graham staff and andre geeks and mainstream
[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:05.160]  meet kevin mainstream my uh financial uh youtubers that aren't even in crypto we're pushing this
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.400]  platform so heavily and once again i says on my show earlier like i don't blame these people for
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:14.520]  doing it it seemed like it was very safe but how much money now has been lost and locked on these
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:19.800]  platforms because people were 100 behind them i think the really important lesson for us going
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:25.320]  forward here in crypto is there's not a platform you can trust 100 percent at the end of the day
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:30.120]  the retail investors are always the ones that get stuck with these bills we are seeing of course a
[02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:33.400]  lot of the hedge funds there have been hedge funds have been absolutely decimated by this too
[02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:38.280]  which is another reason why you know that this wasn't pre-planned out in my opinion because
[02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:43.320]  the hedge funds the institutional money was in lockdown right so the fact that they've lost
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:47.480]  i mean there was a big one um a guy that came out travis cling a guy that was in charge of a big
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:52.680]  hedge fund today said all their capital was locked up in an ftx you're going to see a lot of reverberating
[02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:58.120]  effects but ultimately as always the losers in this are the people the people of crypto the people
[02:51:58.120 --> 02:52:02.120]  that have bought into something that's bigger than themselves the people that bought into the
[02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:07.240]  idea of decentralization and the crypto is really a better way for us to do things and at the end
[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:12.280]  of the day we've now watched it burn to the ground and it's up to us the people that have a voice in
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:17.160]  the space to pick it back up and to move forward and to assure people that we're not going to let
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:23.320]  this happen again we can't let and here's the real problem the real problem is allowing the stock
[02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:29.480]  market 2.0 people to come into crypto we've got to create alliances that keep these people out
[02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:34.120]  and push people towards more decentralized platforms uh you know it look if you're a trader
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:38.680]  you're going to have to use an exchange at some point that's a necessary evil so there are exchanges
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:44.280]  that we do support that we think are okay but we're never going to give 100 confidence in anything
[02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:49.080]  again well and my final question for you was going to be what is the state of crypto but let me just
[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:56.600]  ask you one more one more thing quickly here the fact that of all the different cryptocurrencies
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:53:02.280]  and all the different trends and all the different hype and excitement and everything it was ftx and
[02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:08.600]  sbf that were really the only ones introduced by the establishment embraced by the establishment
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:13.960]  sold to you by the establishment what does that tell you yeah well that tells me that's somebody
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:18.840]  we should be wary of someone we should be very scared of look crypto was created bitcoin was
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:24.840]  created in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis where basically we were forced to bail out banks
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:29.720]  with our money we pay taxes once and we had to bail them out twice and and it was a reaction to
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:33.880]  that like we should be our own banks we should be able to make our own decisions with our money
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:38.040]  not allow the government to just move it around and do whatever it wants and we all know the fiat
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:43.560]  system is going to burn down 100% it's just a matter of time i believe usdc is going to become
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:48.200]  the digital dollar it's going to kick the can down the road but ultimately you just can't print money
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:52.200]  out of nothing and this is a lesson we've learned with ftx you can't just print money out of nothing
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:57.080]  for no reason there's no way that is a viable strategy for the long term so eventually it is
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:02.120]  it is going to burn down um you know in that respect but when you have the government the very
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:07.480]  people that you don't trust so much you created cryptocurrency out of telling you hey these are
[02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:11.640]  the guys you know you got kevin lear kevin oliri on stage saying well you know it and once again
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:16.440]  don't play kevin oliri but coming out and saying well there's one safe place you can you can know
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:20.760]  with your crypto it's definitely ftx you know everything's going to be fine you know we bought
[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:25.720]  into that establishment lie and we have to reject that and crypto we do a pretty good job of being
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:31.080]  skeptical and rejecting uh those types of behaviors but this one here for some reason got under all
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:36.600]  of our noses and we didn't see it all right and just finally what do you see the state of crypto
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:43.080]  right now yeah the the state of crypto is here's what's funny what's funny is i'm what we call a
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:48.440]  a strict four-year fundamentalist four-year cycle fundamentalist in bitcoin we look back at the
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:54.120]  history of bitcoin there's been a constant four-year cycle it's you have an event called
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:57.720]  the bitcoin halving which basically cuts the production of bitcoin in half right now the
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:03.320]  average of 900 bitcoin created per day in 2024 that number is going to get cut down to 450 per day
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:10.440]  you have that halving event they were in 2012 2016 and 2020 that halving event leads to one and a half
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:17.640]  years of parabolic upward action one year of a gigantic 85 drop one and a half years of slowly
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:22.840]  rebuilding towards the halving we are right on track nothing that's happened in the macro nothing
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:29.320]  with inflation nothing with ukraine nothing with this event so far has got us off track i've said
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:35.080]  since the beginning of this year that we should see the bottom of bitcoin at the end of november
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:39.880]  to the middle of december sometime in that range based on the history of bitcoin we're still right
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:44.120]  on track for that bitcoin is still holding very well we do think is going to probably drop somewhere
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:51.800]  between 10 12 000 but unless we break that trend then we were to go say maybe below 8 000 there's
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:56.920]  no reason to think that we're going to see anything different in this cycle every single cycle whether
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:01.400]  it's around the halving or around or the all-time highs around the bear market you always hear people
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:07.160]  say it's different this time look at the macro environment or look at this or look at that
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:13.000]  and what we found in crypto is bitcoin just keeps doing the same thing over and over and over again
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:17.880]  the entire industry is pulled by bitcoin obviously because even in times like this
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.000]  by everything else is burning around it bitcoin is still fine but the prices and the liquidations
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.120]  and the mass selling may come and may send the price down so really guys like you is a good thing
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:35.960]  what's that when the price gets low well yeah it is but it's not certainly look we like to
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:40.280]  accumulate at lower prices but i'm for the people like i like when people win like is that all about
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:45.880]  my personal portfolio and making money i like it when people get into crypto and they win and then
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:49.720]  they start sticking around for the ideals and the philosophies you know we say when you come for the
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:53.880]  money in the lambos but you stick around because you love decentralized well that's why i'm so glad
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:56:58.280]  we got you on today because you're one of the few out there that i think keeps it level and keeps it

[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:12.520]  because 1776 by the way i'm gonna i'm gonna be 76 of my own later this month when i was a kid yeah i
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:20.120]  grew up in the i was born in the brothel there for quite a while and i grew up enough there and um
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:30.360]  i was so out of control i was the youngest of five i'm born 1946 right at the height america's
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:37.800]  at its height you know right after world war two and they used to say to me your little s o b you're
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:46.120]  not going to make it till 21 i heard that i heard that almost in times 21 the trouble i used to get
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:54.920]  into the stuff i used to pull anyway going back to the markets um here's the deal
[03:01:54.920 --> 03:02:07.400]  deal after 40 in term election the s and p 500 has gone up
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:18.680]  some um let's see 15 percent
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:24.440]  in the following 12 months
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:35.000]  so those are the fat and the midterm elections didn't come out the way the repulsive games thought
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:38.760]  they would so
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:45.080]  again you can't forecast this because the game is real
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:51.160]  and the thing called a punch protection team the markets go down too deep they pump the
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:03:00.760]  markets up better reserve so the trend line is though that the markets are going to go up
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:12.520]  and gold gold is at 1776 the spirit is 76 we have forecast and the trends generally gold
[03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:23.160]  hit its bottom a couple of weeks ago now you're also hearing more and more about the fed banksters
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:32.680]  lowering or not raising interest rates as much as they said that they would so here we go
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:41.720]  fed vice chair brainhardt says it may soon be appropriate to move to slower pace of rate
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:48.920]  height better reserve vice chair lial brainhardt brain dead brainhardt brain dead
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:56.600]  member of the club boy they put this picture up of her on cnbc i mean she got rings on every
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:02.520]  finger she got one on a thumb what's the model look at this anyway she um
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:11.640]  he's saying that they uh they could slow down the pace of its interest rate increases
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:22.440]  now let's put this into perspective you have a 17 a 7.7 percent
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:33.640]  seven point seven percent inflation rate what do you have like a three five three seven five
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:41.320]  interest rate your interest rates are in negative territory got it
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:48.920]  and now they're not going to raise them that much
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:53.320]  so they can keep artificially pumping up the economy
[03:04:56.920 --> 03:05:02.680]  i'm pointing my finger at you and i'm also pointing right back at myself you forget to
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:07.320]  take your multivitamins you forget to take your vitamin d3 you forget to take your brain force

[03:05:47.240 --> 03:06:08.520]  the answer to 1984 116 your listening to xjohn show with gerald salente
[03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:25.000]  hey great pinani alex jones show as we're saying um you know it's a uh the markets are rigged
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:33.160]  and everybody has to get that that um they're gonna do everything they can to keep
[03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:39.800]  keep the interest rates going up uh going lower rather and pump up the economy so that's where
[03:06:39.800 --> 03:06:47.400]  you see it going and you look at what's going on with oil price it's very important to take a global
[03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:58.040]  nomic view to look at the future and that means what the world is going on people just concentrate
[03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:04.280]  on what's going on in the united states how about what's going on in china
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:12.280]  they got their zero covid policy they were taking it off later this week earlier this week
[03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:17.400]  well the other last week and now they're you know they're going to make travel easier
[03:07:18.280 --> 03:07:21.880]  they weren't eliminating it and now the case rate is going up
[03:07:21.880 --> 03:07:27.640]  so now they're imposing more covid restrictions
[03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:37.800]  this is hurting not only the chinese economy but everybody that sells to the chinese
[03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:41.320]  so now you look at Brent crude prices
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:49.000]  and the oil prices are going down because the economy is slowing down
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:57.720]  China is the second largest economy in the world this is big is 1.4 billion people what
[03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:01.240]  do we got over here we don't even have for the point for
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:13.240]  we got what 332 million so if they're cutting back on their spending they're cutting back
[03:08:13.240 --> 03:08:19.960]  on their manufacturing this is serious now we take a trip to europe
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:25.640]  remember when bs biden said we're going to punish Putin
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:32.680]  and by punishing Putin by putting the sanctions on russia
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:36.440]  they punish the people
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:44.440]  the energy prices in europe are skyrocketing
[03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:53.080]  you're looking at over a hundred thousand small and medium-sized businesses in new york
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:59.320]  going out of excuse me in italy going out of business
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:05.480]  new york new york is nothing compared to where there's some hot spots in new york you know east
[03:09:05.480 --> 03:09:10.200]  side west side down the villages you know but the rest of it nothing compared to what it was
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:18.440]  this cold war has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people and now the
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:30.280]  ukraine war with the sanctions if the united states and nato did not keep funding the ukraine war
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:39.160]  war it would have been over a long time ago the sanctions would be off it would be over
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:44.760]  people wouldn't care you think people really care about what was going on between ukraine and russia
[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:51.480]  i mean there you got it europe's energy crisis
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:57.480]  again they're doing us a propaganda they've been doing it all our life
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:02.760]  they're taking down a statue of catrin degrade over there in odessa
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:08.280]  place where she founded they said back in what 1750 because they hate her
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:14.200]  you mean it's been going on between 1750 between the russians and the u kranians
[03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:18.840]  and you want me to get involved in it as an american i saw some clown boy yesterday
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:24.520]  going to drive him by holding up a sign support ukraine hey you want to go support ukraine
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:27.960]  go over there and support them send your money leave me out of it
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:33.400]  there were protests going on all across europe
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:41.240]  last week over a hundred thousand italians took to the streets
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:45.640]  they don't want to send any more armaments any more money
[03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:50.600]  money because
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:11:03.720]  they're going out of business they can't afford to pay for their gas and oil
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:14.040]  and now the bragging over and by the way who bombed this Nord Stream pipeline
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:23.320]  the Swedes did a study on it and refuse refuse to provide the information
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:30.840]  again there you have it the protests going on one after another but nothing in the united states
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:40.200]  it's the dead woke america no protests again i had to occupy peace rally here
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:48.600]  and um and judge napolitano scott ridder gary know filled your elderly no coverage at all
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:57.400]  pieces of dirty word so going back to putting this all together you're going to see a new world
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:04.440]  disorder when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it america had an
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:14.840]  election it was worthless the demo craps or the repulsive games you know the difference over there
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:22.680]  in europe is new third parties the old ones getting pushed out not everywhere but in a lot of places
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:32.440]  and here is the same crime syndicate that's been run the show for what the last hundred
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:36.840]  and something years it's almost impossible to get on a ballot
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:49.320]  yep americans are prepared for the worst oh oh uh bezos gave uh dolly pot and what a hundred million
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:54.840]  dollars i looked up how much is she worth 350 million he gave her a hundred million
[03:12:55.640 --> 03:13:03.560]  hey how about some money for occupied peace peace the hell with you salenti no peace
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:12.440]  what kind of jerk are you we only give our money to the club
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:21.400]  oh and they all promoted the vax i remember dolly parton i love the vax i love the vax yeah
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:27.080]  one after another george carlin said it was big one big club and you ain't in it
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:37.560]  a hundred million bucks not a penny for peace from any of these billionaires all they do is
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:45.240]  support the war machine hey bezos go fight all you guys in war war go fight
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:48.040]  yep

[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:02.600]  so anyway going back to the economy all things are connected
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:11.240]  this thing's going down big and hard now winter's coming you're gonna see energy prices skyrocket
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:21.880]  yep and you can see the effects like they say amazon's ready to lay off what thousands of
[03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:33.960]  employees facebook or meta excuse me yeah matter matter guts one after another every week in the

[03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:06.600]  sexist we should not call it misinformation anymore we should call it gender information

[03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:33.640]  they don't teach trend forecasting at harvard princeton yale oxford cambridge none of them
[03:21:33.640 --> 03:21:40.120]  you know why they don't know how to do it yeah but you can get a degree in history yeah we'll
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:44.200]  give you some baloney that will make up that you will tell you happened years ago
[03:21:47.320 --> 03:21:52.920]  now i had a buddy up here the other week this weekend and we're talking about how you know
[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:58.280]  we don't know anything about the future and i looked up i said you know when the when they
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:04.520]  first the first skull they you know they say the world all began like you know like you know like
[03:22:04.520 --> 03:22:11.720]  what 1500 years ago some stoop you know why don't i you know some stupid number you know
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:25.800]  2 000 years ago 2022 and uh i think the skull they found was like 230 000 years old in other
[03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:35.880]  words we don't have a clue and they distort history and one of the great distortions you're seeing
[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:42.120]  right in front of your eyes right now is that they blame certain things like the mental illness of
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:49.720]  children again an article in this week's trends journal the failure of children in school
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:58.680]  school the amount of suicides the increases of crime
[03:23:00.840 --> 03:23:09.400]  they blame it quote on the pandemic no no not the pandemic blame it on the politicians that
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:18.440]  locked everything down i asked my friends and people i know how many people do you know know
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:24.040]  that died of covid remember they're calling it a pandemic how many people do you know
[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:30.360]  well uh i don't know anybody but uh a friend of mine's friend's friend you know that kind of stuff
[03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:37.720]  or i knew someone was 88 years old yeah the average age in america is 78 okay of death
[03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:45.560]  death age of men 88 who had a good run would live forever if it was in covid would live to
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:53.720]  180 so i'm saying they distort history they don't talk about trends and that's why
[03:23:53.720 --> 03:23:59.800]  i want to continue to talk about the importance of the geopolitical trends taking place
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:07.560]  and of course the biggest one right on the scale right now is what's going on over there in ukraine
[03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:14.680]  and today the ukrainian president the guy that used to play a comedian on tv
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:23.560]  and his role on tv was playing the president of ukraine in a sitcom and used to and he played
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:29.480]  the piano with his penis i'm not making that up and then he becomes the president of ukraine
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:39.400]  yet that guy uh vladimir zolensky he made his first visit to kerson where they they're taking over
[03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:44.200]  part of where russia pulled back and he hailed the russian withdrawal quote
[03:24:46.600 --> 03:24:50.200]  yep there he is as the beginning of the end of the war
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:59.800]  this is the beginning of the end of the war we are step by step coming to all the temporarily
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:11.960]  occupied territories you know what that is what are you kidding me he just took back that much
[03:25:11.960 --> 03:25:27.080]  russia still has over 20 percent there he is that's him isn't that great that's who's running the show
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:33.400]  play in the penis with it play in the piano with his penis not making this up
[03:25:33.400 --> 03:25:42.680]  he's some jerk off over there in ukraine these these are who's running our country
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:46.520]  it's no different you got little chucky schuma
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:55.880]  mitch mcconnell cat got more chins in china town lowlife lindsey graham
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:04.760]  adams ship i can't spell it right but there's an snh in there too
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:14.280]  one little jerk after another that is global you got that little katsuo microne over there
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:22.280]  in france and nothing of a boy with an arrogant attitude the world is going down big time which
[03:26:22.280 --> 03:26:29.240]  goes back to me with gold gold and i don't give financial advice is the number one safe haven asset
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:31.000]  and i believe the prices of bottom
[03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:40.360]  and now they're talking about not raising interest rates i just read you the article
[03:26:42.680 --> 03:26:47.320]  as rapidly as they said they were going to and it's still very low compared to inflation
[03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:52.680]  that means inflation is going to keep going up but the dollar is going to get weaker
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:58.600]  and they're doing this too because the dollar is only getting strong because the other currencies
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:04.360]  are so weak so the higher the interest rates go the stronger the dollar goes but the deeper all
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:10.280]  the other world economies go down because they have a lot of money borrowed in dollar dollar debt
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:18.680]  so the lower their currency goes the more they have to pay back and they can't afford to do it
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:23.880]  so they're not raising interest rates because the whole global economy is going down
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:30.760]  and that's what you have to focus on this is deadly serious
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:45.080]  France Spain Greece Italy Bulgaria one Czech Republic one country after another major demonstrations
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:53.560]  people but Belgium taking to the streets but not in America no no no no no no no no no
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:28:01.960]  it's dead woke dead woke swallow the crap if you don't swallow my crap then i don't like you
[03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:10.360]  that's the america of today so it's important to take a global nomic view and all things are connected
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:15.880]  or as they said all things are connected like the blood which unites us all said chief seattle
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:22.600]  we can't call him an indian anymore either no at least not from india indigenous don't

[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:12.360]  for the average person 63 percent of americans are living paycheck to paycheck
[03:35:15.160 --> 03:35:20.040]  and now on the war machine front i was talking about what's going on with china when all else

[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:34.840]  and by the way people have no idea the history of what we're not the basic or formosa at one time
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:37.800]  that's the portuguese name that when i was a kid i remember that name

[03:35:48.040 --> 03:35:56.200]  a tough time getting chips when all those fails they take you to war so now the taiwan war is
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:03.720]  going to heat up they're gonna overtake it again people have no idea how did taiwan get to where
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:09.880]  it is or the guy running the show before the communist overtook it chan kai shek him and those
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:20.360]  people they left and they went to taiwan the united states by the way has sent 10 billion dollars of
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:27.480]  our money this the plantation workers of slave landia our money for military equipment
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:35.560]  for taiwan to fight china taiwan is one of the richest countries in asia it may be the richest
[03:36:37.240 --> 03:36:43.800]  and tens of billions of dollars they got more on the chart that are going to taiwan
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:51.560]  enriching the military industrial complex and biden says we're going to defend taiwan
[03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:57.240]  oh yeah you did a great job defending you did a great job in north korea in the korean war

[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:45.880]  talking about what's going on you know the the dow is up it's a hundred and something points before
[03:48:45.880 --> 03:48:51.720]  i got on the air and now it's down so they're going to do what they can to keep the equity
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:49:00.840]  markets going up end of story and the inflation is way worse than what they're saying when you go
[03:49:00.840 --> 03:49:06.760]  to ice subscribe to it actually john william's shadow stats they rigged the numbers back in the
[03:49:06.760 --> 03:49:12.920]  late 70s early 80s so they wouldn't have to pay us more social security because social security
[03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:18.920]  went up according to the consumer price index so they took out like housing prices i think the
[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:27.320]  average house of a price now uh average price of a home now is almost 400 000 dollar 400 000
[03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:33.800]  dollar that and you saw them go up like 26 38 percent when the covid war happened that's not
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:39.800]  included in inflation price of stake went up no no no people change their eating habits so we
[03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:46.920]  don't put it in there it's a rigged game going back to the markets they're going to do everything
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:52.840]  they can to keep the markets going and we have a great article in here in the trends journal
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:50:00.120]  going out tomorrow by gregory manorino about how the these interest rates are going to do nothing
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:07.480]  nothing to affect inflation and the bs they keep throwing out there's all inflations going down
[03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:14.280]  it's going down but look how high it is look how high the number is
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:20.760]  was our prices aren't going back to where they were
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:29.240]  there's still way up there oh lumber prices went down 45 yeah but how much are they higher than
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:35.400]  they were before the covid war so it's a cheap money game
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:46.120]  and they're going to keep pumping in the cheap money to keep the scheme going particularly in europe
[03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:57.080]  they have inflation over 10 percent in europe over 10 percent what's the interest rate
[03:50:57.080 --> 03:51:06.120]  1.5 oh they aggressively raised them 75 basis points twice what are you talking to
[03:51:06.120 --> 03:51:11.720]  i mean aggressively ready they said when inflation had 2 percent they'd be raising interest rates
[03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:14.120]  oh yeah but they said inflation wasn't coming
[03:51:17.560 --> 03:51:18.680]  you see where this is going
[03:51:18.680 --> 03:51:28.200]  they're going to do everything they can to artificially prop up the markets so what does that
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:34.600]  mean more inflation and a declining economy because as they raise interest rates even
[03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:39.560]  they're going to put more people out of work again every week in the trends journal we have the job
[03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:58.440]  layoffs astounding astounding so again when inflation goes up goal goes up when economies
[03:51:58.440 --> 03:52:06.600]  go down goal goes up when interest rates go way up goal goes down because the value of the dollar
[03:52:06.600 --> 03:52:16.280]  increases and gold is dollar base so people around the world can't buy it but you look we did an
[03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:22.120]  article in last week's trends journal about all the central banksters that are buying gold
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:28.120]  and then going back to the picture i was talking about before
[03:52:28.120 --> 03:52:37.640]  i told you about tens of thousands of italians take to the streets in opposition to arms shipments
[03:52:37.640 --> 03:52:46.360]  to ukraine you don't have that here and it's one after another the protests going on i mentioned
[03:52:46.360 --> 03:52:56.120]  belgium i mentioned germany i mentioned greece i mentioned france and again for all different
[03:52:56.120 --> 03:53:08.040]  reasons but the bottom line is money poland vulgaria this inflation is destroying people
[03:53:08.760 --> 03:53:18.200]  and is brought to you by the morons and imbeciles that put in sanctions against russia
[03:53:18.200 --> 03:53:25.320]  this is hardly making the it doesn't make the american news hardly at all you got to go look for it
[03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:35.720]  tens of thousands of protesters march to morse off riding in polis independence day
[03:53:37.640 --> 03:53:39.080]  and you know what they have concerns about
[03:53:39.080 --> 03:53:46.600]  you're against the european union and against immigration
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:56.280]  an italian doctor stopped by a guy from italy on saturday
[03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:01.800]  and he was telling me how terribly immigration issue is in italy
[03:54:04.200 --> 03:54:06.920]  and how low the country's going and how fast it's going down
[03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:08.840]  and how the culture's dying
[03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:18.760]  you haven't seen anything yet it's the new world disorder
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:28.120]  people are protesting against sending arms shipments to ukraine as their country's going down
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:33.720]  the sanctions that are making them poorer as the rich get richer
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:44.440]  government corruption crime violence you think you want to leave your country
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:53.800]  this has just begun and when the winter sets in it's going to be much worse
[03:54:55.720 --> 03:54:58.680]  you know another article is going to come out in your uh
[03:54:58.680 --> 03:55:03.080]  when you're transgendering you know everybody got worried about covid no so what are you worried about covid?

[03:55:24.840 --> 03:55:33.080]  look how they're killing us with all this stuff but here's the point it's prosecution to the
