[00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.302]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.083]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:09.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:11.405]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:17.168]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:21.210]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:35.874]  What makes me most concerned about the 44th President Barack Obama is that I've never seen in United States politics in our history someone being called world president, messianic leader, our savior.
[00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:40.036]  When the corporate press is behind somebody like this, look out.
[00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.918]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us out of the gates for his analysis, his breakdown.
[00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:56.917]  The congressman from Texas, of course a presidential candidate who sent shockwaves through the political system, the controlled left-right paradigm, is with us for the next 20 minutes to break down what we're facing.
[00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:02.479]  Congressman, are you feeling the dread that many of us are feeling right now?
[00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.803]  Yes, I do, but I don't think it's brand new.
[00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:07.064]  I didn't wake up with it.
[00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:08.425]  I've had it for a while.
[00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:15.248]  I don't think the election was a surprise, but the rhetoric is getting pretty strong, and they are getting very bold.
[00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:20.310]  I think McCain was obviously a backup candidate in case something happened where Obama didn't win.
[00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.951]  They'd have been okay.
[00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:28.955]  They'd have been satisfied with McCain, but they've been positioning Obama for a long, long time.
[00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:37.441]  You know, he's a man of the people, and yet he was the first guy to spend, you know, more money than anybody else.
[00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:54.052]  He probably spent more money than everybody else put together in these last two years, and that was, you know, on the books it's about $750 million, but when you look at all the free stuff, and you look at all the things that have gone on in the last three or four years, I consider the fact that he's probably had a $2 billion campaign.
[00:01:55.333 --> 00:02:00.735]  But we have to realize this started a long time before he even announced to be president.
[00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:13.119]  Anybody who would have gotten that much favorable coverage for so long, you know that the plans are laid for him to be the individual that is going to be taking care of the corporate elite.
[00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:21.785]  Well, he's the guy who helped ram through the banker takeover bill, and now what you predicted and others predicted is happening.
[00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:29.809]  They're openly announcing the end of the dollar, a new Bretton Woods, a new world monetary system run by a small group of private international banks.
[00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:36.492]  We will buy our carbon credits from them, and Barack Obama is signaled that he will do whatever they say.
[00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:39.225]  Yep, and I think there's no doubt about that.
[00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.629]  He wouldn't be there if he didn't toe the line.
[00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:55.226]  And, you know, when the meeting starts on November 15th for the new monetary system, this could be, you know, the beginning of the end of what we see is what's left of our national sovereignty.
[00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.949]  I don't know how long it'll take for their announcement.
[00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.511]  I guess the meeting starts on November 15th.
[00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:02.013]  It won't be November 16th.
[00:03:02.013 --> 00:03:06.878]  I think it'll be a little while before the announcement is made and before we fully understand it.
[00:03:06.878 --> 00:03:12.544]  But I think the fact that the markets are relatively calm right now and the dollar has not totally crashed,
[00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:13.825]  Yes, we are.
[00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:51.730]  That's right.
[00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.930]  We played the club yesterday.
[00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:12.143]  He said, over the banks, over the stocks, over every nation, a trilateral world currency, everything the Trilateral Commission announced in the 70s, everything we warn people about and Obama is saying he's going to give us change, but the change with class warfare is robbing the middle class and transferring it all to the multinational corporations.
[00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:16.685]  You know, I guess you heard a statement by Sarkozy from France.
[00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:19.846]  He said that we want to reform capitalism.
[00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:30.911]  But our president, you know, came right back and he says he's all for this World Summit, but only on one condition, that we not tamper with the free market system.
[00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.292]  And people believe this stuff.
[00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:36.874]  You know, they just listen to that and it just goes over their heads and it's so sad.
[00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.635]  Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:55.541]  We're going to be back in three minutes for one more long segment with him and I've got a list of important questions but I'm not having to ask them because he's already on the same page defending the Republic, defending the true free market, defending sovereignty.
[00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.042]  We'll break down the new 44th president when we get back.
[00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:02.220]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.987]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:09.951]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:12.995]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:17.701]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.101]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:22.842]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:24.903]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:26.723]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:26.723 --> 00:05:30.704]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:33.525]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:39.727]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:42.668]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:47.149]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.750]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.192]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.192 --> 00:05:59.894]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:03.136]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.277]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:08.299]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:12.382]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:16.506]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:24.052]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:27.975]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:30.858]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:38.182]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.182 --> 00:06:41.484]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:00.599]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:17.612]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:19.194]  You want answers?
[00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:20.094]  Well, so does he.
[00:07:20.094 --> 00:07:24.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:30.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:32.465]  Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.046]  For those that
[00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:34.847]  We're good to go.
[00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:58.554]  Biden, on the last week, his running mate, the new vice president-elect, has called for world government twice last week and a new world order.
[00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:02.157]  Everything we told you decades ago, you are now seeing it.
[00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:08.521]  So they move out the old puppet Bush, they're moving in the new puppet to fool the left now to get on this bandwagon.
[00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:15.206]  And, Congressman, I've been interviewing a lot of international experts, by the way, including Stiklitz, who's pushing all of this right now.
[00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:32.739]  And they are saying, yes, the big announcement that Powell's talking about on the 21st or 22nd of January will be devaluing the dollar and basically announcing a new economic order run by the very people that orchestrated all of this.
[00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:40.806]  But other world leaders are saying it's also going to be economic implosions and military adventures.
[00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:42.687]  Pakistan.
[00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:47.871]  What is this huge event where they're naming dates but they won't tell us what it is?
[00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:57.299]  Well they're just getting us prepared and they are doing the planning and they're in charge and unfortunately the people get distracted.
[00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:03.244]  I consider our election this whole past year or two is just a distraction making everybody think
[00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:05.245]  Boy, this is really critical.
[00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:06.665]  This election means everything.
[00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:10.907]  You know, if we don't have McCain, the world is going to go to the dogs or vice versa.
[00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:17.270]  If we don't have Obama, we're not going to be able to take care of the people, and the poor are all going to suffer and die.
[00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:30.456]  And it's all orchestrated that people are misdirected from the important issues of war and peace and money and the Federal Reserve and the business cycle and all these calamities that are going on.
[00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:38.762]  Uh, so they don't want us to know, and by the time we do know and figure it out, then it's so hard to reverse the trend.
[00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:43.406]  You know, it's sort of like the Patriot Act should have been defeated before we passed it.
[00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:47.269]  Once it's passed, it's really tough to repeal laws like that.
[00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:50.670]  Congressman Powell is saying the 21st, the 22nd.
[00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.831]  Others are naming that date.
[00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:54.572]  You're there at the Hill.
[00:09:54.572 --> 00:09:59.634]  You know, you're closer to the inside of the actual workings of power than the general public is.
[00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:07.678]  I mean, have you heard anybody who has inside knowledge about what the crisis is, or is it going to be the announcement of the New World Order?
[00:10:08.198 --> 00:10:13.521]  Well, I think it's going to be an announcement of a new monetary order, and they'll probably make it sound as very limited.
[00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:24.666]  They're not going to say, this is world government, even though if you control the world money, and you control the military, which they do indirectly, they do control the world.
[00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.567]  They're mainly interested in controlling the money and natural resources.
[00:10:28.387 --> 00:10:28.948]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:52.129]  And it's going to be controlled by the very financial institutions that orchestrated
[00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:03.636]  We're good to go.
[00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:30.159]  You know, taxes on the stock market transactions, and there's gonna be world carbon taxes that you buy from this group of banks.
[00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:37.385]  I mean, that is total control, and as Barack Obama said, he's gonna bankrupt the coal industry that gives us 49% of our power.
[00:11:37.385 --> 00:11:38.966]  This is the neo-feudal model.
[00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:41.547]  It's in direct control.
[00:11:41.547 --> 00:11:46.688]  They're not going to own the coal mines and the coal processes.
[00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:48.889]  What they can do is just tax you.
[00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:51.110]  And they can control us.
[00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:57.252]  And I've argued the case that we don't have private property in this country anymore because we have all the responsibility and liability.
[00:11:57.252 --> 00:11:59.393]  But can you use your land without getting permission?
[00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:03.794]  You have to get 20 permits to use your own land in order to stay on the land.
[00:12:05.923 --> 00:12:06.243]  I think so.
[00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:37.055]  I imagine a few of them think that they'll be able to manage this and we'll be able to help take care of everybody, but obviously that isn't the case.
[00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.437]  They're going to make the world a lot poorer.
[00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:44.020]  So Obama is the Pied Piper after eight years of George Bush and all of his New World Order policies.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.421]  To lead America into the New World Order.
[00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:49.622]  That's why Newsweek's calling him the President of the World.
[00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:52.904]  They're calling him that in British, and German, and French.
[00:12:52.904 --> 00:12:56.425]  Newspapers, uh, Obamamania in Germany.
[00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:58.767]  I mean, they are calling him the one.
[00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.908]  They are calling him the leader.
[00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:03.909]  I mean, any time you see that in history, Congressman, isn't that dangerous?
[00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:11.800]  I mean, that means not only dangerous, but maybe we have crossed a Rubicon.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.102]  You know, maybe it's going to be very difficult.
[00:13:14.102 --> 00:13:16.264]  So we have to look for sources of optimism.
[00:13:16.264 --> 00:13:17.525]  What do we do?
[00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:21.388]  Ultimately, though, all that happens to us is a result of philosophy.
[00:13:21.428 --> 00:13:21.888]  I think so.
[00:13:40.948 --> 00:13:51.643]  That's right, your campaign covered all the issues that are now unfolding, center stage on the world, but as you said, the global crisis they were going to engineer
[00:13:53.112 --> 00:14:05.481]  For decades you've said this, that when we came to that point, it would be with the free market and liberty and freedom, be able to use the crisis to expand liberty, or with the establishment who orchestrated it, use it to bring in more bondage.
[00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:08.664]  Now, I want to get into the trifecta.
[00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:18.271]  The House, the Senate, so now the Legislative, and the Executive, at least for a year or two with just absolute power.
[00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:19.692]  How dangerous is that?
[00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.193]  With Chuckie Schumer talking about
[00:14:21.714 --> 00:14:26.556]  All these new taxes and more gun control and fairness doctrine restricting free speech.
[00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:32.047]  I think it's very dangerous and the first year is probably going to be the most dangerous year.
[00:14:32.047 --> 00:14:38.933]  And just think of Bush's first year, but he also had the 9-11 thing that he could use to scare everybody to death.
[00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:41.375]  And Obama will use the financial crisis.
[00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:46.099]  The crisis will get worse and there will be some more military skirmishes around the world.
[00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:49.001]  So he'll say, well, we've got to do this, we've got to do this.
[00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:53.645]  And just as the Republican Congress wouldn't say boo to our Republican President,
[00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:57.989]  You know the Democratic Congress is never going to stand up.
[00:14:57.989 --> 00:15:09.298]  There'll be a couple, maybe a Dennis Kucinich and a few others who are principled and anti-war, but the Democratic Congress will not stand up to the President.
[00:15:09.298 --> 00:15:13.122]  As a matter of fact, a lot of Republicans might say, hey, how do I stay in here?
[00:15:13.122 --> 00:15:15.103]  Obama's so popular, I better go along with it.
[00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:16.845]  I don't want to look like I'm in opposition to this.
[00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:20.087]  Sort of like how many people went along with the bailout.
[00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.629]  Oh, I don't want to look like I don't care about the financial crisis.
[00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:24.010]  I better vote for this.
[00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:28.473]  Oh, I don't want to look like I don't care about, you know, the danger of the terrorists coming here.
[00:15:28.473 --> 00:15:30.094]  I better vote for the Patriot Act.
[00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:35.158]  There's going to be a lot of that, and there's going to be a lot of legislation passed, I think, in the first year.
[00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:36.960]  Well, that's the issue.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:44.148]  Obama's called for a million-man youth brigade as large as the military, domestically spying on us.
[00:15:44.148 --> 00:15:47.411]  He supports the warrantless wiretaps.
[00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:52.277]  The Air Force has now announced more brigades being added to NORTHCOM.
[00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:55.939]  Talk about crossing the Rubicon.
[00:15:55.939 --> 00:16:06.123]  What is the left, the mainline left, going to do when they realize that Barack Obama is actually going to intensify all of the policies that George Bush had?
[00:16:06.123 --> 00:16:07.584]  Well, there's not too many left.
[00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:13.287]  I mean, you have the Ralph Naders and others, but they get marginalized, just as I was in the Republican Party.
[00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:21.391]  So those who are principled, who object to this, aren't going to be heard from, and people are going to go along with it.
[00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:22.692]  No, no it doesn't.
[00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:25.114]  Congressman, how do we prepare for this?
[00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:27.056]  How do we stop the
[00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:44.770]  I mean, we've already had the government triple under George Bush, now Obama's talking about expanding it even more.
[00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:50.172]  I mean, what do we do, in your educated opinion, to somehow save the republic?
[00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:59.114]  Well, they're going to claim they're saving it because they take all these people up and put them in all these organizations in the military and talk about things like, oh, unemployment rates are going down.
[00:16:59.114 --> 00:17:01.195]  That's what they'll probably argue.
[00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:02.796]  No, we have to continue to do what we're doing.
[00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:03.996]  You're in the business of passing
[00:17:04.717 --> 00:17:07.039]  Spreading information, that to me is the most crucial.
[00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:10.702]  Getting more people engaged, more people understanding what the issues are.
[00:17:10.702 --> 00:17:12.503]  Nothing else is more important than that.
[00:17:12.503 --> 00:17:18.449]  And then, when you see an opportunity, then we have to turn this into political action.
[00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:21.211]  And hopefully we don't give up on that too soon.
[00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:25.134]  But it does get rather frustrating, especially after elections like this.
[00:17:25.134 --> 00:17:26.696]  But there's going to be special elections.
[00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:28.797]  I don't think so.
[00:17:50.009 --> 00:18:06.894]  Congressman, do you think that we are in danger of not just them using the staged economic crisis that they created to get total control, but Gulf of Tonkins, because they're also talking about terror attacks, inaugural bombings, Al-Qaeda, Al-Syaida, wants to test the resolve of the United States.
[00:18:06.894 --> 00:18:07.954]  Do you think that's on the cards?
[00:18:08.614 --> 00:18:17.143]  Oh, it sure is, but back to the philosophy of the Bush Doctrine, which was that we have the right to preemptively strike anybody.
[00:18:17.143 --> 00:18:27.092]  And then he even expanded that recently by saying, well, we don't have to invade and conquer, but we have the right to go in and bomb anybody without their permission.
[00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:32.618]  That's why we go into Pakistan and into Syria, which are acts of war.
[00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:43.088]  So they have the tools to do it, and they have the sentiment, and most Americans are oblivious to what's happening.
[00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:51.856]  So you're saying you think members of the establishment might stage something so that people will then support more warmongering, but this time by Obama?
[00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:54.318]  Yeah, of course, we've been worrying about that for a long time.
[00:18:54.318 --> 00:18:58.541]  I thought it would have occurred sooner because Bush was so anxious to go into a rant.
[00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:03.224]  It hasn't happened so far, so maybe our talking about it made him back off a little bit.
[00:19:03.224 --> 00:19:05.325]  That doesn't mean we should be complacent.
[00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:05.886]  Hold on one second.
[00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.604]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:13.626]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?

[00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.433]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:25.143]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:25.143 --> 00:20:25.604]  The U.S.
[00:20:25.604 --> 00:20:31.128]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:35.652]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:36.753]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:36.753 --> 00:20:39.695]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:46.161]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.583]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:00.630]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[00:21:04.072 --> 00:21:14.815]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.436]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:17.436 --> 00:21:18.997]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:18.997 --> 00:21:19.777]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:19.777 --> 00:21:20.757]  This is his MO.
[00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:22.158]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:22.158 --> 00:21:23.558]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:31.303]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:31.303 --> 00:21:31.783]  Some U.S.
[00:21:31.783 --> 00:21:38.127]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:38.127 --> 00:21:41.589]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:52.114]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more.
[00:21:52.114 --> 00:21:53.334]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:10.579]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.502]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:22:13.502 --> 00:22:19.188]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.

[00:23:15.784 --> 00:23:19.087]  I am saddened.
[00:23:19.087 --> 00:23:20.948]  I am hurt.
[00:23:20.948 --> 00:23:24.270]  I have dread in the pit of my stomach.
[00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.933]  The dread has only been intensifying in the last six months.
[00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:31.255]  We're going to have unmitigated depression.
[00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:34.057]  Squads of youth brigades.
[00:23:34.057 --> 00:23:39.041]  I believe Barack Obama will probably end up being the president that has me arrested.
[00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.443]  In fact, I've pretty much foreseen it.
[00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:45.377]  A lot of us are going to be arrested.
[00:23:45.377 --> 00:23:48.220]  A lot of us are going to be hunted down and killed.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.144]  A great time of darkness is upon us.
[00:23:51.144 --> 00:23:56.209]  Prepare for the real New World Order.
[00:23:56.209 --> 00:24:02.035]  Prepare for it to drink the blood of the innocent out of the nations of the world.
[00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.745]  Prepare for the fall of the republic.
[00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:12.811]  Prepare to be regulated and micromanaged.
[00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:15.374]  Prepare for the death squads.
[00:24:15.374 --> 00:24:21.520]  Prepare for communist-style mass murder.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.683]  My friends, this isn't a joke or a game.
[00:24:26.244 --> 00:24:29.466]  This is the New World Order.
[00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:35.109]  Having its way with the population of the United States and the world.
[00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:42.033]  You know, I go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:44.755]  I look at the comments on the stories.
[00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:53.840]  There's like 400 comments on one story, Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss, by Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:24:56.848 --> 00:25:02.710]  400 comments on the one on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:07.432]  And about a third of them are in there saying, you racist Alex Jones.
[00:25:07.432 --> 00:25:13.354]  I've been listening to you for years and now I'm not going to listen anymore.
[00:25:13.354 --> 00:25:18.095]  Because you hate black people.
[00:25:18.095 --> 00:25:20.916]  And most of them say, by the way, I'm white.
[00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:22.317]  Obama is our savior.
[00:25:24.352 --> 00:25:26.453]  They say that he will save us.
[00:25:26.453 --> 00:25:28.794]  A new Don is here.
[00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:33.716]  You're right, a new Don is here.
[00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:38.018]  Well, we're gonna break down what we're truly facing.
[00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:42.560]  Now, let's not be like two-year-olds or three-year-olds or four-year-olds here.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.803]  Let's use real, real logic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:48.803 --> 00:25:51.984]  I'm not sad that John McCain didn't win.
[00:25:55.603 --> 00:25:57.145]  I don't care.
[00:25:57.145 --> 00:26:00.788]  You heard Ron Paul say he was never meant to win.
[00:26:00.788 --> 00:26:07.454]  They ran a corpse against Barack Obama.
[00:26:07.454 --> 00:26:18.865]  They have been grooming Barack Obama for a long time to sell the progressives and the left in this country to go along with any evil committed by the New World Order.
[00:26:20.154 --> 00:26:33.900]  I'm upset to watch people calling him the world president, the leader, crying, watching those crowds last night during his speech like they had seen Jesus return and touch down.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.962]  Because I know his policies.
[00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:43.925]  Spy brigades, FEMA camps, wars, handing everything over to foreign international banks.
[00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:45.545]  It's all happening!
[00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:46.606]  It's in Reuters today!
[00:26:47.682 --> 00:27:00.509]  George Bush could have never gotten away with that, because he had no political capital, because he's a bumbling, corrupt little fool, who the system picked by design to do that for eight years.
[00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:10.375]  And people are so one-dimensional, that they email me, they call me, and again, it's a minority of our listeners, maybe 15%.
[00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:13.056]  We've had polls on InfoWars, you know, who are you supporting?
[00:27:13.056 --> 00:27:14.957]  About 15% Barack Obama.
[00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:15.498]  So we know it's about 15%.
[00:27:18.397 --> 00:27:23.381]  I mean, don't be blinded, don't be suckers, don't be mindless.
[00:27:23.381 --> 00:27:26.904]  You're gonna be hurt by this new world order very bad.
[00:27:26.904 --> 00:27:28.686]  Remove Barack Obama from the equation.
[00:27:28.686 --> 00:27:30.347]  He's a puppet, a front man.
[00:27:30.347 --> 00:27:34.110]  He's a brand name they think they can sell their tyranny through.
[00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:41.116]  And when they're done with him in four to eight years, they will give you a Republican.
[00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:47.721]  And then I will cease being a right-wing fascist and I will become a commie again in the mindless left-right paradigm population.
[00:27:50.196 --> 00:27:56.802]  I've written some notes here this morning that I want to go over dealing with Barack Obama.
[00:27:56.802 --> 00:28:05.669]  I am sad because people are thinking that everything Bush did is about to be reversed, and if you study Barack Obama, they are going to kick it into high gear.
[00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:09.132]  They had a divided Congress before.
[00:28:09.132 --> 00:28:09.953]  Close margins.
[00:28:10.882 --> 00:28:13.603]  Democratic Congress and a Republican President.
[00:28:13.603 --> 00:28:15.124]  But still, the war continues.
[00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:17.065]  The banker takeover continues.
[00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:18.305]  Everything continues.
[00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:22.507]  You're not going to see the phony drug war reversed in any way.
[00:28:22.507 --> 00:28:24.047]  He's not going to speak out against it.
[00:28:24.047 --> 00:28:25.368]  He supports it.
[00:28:25.368 --> 00:28:32.491]  You're not going to see them stop using spy satellites against the American people with the local police departments and warrantless wiretaps.
[00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:33.911]  You're not going to see any of that reversed.
[00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:34.672]  The Patriot Act?
[00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:35.112]  None of it!
[00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:42.283]  And see, like I told you, overnight, suddenly Democrats are going, hey, what's wrong with shutting down free speech?
[00:28:42.283 --> 00:28:45.505]  What's wrong with, you know, maybe we don't need guns anymore.
[00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:47.506]  You know, George Bush is leaving.
[00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:56.451]  A lot of what we've gained being reversed with this stunt, this corporate stunt, this hoax.
[00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:58.593]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:58.593 --> 00:28:59.994]  We're on the march.
[00:28:59.994 --> 00:29:02.515]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:02.515 --> 00:29:05.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:08.397 --> 00:29:11.259]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:12.820]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.961]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:29:14.961 --> 00:29:16.862]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:29:16.862 --> 00:29:18.363]  The Late Great USA.
[00:29:18.363 --> 00:29:20.125]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[00:30:05.835 --> 00:30:10.698]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[00:30:10.698 --> 00:30:14.520]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:21.725]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[00:30:21.725 --> 00:30:33.513]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:38.421]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:46.094]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[00:30:47.074 --> 00:30:52.699]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[00:30:52.699 --> 00:30:57.243]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[00:30:57.243 --> 00:30:58.604]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:31:07.845 --> 00:31:09.846]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:16.811]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:25.196]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:30.920]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.620]  I don't know.
[00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:52.270]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:52.731]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:54.513]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:56.436]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.

[00:32:12.385 --> 00:32:31.745]  Throughout the last 130 years, the private central bank in London has funded communists and socialists and fascists, as Dr. Carol Quigley and many other historians wrote.
[00:32:31.745 --> 00:32:32.806]  In favor of it, by the way.
[00:32:34.504 --> 00:32:36.766]  They are going to take everything we've got.
[00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:39.789]  They are going to devalue the dollar down to nothing.
[00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:46.276]  They are going to transfer trillions of your tax money that you will be forced at gunpoint to pay for.
[00:32:46.276 --> 00:32:51.141]  And they will devalue your currency.
[00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:56.506]  And I just wish that Republicans didn't act like mindless, idiotic, thin-skinned children
[00:32:57.938 --> 00:33:08.320]  When I went on air seven and a half plus years ago and told you he was going to balloon the size of the government and come after our liberties and freedoms.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.081]  And I warned you in your partisan idiocy.
[00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:14.602]  I said, OK, let's let's play your partisan game.
[00:33:14.602 --> 00:33:20.163]  Hillary Clinton or somebody else is going to get all that power when they get into office.
[00:33:21.238 --> 00:33:33.761]  And you laughed, and you smirked, and you joked around, and now we got somebody in there that talks about people clutching their Bibles and their guns disdainfully, and a crowd of insiders laughing at us.
[00:33:33.761 --> 00:33:37.941]  They want our guns because they want us to be slaves.
[00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:43.602]  And they think the stupid public will be sold on it because a black guy, he can't be for slavery.
[00:33:43.602 --> 00:33:46.063]  Well, number one, Barack Obama isn't going to run anything.
[00:33:51.297 --> 00:33:57.979]  Get that through your heads!
[00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:04.421]  He is traitorously going to lead this country into the gallows.
[00:34:04.421 --> 00:34:15.103]  We're already bleeding to death as a nation on our knees and they are openly announcing world government run for and by the bankers regulating you through your carbon footprint.
[00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.004]  Everything you exhale, everything you do
[00:34:18.194 --> 00:34:23.136]  There's a carbon emission from almost every form of human activity.
[00:34:23.136 --> 00:34:26.878]  It doesn't matter if the North and South Poles got 30-plus percent bigger this year.
[00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:29.439]  It doesn't matter if we're already having record cold temperatures.
[00:34:29.439 --> 00:34:43.605]  It doesn't matter if it's because the sun has cooled off and the entire solar system is freezing again, including the ice caps on Mars, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are freezing again and become liquid seas.
[00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.133]  They don't care.
[00:34:47.133 --> 00:34:53.044]  It is a world banking system where every facet of your life will be regulated, where you will have carbon credits.
[00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:56.209]  They will also regulate and tax all financial transactions.
[00:34:57.432 --> 00:34:59.854]  This is open world government.
[00:34:59.854 --> 00:35:10.083]  It is a new world order, and you were preconditioned that that didn't exist, and that that wasn't real, and now all these world leaders and banking leaders are openly calling for it.
[00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:14.327]  They are making their move, and they put a new front man in there.
[00:35:14.327 --> 00:35:21.193]  They're calling the president of the world to sucker the planet into going along with it.
[00:35:21.193 --> 00:35:23.275]  It's basic child psychology.
[00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:24.496]  They talk to you like your children.
[00:35:25.342 --> 00:35:27.403]  Oh, George Bush says global warming isn't real.
[00:35:27.403 --> 00:35:28.663]  He's dumb and stupid.
[00:35:28.663 --> 00:35:30.504]  He's from Texas.
[00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:35.366]  Meanwhile, he signed on to it, has actually been pushing it, signed us back on to UNESCO and endorsed it.
[00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.966]  So did John McCain.
[00:35:36.966 --> 00:35:41.167]  But then the left all said, well, then it must be real.
[00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:43.448]  It must be real.
[00:35:43.448 --> 00:35:47.270]  You know, if George Bush says it isn't, we better be for it.
[00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.350]  See that basic reverse psychology?
[00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.151]  That good cop, bad cop game?
[00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:59.699]  That they play with you?
[00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.319]  So Democrats, you were outraged.
[00:36:01.319 --> 00:36:03.140]  You were angry about Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.980]  You were outraged by the phony drug war.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.001]  You were outraged by the secret arrest and torture and rendition and the wars.
[00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:15.803]  You were outraged by the attacks on free speech and protests and demonstrations.
[00:36:15.803 --> 00:36:16.983]  All of it continuing.
[00:36:16.983 --> 00:36:18.883]  It had nothing to do with George Bush.
[00:36:18.883 --> 00:36:20.463]  He was a puppet.
[00:36:20.463 --> 00:36:22.144]  It had nothing to do with Bill Clinton.
[00:36:22.144 --> 00:36:22.784]  He was a puppet.
[00:36:23.539 --> 00:36:25.640]  It had nothing to do with George Bush Senior.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.982]  These people are front men for the social engineers.
[00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:34.345]  Nothing is going to change other than the fact they're going to turn the heat up even more.
[00:36:34.345 --> 00:36:42.649]  The height of the flame, the intensity of the flame, burning this country to bits, destroying our freedoms, decimating liberty.
[00:36:42.649 --> 00:36:43.669]  That's the only change.
[00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:52.534]  There will be no change in reducing and reversing tyranny, only an intensification of it with the public confused and bamboozled.
[00:36:54.398 --> 00:36:57.540]  Into believing that they're seeing real change.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:10.986]  And the most dangerous sign, the most dangerous issue that we're dealing with is that I have watched newsreels going back to the 1930s.
[00:37:10.986 --> 00:37:22.592]  I have read the historical books on every time period in the last 300 years in the United States, 234 years,
[00:37:24.986 --> 00:37:26.587]  Since our country was officially founded.
[00:37:26.587 --> 00:37:44.021]  And I have never seen the media worshipping someone like they were Kim Jong Il of North Korea or Stalin of Russia or Adolf Hitler of the Reich.
[00:37:44.021 --> 00:37:46.803]  I have never seen it.
[00:37:46.803 --> 00:37:50.946]  In fact, it took them five, six years
[00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:57.248]  After Hitler got in power in 33, they didn't start worshipping him until 39.
[00:37:57.248 --> 00:38:07.616]  They didn't start using all of those Messiah terms until they were getting the public ready to go into war, to go into empire, to go into unpopular things.
[00:38:07.616 --> 00:38:18.103]  And now they're doing it with Obama out of the gates!
[00:38:18.103 --> 00:38:18.844]  From the very
[00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:35.135]  Beginning, and you notice in his speech last night, we're going to play it later in the show, you notice that he said, now I'm going to do a lot of things you're not going to like, but I'm never going to lie to you.
[00:38:35.135 --> 00:38:36.295]  That was a lie.
[00:38:36.295 --> 00:38:41.818]  He swore to vote against warrantless wiretapping against the American people.
[00:38:41.818 --> 00:38:43.238]  Now he's for it.
[00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:45.539]  He swore to end the war immediately.
[00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:47.980]  Now they're saying, well, we'll probably keep troops there forever.
[00:38:49.252 --> 00:38:53.015]  You know, we'll have a drawdown to 50-60,000 and that's it.
[00:38:53.015 --> 00:38:59.160]  And I've been on international TV and radio with people, part of his campaigns.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:05.145]  And they go, oh, that's right, yeah, we're gonna keep 60,000 troops there.
[00:39:05.145 --> 00:39:05.805]  Because they're done.
[00:39:05.805 --> 00:39:09.088]  They've done their dehumanization, their mass murder, millions dead, they've taken over.
[00:39:09.088 --> 00:39:10.489]  They gotta move those troops on.
[00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:15.053]  They gotta move them back here.
[00:39:15.053 --> 00:39:18.656]  You notice the Army and the Air Force are announcing more brigades, more units.
[00:39:19.727 --> 00:39:30.930]  Well, if you read the original Army Times article, it mentioned units that we exposed as being part of covert military operations, domestically paying off mayors, politicians, in the late 90s.
[00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:46.214]  All the brigades and units we list in the takeover, released in 2000, police state to the takeover, those are the very brigades and units listed by me in the film that was in the Army Times a month ago.
[00:39:48.439 --> 00:39:51.901]  And Naomi Wolf and the left are like, oh my gosh, George Bush is getting ready for martial law.
[00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:53.962]  He's getting ready to suspend things.
[00:39:53.962 --> 00:39:56.043]  He's getting ready to stop the election.
[00:39:56.043 --> 00:39:57.703]  And I said, no they're not.
[00:39:57.703 --> 00:40:01.285]  This is all being set up, like when Bill Clinton passed the baton to George Bush.
[00:40:01.285 --> 00:40:11.350]  And George Bush went to Congressman Dan Burton's committee and threatened them and said, you will shut down the pardon gate of cocaine dealers and the Chinese gate and all the corruption investigations.
[00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:16.052]  And you're going to see George Bush protected by Barack Obama.
[00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:36.194]  And so you are going to witness... You are going to witness the New World Order go absolutely wild.
[00:40:36.194 --> 00:40:37.295]  This is their jump point.
[00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:38.636]  This is their big move.
[00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:46.443]  This is a century plus, according to Cecil Rhodes and the Club of Rome and all the official government documents of the British Empire.
[00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.384]  Now the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:49.305]  This is their move.
[00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:54.726]  They are going to destroy the United States economically in the world's eyes.
[00:40:54.726 --> 00:41:03.388]  They are going to merge us into a new monetary world government system of regulatory control.
[00:41:03.388 --> 00:41:09.610]  They are going to have a million plus as strong as large the general military civilian spy corps.
[00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.671]  Bigger than the East German Stasi per capita.
[00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:14.892]  A million to begin with.
[00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:16.632]  He talked about that in his speech last night.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:28.307]  And I got people on the message board in the comment sections of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com saying, Alex, what's wrong?
[00:41:28.307 --> 00:41:29.528]  What's wrong with youth corps?
[00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:31.589]  What's wrong with... It's like the Peace Corps.
[00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:34.832]  Yeah, but they got guns and they spy on you.
[00:41:34.832 --> 00:41:35.372]  What for?
[00:41:35.372 --> 00:41:36.133]  Where are the terrorists?
[00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:36.994]  It's non-existent.
[00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:37.534]  It's not real.
[00:41:37.534 --> 00:41:41.017]  It's us, the American people.
[00:41:41.017 --> 00:41:45.620]  Because they know there's going to be resistance to taking the farms and the ranches and the homes.
[00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:59.448]  They're playing classic class warfare, telling people, oh, we're going to get the rich people, we're going to tax people that make over $250,000 a year, and now you really look at the tax plan, it's $150,000 a year.
[00:41:59.448 --> 00:42:04.753]  That's not the rich, that's not the elite, especially as the currency's devalued.
[00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:10.077]  That is the middle class being robbed, and that money's not going to go to you, the American people.
[00:42:10.077 --> 00:42:10.818]  Barack Obama
[00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:15.713]  When McCain, to try to get some campaign points, I don't believe he would have done it.
[00:42:15.713 --> 00:42:18.334]  He's a horrible little wicked devil as well.
[00:42:18.334 --> 00:42:22.457]  Just not as slick as Obama, so not as dangerous.
[00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:25.258]  He said, well, let's actually give people money for their mortgages.
[00:42:25.258 --> 00:42:27.620]  Let's actually forgive part of their mortgages with the money.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.981]  Barack Obama said, no.
[00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:32.843]  And then that bailout didn't go even to the mortgage companies.
[00:42:32.843 --> 00:42:37.926]  It went to the private, inner group of banks as money to forcibly, with regulators, aiding them
[00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:59.128]  We've got government regulators aiding the private group of banks, setting up rural government, to come in and force vertical integration of insurance companies, banks, and other banking institutions, like credit unions, and there's a massive closing of the net.
[00:42:59.128 --> 00:43:00.209]  We've got three million cops,
[00:43:01.568 --> 00:43:15.112]  Up from only 500,000 ten years ago, we're talking about millions more, and 3 million in Virocomps, Federal Envirocomps, in your yard, in your factory, in your farm, in your ranch.
[00:43:15.112 --> 00:43:25.716]  And you read the Premises ID, the Animal ID, the big companies, they're exempt from almost all the regulations, they're only for the small farms and ranches that are already shutting down.
[00:43:25.716 --> 00:43:27.796]  And so you're gonna pay more for everything.
[00:43:27.796 --> 00:43:29.917]  Energy, food, shelter,
[00:43:31.889 --> 00:43:34.891]  Oh yeah, and they'll be government jobs as spies, as tattletales.
[00:43:34.891 --> 00:43:39.834]  Already one-tenth of the 10% of the college grads are Homeland Security related.
[00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:42.196]  They're talking about massively increasing that.
[00:43:42.196 --> 00:43:44.837]  They're gonna shift the military-industrial complex funding.
[00:43:44.837 --> 00:43:46.798]  Now a trillion dollars.
[00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:49.160]  And around $300 billion of that is for domestic operations.
[00:43:52.327 --> 00:43:53.609]  Who runs the red light cameras?
[00:43:53.609 --> 00:43:54.810]  Lockheed Martin.
[00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.771]  Going in everywhere.
[00:43:55.771 --> 00:43:57.853]  Who runs the face scanning cameras?
[00:43:57.853 --> 00:43:59.495]  Other defense contractors.
[00:43:59.495 --> 00:44:01.958]  They are militarizing the United States.
[00:44:01.958 --> 00:44:10.487]  They are taking over the economy and conduiting all the new jobs and funds, not just into government, but into private corporations with government contracts.
[00:44:10.487 --> 00:44:12.129]  A reign of terror!
[00:44:15.743 --> 00:44:19.686]  Now again, get it through your head for people out there in Obama worship.
[00:44:19.686 --> 00:44:21.267]  I understand you hate George Bush.
[00:44:21.267 --> 00:44:22.749]  I understand it was horrible.
[00:44:22.749 --> 00:44:24.590]  I understand he was a tyrant.
[00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:28.113]  I led the fight against him.
[00:44:28.113 --> 00:44:34.678]  And I even said, well, yeah, we should throw the Republicans out because the Democrats say they are going to end the war.
[00:44:34.678 --> 00:44:38.121]  I said, I don't really believe that, but let's show the public.
[00:44:38.121 --> 00:44:39.182]  Let's give them a shot.
[00:44:39.182 --> 00:44:42.124]  It's very dangerous because they'll try to ban guns.
[00:44:42.124 --> 00:44:43.145]  It's very dangerous, but
[00:44:43.826 --> 00:44:48.089]  Let's go ahead because I said down the road it will shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:44:48.089 --> 00:44:59.017]  Perhaps if people see that when they're given two years of having control of the House and Senate that they will not stop these wars, they will not stop the Patriot Act, they will not reverse anything.
[00:44:59.017 --> 00:45:00.998]  The warrantless spying, the torture.
[00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:04.220]  And they didn't!
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.262]  And so they got into power.
[00:45:07.262 --> 00:45:09.644]  And you saw what I predicted unfold.
[00:45:09.644 --> 00:45:10.705]  It wasn't hard to predict that.
[00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:18.152]  So understand, it's like George Bush was a locomotive pulling the New World Order train, pulling us into Hades.
[00:45:18.152 --> 00:45:20.214]  Pulling us deeper into tyranny.
[00:45:20.214 --> 00:45:22.475]  And now they pulled into a side yard.
[00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:28.919]  They hooked a new, shiny, fancy engine.
[00:45:28.919 --> 00:45:36.083]  Bush was a battered, you know, green and yellow engine, and they put a big, pretty, red and yellow engine on there.
[00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:42.807]  And the people are all hailing the engine, but it's going down the same tracks, the same place, and it's bigger.
[00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:43.527]  It's faster.
[00:45:43.527 --> 00:45:45.368]  It's better.
[00:45:45.368 --> 00:45:48.029]  It hadn't been through eight years of having everything blamed on it.
[00:45:48.029 --> 00:45:50.670]  See, they blame everything on the puppet, like birdcage liner.
[00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.411]  They lay it in there under the bird.
[00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:55.312]  It's the New World Order.
[00:45:55.312 --> 00:46:02.955]  All the blame for what the bird does, what the New World Order does, goes on to the birdcage liner, and then they pull it out after eight years, and they stick a new one in there.
[00:46:02.955 --> 00:46:04.796]  Everybody's fooled for a while.
[00:46:04.796 --> 00:46:07.537]  And then they carry the agenda down the field again.
[00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:11.551]  Like a drive in football.
[00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:20.941]  But instead of Bush staging the terror attacks, his controllers, and getting a few feet, and getting a first down, and getting a touchdown, and then it slowed down to where he couldn't.
[00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:21.962]  You know, he was worn out.
[00:46:21.962 --> 00:46:23.023]  People knew his games.
[00:46:23.023 --> 00:46:24.245]  They knew his plays.
[00:46:24.245 --> 00:46:26.327]  Well, now they're sending a whole fresh team.
[00:46:30.512 --> 00:46:35.076]  Now they've sent in the super quarterback, Barack Obama, and he plays for the New World Order.
[00:46:35.076 --> 00:46:36.477]  He's on the New World Order team.
[00:46:36.477 --> 00:46:38.738]  He's said on every issue he's for it.
[00:46:38.738 --> 00:46:41.480]  Every issue he's for what the New World Order bankers want.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.061]  Every issue!
[00:46:44.767 --> 00:46:46.469]  And he says, I know you love me.
[00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:49.872]  And even tells the mainline socialist, we're gonna cut the teachers' pay.
[00:46:49.872 --> 00:46:51.153]  Yay!
[00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:52.554]  You're not gonna get any help.
[00:46:52.554 --> 00:46:53.115]  Yay!
[00:46:53.115 --> 00:46:53.975]  Which is bad enough.
[00:46:53.975 --> 00:46:55.697]  But see, they don't need the welfare anymore.
[00:46:55.697 --> 00:46:57.018]  They've got control of the government.
[00:46:57.018 --> 00:46:58.860]  They've taken the money and given it to the corporations.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.221]  They've built up their war chest.
[00:47:00.221 --> 00:47:03.204]  They're just openly looting trillions right in front of you now.
[00:47:03.204 --> 00:47:04.905]  And so, hey, we're gonna cut your welfare.
[00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:07.387]  We're gonna cut your teachers' pay.
[00:47:07.387 --> 00:47:09.449]  You want me to play him saying it?
[00:47:09.449 --> 00:47:11.131]  I talk about people email me saying I'm a liar.
[00:47:12.085 --> 00:47:18.249]  We're going to, uh, tax you to pay the corporations a bunch of money, but you're going to get nothing.
[00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:24.013]  Again, I'm against socialism because it gives the globalists control, and they've always used it, but only in the earlier stages, getting us domesticated.
[00:47:24.013 --> 00:47:28.416]  If we're going to have socialism, why not literally rain $100 bills out of helicopters?
[00:47:28.416 --> 00:47:30.438]  Like Ben Bernanke said, but on the American people.
[00:47:30.438 --> 00:47:36.201]  If they're going to kill the currency, might as well, while it still has some value, get the economy going with it.
[00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:41.265]  I mean, it's bad, but it's not as bad as transferring it all offshore, while the banks cut off all the liquidity.
[00:47:42.153 --> 00:47:48.374]  To Main Street, the general public, and other institutions that aren't part of the elite inner group, so they can consolidate it all.
[00:47:48.374 --> 00:47:55.795]  This is cold-blooded military, economic, precision domination.
[00:47:55.795 --> 00:48:00.536]  Here's another parallel or parable.
[00:48:00.536 --> 00:48:02.757]  Another analogy.
[00:48:02.757 --> 00:48:03.997]  It's like Rome.
[00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:07.178]  The corrupt Roman imperial system enslaving the people.
[00:48:07.178 --> 00:48:09.618]  Taxing them, regulating them, arresting them, torturing them.
[00:48:10.547 --> 00:48:24.564]  And one Caesar, and they would do this routinely, they would overthrow a Caesar or banish him or kill him because they knew he was unpopular, they would blame it on him and the public for a few years would buy it and accept the exact same policies, and they put a new Caesar in.
[00:48:24.564 --> 00:48:29.971]  And the Caesar really didn't run anything, he was controlled by his inner court and inner group of senators, and it's the same thing again here.
[00:48:32.671 --> 00:48:47.127]  And so all the work we did exposing the New World Order, all the work we did exposing government-sponsored terrorism, all the work we did exposing torture is wrong and wars is wrong and killing Iraqis is wrong, a lot of that's going to be reversed now.
[00:48:47.127 --> 00:48:51.091]  And the New World Order is going to be able to start new wars, kill more people, just like the left loved Bill Clinton.
[00:48:52.239 --> 00:48:53.541]  And the right loves it too.
[00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:54.923]  Bombing and attacking Serbia.
[00:48:54.923 --> 00:48:56.325]  They just like the image of killing people.
[00:48:56.325 --> 00:48:57.627]  They like the image of power.
[00:48:57.627 --> 00:49:01.913]  These weak-minded people associate their personal destiny and power with the elite.
[00:49:01.913 --> 00:49:03.275]  The very elite that's destroying us!
[00:49:08.539 --> 00:49:15.923]  And so when I talk about Barack Obama having people like myself arrested, they're openly talking about shutting down talk radio, restricting free speech, shutting down and restricting the web.
[00:49:15.923 --> 00:49:16.564]  Europe's doing it.
[00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:17.724]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:49:17.724 --> 00:49:19.185]  It's unfolding right now.
[00:49:19.185 --> 00:49:24.268]  They're coming in with limited websites you can visit through Comcast and Time Warner.
[00:49:24.268 --> 00:49:27.410]  It's all happening right now.
[00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.091]  And they've geared up the secret police.
[00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:30.392]  They're gearing up the military.
[00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:36.754]  Democrats tend to go after their opposition more, set people up, audit them, go after them.
[00:49:36.754 --> 00:49:45.680]  I'm telling you, folks, we're going into the real danger zone here now.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:51.024]  And so, to see the public fooled... Again, I'm not saying I wish John McCain would have gotten elected.
[00:49:52.071 --> 00:49:56.377]  I'm saying they're calling him a messianic leader to set up their New World Order.
[00:49:56.377 --> 00:49:58.460]  He works for the bad guys.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.985]  We need to shatter the left-right paradigm to understand they control both parties.
[00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:05.149]  Until we do that, we're just beating our heads up against the wall.
[00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:07.292]  And I feel so sorry for all the people being conned.
[00:50:08.374 --> 00:50:15.138]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:50:15.138 --> 00:50:17.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.321]  But who is the enemy?
[00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:20.121]  Bin Laden.
[00:50:20.121 --> 00:50:20.982]  This is his ammo.
[00:50:20.982 --> 00:50:22.503]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:50:22.503 --> 00:50:24.104]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:50:24.464 --> 00:50:31.634]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:50:31.634 --> 00:50:32.115]  Some U.S.
[00:50:32.115 --> 00:50:38.463]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:50:38.463 --> 00:50:41.928]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:52.432]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:50:52.432 --> 00:50:53.672]  Fabled enemies.
[00:50:53.672 --> 00:51:01.195]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.195 --> 00:51:04.816]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:51:08.228 --> 00:51:11.650]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.951]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:51:13.951 --> 00:51:17.252]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:51:17.252 --> 00:51:24.135]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:51:24.135 --> 00:51:26.256]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:51:26.756 --> 00:51:30.037]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:51:30.037 --> 00:51:34.839]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:38.760]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.401]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:43.062]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[00:51:43.062 --> 00:51:48.984]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[00:51:48.984 --> 00:51:52.745]  Remember that code, 500, to qualify for the free webcam.
[00:51:52.745 --> 00:51:54.246]  Webex, now part of Cisco.
[00:51:54.366 --> 00:51:54.967]  I am so frustrated.
[00:51:54.967 --> 00:51:56.228]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:51:56.228 --> 00:51:56.468]  What?
[00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:59.130]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.491]  I read something and forget.
[00:52:00.491 --> 00:52:01.753]  I forget people's names.
[00:52:01.753 --> 00:52:05.616]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.371]  Okay, slow down.
[00:52:23.371 --> 00:52:25.932]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:52:25.932 --> 00:52:33.075]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:52:33.075 --> 00:52:34.696]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:52:34.696 --> 00:52:36.457]  You know, I can remember everything now!
[00:52:36.457 --> 00:52:37.357]  Even entire books!
[00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:37.897]  What?
[00:52:37.897 --> 00:52:38.458]  How?
[00:52:38.458 --> 00:52:41.700]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.484]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:52:45.484 --> 00:52:55.131]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:52:55.131 --> 00:53:00.516]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:53:00.516 --> 00:53:01.016]  Wow.
[00:53:01.016 --> 00:53:01.797]  What's the website?
[00:53:02.037 --> 00:53:05.518]  Now, don't forget, it's Pmemory.net.
[00:53:05.518 --> 00:53:11.641]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:53:11.641 --> 00:53:23.846]  Barack Obama, even more than George Bush, is controlled by the inter-coterie, the inter-group, of international bankers.
[00:53:23.846 --> 00:53:28.968]  You watch, he's gonna allow them to kill the dollar, to bring in the trilateral world currency,
[00:53:31.737 --> 00:53:45.868]  I've got Webster Tarpley popping in next hour and I've got to go in the last hour and be in studio for TV for Crest TV Worldwide but I think I'm going to ask Tarpley if he can do it to sit in and do the fourth hour today.
[00:53:46.908 --> 00:53:52.991]  If he agrees to that, if he can, he's just going to pop in briefly in the next hour because there's no point in having him on twice.
[00:53:52.991 --> 00:53:55.892]  And then he can come on and take your phone calls.
[00:53:55.892 --> 00:54:07.376]  As soon as Tarpley leaves us, regardless, I do want to take a lot of your phone calls today so you can chime in on what's happened specifically with the election and the economy and all the mainstream newspapers announcing a new world order run by the banks.
[00:54:07.376 --> 00:54:09.297]  I mean, yeah, that's change.
[00:54:09.297 --> 00:54:13.659]  That's going out of the fire into hell itself, out of the frying pan into Hades.
[00:54:16.824 --> 00:54:24.086]  It's just staggering to see them saying he's the messianic world leader, the world president.
[00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:32.029]  It's just unbelievable that he admits he used cocaine, but you watch, the drug war is just going to expand.
[00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:37.711]  And, you know, at the end of the day, that's who the right wing, that's who the phony right wing are, that they didn't care what George Bush did.
[00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:43.273]  It was about their party winning and their little puppet being in there, so they supported gun control and open borders and
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.943]  Quadrupling the size of the federal government and all of this, and now it's the same with Obama.
[00:54:50.943 --> 00:54:53.924]  The Democrats en masse, you know, it was about hating George Bush.
[00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:57.405]  It wasn't about caring about Iraqi kids or torture.
[00:54:57.405 --> 00:54:58.866]  It's just about feeling like they're winners.
[00:54:58.866 --> 00:54:59.526]  Oh, we won!
[00:54:59.526 --> 00:55:00.527]  Our guy got in.
[00:55:00.527 --> 00:55:02.488]  Hey, they stole the election twice for Bush before.
[00:55:02.488 --> 00:55:08.750]  They had Kerry, his cousin, and his skull and bones mate take a fall on top of it.
[00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.231]  That election was clearly stolen.
[00:55:10.231 --> 00:55:12.832]  You don't think with Obama winning by six, seven points,
[00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:16.289]  You don't think they couldn't have stolen it again?
[00:55:16.289 --> 00:55:18.430]  No, they needed a new frontman.
[00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.252]  And I have no doubt the popular vote, people didn't really vote for him.
[00:55:21.252 --> 00:55:23.493]  I'm saying I believe he was really elected.
[00:55:23.493 --> 00:55:24.834]  They didn't have to steal it.
[00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:29.177]  But they were stealing Senate races, House races.
[00:55:29.177 --> 00:55:32.979]  They were stealing county races, city races.
[00:55:32.979 --> 00:55:34.220]  Those fraud machines were there.
[00:55:36.794 --> 00:55:38.175]  We have Bev Harris coming on tomorrow.
[00:55:38.175 --> 00:55:40.177]  I could have her on today, but I just want to cover this today.
[00:55:40.177 --> 00:55:41.578]  We're going to get into all the fraud.
[00:55:41.578 --> 00:55:43.760]  And now the left's saying, oh, I guess voting machines really do work.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.062]  I guess this is all right now!
[00:55:46.062 --> 00:55:50.946]  See how perfect Barack Obama is for them?
[00:55:50.946 --> 00:55:53.328]  We're all going to be hurt very badly by this.
[00:55:53.328 --> 00:55:59.032]  A very tiny group of global elitists, a few thousand of them, they're going to be empowered by it.
[00:55:59.032 --> 00:56:02.175]  And Barack Obama is going to turn a hellish police state loose on us.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.961]  You're not going to hear him say, stop tasering people to death.
[00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:11.543]  You're not going to hear him talk about how they have laws tailored to put black men in prison.
[00:56:11.543 --> 00:56:12.603]  You're not going to hear any of that.
[00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:18.626]  You're going to hear him push Planned Parenthood and exterminating black people and white people and brown people.
[00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:22.087]  He's a big pusher of that.
[00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:24.068]  And so, now the debate's over.
[00:56:24.068 --> 00:56:24.728]  Get it straight.
[00:56:24.728 --> 00:56:26.068]  I was never for John McCain.
[00:56:26.068 --> 00:56:27.109]  I said I stayed out of it.
[00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:31.671]  I said they were both puppets and both evil.
[00:56:31.671 --> 00:56:32.511]  And there's no doubt that
[00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:47.820]  Frankly, people voting for Chuck Baldwin, people voting for Ralph Nader, and people voting for Bob Barr, definitely with the Bob Barr and then the Libertarians and the Constitution Party.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:53.225]  I mean, they got a good percentage of the vote.
[00:56:53.225 --> 00:56:54.025]  What is it?
[00:56:54.025 --> 00:56:55.226]  10% or so?
[00:56:55.226 --> 00:57:00.230]  That was what would have pushed McCain over the edge, and he would have won.
[00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.131]  And then you'd have had this
[00:57:02.094 --> 00:57:03.114]  Corpse.
[00:57:03.114 --> 00:57:07.255]  This lame duck who couldn't have gotten anything done.
[00:57:07.255 --> 00:57:09.215]  But see, the system needs your acquiescence.
[00:57:09.215 --> 00:57:10.356]  They need your support.
[00:57:10.356 --> 00:57:11.996]  They need you to be suckered in.
[00:57:11.996 --> 00:57:13.736]  That's why he's saying, we need your help, America.
[00:57:13.736 --> 00:57:15.997]  We need you to help build this new world order.
[00:57:15.997 --> 00:57:16.697]  We need you.
[00:57:16.697 --> 00:57:17.797]  I'll never lie to you.
[00:57:17.797 --> 00:57:19.857]  All he does is lie.
[00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:22.498]  I'll never betray you.
[00:57:22.498 --> 00:57:23.778]  I need you to help me.
[00:57:23.778 --> 00:57:26.519]  I need you to get behind what we're doing.
[00:57:26.519 --> 00:57:27.959]  We need you to acquiesce.
[00:57:28.717 --> 00:57:29.577]  That's what the system said.
[00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:35.439]  They said Barack Obama can bring the suckers back to the table.
[00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:37.700]  And he does have grassroots fascist support.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.502]  They were out in the streets, just eyes lit up like they were on some drug last night.
[00:57:42.502 --> 00:57:49.304]  Just, oh, celebrating, oh, oh, change, change, change.
[00:57:49.304 --> 00:57:54.146]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:57:54.146 --> 00:57:56.327]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:57:58.803 --> 00:58:04.526]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:04.526 --> 00:58:05.847]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:05.847 --> 00:58:07.848]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:07.848 --> 00:58:14.211]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:14.873 --> 00:58:23.775]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:58:23.775 --> 00:58:30.856]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:58:30.856 --> 00:58:34.017]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:58:34.017 --> 00:58:39.818]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:58:39.818 --> 00:58:42.379]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:58:42.899 --> 00:58:48.802]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:58:48.802 --> 00:58:51.863]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:58:51.863 --> 00:59:00.946]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:00.946 --> 00:59:03.327]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:03.327 --> 00:59:06.089]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.714 --> 00:59:14.035]  Big Brother.
[00:59:14.035 --> 00:59:15.796]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:15.796 --> 00:59:17.558]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:17.558 --> 00:59:19.139]  You want answers?
[00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:20.700]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.883]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:24.883 --> 00:59:28.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.055 --> 00:59:48.617]  He's the most credible resistor against the Obama zombies.
[00:59:48.617 --> 00:59:50.637]  And that's why we've been having him on quite a bit.
[00:59:50.637 --> 00:59:54.778]  I, um... You know, I give people the benefit of the doubt.
[00:59:54.778 --> 01:00:00.180]  All of these, uh, controlled neo-libs out there who have no idea what they're in store for.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:08.743]  They think the robbing of the middle class and the carbon tax is, quote, gonna get the rich people, and that's anybody that's got a dollar more than them.
[01:00:08.743 --> 01:00:09.803]  They, uh, have no idea.
[01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:16.211]  That this is neo-feudalism, this is serfdom, they're going to be hurt very, very bad.
[01:00:16.211 --> 01:00:18.874]  You know, I'm on record here.
[01:00:18.874 --> 01:00:22.036]  I'm on record here saying John McCain's evil.
[01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:24.998]  You know, I can't vote for either one of them.
[01:00:24.998 --> 01:00:28.201]  And I didn't get suckered, but I said, well, Obama says he'll end the war.
[01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:30.923]  Obama says he'll do this and that.
[01:00:30.923 --> 01:00:33.645]  Obama says he'll end the wiretapping of the American people without warrants.
[01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:41.838]  He reversed all that, and now to see the media literally calling him world president, the hope, he will change the world.
[01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.659]  I've never seen this in US politics.
[01:00:43.659 --> 01:00:50.803]  I've never... I mean, they're already saying he's greater than Jack Kennedy and Martin Luther King out of the gates.
[01:00:50.803 --> 01:00:56.166]  And he's now calling for a new world order run by the private banks, global carbon taxes, global regulation.
[01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:58.327]  It's all being announced!
[01:00:58.327 --> 01:01:01.529]  So we're going to have Tarpley on with us for 20 minutes, and then I've got to leave
[01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:10.448]  I've got to leave coming up in the fourth hour today.
[01:01:10.448 --> 01:01:13.410]  We have a record audience, by the way, just on the internet alone.
[01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:21.576]  So Tarpley is going to host the show in the last hour, so I'm not going to have him on then for long in this hour.
[01:01:22.669 --> 01:01:36.552]  But I want his basic boil down now, and now the battle plan to stop what's happening, because the whole agenda of the neocons, the new old order, they now have their new pony, the fresh pony, the fresh engine, but the train is going to be pulled down the same tracks.
[01:01:36.552 --> 01:01:41.153]  And this is worse than I thought.
[01:01:41.153 --> 01:01:44.194]  I mean, I've never seen worship as a world leader.
[01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:47.975]  Worship as the messiah.
[01:01:47.975 --> 01:01:49.715]  So Webster Tarpley, we're about to break, but
[01:01:50.696 --> 01:01:56.221]  His Lordship is now our new Führer.
[01:01:56.221 --> 01:01:58.082]  Where do we go from here, Webster?
[01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:02.345]  I think we need to create what amounts to a united front against fascism.
[01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:04.467]  We'll have to find a suitable name for it.
[01:02:05.094 --> 01:02:33.946]  But a resistance front of anti-fascists, principled people from left, right, center, and any coloration, that there will be no honeymoon for the fascist Obama, that we don't want the carbon cap-and-trade system, we don't want fascist censorship of radio and other mass communications media, we don't want any more bailouts, we don't want confrontation with Russia, China,
[01:02:34.736 --> 01:02:37.518]  Sudan and Pakistan.
[01:02:37.518 --> 01:02:42.222]  We don't want any more free trade sellouts with Latin America or any other part of the world.
[01:02:42.222 --> 01:02:50.928]  In other words, what we've got to do is to get a catalog of the probably half a dozen main thrusts of an Obama administration.
[01:02:50.928 --> 01:02:52.149]  We're gonna go into an attempt
[01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.898]  By the Obamazoids to have a fascist hundred days.
[01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:58.679]  In other words, I would call it a hundred days in reverse.
[01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:08.785]  It will be the implementation of fascist political reforms to go with the fascist corporate state that the bailout has already largely implemented.
[01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.967]  So I think we've got to gear up.
[01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:12.587]  No honeymoon.
[01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:15.890]  People say they hear America singing.
[01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:21.172]  If they hear America singing, it's the Horst Wessel song and Jovinette's that they hear.
[01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:24.594]  Those are the various fascist anthems left over from the 1920s and 30s.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:30.363]  I don't believe that most people realize the enormity of what's gone on.
[01:03:30.363 --> 01:03:37.388]  So we've got to conduct a very vigorous emergency campaign of mass political education and encourage people.
[01:03:37.388 --> 01:03:38.348]  They're not alone.
[01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.070]  This is not a landslide.
[01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:44.412]  This is anything but a mandate for fascist transformation.
[01:03:44.412 --> 01:03:45.853]  It's really a very close election.
[01:03:45.853 --> 01:03:47.314]  It's not a landslide in any sense.
[01:03:47.314 --> 01:03:53.619]  Well, the good news is the left is going to find out very soon that this is the man of the new world order.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.145]  And I want to talk about Secky Schumer when we get back.
[01:03:57.145 --> 01:04:00.531]  I've seen him on TV seething with power.
[01:04:00.531 --> 01:04:02.094]  Seething with evil.
[01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:03.817]  They are getting ready to rampage.
[01:04:03.817 --> 01:04:05.239]  I agree with Tarbly.
[01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:06.722]  Hell is about to be released.
[01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:07.303]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:08.424 --> 01:04:10.105]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:10.105 --> 01:04:14.868]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:14.868 --> 01:04:17.810]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:20.872]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:26.996]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:32.800]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.641]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:36.503]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:41.407]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:41.407 --> 01:04:50.555]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:57.642]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:57.642 --> 01:04:59.644]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[01:04:59.864 --> 01:05:02.086]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:02.086 --> 01:05:07.771]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:11.014]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:11.014 --> 01:05:14.377]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.199]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:16.199 --> 01:05:20.283]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:22.725]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[01:05:22.725 --> 01:05:23.546]  Get self-sufficient.
[01:05:23.706 --> 01:05:24.387]  Get food.
[01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:31.936]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:31.936 --> 01:05:33.138]  And so it's a mindset.
[01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.861]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:38.745]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:39.085 --> 01:05:46.087]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:46.087 --> 01:05:49.369]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:49.369 --> 01:05:50.269]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:54.510]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:54.510 --> 01:06:00.773]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:06:00.773 --> 01:06:01.853]  Watch the free videos.
[01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:07.135]  Look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:07.135 --> 01:06:12.118]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:12.118 --> 01:06:13.258]  Take action today.
[01:06:13.258 --> 01:06:17.340]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:23.943]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:23.943 --> 01:06:27.905]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:29.786]  The Anglo-American power elite
[01:06:32.574 --> 01:06:36.756]  I saw Chuckie Schumer on Fox News and CNN last night
[01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:10.502]  And then again this morning, and when he was talking about shutting down talk radio and other things, and he was seething, and just, just, I've never seen him so emboldened, and I was watching others.
[01:07:10.502 --> 01:07:12.123]  Uh, the Democrats are not nice people, folks.
[01:07:12.123 --> 01:07:18.587]  They want your guns, they want the middle class, uh, you know, we clutch our guns, we clutch our bibles.
[01:07:18.587 --> 01:07:19.828]  They are coming.
[01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:25.912]  And they're gonna use the money they squeeze out of the middle class to regulate and control your life, and for all the poor, mainline socialists,
[01:07:26.972 --> 01:07:29.894]  I don't like socialism, but let me tell you something, it's a lot better than this.
[01:07:29.894 --> 01:07:32.795]  This ain't socialism, Jack!
[01:07:32.795 --> 01:07:33.876]  Okay?
[01:07:33.876 --> 01:07:37.758]  When they take 5 trillion, that's what Ron Paul said at the start of the show today.
[01:07:37.758 --> 01:07:40.300]  It's 5 trillion now.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.261]  Just like Bloomberg reported.
[01:07:42.261 --> 01:07:45.443]  And they suck that into their gullets and give none of it to the people.
[01:07:45.443 --> 01:07:47.384]  That isn't socialism!
[01:07:47.384 --> 01:07:50.946]  Now, socialism's bad, overall, because it domesticates people.
[01:07:52.167 --> 01:07:55.189]  I'm not against the government with, you know, base seed money to get things going.
[01:07:55.189 --> 01:07:59.471]  I know Tarpley is along those lines, and he's got his own political nomenclature.
[01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:02.593]  And he's outside the left-right paradigm.
[01:08:02.593 --> 01:08:03.953]  This is sophisticated, folks.
[01:08:03.953 --> 01:08:05.094]  We're playing chess.
[01:08:05.094 --> 01:08:08.876]  The public isn't even playing chess, uh, checkers here.
[01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:15.660]  Now, Webster, I've been watching their body language, and I've studied history just like you've done.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.941]  I have never seen worship like this.
[01:08:18.941 --> 01:08:20.042]  And I'm gonna be honest with people.
[01:08:21.212 --> 01:08:27.734]  I have promised that I will not evacuate the country unless they shut all the radio off and there's no point of even being on the air.
[01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:33.196]  But let me tell you, during the first hundred days, and I agree with Webster, they're gonna go absolutely ape.
[01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:35.857]  I'm gonna let you know on air if I evacuate my family.
[01:08:35.857 --> 01:08:42.519]  I am literally... I had a list of countries, I'm looking at it now, the passports are in order.
[01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:47.701]  And folks, I'm not like some Hollywood person or some leftist who left when George Bush got in.
[01:08:47.701 --> 01:08:49.121]  And I said he was gonna blow those towers up.
[01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:52.736]  Folks, we predict when they're going to blow towers up.
[01:08:52.736 --> 01:08:55.017]  We know what they're going to announce with the banking system.
[01:08:55.017 --> 01:08:56.838]  We're right about everything.
[01:08:56.838 --> 01:09:00.660]  We should have people just absolutely hanging on our every word.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.082]  We have the scholars, the research on.
[01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:04.562]  Tarbly, I'm just freaking out.
[01:09:04.562 --> 01:09:06.864]  My God, I have total dread.
[01:09:06.864 --> 01:09:08.004]  It's worse than I thought.
[01:09:08.004 --> 01:09:11.046]  I should have gotten behind this earlier to fight this.
[01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.947]  I probably, but I didn't want to be in the left-right paradigm.
[01:09:13.947 --> 01:09:17.249]  I didn't want to be suckered into all that because that's key to shatter that.
[01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:29.699]  But now, maybe it's better that it all get bad and come down on us now, or maybe it would have been better if we had told the third parties, vote for McCain to stop this, because God, they've got the zombies now, and this is it!
[01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:30.761]  Tarpley, I know it now!
[01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:31.361]  You're right!
[01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:32.563]  They're going for broke!
[01:09:32.563 --> 01:09:33.244]  Webster Tarpley!
[01:09:34.053 --> 01:09:41.397]  Well, let's also remember that there are still important institutional factors of resistance, which of course Obama will try to destroy.
[01:09:41.397 --> 01:09:46.760]  47 to 48 percent of the American people are against this.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.083]  And maybe if you see complete vote totals when you add up everything, the anti-Obama vote
[01:09:52.703 --> 01:09:53.843]  Approaches 50%.
[01:09:53.843 --> 01:09:57.605]  It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%, no matter how we cut it.
[01:09:57.605 --> 01:10:11.289]  We've also got to figure that the acorn-induced and related vote fraud, intelligence community vote fraud, because it was clear that that was going to be in favor of Obama this time, that this considerable vote fraud also skews the figures.
[01:10:11.289 --> 01:10:14.030]  So, this is, once again, a 50-50 country.
[01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:20.792]  Obama's attempt to install pan-oligarchy, or a sort of an oligarchical consensus,
[01:10:21.372 --> 01:10:23.253]  This has obviously been a failure.
[01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:26.954]  Notice there's very little discussion about what's the mandate.
[01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:28.215]  I don't see any mandate.
[01:10:28.215 --> 01:10:32.417]  Obama ran on nothing except I'm the savior, vote for me.
[01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:34.878]  That is not a mandate for any policy.
[01:10:34.878 --> 01:10:44.822]  And most of the policies that Obama is now going to pull out of his hat are the ones that he's talked about least, because they're the oppressive ones, the onerous ones, the austerity, the sacrifice.
[01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:58.785]  If you happen to be watching some of these networks, Doris Kearns Goodwin, a very meretricious professor of history from Harvard, says, yes, now shared sacrifice has to be the watchword of our entire government, right?
[01:10:58.785 --> 01:11:04.447]  You've got various oil companies going on, saying the great task of the future is to use less.
[01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.970]  Let's have a Malthusian zero growth.
[01:11:16.946 --> 01:11:18.007]  Unpopular.
[01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:23.110]  So he's telling everybody, hey, the change is we're going to screw you real bad.
[01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:26.812]  You're not going to like what I do, but we love you.
[01:11:26.812 --> 01:11:29.654]  So get ready to sacrifice and unify.
[01:11:29.654 --> 01:11:32.636]  And basically we're coming after you if you're not for us.
[01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:33.436]  I mean, they are.
[01:11:33.436 --> 01:11:35.017]  And that's what Biden has said.
[01:11:35.017 --> 01:11:36.478]  Get ready for unpopular stuff.
[01:11:36.478 --> 01:11:37.459]  My God, Tarpley.
[01:11:38.442 --> 01:11:44.747]  Yes, but on the other hand, there are significant factors of resistance, and we've got to basically regroup around those.
[01:11:44.747 --> 01:11:49.531]  Almost half the country have looked at this and said, no thanks, no Obama.
[01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:54.855]  You've got a significant number of Republicans who have been re-elected.
[01:11:54.855 --> 01:12:04.683]  The attempt to get the filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, as far as I can see, I haven't looked too much this morning, but it looks like that has fallen short.
[01:12:05.303 --> 01:12:19.374]  And you've got to realize that the Democratic Party always needs more than 60, because you've got the various conservative Democrats, the sort of blue dog or bold weevil type Democrat in there, who is unlikely to go with it.
[01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:21.496]  This is not Hitler, really.
[01:12:21.496 --> 01:12:22.717]  This is Mussolini.
[01:12:23.597 --> 01:12:29.981]  Mussolini, when he came to power with the March on Rome in October of 1922, had to deal with a coalition government.
[01:12:29.981 --> 01:12:32.342]  Now, this is not a coalition in name.
[01:12:32.342 --> 01:12:34.563]  It's a democratic, one-party state.
[01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:43.668]  But if we look inside the Democratic Party, you'll see that there are people like the Marci Capitores, the New Deal Democrats, and then these other Blue Dog or Boll Weevil types.
[01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:50.692]  There's going to be significant tension between Obama and the Congress, even though it's all Democrats.
[01:12:50.692 --> 01:12:52.933]  The founders built this in.
[01:12:52.933 --> 01:13:01.818]  If you go back to Carter, you'll see that Carter had a very large majority in both houses of Congress, and still his relations with them were very, very bad.
[01:13:01.818 --> 01:13:03.779]  He got into these conflicts with Tip O'Neill.
[01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.181]  Now, right now the leadership is not there.
[01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:09.603]  The leadership is Pelosi and Reid, and they're as rotten as can be.
[01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:23.097]  But there will be the possibility of peeling off some Democratic votes and then maybe together with those right-wing Republicans, you can make an anti-Obama blocking position that will be able to stop certain things from going through.
[01:13:23.097 --> 01:13:25.359]  We've got to hold out for two years.
[01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.402]  You've got to figure that within about two years,
[01:13:28.543 --> 01:13:36.710]  The entire rage and resentment for the economic crisis will be directed against the Democrats.
[01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:42.095]  In other words, they will be holding the bag for the worst economic depression in human history.
[01:13:42.095 --> 01:13:50.383]  Bush will be out the door, Republicans will be gone, and the Democrats will be sitting there, imposing austerity and providing laws.
[01:13:50.683 --> 01:13:57.649]  The neocons are evacuating to Dubai, Switzerland, England, Paraguay.
[01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:59.651]  Now Webster, I'm going to make this announcement now.
[01:13:59.651 --> 01:14:04.014]  Webster is going to host the show for an hour and a half.
[01:14:04.014 --> 01:14:08.838]  So from 1.30 to 3 o'clock Central Time.
[01:14:08.838 --> 01:14:15.264]  That's 2.30 to 4 Eastern Time today because I can't turn down going on press TV.
[01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:18.887]  That's got tens of millions of viewers worldwide conservatively.
[01:14:20.094 --> 01:14:21.576]  And so I'm going to do that.
[01:14:21.576 --> 01:14:24.579]  They've rescheduled the Russian today to later tonight.
[01:14:24.579 --> 01:14:26.901]  I'm back on that today.
[01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:29.864]  So I appreciate Webster coming in.
[01:14:29.864 --> 01:14:31.165]  Unfortunately, I'll have to miss it.
[01:14:31.165 --> 01:14:33.848]  Driving down to the TV studio, I'll be able to listen to Webster on 90.1.
[01:14:35.309 --> 01:14:37.852]  Here in Austin in 1330, the great A.M.
[01:14:37.852 --> 01:14:39.334]  out of Taylor.
[01:14:39.334 --> 01:14:49.564]  But Webster, in the few minutes I've got left before you come up later, the hundred days for all these poor, well-meaning zombies who see things in a one-dimensional and even two-dimensional way.
[01:14:49.564 --> 01:14:53.168]  They don't understand that Bush and all these guys are puppets.
[01:14:53.168 --> 01:14:55.531]  They think, oh, well, he's black, you know, he's a Democrat.
[01:14:56.309 --> 01:14:58.010]  They haven't looked at the policies.
[01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.251]  Tell people what the first hundred days is going to be like.
[01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:03.472]  I mean, it's clear the New World Order is making its move.
[01:15:03.472 --> 01:15:08.454]  That's why they're trying to give him total support, calling him the, literally, the one.
[01:15:08.454 --> 01:15:20.400]  They're calling him the one, like the Matrix, the Messianic Moses, Jesus the Messiah, mainstream news saying world president, world leader.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.301]  I mean, they're not doing that for him for no reason.
[01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:25.132]  No, of course.
[01:15:25.132 --> 01:15:31.676]  It's going to be an attempt to do some pretty thorough institutional reform, and we want to block that.
[01:15:31.676 --> 01:15:33.197]  It will be things like this.
[01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:38.802]  If you look at Mussolini, the first thing Mussolini wanted to do was to change the laws that governed elections.
[01:15:38.802 --> 01:15:42.845]  He wanted to change the way the Parliament was elected and stuff like this.
[01:15:42.845 --> 01:15:52.572]  I would say with Obama, it's going to be this question of suppressing voices of dissent, suppressing various forms of talk radio, internet radio,
[01:15:53.577 --> 01:15:57.921]  Trying to muzzle and censor the political opposition.
[01:15:57.921 --> 01:15:59.942]  They're saying they're going to do it!
[01:15:59.942 --> 01:16:06.427]  And I've got Democrats, I mean I think Rivero, who's never been a Democrat, blew himself away yesterday when he said, I'm for the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:14.614]  Yeah, I think that the Night of the Long Knives will be coming for a lot of people who think that Obama is for them.
[01:16:14.614 --> 01:16:16.495]  They're going to find that he's not.
[01:16:16.495 --> 01:16:22.417]  Obama will unnecessarily turn on his base, attack his base, betray his own base.
[01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:24.238]  So let's look at what they're going to do.
[01:16:24.238 --> 01:16:27.979]  It'll be some version of the Fairness Doctrine and hate speech to Muslim dissent.
[01:16:28.579 --> 01:16:35.282]  They will try to have this fascist cap-and-trade system built on the hoax of global warming.
[01:16:35.282 --> 01:16:40.144]  With the Nazis, you'll remember the doctrine was blood, right?
[01:16:40.144 --> 01:16:42.065]  The description of Aryan blood.
[01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:43.866]  You didn't believe in that.
[01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:44.867]  You were a subversive.
[01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:52.844]  In the case of these people today, they'll say, if you don't believe in global warming, you're a subversive and the Green Corps will come to you.
[01:16:52.844 --> 01:16:54.005]  That was the other thing.
[01:16:54.005 --> 01:16:58.409]  Mussolini created the Voluntary Militia for National Security.
[01:16:58.409 --> 01:17:00.711]  Voluntary Militia for National Security.
[01:17:00.711 --> 01:17:03.995]  It sounds exactly like Obama's Homeland Security.
[01:17:04.695 --> 01:17:09.658]  I'm going to tell them right now, stay away from my family, you scum, you Nazi blood-sucking maggots!
[01:17:27.954 --> 01:17:31.419]  I mean, I've got them on my website right now, Webster, saying, so what?
[01:17:31.419 --> 01:17:35.584]  Yeah, we're going to be armed corps, a million of us, to defend against terrorists.
[01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.246]  And those terrorists are us, folks!
[01:17:37.246 --> 01:17:39.749]  Anybody that... I can't believe this is happening, Webster.
[01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:42.464]  Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:50.367]  I mean, you know, Bush and Cheney did a great deal of damage, and this, in some ways, is the final culmination of the damage, right?
[01:17:50.367 --> 01:17:51.868]  That they've opened the door to this.
[01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:53.749]  Anyway, we want to stop... Stay there!
[01:17:53.749 --> 01:17:54.069]  Stay there!
[01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:54.909]  We'll do one more segment.
[01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:55.490]  I don't want to cut you.
[01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:57.270]  You've got an hour and a half coming up.
[01:17:57.270 --> 01:18:00.572]  I've actually got a headache over all this, folks.
[01:18:00.572 --> 01:18:01.612]  Oh, God.
[01:18:01.612 --> 01:18:03.213]  I mean, it's so horrible.
[01:18:04.295 --> 01:18:05.137]  It's so horrible.
[01:18:05.137 --> 01:18:13.212]  They're talking about a three million man Enviro Spy Brigade that the police are going to basically give official power and a million person spy brigade.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.062]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:18:18.062 --> 01:18:20.283]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:18:20.283 --> 01:18:22.045]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:22.905]  Sound familiar?
[01:18:22.905 --> 01:18:26.348]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[01:18:26.348 --> 01:18:31.713]  Introducing our patented Find One Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.
[01:18:31.713 --> 01:18:37.898]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[01:18:37.898 --> 01:18:44.203]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[01:18:44.343 --> 01:18:45.904]  The possibilities are endless.
[01:18:45.904 --> 01:18:52.249]  Fofa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:54.090]  Got the remote!

[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.983]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.

[01:21:15.624 --> 01:21:24.832]  With the days getting shorter and the nights getting longer, being out after dark increases your odds of being mugged, assaulted, or even worse.
[01:21:24.832 --> 01:21:28.915]  Studies show 45% of violent crimes happen after dark.
[01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:35.781]  No matter where you are, being unprepared in the wrong place at the wrong time can be extremely dangerous.

[01:22:21.115 --> 01:22:24.238]  Webster Tarpley's gonna fill in for the last hour and a half of the show today.
[01:22:24.238 --> 01:22:27.142]  He's about to go to international TV.
[01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:30.786]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:22:30.786 --> 01:22:33.008]  Run on for a long time.
[01:22:33.008 --> 01:22:34.970]  Run on for a long time.
[01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:37.252]  Alright, so all these idiots think they've defeated George Bush.
[01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.455]  He's nothing but a puppet.
[01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.377]  Webster continuing with their first hundred days.
[01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:42.999]  They've said they're coming out for free speech.
[01:22:43.599 --> 01:22:48.204]  They're setting up all these brigades of idiot youth.
[01:22:48.204 --> 01:22:50.947]  I mean, classic fascism.
[01:22:50.947 --> 01:22:55.692]  And he says he'll give all the money, everything to the foreign banks, nothing for the people.
[01:22:55.692 --> 01:22:58.816]  I mean, it's just the opposite of what you think of a classic Democrat thing.
[01:22:59.685 --> 01:23:02.828]  And what's this big crisis?
[01:23:02.828 --> 01:23:10.333]  A lot of experts are saying dollar devaluation in this new Bretton Woods World Banking System on the 21st and 22nd.
[01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.835]  They're saying he's going to do all these unpopular things.
[01:23:12.835 --> 01:23:15.297]  Do you think stage terror is in the mix?
[01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:28.115]  Yes, well that's implicit in the Biden remarks in Seattle on October 19th, when we're told that we're going to have an international confrontation, most probably with Russia, or possibly involving the Middle East.
[01:23:28.115 --> 01:23:30.757]  It's going to be generated, and the righteousness of the U.S.
[01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:33.198]  position will not be immediately obvious.
[01:23:33.198 --> 01:23:35.139]  I take it to mean either one of two things.
[01:23:35.139 --> 01:23:36.360]  One is that they want to return.
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:42.442]  Using the credibility of the new Messiah here, return to the path of false flag.
[01:23:42.442 --> 01:23:50.045]  That path had been barred to them by the fact that Bush and Cheney were so hated and so discredited that nobody would believe anything they said.
[01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:56.927]  And indeed, the Lemmings at the Atlantic Monthly were complaining about that.
[01:23:56.927 --> 01:23:58.808]  They said, look, you know, we want to have an imperialism.
[01:23:58.808 --> 01:24:00.348]  We've got to have false flags.
[01:24:00.348 --> 01:24:01.589]  But we can't do that anymore.
[01:24:02.129 --> 01:24:04.190]  Because nobody will believe Bush.
[01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:06.852]  Now they probably think they can go back to that.
[01:24:06.852 --> 01:24:14.536]  I know some of them openly write... I mean, there's been a whole bunch of editorials where they say, we love big terror attacks, we wish we could have more, but the public doesn't buy it.
[01:24:14.536 --> 01:24:17.037]  I mean, these murderers are right out in the open!
[01:24:17.037 --> 01:24:17.237]  Right.
[01:24:17.237 --> 01:24:20.319]  The other thing, of course, is they have these puppet states, right?
[01:24:20.319 --> 01:24:23.781]  You've still got Saakashvili seems to have hung on in Georgia.
[01:24:24.361 --> 01:24:33.265]  You've got this despicable Yushchenko, a NATO agent, an IMF agent in Kiev in Ukraine, and they'd like to get something going against Russia.
[01:24:33.265 --> 01:24:40.608]  You'll notice the one clear voice in the world that had no praise for the new messiah was Russian President Medvedev.
[01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.769]  We have to regard such people as allies.
[01:24:43.269 --> 01:24:56.657]  At least in terms of power combinations, because he got up there and said, listen, if you insist on putting those missiles into Poland, we will have a response for them in the form of a new missile of our own, which you will not be able to match.
[01:24:56.657 --> 01:24:57.778]  Well, let me be specific.
[01:24:57.778 --> 01:25:00.960]  Again, we're not here to... All these systems are corrupt, but you're right.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.423]  The only country in the world, not even China, that has come out
[01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:12.809]  On the record, and said, we don't want a new world order with your banks running everything.
[01:25:12.809 --> 01:25:15.710]  We're against this new monetary system.
[01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:20.092]  We want one that is a free market of currencies.
[01:25:20.092 --> 01:25:21.472]  We don't want a new power grab.
[01:25:21.472 --> 01:25:23.813]  We don't want your new world order.
[01:25:23.813 --> 01:25:26.814]  I mean, Russia seems to really be understanding what's happening.
[01:25:27.484 --> 01:25:35.166]  As Gideon Wells, the Secretary of the Navy under Lincoln, said in 1863, thank God for the Russians.
[01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:38.167]  And that is a center of resistance in the world.
[01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:45.169]  Other countries, I think, will tend to gravitate to them as the bankruptcy of Obama becomes evident.
[01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:50.711]  Obviously, right now, you've got the full flush of hysteria, but the bloom will still grow up the rose.
[01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:52.711]  We've got to hold on for two years.
[01:25:52.711 --> 01:25:54.052]  We've got to hold on during the 100 days.
[01:25:55.533 --> 01:26:02.604]  Uh, if you look back at Carter, Carter peaked at the end of the 100 days and then began inexorable decline.
[01:26:02.604 --> 01:26:04.527]  And let me be specific, let me be specific.
[01:26:04.527 --> 01:26:11.137]  During that 100 days, they're gonna be bringing us into open depression, blaming it on Bush still, which again, they all are the same people.
[01:26:12.077 --> 01:26:15.218]  And then saying, you've got to do everything we say to turn this around.
[01:26:15.218 --> 01:26:17.598]  And most of it will have nothing to do with the economy.
[01:26:17.598 --> 01:26:24.179]  It'll just be, do this, do this, just like the terrorism we saw a month ago, pass this, or we're going to have a depression.
[01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:25.740]  Right, it'll be cap and trade.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:34.902]  So we want to say no to the Fairness Doctrine, no to cap and trade, no to these fascist militias and fascist volunteer organizations.
[01:26:34.902 --> 01:26:37.982]  We don't want any extension of free trade.
[01:26:37.982 --> 01:26:40.563]  We don't want that extended to any more countries in Latin America.
[01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:41.583]  We've had quite enough of that.
[01:26:42.518 --> 01:26:49.305]  And we don't want confrontation with Russia, China, Sudan, and Pakistan.
[01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:51.487]  Obama wants to escalate Afghanistan.
[01:26:51.487 --> 01:26:52.808]  That war is lost.
[01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:54.549]  Take a new look at Afghanistan.
[01:26:54.549 --> 01:26:57.032]  The situation there is more hopeless than ever.
[01:26:57.032 --> 01:26:59.374]  You want to join the Red Army in bloody defeat?
[01:27:00.094 --> 01:27:02.155]  That's the only thing you'll get out of it.
[01:27:02.155 --> 01:27:06.256]  Biden is associated with this hysteria to attack Sudan.
[01:27:06.256 --> 01:27:07.836]  No attacks on Sudan.
[01:27:07.836 --> 01:27:10.337]  Or if they do, let Biden lead the charge.
[01:27:10.337 --> 01:27:15.579]  Put him in the first tank and see how far it gets him.
[01:27:15.579 --> 01:27:19.940]  Imperialist armies that go into Sudan have a habit of not coming back.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.881]  Same thing with Afghanistan.
[01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:26.903]  The opprobrium for all of this rapidly shifts to Obama.
[01:27:26.903 --> 01:27:33.685]  I mean, in some ways he's already been the incumbent for the best part of a year now.
[01:27:33.685 --> 01:27:36.006]  He will be left holding the bag for all this stuff.
[01:27:36.724 --> 01:27:46.531]  His regime will tend to collapse even more rapidly than Carter, but we've got to hang on during that critical 100 days and then hold on through the first two years.
[01:27:46.531 --> 01:27:52.575]  Well, what I think they'll do is, at the 100-day mark, ride around and then they'll stage a terror attack and try to get another 100 days.
[01:27:52.575 --> 01:27:58.560]  Webster, you're going to be back with us coming up in one hour, so we'll talk to you then.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.460]  Thank you, Webster.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.522]  Good luck with your work this afternoon, Alex.
[01:28:01.522 --> 01:28:01.902]  All right.
[01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:02.723]  Stay on hold, Webster.
[01:28:06.272 --> 01:28:10.203]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:12.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:16.386 --> 01:28:20.347]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[01:29:08.931 --> 01:29:14.759]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:14.759 --> 01:29:16.621]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:25.653 --> 01:29:27.215]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:27.215 --> 01:29:28.015]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:28.015 --> 01:29:28.916]  This is his MO.
[01:29:28.916 --> 01:29:30.377]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:30.377 --> 01:29:32.359]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:32.359 --> 01:29:39.525]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:39.525 --> 01:29:40.006]  Some U.S.
[01:29:40.006 --> 01:29:46.351]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:46.351 --> 01:29:49.814]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:50.034 --> 01:30:00.117]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:00.117 --> 01:30:01.558]  Fabled enemies.

[01:30:16.255 --> 01:30:17.937]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:30:17.937 --> 01:30:19.699]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:30:19.699 --> 01:30:22.361]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.

[01:31:38.357 --> 01:31:43.442]  Barack Obama's speech.
[01:31:43.442 --> 01:31:47.325]  Last night, 18-minute speech.
[01:31:47.325 --> 01:31:50.247]  And watch it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:31:50.247 --> 01:31:54.791]  Did you see what he had to say?
[01:31:56.387 --> 01:31:58.228]  He said, you're not going to like a lot of what I do.
[01:31:58.228 --> 01:32:01.430]  This is to his mindless, liberal, idiot audience.
[01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:06.472]  Just like you Republican morons thinking George Bush was good.
[01:32:06.472 --> 01:32:07.733]  You're pathetic.
[01:32:07.733 --> 01:32:09.194]  You love being suckers.
[01:32:09.194 --> 01:32:14.657]  The policies of George Bush and Barack Obama are identical.
[01:32:14.657 --> 01:32:18.739]  It's all about unity, unity, unity, unity.
[01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:19.519]  It's going to be tough.
[01:32:19.519 --> 01:32:20.379]  It's going to be hard.
[01:32:20.379 --> 01:32:22.581]  Austerity.
[01:32:22.581 --> 01:32:23.161]  Pain.
[01:32:23.161 --> 01:32:24.281]  Suffering.
[01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:25.022]  Sacrifice.
[01:32:25.962 --> 01:32:31.245]  Because they are going to rape you, and if you think it's bad, no.
[01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:38.789]  They plan to have you pay back in tax money all of the trillions being given to the offshore foreign banks that are setting up world government.
[01:32:38.789 --> 01:32:41.030]  I keep making that point here.
[01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:45.252]  Get it through your heads out there, Obama-brained dead zombies.
[01:32:45.252 --> 01:32:48.554]  And get it through your heads, you mindless neocon turds.
[01:32:48.554 --> 01:32:49.354]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:51.672]  You loved it.
[01:32:51.672 --> 01:32:59.173]  You thought the torture was cute, the secret arrests were cute, the tripling of government was cute, the open borders were cute.
[01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:04.174]  You thought all the government programs and federalization of schools was cute.
[01:33:04.174 --> 01:33:13.256]  Your drug addict Rush Limbaugh and all these other fake conservative whores on the air were there to pied piper you Judas Gochu into the slaughter pens.
[01:33:13.256 --> 01:33:16.156]  And now you're all freaked out by Obama, aren't you?
[01:33:16.156 --> 01:33:18.157]  It's like the liberals were freaked out by Bush.
[01:33:18.157 --> 01:33:19.297]  They don't run anything.
[01:33:20.003 --> 01:33:25.968]  And for all you poor racists out there that don't like Obama because he's black, don't worry!
[01:33:25.968 --> 01:33:30.972]  Don't worry your little head, he doesn't run anything.
[01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:33.074]  But that's how stupid you are.
[01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.676]  You think the President actually runs anything.
[01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.438]  All he does is sucker people.
[01:33:37.438 --> 01:33:39.780]  All he is is a front man.
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.701]  You know what a Judas goat is?
[01:33:40.701 --> 01:33:42.482]  It's a trained goat.
[01:33:42.482 --> 01:33:45.725]  Generally a dominant ram who they never slaughter.
[01:33:45.725 --> 01:33:46.626]  And he goes out and he...
[01:33:47.665 --> 01:33:53.431]  You know, he leads the herd of goats, the other goats, the babies, the mommies, the other daddies.
[01:33:53.431 --> 01:33:57.776]  He leads them around, and he leads them to eat, and leads them to water, and he's the leader.
[01:33:57.776 --> 01:34:00.739]  Well, here they have him lead them into the slaughter pens.
[01:34:00.739 --> 01:34:06.726]  And see, George Bush is the Republican Judas goat, to give you change after Bill Clinton.
[01:34:07.463 --> 01:34:09.624]  And then now, there's Barack Obama.
[01:34:09.624 --> 01:34:15.347]  He's the liberal Judas Goat to give you change after the evil George Bush went at their own by the same people.
[01:34:15.347 --> 01:34:16.988]  And I know my audience knows that.
[01:34:16.988 --> 01:34:19.970]  The public still doesn't understand that.
[01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:23.712]  They do to a certain extent with a 9% approval rating for Congress.
[01:34:23.712 --> 01:34:28.535]  But see, primitively, oh the leader, the new male, he will lead the tribe.
[01:34:28.535 --> 01:34:33.137]  See, we're primitively designed to think that this one man's running something.
[01:34:33.137 --> 01:34:36.219]  So, our whole psychological makeup, our
[01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:48.048]  Our whole anthropology gears us towards going along with it.
[01:34:48.048 --> 01:35:00.575]  So... And again, four to eight years from now, there'll be a Republican they're putting in, and I'll go on the air and go, Ladies and gentlemen, I'm no longer a fascist right-wing Nazi.
[01:35:00.575 --> 01:35:05.257]  Of course, I never was, but the media's gonna be saying that for now, in the next few years.
[01:35:05.257 --> 01:35:07.058]  I'll be... I'm now prepared to become a commie again.
[01:35:07.757 --> 01:35:09.559]  I mean, it's like your children.
[01:35:09.559 --> 01:35:11.840]  They love playing you.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.122]  They love scamming you.
[01:35:14.122 --> 01:35:19.987]  Hey, liberals, do you understand he's saying he's going to start more wars beforehand?
[01:35:19.987 --> 01:35:21.288]  He's telling you?
[01:35:21.288 --> 01:35:24.931]  And he's going to take the middle class money through class warfare?
[01:35:24.931 --> 01:35:30.255]  All you pathetic socialists, lazy do-nothings who keep getting suckered by socialism?
[01:35:30.942 --> 01:35:34.144]  You're not going to get any of that middle class money being stolen.
[01:35:34.144 --> 01:35:42.069]  That all goes to the bankers to buy up shipping companies and infrastructure and roads and power plants.
[01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:50.655]  And you liberals, you're not going to like it when the new Enviro cops drop by or the new Obama Nazis beat you up or burn down your shop.
[01:35:50.655 --> 01:35:52.676]  And again, the Feds proposed this decades ago.
[01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:54.377]  They can get it with Obama now.
[01:35:54.377 --> 01:35:59.481]  These youth brigades, these spy corps of power-tripping scum in uniforms.
[01:36:00.245 --> 01:36:03.128]  It's like right out of a third world dictatorship.
[01:36:03.128 --> 01:36:09.996]  Right out of a... Alright, let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:36:09.996 --> 01:36:13.380]  Patrick in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:15.943]  Hey Alex, I called in yesterday.
[01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:19.267]  I'm actually really surprised how easy it is to get on your radio show.
[01:36:19.267 --> 01:36:20.809]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:27.372]  Actually, you covered one of the things I was going to ask earlier.
[01:36:27.372 --> 01:36:30.053]  It seems like everybody is okay with socialism now.
[01:36:30.053 --> 01:36:31.253]  Like, literally.
[01:36:31.253 --> 01:36:37.016]  Like, they will use the exact term socialism in a conversation and be completely all about it.
[01:36:37.016 --> 01:36:38.537]  I'm like, haven't you read history?
[01:36:38.537 --> 01:36:41.498]  Don't you know this is a very dangerous idea?
[01:36:41.498 --> 01:36:44.099]  They're moron idiots.
[01:36:44.099 --> 01:36:44.459]  Okay?
[01:36:44.459 --> 01:36:47.421]  They're moron idiots who
[01:36:48.450 --> 01:36:53.097]  Who, who were told that they're gonna get some of this money.
[01:36:53.097 --> 01:36:57.263]  They were told that, that, oh, the economy's in trouble.
[01:36:57.263 --> 01:37:02.391]  We're gonna, we're gonna have a bailout of all this free money that the idiots are gonna be paying back.
[01:37:02.978 --> 01:37:06.379]  And that they're not going to be able to have jobs because the economy is going to implode so bad.
[01:37:06.379 --> 01:37:08.861]  They don't understand we're being looted and consolidated.
[01:37:08.861 --> 01:37:12.722]  And so they think, oh socialism, fix the economy, I want some money.
[01:37:12.722 --> 01:37:16.204]  You're not getting jack squat, you got that slaves?
[01:37:16.204 --> 01:37:21.566]  And by the way, we open the phones up and then it's whoever we happen to answer.
[01:37:21.566 --> 01:37:22.947]  They're always ringing.
[01:37:22.947 --> 01:37:25.628]  We just don't answer them now and keep people on hold like we used to.
[01:37:25.628 --> 01:37:29.850]  So it's luck of the draw who calls in Patrick at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:32.891 --> 01:37:49.062]  But, I mean, they're a nation of morons that watch four or five hours of TV a day, and drink poison water, and eat poison food, and are into believing that if they just imagine they're powerful and in charge, they just want to feel good and imagine that, you know, they're empowered by the President.
[01:37:49.062 --> 01:37:51.964]  And again, suckers, you're going to get everything you want.
[01:37:51.964 --> 01:37:52.605]  Go ahead, Patrick.
[01:37:53.723 --> 01:38:00.952]  I think it also has to do with the fact that they think that this system actually has a way of working, but it comes down to the same questions.
[01:38:00.952 --> 01:38:02.414]  Well, who's rationing?
[01:38:02.414 --> 01:38:03.115]  You know?
[01:38:03.115 --> 01:38:05.318]  Who's deciding who gets what?
[01:38:05.318 --> 01:38:06.639]  And all this.
[01:38:06.639 --> 01:38:12.627]  But to move on, also, I'm astounded by people's disbelief in FEMA camps.
[01:38:13.413 --> 01:38:14.834]  Because they definitely exist.
[01:38:14.834 --> 01:38:22.260]  And I was talking to my friend last night and he was like, oh yeah, but I could show you anthropologists with degrees talking about Bigfoot.
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:25.162]  And I'm like, dude, it's not the same thing.
[01:38:25.162 --> 01:38:26.543]  It's a completely different subject.
[01:38:26.543 --> 01:38:28.465]  Bigfoot is obviously not existent.
[01:38:28.465 --> 01:38:30.406]  You can't show me a picture of Bigfoot.
[01:38:30.406 --> 01:38:30.667]  You can't.
[01:38:30.667 --> 01:38:30.987]  It's impossible.
[01:38:30.987 --> 01:38:31.867]  Well, you know what?
[01:38:31.867 --> 01:38:32.488]  You know what?
[01:38:32.488 --> 01:38:33.569]  They don't believe in FEMA camps.
[01:38:33.569 --> 01:38:34.229]  Good.
[01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:35.731]  Enjoy being stupid slaves.
[01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:36.931]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:36.931 --> 01:38:39.754]  Listen, I'm going to say this right now.
[01:38:39.754 --> 01:38:42.536]  We have more people per capita per population
[01:38:43.328 --> 01:38:46.350]  We're not just per capita, we're number one, period.
[01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:49.411]  More people in prison than any other country in the world.
[01:38:49.411 --> 01:38:50.892]  Four million.
[01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:52.713]  And a couple more million in the system.
[01:38:52.713 --> 01:38:55.274]  So it's seven million total.
[01:38:55.274 --> 01:39:02.158]  I've got some ten-year-old number of two and a half million out there, but we've got the Justice Department's own numbers.
[01:39:02.158 --> 01:39:02.919]  Oh, what's the point?
[01:39:02.919 --> 01:39:07.481]  Why should I even explain to people that there are FEMA camps?
[01:39:07.481 --> 01:39:09.682]  Listen, morons!
[01:39:09.682 --> 01:39:11.083]  And I see it on my message board.
[01:39:11.889 --> 01:39:13.651]  I see it all over the news.
[01:39:13.651 --> 01:39:15.512]  Listen, morons!
[01:39:15.512 --> 01:39:25.482]  The Houston Chronicle reported, in January of 2006, Homeland Security contracts for multi-million person emergency FEMA camps for political dissenters.
[01:39:26.181 --> 01:39:28.362]  Listen, morons!
[01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:44.931]  Newsmax, in 2002, reported other contracts for million-man camps, and Christopher Ruddy, who's a neocon, he was supporting Bush, wrote an article saying, of course the FEMA camps are real, here's the federal purchase order, here's the legislation, here is the bid!
[01:39:46.354 --> 01:40:00.306]  I mean, I've got scores of newscasts where they admit they've built camps for the American people, where they admit they've got them ready for political dissidence, where they're announcing they've activated NORTHCOM and multiple brigades of army troops to, quote, fight the American people.
[01:40:00.306 --> 01:40:06.712]  It's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act!
[01:40:06.712 --> 01:40:07.933]  I don't mean to get so mad, folks.
[01:40:07.933 --> 01:40:09.314]  I just can't handle it anymore sometimes.
[01:40:10.416 --> 01:40:11.657]  I mean, you know what?
[01:40:11.657 --> 01:40:12.677]  Let them live in denial.
[01:40:12.677 --> 01:40:14.878]  Let them live in denial about the dollar being devalued.
[01:40:14.878 --> 01:40:17.779]  Let them live in denial about the banker takeover bailout bill.
[01:40:17.779 --> 01:40:20.820]  Let them live in denial about sodium fluoride and mercury in shots.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.662]  I have these idiots email me every day and say, it is the law, you've got to take vaccines.
[01:40:24.662 --> 01:40:29.464]  When there's no law.
[01:40:29.464 --> 01:40:30.924]  They want to be hurt.
[01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.645]  They want to be stupid.
[01:40:32.645 --> 01:40:33.545]  They're cowards.
[01:40:33.545 --> 01:40:35.766]  Cowards imagine they're in control.
[01:40:35.766 --> 01:40:37.787]  Instead of realizing just how much trouble we're in.
[01:40:40.692 --> 01:40:42.533]  And they say, I want to see these FEMA camps.
[01:40:42.533 --> 01:40:44.614]  I've never seen pictures of them.
[01:40:44.614 --> 01:40:45.534]  Really, I've been to them.
[01:40:45.534 --> 01:40:46.855]  I've shown people them.
[01:40:46.855 --> 01:40:53.278]  I have a link to the Army's website where they list their 12 and now 24 civilian inmate labor camp programs.
[01:40:53.278 --> 01:40:58.200]  People on the message boards will say, here's a link to the Army, civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.521]  And they'll say, eh, whatever, liar.
[01:41:01.521 --> 01:41:02.642]  They're in denial.
[01:41:02.642 --> 01:41:03.702]  They're cowards.
[01:41:03.702 --> 01:41:08.184]  And they're going to get hurt real bad by their masters.
[01:41:08.184 --> 01:41:09.385]  Matt and New York are on the air.
[01:41:11.993 --> 01:41:12.573]  You there?
[01:41:12.573 --> 01:41:13.133]  Yes, sir!
[01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:14.034]  Always get some interference.
[01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.554]  Hey, Alex, it's Matt from MobileLiveTV.com.
[01:41:15.554 --> 01:41:17.314]  Hey, Matt, it's good to talk to you.
[01:41:17.314 --> 01:41:23.836]  That's a Talos phone system, and so it goes... When it airs, you... Yeah, I didn't know if it was a new world order.
[01:41:23.836 --> 01:41:24.656]  No, no, let me stop you.
[01:41:24.656 --> 01:41:25.116]  Let me stop.
[01:41:25.116 --> 01:41:25.396]  I'm back.
[01:41:25.396 --> 01:41:26.456]  Put him on hold.
[01:41:26.456 --> 01:41:27.837]  Put him on hold right now.
[01:41:27.837 --> 01:41:33.418]  I'm gonna spend a few minutes here talking about the phone system, because I get calls and emails saying it's a phone tap or something.
[01:41:34.128 --> 01:41:37.133]  I've worked in talk radio for 13 years, okay?
[01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:43.945]  And every major phone system I know, from a Gintner to a Telos, when they air you, that is to let you know you're on air.
[01:41:43.945 --> 01:41:46.710]  It goes... Okay?
[01:41:46.710 --> 01:41:47.251]  That's the noise.
[01:41:47.251 --> 01:41:47.792]  Now, I'm sorry...
[01:41:48.743 --> 01:41:49.604]  We're going to go to Matt now.
[01:41:49.604 --> 01:41:51.164]  Now, Matt, New York, go ahead.
[01:41:51.164 --> 01:41:52.905]  Matt from mobilizethepeople.com.
[01:41:52.905 --> 01:41:53.466]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:53.466 --> 01:41:55.247]  Always spreading the message of freedom.
[01:41:55.247 --> 01:41:55.927]  A couple points.
[01:41:55.927 --> 01:42:00.370]  Les Cole made a valid point when debating truthful topics.
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:06.833]  I find that when I'm spreading the word of freedom, people almost often with the losing argument always don't have the facts.
[01:42:08.434 --> 01:42:14.095]  And they always fall back on some, you know, bogus issue and try and, you know, change the subject.
[01:42:14.095 --> 01:42:16.696]  Well, they say all the black helicopters are going to get me.
[01:42:16.696 --> 01:42:19.497]  Bigfoot, the black helicopters, show me proof, show me proof.
[01:42:19.497 --> 01:42:21.657]  You know, it's always the same thing.
[01:42:21.657 --> 01:42:29.259]  I told them they were going to federalize the police and put them all in black riot gear in 1997 because I saw the federal documents and then by 1999 they were out on the streets.
[01:42:29.659 --> 01:42:30.921]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:30.921 --> 01:42:40.412]  Regarding elected officials, Alex, you know, the bottom line is when the elected officials of the people fail to do the bidding on behalf of the people, the people must mobilize.
[01:42:40.412 --> 01:42:44.217]  And our elected officials, obviously, as we all know, have truly failed in all areas.
[01:42:44.217 --> 01:42:45.519]  The people must mobilize now.
[01:42:46.459 --> 01:42:48.800]  You know, regarding Schumer, you know, you're right.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.680]  I've spoken with him, I've met him.
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:55.082]  As a matter of fact, you're probably very familiar with the 1991 in Killeen, Texas.
[01:42:55.082 --> 01:42:58.603]  George Kennard, he drove into Luby's cafeteria.
[01:42:58.603 --> 01:43:02.804]  He gunned down Susanna Gracia Hubb's parents and many other people.
[01:43:02.804 --> 01:43:06.865]  There's a YouTube video on this topic where she's testifying in front of Congress.
[01:43:07.425 --> 01:43:08.786]  What she said is very prophetic.
[01:43:08.786 --> 01:43:17.051]  She was telling Congress that guns and the Second Amendment are not for hunting, but for protecting the people against radical politicians and governments.
[01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:19.733]  And the camera looks directly at Schumer.
[01:43:19.733 --> 01:43:21.314]  So, you know, it's very interesting.
[01:43:21.314 --> 01:43:22.835]  You're definitely on the right track about this.
[01:43:23.857 --> 01:43:28.340]  And he's so predatory how he perches up there, just looking at hatred at everyone.
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:39.526]  Just, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna dominate you, I'm gonna get your guns, and I'm gonna send my cops with guns, and my military, and I'm gonna suck out everything you got, because I'm a big fat murderin' parasite.
[01:43:39.526 --> 01:43:40.586]  That's exactly who they are.
[01:43:40.586 --> 01:43:44.068]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:44.068 --> 01:43:46.509]  I might not even need to be on air today.
[01:43:46.509 --> 01:43:47.070]  What's going on?
[01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:48.790]  You're pointing something out to me on my call list.
[01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:50.491]  Okay, thank you.
[01:43:50.491 --> 01:43:52.693]  Oh God, help me.
[01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:53.313]  Oh God, help us.
[01:43:55.817 --> 01:43:56.458]  Oh, God.
[01:43:56.458 --> 01:43:57.358]  People are like, why?
[01:43:57.358 --> 01:43:58.499]  What, do you want McCain to win?
[01:43:58.499 --> 01:44:00.160]  I mean, somebody had to win.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.783]  No, it's that that's the one they wanted because it'll sucker more people.
[01:44:03.783 --> 01:44:09.628]  And then all these idiot leftists suddenly supporting all the Bush policies because Barack Obama's pushing them.
[01:44:09.628 --> 01:44:14.732]  I mean, it's bad, folks, when they start calling somebody world president and the one.
[01:44:14.732 --> 01:44:19.015]  When governments start having leaders that do that, look out, man, look out!
[01:44:20.419 --> 01:44:21.059]  I live here!
[01:44:21.059 --> 01:44:21.980]  This is my country!
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:24.601]  I know what tyranny means to my family's future!
[01:44:24.601 --> 01:44:26.502]  I know we're going into hard times!
[01:44:26.502 --> 01:44:28.963]  World government's being born right now!
[01:44:28.963 --> 01:44:31.624]  There isn't time to be a bunch of idiots anymore!
[01:44:31.624 --> 01:44:33.344]  Everything we've told you's come true!
[01:44:33.344 --> 01:44:34.565]  We've been right about everything!
[01:44:34.565 --> 01:44:40.287]  We're gonna be right about all the other stuff coming, too.
[01:44:40.287 --> 01:44:44.009]  And let me tell you, you're gonna wish, you're gonna beg when you're in a depression.
[01:44:45.894 --> 01:44:59.746]  When those local youth corps are beating the hell out of you or burning your house down, if we don't stop these people, you're gonna wish to God you'd have stood up and done something earlier, and that goes for all you pathetic, yuppie, know-it-all trendies who think you're part of the system.
[01:44:59.746 --> 01:45:03.829]  You're a bunch of idiot scum, and that's why this country's getting rolled.
[01:45:03.829 --> 01:45:11.936]  That's why this country's getting taken over by hardcore tyranny, because they know you're cowardly, weak-kneed scum, and they know they can fool you with your propaganda, and you'll take it.
[01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:15.075]  Ray in Indiana!
[01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.297]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:45:16.297 --> 01:45:17.720]  Yeah, uh...
[01:45:19.452 --> 01:45:22.335]  Alex, I've got a couple questions for you, two of them actually.
[01:45:22.335 --> 01:45:39.129]  You keep talking about the system and what's coming down the pipe, but then you talk positively about Russia, and I'm wondering why you do that, because they are one of the most fascist communist systems and they still do that.
[01:45:39.129 --> 01:45:46.395]  And then my other question is, you keep talking about New World Order and so on and so forth, and how do you
[01:45:47.348 --> 01:45:50.109]  I know you are a Bible-believing man.
[01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:54.090]  How do you define prophecy, that it is prophesied?
[01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:55.691]  This is how I define it.
[01:45:55.691 --> 01:45:56.891]  This is how I define it.
[01:45:56.891 --> 01:46:04.913]  I do not use that as a larcenous, wicked way to hand over my responsibility and do nothing like 99% of phony Christians out there.
[01:46:04.913 --> 01:46:06.214]  And so I do the right thing.
[01:46:06.214 --> 01:46:07.494]  I stand up to evil.
[01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:09.075]  I stand up to corruption.
[01:46:09.075 --> 01:46:11.035]  I stand up to the New World Order.
[01:46:11.035 --> 01:46:13.056]  I say no to it, and I do
[01:46:13.816 --> 01:46:16.058]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:46:16.058 --> 01:46:19.501]  I just don't cop out and say, oh it's all a foregone conclusion abortion.
[01:46:19.501 --> 01:46:21.282]  It's all a foregone conclusion wars.
[01:46:21.282 --> 01:46:23.504]  It's all a foregone conclusion microchips.
[01:46:23.504 --> 01:46:30.109]  It's all a foregone conclusion and then just run around and feel good and ignore what's happening and live in la-la land denial.
[01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:34.112]  Now as for Russia, I just said earlier it's an evil New World Order country.
[01:46:34.112 --> 01:46:35.413]  Every country is run by wickedness.
[01:46:35.413 --> 01:46:36.634]  I said this about 40 minutes ago.
[01:46:37.423 --> 01:46:46.209]  But I said that clearly, between them and the Anglo-American establishment, there is some real friction going on, and they say they don't want this new world banking system.
[01:46:46.209 --> 01:46:47.070]  They want a, quote,
[01:46:47.922 --> 01:46:50.823]  Multi-polar New World Order.
[01:46:50.823 --> 01:46:59.625]  So that's what I said, and I was clear about that, and I am against the sneak attack against Russian-held territories to try to start a new Cold War.
[01:46:59.625 --> 01:47:03.226]  Because I order out of chaos, and that's where I stand.
[01:47:03.226 --> 01:47:07.367]  And I don't care if people say I'm a liar and that Russia snuck attacked Georgia.
[01:47:07.367 --> 01:47:08.168]  I know the truth.
[01:47:08.168 --> 01:47:08.988]  We have the facts.
[01:47:08.988 --> 01:47:11.108]  It's even admitted by the State Department now.
[01:47:11.108 --> 01:47:12.789]  And I'll just tell the truth no matter what it is.
[01:47:14.381 --> 01:47:17.502]  I'm not indoctrinated in all this phony anti-Russian garbage.
[01:47:17.502 --> 01:47:19.343]  Our government put the commies in there.
[01:47:19.343 --> 01:47:21.864]  They slaughtered 60 million good Russian people.
[01:47:21.864 --> 01:47:23.645]  The new order gave them the nuclear weapons.
[01:47:23.645 --> 01:47:26.206]  The new order propped the whole thing up.
[01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:26.606]  Okay?
[01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.807]  And now we're in a whole different system.
[01:47:28.807 --> 01:47:31.329]  Does that answer your question?
[01:47:31.329 --> 01:47:38.992]  Yeah, except for the fact that the Russians, according to, you know, a lot of people, shouldn't have been in Georgia to begin with.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:46.555]  So you're telling me what happened there was good?
[01:47:46.555 --> 01:47:59.382]  I'm not saying either way, but I'm glad you made it clear that you're not necessarily saying that Russia is on track, and you're not necessarily thinking about evacuating to Russia, right?
[01:47:59.382 --> 01:48:01.584]  That's smart-ass.
[01:48:01.584 --> 01:48:01.984]  You know what?
[01:48:01.984 --> 01:48:03.145]  You're going to get everything you want.
[01:48:03.145 --> 01:48:04.645]  You're going to get your New World Order.
[01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:05.346]  No, I don't want it.
[01:48:06.295 --> 01:48:07.115]  Absolutely not.
[01:48:07.115 --> 01:48:10.557]  Look, you know good and well I'm not evacuating to Russia.
[01:48:10.557 --> 01:48:10.937]  Okay.
[01:48:10.937 --> 01:48:12.637]  Never been to Russia.
[01:48:12.637 --> 01:48:13.718]  Okay, I just wanted to make sure.
[01:48:13.718 --> 01:48:15.218]  Now hold on just a minute!
[01:48:15.218 --> 01:48:20.420]  A month ago I was secretly trained in Al Qaeda base camps by the by the neocons.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:23.041]  Are you saying I'm a Russian agent?
[01:48:23.041 --> 01:48:23.841]  No.
[01:48:23.841 --> 01:48:25.682]  Thank you for the call.
[01:48:25.682 --> 01:48:28.903]  Listen, you're not gonna have to worry about Alex Jones, okay?
[01:48:28.903 --> 01:48:31.344]  You got real fascism coming down on you.
[01:48:32.355 --> 01:48:39.106]  Look, I'm in a really bad mood today, and I'm not in a mood to have my buttons pushed, I'll tell you right now.
[01:48:39.106 --> 01:48:44.534]  No, I think Mexico's gonna totally implode as well, it already is, so that would probably be where I would go to.
[01:48:44.534 --> 01:48:45.656]  But I don't have a lot of money.
[01:48:46.929 --> 01:48:48.550]  And I'm not talking about myself going.
[01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:54.772]  I mean, if they're running around arresting people, if it starts getting to that, I will get my family out of here, you dumbass.
[01:48:54.772 --> 01:48:55.872]  Excuse me.
[01:48:55.872 --> 01:48:56.913]  I apologize, folks.
[01:48:56.913 --> 01:49:06.696]  I just can't take how weak this country is, and how pathetic and slimy our own movement is, and all the nitpicking and garbage!
[01:49:06.696 --> 01:49:07.916]  I'm True Blue!
[01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:08.997]  I'm for real!
[01:49:08.997 --> 01:49:10.157]  And you know it!
[01:49:10.157 --> 01:49:13.438]  And a lot of you cowards don't like it!
[01:49:13.438 --> 01:49:14.859]  You're cowards!
[01:49:16.443 --> 01:49:22.166]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming, finding the right gift can be tough.
[01:49:22.166 --> 01:49:24.907]  Why not give the gift of an Excalibur dehydrator?

[01:50:18.368 --> 01:50:21.130]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:23.112]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:50:23.112 --> 01:50:24.693]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:50:24.693 --> 01:50:26.334]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:50:26.334 --> 01:50:29.257]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:50:29.257 --> 01:50:32.879]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:50:42.514 --> 01:50:47.444]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.843]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.

[01:51:29.043 --> 01:51:32.765]  Or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:51:32.765 --> 01:51:33.546]  Question.
[01:51:33.546 --> 01:51:40.771]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[01:52:22.046 --> 01:52:24.287]  Look, I'm not personally mad at that last caller.
[01:52:24.287 --> 01:52:27.968]  I just don't have time for all the games anymore.
[01:52:27.968 --> 01:52:34.470]  I'm not even calling you a coward, but all these church ladies and all these phony people, they seem so satisfied.
[01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:37.250]  They seem so happy.
[01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:41.211]  They're not worried about nothing.
[01:52:41.211 --> 01:52:46.313]  If you really care about what's happening and you know anything about what's going on, you're freaked out right now.
[01:52:51.045 --> 01:52:55.606]  The United States, through Georgia, launched a sneak attack on South Ossetia.
[01:52:55.606 --> 01:52:58.807]  It's been held by Russia for close to 300 years.
[01:52:58.807 --> 01:53:03.688]  It's an international peace agreement in 91.
[01:53:03.688 --> 01:53:06.028]  Russians have been there ever since that.
[01:53:06.028 --> 01:53:10.989]  They snuck attack them, and you call in and ask if I'm a Ruski.
[01:53:10.989 --> 01:53:12.450]  I mean, that's so ridiculous.
[01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:13.050]  I'm reaching out.
[01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:17.851]  When I go on these shows, on British and on French and on Iranian TV,
[01:53:18.906 --> 01:53:29.208]  I go on there and I explain, this is not the American people, this is the bankers out of England who've seized us, this is not in our name, and I talk about the free market and liberty and freedom.
[01:53:29.208 --> 01:53:35.909]  That's my message, it's always the same, it's from the heart, it's from my soul, and it isn't about me all day long.
[01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:43.691]  I'm talking about the media saying we've got this messianic leader, Barack Obama, and I mean, you know,
[01:53:45.774 --> 01:53:52.077]  People subconsciously don't want to hear about the responsibility I'm trying to get them to accept here on air.
[01:53:52.077 --> 01:53:54.538]  To fight back, to speak out.
[01:53:54.538 --> 01:53:56.819]  And so, you can pull up on me, whatever you want.
[01:53:56.819 --> 01:54:01.461]  I had a lot of tension earlier.
[01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:04.723]  I feel better after I blew up, though.
[01:54:04.723 --> 01:54:06.363]  Oh, Will in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:54:06.363 --> 01:54:08.204]  Go ahead.
[01:54:08.204 --> 01:54:09.625]  Can I call Alex?
[01:54:09.625 --> 01:54:12.666]  It's my second time on the air with you.
[01:54:12.666 --> 01:54:14.427]  You know, out here in Colorado,
[01:54:15.453 --> 01:54:22.118]  Um, you know, I'm in Boulder and it's pretty much a prototype for the kind of things that you talk about.
[01:54:22.118 --> 01:54:24.379]  It's, uh, you know, we got our EnviroCops out here.
[01:54:24.379 --> 01:54:32.845]  We got, uh, you know, last night the streets were just mobbed with all types of people getting drunk and feeling cool about Obama and it was pretty depressing.
[01:54:32.845 --> 01:54:43.752]  It's a tough day for the InfoWarriors today, but I just want to, you know, I guess call it and say that I'm not a Christian, but I got to believe that there's some angels watching over us or something, because something's got to give here.
[01:54:45.741 --> 01:54:47.842]  Let me say this for the people who just tuned in.
[01:54:47.842 --> 01:54:49.723]  We're not sad that McCain lost.
[01:54:49.723 --> 01:54:59.709]  We're sad that people were suckered by Obama into the left-right paradigm and that they are openly announcing world government where we will pay our taxes to the bankers.
[01:54:59.709 --> 01:55:01.770]  Ron Paul was on at the start of the show.
[01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:02.911]  I mean, I mean, this is horrible!
[01:55:02.911 --> 01:55:04.092]  It's all happening!
[01:55:04.092 --> 01:55:05.793]  These people are eugenicists!
[01:55:05.793 --> 01:55:07.714]  They're poisoning our water!
[01:55:07.714 --> 01:55:11.356]  And I got people calling up saying it's prophecy and asking if I'm a Russian agent!
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:29.751]  Well, I know that last call was not easy for you to handle, but I do appreciate the fact that it did clear up a little bit of my questions about the article on InfoWars about Medvedev supporting New World Order, because it seemed a little contradictory to some of Webster's points earlier.
[01:55:29.751 --> 01:55:33.374]  But I just... Overall, Alex... They all say they want a New World Order.
[01:55:33.374 --> 01:55:35.615]  They argue about how they want it set up.
[01:55:35.615 --> 01:55:37.717]  I just said they're a separate branch of it.
[01:55:37.717 --> 01:55:38.777]  I said that last hour.
[01:55:38.777 --> 01:55:39.558]  I said that this hour.
[01:55:40.593 --> 01:55:41.894]  No, I got it.
[01:55:41.894 --> 01:55:43.395]  It's crystal clear.
[01:55:43.395 --> 01:55:47.377]  I appreciate that question being asked.
[01:55:47.377 --> 01:55:47.977]  Let me say this.
[01:55:47.977 --> 01:55:50.358]  I appreciate all of you.
[01:55:50.358 --> 01:55:55.421]  I'm just very upset right now by the mind control I see the public under.
[01:55:55.421 --> 01:55:58.923]  Well, I just want to say that I've never doubted your message, Alex.
[01:55:58.923 --> 01:56:02.364]  I've been trying to talk to people about shower government since I was 18.
[01:56:02.364 --> 01:56:04.986]  I'm 32 right now.
[01:56:04.986 --> 01:56:09.288]  If I had it my way, I'd stop everything I'm doing, quit all my jobs and everything, and
[01:56:10.091 --> 01:56:13.813]  I devote all my time to what you do, which is researching and trying to spread the word.
[01:56:13.813 --> 01:56:14.653]  Well, thank you.
[01:56:14.653 --> 01:56:16.274]  It's not just that we have a shadow government.
[01:56:16.274 --> 01:56:17.334]  They're coming out now.
[01:56:17.334 --> 01:56:19.035]  They're taking over.
[01:56:19.035 --> 01:56:20.896]  That's what's crazy about it.
[01:56:20.896 --> 01:56:24.777]  You've got Good Morning America talking about shadow government this morning.
[01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:28.079]  They're openly discussing Illuminati on national media.
[01:56:28.819 --> 01:56:43.252]  Yeah, people, I try to talk to people about it, and they still just, you know, they got thumbs up their butts and say how they love socialism when it's not even what we're getting, and it's just, I don't even know where to go other than to listen to your show and, you know, just try to talk some to the people, but, you know, it's frustrating.
[01:56:43.252 --> 01:56:44.173]  Anyway, I appreciate it.
[01:56:44.173 --> 01:56:45.234]  I want to take up more of your time.
[01:56:45.234 --> 01:56:46.055]  God bless you.
[01:56:46.055 --> 01:56:48.577]  Oh, no, it's your time, too, brother.
[01:56:48.577 --> 01:56:51.920]  Mike, Chris, Don, William.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.762]  I, the evil Russian agent, will be right back.
[01:56:57.794 --> 01:57:01.196]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:01.196 --> 01:57:06.498]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:06.498 --> 01:57:09.639]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:57:09.639 --> 01:57:13.221]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:13.221 --> 01:57:15.842]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:15.842 --> 01:57:17.403]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:17.403 --> 01:57:18.183]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:18.183 --> 01:57:19.164]  This is his MO.
[01:57:19.164 --> 01:57:20.584]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:20.584 --> 01:57:22.005]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:22.546 --> 01:57:29.712]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:29.712 --> 01:57:30.173]  Some U.S.
[01:57:30.173 --> 01:57:36.539]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:36.539 --> 01:57:39.982]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:40.222 --> 01:57:50.506]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:57:50.506 --> 01:57:51.726]  Fabled enemies.

[01:57:59.489 --> 01:58:02.850]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:08.977 --> 01:58:11.358]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:11.358 --> 01:58:20.742]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:20.742 --> 01:58:22.062]  Big Brother.
[01:58:22.062 --> 01:58:23.823]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:23.823 --> 01:58:25.583]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:25.583 --> 01:58:27.164]  You want answers?
[01:58:27.164 --> 01:58:28.044]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:28.044 --> 01:58:32.906]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:32.906 --> 01:58:37.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:39.053 --> 01:58:44.616]  Everything foretold, everything the New World Order worked for is now openly being announced.
[01:58:44.616 --> 01:58:59.444]  World government run for and by a private group of banks openly looting trillions of dollars a month on taxpayers' backs, telling the mindless mobs of zombies that the money's for them when none of it's being given to the morons.
[01:58:59.444 --> 01:59:01.005]  Just unbelievable evil.
[01:59:04.528 --> 01:59:06.388]  And I blew up earlier.
[01:59:06.388 --> 01:59:17.610]  It's just that to know the truth, to know how evil the rule of order is, to know they control both parties, to see people being suckered and to have idiots telling me, oh, you just don't like black people and you just don't like the Democrats.
[01:59:17.610 --> 01:59:18.910]  It's not about that.
[01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:23.291]  Obama's for the torture, the open borders, gun control.
[01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:24.431]  He's for more wars.
[01:59:24.431 --> 01:59:25.692]  He's for carbon taxes.
[01:59:25.692 --> 01:59:27.092]  You know what that's going to do to you?
[01:59:27.092 --> 01:59:31.753]  These idiots here are talking about shutting down and bankrupting energy companies.
[01:59:31.753 --> 01:59:32.573]  They're not going to do that.
[01:59:32.573 --> 01:59:33.633]  They're going to tax you.
[01:59:35.737 --> 01:59:39.119]  We're going to micromanage every facet of your life.
[01:59:39.119 --> 01:59:42.920]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:43.821]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:59:43.821 --> 01:59:44.301]  I'm alright.
[01:59:44.301 --> 01:59:45.462]  Alright, friend.
[01:59:45.462 --> 01:59:46.442]  Yeah, we spoke yesterday.
[01:59:46.442 --> 01:59:50.304]  Everything got cut off, so I couldn't continue to ask you some more questions.
[01:59:50.304 --> 01:59:57.287]  But, um, I guess the most important question I have is what are the options we, uh, do you have in place just in case they shut you down?
[01:59:57.287 --> 02:00:02.530]  I remember you were talking about setting up some other things, maybe a phone thing or some kind of, uh, I don't know, maybe some
[02:00:03.274 --> 02:00:04.214]  Radio, I don't know.
[02:00:04.214 --> 02:00:05.135]  What do you have in place?
[02:00:05.135 --> 02:00:13.558]  Well, we put in a system where people can call in 512-646-5000, and that's limited to 188 lines or something.
[02:00:13.558 --> 02:00:14.678]  But that's just... 512... 646.
[02:00:14.678 --> 02:00:15.839]  646.
[02:00:15.839 --> 02:00:16.159]  5000.
[02:00:16.159 --> 02:00:18.140]  5000.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:30.644]  And, uh, I am, um... I mean, they're openly announcing ways they're going to shut down the free internet, ways to shut down mainline talk radio, but they'll keep Limbaugh and stuff on.
[02:00:30.644 --> 02:00:32.385]  I mean, they're just coming for everything, man.
[02:00:34.543 --> 02:00:47.732]  My next question, and I know you're focusing on everyone, but since I come from the hood or South Central and represent the black community, why in your opinion do black folks consistently vote
[02:00:51.242 --> 02:00:54.024]  Well, things have changed.
[02:00:54.024 --> 02:01:00.851]  We've gone from 90% legitimacy in the black community to 92% illegitimacy.
[02:01:00.851 --> 02:01:03.814]  One in three black males is in prison.
[02:01:03.814 --> 02:01:06.316]  They've sent an evil corporate culture.
[02:01:06.316 --> 02:01:07.377]  They openly broke up
[02:01:08.172 --> 02:01:09.433]  Uh, with the eugenics.
[02:01:09.433 --> 02:01:12.355]  I've done it to everybody now, but they tested it on the blacks.
[02:01:12.355 --> 02:01:14.697]  And, uh, they're poverty pimps, and they're there to control them.
[02:01:14.697 --> 02:01:17.438]  And I'm not even saying blacks should have voted for John McCain.
[02:01:17.438 --> 02:01:19.700]  My whole thing is, it's the policies.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:24.823]  Barack Obama is slick, and is better spoken, and looks different.
[02:01:24.823 --> 02:01:31.848]  So, he's gonna be able to carry the ball for the same people George Bush was carrying the ball for, just a lot worse.
[02:01:31.848 --> 02:01:36.631]  And, uh, you know, I don't blame black folks wanting a black president, seeing that as a milestone.
[02:01:36.631 --> 02:01:37.712]  What's gonna be sad is,
[02:01:38.512 --> 02:01:40.913]  When they're done with Barack Obama, they're going to destroy him, too!
[02:01:40.913 --> 02:01:43.995]  And it's going to be very, you know, they're going to try to embarrass blacks with that.
[02:01:43.995 --> 02:01:46.196]  I mean, isn't that just disgusting?
[02:01:46.196 --> 02:01:46.956]  I definitely agree.
[02:01:46.956 --> 02:01:57.081]  You kind of addressed it in that last statement you made, because I was going to ask you, does Obama realize that he won't be able to keep the promises, or does he believe in what he says?
[02:01:57.081 --> 02:01:57.461]  No, no, no.
[02:01:57.461 --> 02:01:59.062]  He's already saying it's going to hurt.
[02:01:59.062 --> 02:02:00.402]  There's going to be austerity.
[02:02:00.402 --> 02:02:01.483]  There's going to be sacrifice.
[02:02:01.483 --> 02:02:03.764]  I'm going to do things you don't like.
[02:02:03.764 --> 02:02:05.965]  Because he's going to have wars and everything else.
[02:02:07.478 --> 02:02:09.140]  Because he's a puppet.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:11.202]  They wouldn't let him in there.
[02:02:11.202 --> 02:02:15.225]  It's not that they're just running things.
[02:02:15.225 --> 02:02:20.870]  It's that he is for it all.
[02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:28.377]  And how long will it take for people in general to realize that this man didn't keep his promise?
[02:02:28.377 --> 02:02:29.358]  Well, we'll see.
[02:02:29.358 --> 02:02:30.960]  A lot of people are wedded to him now.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:33.182]  Just like Republicans wouldn't wake up to George Bush being evil.
[02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:38.068]  How was open borders and tripling the size of government and gun control conservative?
[02:02:38.068 --> 02:02:40.689]  They said, well, we, you know, we bet on Bush.
[02:02:40.689 --> 02:02:41.469]  We voted for him.
[02:02:41.469 --> 02:02:42.209]  He's our man.
[02:02:42.209 --> 02:02:43.810]  You're an evil liberal, Alex.
[02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:45.831]  You just don't like conservatives.
[02:02:45.831 --> 02:02:46.771]  I even know all these emails.
[02:02:46.771 --> 02:02:49.792]  You don't like white people because you're not for George Bush.
[02:02:49.792 --> 02:02:51.653]  You know, they're racist whites.
[02:02:51.653 --> 02:02:53.493]  And I was like, no, no, no.
[02:02:53.493 --> 02:02:54.054]  He's a puppet.
[02:02:54.054 --> 02:02:54.734]  He's a puppet.
[02:02:54.734 --> 02:02:56.835]  Well, now it's the same thing with Barack Obama.
[02:02:56.835 --> 02:02:58.475]  It's just now they're saying I'm a fascist.
[02:02:58.475 --> 02:02:58.916]  You understand?
[02:03:01.298 --> 02:03:02.459]  Um, can I hang on?
[02:03:02.459 --> 02:03:03.199]  Yeah, just real quick.
[02:03:03.199 --> 02:03:03.759]  We'll come back to you.
[02:03:03.759 --> 02:03:04.300]  Let me finish up.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:09.863]  And Chris, Don, William, Aaron, and others, uh... I'm very tired, folks.
[02:03:09.863 --> 02:03:10.563]  I'm very upset.
[02:03:10.563 --> 02:03:11.984]  I'm sorry about that blew up earlier.
[02:03:16.598 --> 02:03:18.258]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:18.258 --> 02:03:23.020]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:25.981]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:03:25.981 --> 02:03:29.021]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:29.021 --> 02:03:34.863]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:03:35.163 --> 02:03:40.947]  Our elective representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:40.947 --> 02:03:42.789]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:42.789 --> 02:03:46.752]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[02:03:46.752 --> 02:03:49.574]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:49.574 --> 02:03:58.721]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[02:03:58.721 --> 02:04:03.184]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[02:04:03.444 --> 02:04:05.786]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:04:05.786 --> 02:04:10.249]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:10.249 --> 02:04:15.933]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:15.933 --> 02:04:19.176]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:19.176 --> 02:04:22.318]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:22.538 --> 02:04:24.340]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:28.423]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:28.423 --> 02:04:32.547]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:32.547 --> 02:04:40.093]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:40.093 --> 02:04:44.036]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:44.036 --> 02:04:46.899]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:47.259 --> 02:04:54.241]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:54.241 --> 02:04:57.523]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:58.443]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:04:58.443 --> 02:05:02.664]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:23.975]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:05:23.975 --> 02:05:32.760]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.661]  Again, what I'm bummed out about
[02:05:35.538 --> 02:05:38.539]  It's the fact that Obama went back on all his promises.
[02:05:38.539 --> 02:05:40.800]  He says, get ready to basically be sucked dry.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:47.401]  They're gonna attack the middle class, the people that give everybody their jobs.
[02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:51.983]  Hand all that money over to the trillionaire bankers.
[02:05:51.983 --> 02:05:54.183]  And people can say, well, there's a good message here.
[02:05:54.183 --> 02:05:56.484]  We got 80-some percent turnout.
[02:05:56.484 --> 02:05:58.345]  The public said no to all the Bush policies.
[02:05:58.345 --> 02:05:59.105]  That's right.
[02:05:59.105 --> 02:06:02.926]  It is positive in a way, but then it's not because they got suckered.
[02:06:04.186 --> 02:06:11.612]  But, yes, the good news is, down the road, the Democrats, when the wars are continuing and everything's happening, they're finally going to get it.
[02:06:11.612 --> 02:06:14.314]  I mean, the left-right paradigm has been breaking down more and more.
[02:06:14.314 --> 02:06:18.497]  This is kind of a last gasp of it, but that's why they're throwing everything behind Obama.
[02:06:18.497 --> 02:06:30.386]  And, I mean, any time the media that's owned by the bomb makers and the bankers starts, in the military industrial complex, starts calling somebody the one, and starts calling him the leader and the world president,
[02:06:31.121 --> 02:06:33.463]  That's because he's going to lead us right into the death of the dollar.
[02:06:33.463 --> 02:06:36.085]  They're talking about that in three months.
[02:06:36.085 --> 02:06:37.046]  They're announcing it.
[02:06:37.046 --> 02:06:40.389]  See, there's no more cop-outs anymore, folks.
[02:06:40.389 --> 02:06:48.216]  There's so many world leaders calling for a new world order and so many big bankers saying the banks are going to run everything and be the world government, as they always said they would.
[02:06:48.216 --> 02:06:50.358]  Huh.
[02:06:50.358 --> 02:06:52.881]  There's no more copping out.
[02:06:52.881 --> 02:06:56.504]  Meanwhile, everybody's giggling and smirking and laughing and acting like Jesus just landed.
[02:06:58.879 --> 02:07:00.560]  It's just amazing.
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:04.381]  I want to get to Don William, Aaron, and others.
[02:07:04.381 --> 02:07:07.663]  We got some economic news coming up here in a minute.
[02:07:07.663 --> 02:07:09.484]  But who was I just talking to?
[02:07:09.484 --> 02:07:13.726]  I was talking to Mike in California, wasn't I?
[02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:16.047]  Okay, he's still there, right?
[02:07:16.047 --> 02:07:18.989]  Mike, finish up briefly because I've got to move on.
[02:07:18.989 --> 02:07:19.689]  Sorry about that.
[02:07:19.689 --> 02:07:21.510]  I had so many questions.
[02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:22.470]  Oh no, you're a great caller.
[02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:23.111]  Everybody's great.
[02:07:23.111 --> 02:07:23.311]  Go ahead.
[02:07:24.702 --> 02:07:43.127]  Alright, now, being that, okay, you got America, you got Britain and France, they're kind of allies, I guess, in this whole thing, in order for them to interject this new financial system, wouldn't they have to get or eliminate, I guess, Russia and China's influence or power?
[02:07:43.127 --> 02:07:45.388]  And I'll try to ask one more question after that.
[02:07:45.388 --> 02:07:46.428]  Go ahead.
[02:07:46.428 --> 02:07:48.469]  Man, that's a super complex question.
[02:07:50.041 --> 02:07:57.944]  They're not trying to eliminate any, they're expanding all governments' power.
[02:07:57.944 --> 02:08:01.606]  All governments want more power, more control, so they're all getting more and more evil.
[02:08:01.606 --> 02:08:03.847]  That's the nature of government.
[02:08:03.847 --> 02:08:12.751]  But yes, the Anglo-American establishment is going to sacrifice the United States, economically in our name, on the altar of a larger world government.
[02:08:12.751 --> 02:08:18.293]  So we're about to see the decline of the United States, by design, with the globalists running it, Obama saying that,
[02:08:19.412 --> 02:08:21.433]  Uh, and all the other leaders are saying it.
[02:08:21.433 --> 02:08:26.275]  Into the larger official world government, which Russia and China will be part of.
[02:08:26.275 --> 02:08:42.863]  Alright, my last question is, uh, what is the difference between, you know, an Obama-type socialism, or the type of socialism that he represents on the left, on the left, and the kind of socialism that McCain advocated for on the right?
[02:08:42.863 --> 02:08:48.546]  Really, if you look at the real policies, there was almost no difference, just different, different ways that they put it, different rhetoric.
[02:08:50.018 --> 02:08:57.481]  Uh, just like Ron Paul said at the start of the show, and that'll re-air at the end of the show today on the internet, you'll be able to hear Ron Paul right at the start of the show, bombshell interview.
[02:08:57.481 --> 02:09:05.664]  Uh, he broke it all down and said that McCain was just a backup guy, that the system had this stage, that they'd been grooming Obama for a long time.
[02:09:05.664 --> 02:09:12.106]  This stuff is thought out by the social engineers and the think tanks openly, and then the President's just carry it out.
[02:09:12.106 --> 02:09:14.647]  That's what I'm saying, and I feel so sorry for black folks that think
[02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:16.771]  Because I mean, I don't blame black folks.
[02:09:16.771 --> 02:09:21.854]  If I was, you know, especially if I was black, I would, you know, want to think, oh my gosh, you know, we're real equality.
[02:09:21.854 --> 02:09:24.656]  But no, no, no, it's actually just going to get worse for everybody.
[02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:27.318]  And now they're going to say, see, blacks have got equality now.
[02:09:27.318 --> 02:09:34.262]  And then Obama's going to have left cover to keep putting all the black folks in prison, to keep the phony drug laws in place.
[02:09:34.262 --> 02:09:36.164]  You watch, it's going to get worse for black people.
[02:09:36.164 --> 02:09:37.444]  You just watch.
[02:09:37.444 --> 02:09:39.766]  You do realize that blacks suffer.
[02:09:40.459 --> 02:09:43.961]  A higher degree of brainwashing than, let's say, you know, white people.
[02:09:43.961 --> 02:09:44.661]  I mean, look at you.
[02:09:44.661 --> 02:09:46.983]  Look at you and your family and your family history.
[02:09:46.983 --> 02:09:56.408]  You wouldn't know what you know or have the instincts that you have if your family or your family tree was enslaved and, I guess, you know, deprived.
[02:09:56.408 --> 02:09:57.209]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:09:57.209 --> 02:10:00.350]  And I'm not attacking my family tree, because that was the way of the world.
[02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:05.073]  But in my family tree, there were, at least in their regions, aggressive, dominant,
[02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:07.270]  King, kingpins.
[02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:15.176]  And so, and so king rats and kingpins, and I've actually had some, you know, back in the, they pass on the real tricks.
[02:10:15.176 --> 02:10:28.006]  And so it's not, and then, and then I've got a good family down the line, but, but, but again, it's that world smart, street smart of people that have been more middle class than absolutely people who were taken off a slave boat.
[02:10:28.006 --> 02:10:28.947]  You're absolutely right.
[02:10:28.947 --> 02:10:29.988]  No, no, you're absolutely right.
[02:10:31.164 --> 02:10:39.350]  Yeah, because, you know, you have the 300-year period where blacks are physically enslaved, and then another hundred and something years of financial sanctions where they couldn't work.
[02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:41.231]  I guess you call it the Jim Corry era.
[02:10:41.231 --> 02:10:42.472]  But let me ask you one question.
[02:10:42.472 --> 02:10:45.414]  Hold on, that's an important point, but it was more than that.
[02:10:45.414 --> 02:10:47.536]  On average, half the people grabbed in Africa.
[02:10:48.724 --> 02:10:50.905]  A lot of times they were grabbed in the interior.
[02:10:50.905 --> 02:10:54.928]  They were tied up and marched hundreds of miles.
[02:10:54.928 --> 02:10:56.169]  I've actually read the histories of this.
[02:10:56.169 --> 02:10:57.449]  It's very interesting.
[02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:58.490]  That's why I got into history.
[02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:59.371]  It's riveting.
[02:10:59.371 --> 02:11:01.492]  I mean, history is a lot better than fiction.
[02:11:01.492 --> 02:11:08.816]  And they would march them 200, 300, 400 miles to the coast.
[02:11:08.816 --> 02:11:09.917]  They would normally try to escape.
[02:11:09.917 --> 02:11:10.817]  A lot of them were wounded.
[02:11:10.817 --> 02:11:13.199]  10% on average or more.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:19.221]  Uh, sometimes they get fevers and more would die, would die, uh, being marched.
[02:11:19.221 --> 02:11:24.002]  Then, half of those, so we're now 60%, would die on the way over.
[02:11:24.002 --> 02:11:26.003]  Because they wouldn't even feed them!
[02:11:26.003 --> 02:11:36.405]  The slave ships would just give them water, and they were down there with the rats, living for, on average, about two months, and then the ships got blown back by, uh, hurricanes or by storms.
[02:11:36.405 --> 02:11:37.045]  Everybody would die.
[02:11:37.954 --> 02:11:48.137]  Uh, and then sharks would follow the ships to and fro, uh, in the Caribbean, the Americas, uh, you know, to and fro Africa, especially from Africa.
[02:11:48.137 --> 02:11:59.301]  And so then they got here, and then the first social engineering of marriage licenses and feminism, putting the black women up above the men as the house slaves.
[02:11:59.301 --> 02:12:01.541]  And there's handbooks on this.
[02:12:01.541 --> 02:12:03.822]  And so, yes, that's what it is today.
[02:12:03.822 --> 02:12:06.443]  And those same systems, the Caesars,
[02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:32.374]  Developed in Rome over other slaves who are from all over the world Predominantly Caucasian and so the systems Look I've got to go, but yeah, I mean, it's just absolutely Absolutely horrible that all of this is happening, but but now we're all becoming slaves Go ahead and ask your last question
[02:12:34.848 --> 02:12:40.252]  Okay, what aspects of the Patriot Act should we fear the most?
[02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:43.934]  And can we actually link Obama as a supporter?
[02:12:43.934 --> 02:12:49.978]  The reason I'm asking is I want you to get information out to people so they can do their research and see just what he's about.
[02:12:49.978 --> 02:12:51.779]  Sure, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:51.779 --> 02:12:56.763]  Barack Obama is extremely powerful right now.
[02:12:56.763 --> 02:13:01.506]  He's the most powerful world leader, though he's a puppet, but he's the most powerful person
[02:13:02.905 --> 02:13:04.366]  In the world right now.
[02:13:04.366 --> 02:13:05.806]  On paper.
[02:13:05.806 --> 02:13:07.647]  A public political personality.
[02:13:07.647 --> 02:13:10.247]  He'll only have that for maybe six months to a year.
[02:13:10.247 --> 02:13:12.648]  Maybe not even that long.
[02:13:12.648 --> 02:13:17.490]  He's the most powerful person on the surface.
[02:13:17.490 --> 02:13:19.930]  The minute he doesn't do what they say, they'll kill him.
[02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:27.153]  But that's not a problem, he's one of them, so... It's a judisco.
[02:13:27.153 --> 02:13:30.374]  And... John, what was the question you was asking?
[02:13:30.374 --> 02:13:31.674]  I got off thinking about
[02:13:32.645 --> 02:13:34.867]  Barack Obama.
[02:13:34.867 --> 02:13:37.509]  I was asking about the Patriot Act.
[02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:40.132]  He said that he would repeal the Patriot Act.
[02:13:40.132 --> 02:13:40.592]  I don't remember.
[02:13:40.592 --> 02:13:42.814]  It was like a year ago when he was first running.
[02:13:42.814 --> 02:13:47.158]  He said that he would repeal the warrantless wiretapping.
[02:13:47.158 --> 02:13:51.502]  He said he would repeal a whole bunch of police state provisions and now he's saying he's not.
[02:13:51.502 --> 02:13:54.985]  So the point is, Democrats were all upset and wanted that stuff repealed.
[02:13:54.985 --> 02:13:58.268]  Okay, well now they got the House, the Senate, and the Executive.
[02:13:58.268 --> 02:13:59.169]  Let's see it repealed!
[02:14:00.091 --> 02:14:01.172]  Let's see it all repealed!
[02:14:01.172 --> 02:14:02.773]  All these leftists against the drug war?
[02:14:02.773 --> 02:14:03.494]  Good!
[02:14:03.494 --> 02:14:05.976]  Let's see it repealed!
[02:14:05.976 --> 02:14:07.697]  I want some change!
[02:14:07.697 --> 02:14:11.220]  What the people want, what's constitutional, what you promised!
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:17.125]  Not fake change of getting deeper into the New World Order.
[02:14:17.125 --> 02:14:18.366]  So that's it.
[02:14:18.366 --> 02:14:24.631]  Everything the Democrats didn't like and Bush did, rightfully, let's see it reversed now, because you got the power.
[02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:25.972]  You're in the driver's seat right now.
[02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:31.113]  But Obama has said he's not doing any of it, so there's the basic facts.
[02:14:31.113 --> 02:14:34.135]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up for this segment and part of the next, and then TARP was coming up.
[02:14:34.135 --> 02:14:35.495]  We'll get to all your calls.
[02:14:35.495 --> 02:14:39.416]  I said that call around for 15 minutes because it was a lot of important questions.
[02:14:39.416 --> 02:14:41.777]  Ted, I'm really freaked out today.
[02:14:41.777 --> 02:14:42.378]  I'm exhausted.
[02:14:42.378 --> 02:14:45.799]  I was up here until past midnight and doing a bunch of broadcasts.
[02:14:45.799 --> 02:14:49.400]  I'm kind of out of control today, and I'm freaked out that open world government's being announced.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.220]  I know you're freaked out.
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.461]  Dean Barclay lost last night.
[02:14:52.023 --> 02:14:54.585]  Only got 15% but we resisted and that's enough.
[02:14:54.585 --> 02:14:56.306]  So I want to thank all the listeners for that.
[02:14:56.306 --> 02:14:59.528]  But I wanted to get you up about financials.
[02:14:59.528 --> 02:15:01.669]  Gold has exploded, oil is exploding.
[02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:05.191]  They did that on purpose for the election, kept it down.
[02:15:05.191 --> 02:15:09.814]  They're talking about devaluing the dollar in January.
[02:15:09.814 --> 02:15:19.200]  Ted, people need to get gold coins and I just want to make it clear to the listeners that you have gold coins that you bought when gold was 50 bucks less than it is now.
[02:15:20.743 --> 02:15:26.185]  And so you're not tacking a premium on, you're not even selling gold for what it costs right now as it's gone up.
[02:15:26.185 --> 02:15:31.926]  When everywhere else it's at a 30, 40, 50 percent premium to get gold, you don't have a premium on it.
[02:15:31.926 --> 02:15:36.487]  You have it below the price it is when most dealers are still sold out, Ted.
[02:15:36.487 --> 02:15:42.309]  Yeah, that's, well, you know, I try to take advantage of everything I can, and when the prices get down there, I buy it up.
[02:15:42.309 --> 02:15:46.310]  Here's an example right here, and I've only got 30, and it's going to be a first come, first served thing.
[02:15:47.037 --> 02:15:51.184]  I've got Philharmonics, the Austrian Philharmonics.
[02:15:51.184 --> 02:15:55.791]  Right now, if I go into the marketplace and buy these from dealers, I pay $8.25.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:00.961]  Right now I can sell them to you guys for $800.
[02:16:00.961 --> 02:16:01.801]  Why can I do that?
[02:16:01.801 --> 02:16:04.061]  Because I bought it back when gold was lower.
[02:16:04.061 --> 02:16:06.182]  And I'm passing on the savings to you.
[02:16:06.182 --> 02:16:10.743]  That's $25 less than they cost me or any other dealer across the United States.
[02:16:10.743 --> 02:16:12.543]  You won't find them for less than that.
[02:16:12.543 --> 02:16:15.364]  That's the best price out there on the market bar none.
[02:16:15.364 --> 02:16:17.204]  But it's first come first serve.
[02:16:17.204 --> 02:16:19.105]  I also have a bunch of $10 Liberties at $673.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.683]  That is almost $100 less than what I'd be trading.
[02:16:24.683 --> 02:16:26.304]  I'm sorry, $10 Indians at $673.
[02:16:26.304 --> 02:16:32.528]  It's about $100 less than I'd be doing it if I just bought them out in the marketplace today.
[02:16:32.528 --> 02:16:34.769]  That's just a fabulous buy.
[02:16:34.769 --> 02:16:37.031]  Again, small fractional gold pieces.
[02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:39.052]  I'll just talk about what we talked about yesterday.
[02:16:39.672 --> 02:16:41.633]  Frank Coins at 198.
[02:16:41.633 --> 02:16:43.194]  You can't beat it.
[02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:47.537]  It's a coin that's small, it's portable, something you can trade for money.
[02:16:47.537 --> 02:16:48.558]  We all know what's great.
[02:16:48.558 --> 02:16:49.739]  You know, I was listening.
[02:16:49.739 --> 02:16:54.301]  I gotta say, Alex, right before I ran, I had to ship about 100 packages out this morning.
[02:16:54.301 --> 02:16:57.043]  And I was listening to you and Ron Paul.
[02:16:57.043 --> 02:16:58.244]  My blood was boiling.
[02:16:59.465 --> 02:17:04.970]  You know just that whole thing and I was I mean you guys the two of you put together Explaining this how it works.
[02:17:04.970 --> 02:17:05.770]  I mean it.
[02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:12.856]  I don't know why there's no Nobel Peace Prize for Nobel Prize for this I mean to explain what's really going on.
[02:17:12.856 --> 02:17:16.700]  Yeah all the all the nonsense we hear from mainstream media and
[02:17:17.621 --> 02:17:18.883]  They're there to neutralize.
[02:17:18.883 --> 02:17:20.184]  They're there to hurt you.
[02:17:20.184 --> 02:17:24.210]  Folks, they look at you with fake smiles.
[02:17:24.210 --> 02:17:27.674]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:17:27.674 --> 02:17:31.900]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:32.781]  Utopia, Texas.
[02:17:32.941 --> 02:17:33.682]  We're good to go.
[02:17:49.445 --> 02:17:49.925]  I think so.
[02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:14.524]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:18:14.524 --> 02:18:16.526]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:18:33.437 --> 02:18:34.978]  But who is the enemy?
[02:18:34.978 --> 02:18:35.779]  Bin Laden.
[02:18:35.779 --> 02:18:36.700]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.161]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:18:38.161 --> 02:18:40.142]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:40.142 --> 02:18:47.288]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:18:47.288 --> 02:18:47.788]  Some U.S.
[02:18:47.788 --> 02:18:54.133]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:18:54.133 --> 02:18:57.576]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:18:57.816 --> 02:19:08.106]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:19:08.106 --> 02:19:09.327]  Fabled enemies.

[02:19:16.874 --> 02:19:20.497]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:19:24.119 --> 02:19:25.660]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:27.500]  November 5th, 2008.
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:29.741]  Gold open this morning at $751.60.
[02:19:29.741 --> 02:19:33.202]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $774.79, $387.40 for the half ounce, and $193.70 for a quarter ounce.
[02:19:33.202 --> 02:19:33.602]  That's $774.79, $387.40, and $193.70.
[02:19:42.025 --> 02:19:47.748]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[02:19:47.748 --> 02:19:51.209]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[02:19:51.209 --> 02:19:52.130]  Bad news for U.S.
[02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.790]  currency.
[02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:54.951]  China, Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:56.512]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[02:19:56.512 --> 02:19:58.593]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[02:19:58.593 --> 02:19:59.753]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:19:59.753 --> 02:20:02.274]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[02:20:02.274 --> 02:20:04.215]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[02:20:04.215 --> 02:20:06.436]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[02:20:06.716 --> 02:20:07.717]  Why attack Iran?
[02:20:07.717 --> 02:20:10.560]  Jerome O. Corsi's Iran Leads Attack Against the U.S.
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:12.022]  Dollar Document spells it out.

[02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:19.050]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:24.033 --> 02:20:34.599]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:20:34.599 --> 02:20:36.019]  Garden in a can.

[02:20:40.162 --> 02:20:42.183]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[02:20:42.183 --> 02:20:44.484]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[02:20:57.250 --> 02:20:57.950]  Fresh.
[02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:58.810]  Healthy.
[02:20:58.810 --> 02:20:59.631]  Easy.
[02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:03.993]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe, fresh vegetables.
[02:21:03.993 --> 02:21:05.553]  Ready when you are.
[02:21:05.553 --> 02:21:09.095]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.
[02:21:11.732 --> 02:21:14.314]  Yeah, there's a lot of news we're not covering while this is going on.
[02:21:34.785 --> 02:21:38.448]  Two billion honeybees have died, that's the London Telegraph.
[02:21:38.448 --> 02:21:44.853]  The entire biosphere is starting to crumble.
[02:21:44.853 --> 02:21:50.898]  The very internationalists setting up a carbon tax on carbon dioxide are just destroying the environment everywhere.
[02:21:50.898 --> 02:21:56.783]  Reports are pouring in, in mainstream press reports and in Austin, people I personally know.
[02:21:57.663 --> 02:22:02.188]  Where their daughters, their sons are being given HPV shots without their consent.
[02:22:02.188 --> 02:22:09.976]  They're giving women after they have babies in Austin hospitals pills that sterilize them.
[02:22:09.976 --> 02:22:13.219]  I mean, the government's totally wicked.
[02:22:13.219 --> 02:22:17.323]  It's filled with mindless scum who do nothing but follow orders.
[02:22:17.323 --> 02:22:19.025]  We're under attack.
[02:22:19.025 --> 02:22:21.307]  We don't need Barack Obama the diversion.
[02:22:22.446 --> 02:22:24.087]  We have exposed the New World Order.
[02:22:24.087 --> 02:22:25.548]  We had the government being exposed.
[02:22:25.548 --> 02:22:27.170]  People didn't trust the bastards.
[02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:30.973]  And now they've fooled everybody with this new shill.
[02:22:30.973 --> 02:22:31.933]  That's why we're mad.
[02:22:31.933 --> 02:22:35.196]  No, we're not for John McCain either.
[02:22:35.196 --> 02:22:38.518]  We're against Obama because we knew he was the heir apparent.
[02:22:38.518 --> 02:22:40.320]  We're against whoever the man is for.
[02:22:43.146 --> 02:22:47.009]  GP gives cervical cancer vaccine to 13-year-old against parents' wishes.
[02:22:47.009 --> 02:22:48.750]  They just say, we don't care, we're doing it.
[02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:53.094]  The government is lawless scum with a bunch of... That's what fascism is.
[02:22:53.094 --> 02:22:55.575]  These nurses, these doctors, these... They're not even government.
[02:22:55.575 --> 02:22:56.716]  They just do what they're told.
[02:22:56.716 --> 02:22:58.197]  It's not even a law.
[02:22:58.197 --> 02:23:05.303]  Ted, I'm... Ron Paul off-air was very upset talking to me, um... And, um...
[02:23:06.224 --> 02:23:07.365]  Very powerful interview, folks.
[02:23:07.365 --> 02:23:08.987]  I hope everybody tunes in when the show ends.
[02:23:08.987 --> 02:23:10.029]  Webster Tarp is coming up.
[02:23:10.029 --> 02:23:11.430]  I want to finish up.
[02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:13.813]  I firmly believe in buying gold and silver.
[02:23:13.813 --> 02:23:16.236]  While it's been down, it's going back up.
[02:23:16.236 --> 02:23:19.079]  And that's all manipulated, the fact that they've been trying to keep it down.
[02:23:19.079 --> 02:23:19.780]  We've gone over that.
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:22.361]  You know what, I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:23:22.361 --> 02:23:25.523]  Finish up your point about the Ron Paul interview and then just give him the offer, Ted.
[02:23:25.523 --> 02:23:29.485]  Well, like I said, I mean, it just made my blood boil to listen to what's going on.
[02:23:29.485 --> 02:23:39.311]  I mean, it's not that I didn't already know, but when you hear it coming right from the Hill, and you know darn well that this is being fed to us, and you're right about that.
[02:23:39.311 --> 02:23:45.374]  Barack Obama, you know, habeas corpus and posse comitatus.
[02:23:45.374 --> 02:23:46.174]  What more do you need?
[02:23:46.174 --> 02:23:47.975]  Why should we give her the Patriot Act?
[02:23:47.975 --> 02:23:48.796]  What else do you want?
[02:23:49.296 --> 02:23:51.339]  I mean, there is enough information.
[02:23:51.339 --> 02:23:54.102]  Alex, it shouldn't even have to be questioned anymore.
[02:23:54.102 --> 02:24:01.490]  They're openly announcing more brigades for martial law, and the public's in denial!
[02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:03.753]  They're announcing world government everywhere!
[02:24:05.393 --> 02:24:06.473]  By the bankers!
[02:24:06.473 --> 02:24:08.534]  They're running everything!
[02:24:08.534 --> 02:24:10.915]  Paying taxes to these bastards!
[02:24:10.915 --> 02:24:11.876]  I'm sorry, Ted.
[02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:12.796]  That'll be it.
[02:24:12.796 --> 02:24:15.897]  I mean, just wait until that carbon tax comes out.
[02:24:15.897 --> 02:24:17.138]  Hundreds of them.
[02:24:17.138 --> 02:24:21.900]  That's going to be like 1913 here with the Federal Reserve Act all over again.
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:23.080]  They had created the Federal
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.641]  Even bigger, even bigger.
[02:24:24.641 --> 02:24:28.144]  Paying taxes, regulators, enviros, squads.
[02:24:28.144 --> 02:24:31.327]  Here in Austin, you can't park an SUV at Joker Park.
[02:24:31.327 --> 02:24:32.268]  They slice your tires.
[02:24:32.268 --> 02:24:33.789]  There's already little cult members.
[02:24:33.789 --> 02:24:35.490]  But they don't care about genetic engineering.
[02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:36.992]  They don't care about all the honeybees dying.
[02:24:36.992 --> 02:24:39.174]  They don't care about all the poison in our food.
[02:24:39.174 --> 02:24:42.997]  They are trained in class warfare to hate people that drive a nice car, you little dumb...
[02:24:43.809 --> 02:24:45.370]  You know what, Ted?
[02:24:45.370 --> 02:24:51.174]  Well, Alex, you cannot have world banking without a world tax, and that's what we're looking at running into here.
[02:24:51.174 --> 02:24:54.195]  That is the ultimate New World Order.
[02:24:54.195 --> 02:24:56.157]  That is what we're going to be answering to.
[02:24:56.157 --> 02:24:58.438]  The President of the United States is going to be a puppet.
[02:24:58.438 --> 02:25:06.523]  And that's why they're calling him President of the World, because he's going to be the titular head, the front man who brings us into this, and he's going to be hated.
[02:25:08.194 --> 02:25:12.036]  They know that's their job when they become president, and he knows what his job is.
[02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:21.382]  I feel so sorry for black folks especially because, you know, I would love to support a black leader who was a great patriot, or a white guy who was a great patriot like Ron Paul, but Ted, real fast, we've got two minutes left.
[02:25:21.382 --> 02:25:24.263]  The coins are an insane deal.
[02:25:24.263 --> 02:25:32.408]  That Philharmonic you're not going to get, I don't care, you can call every single gold dealer in the United States today, there isn't one of them out there that has it for less.
[02:25:32.408 --> 02:25:34.729]  Eight hundred bucks for Philharmonics, that's it.
[02:25:35.249 --> 02:25:37.090]  The frank coin, a great buy.
[02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:38.311]  I wouldn't forget the silver.
[02:25:38.311 --> 02:25:41.253]  Right now, the silver dimes are $1.56.
[02:25:41.253 --> 02:25:50.879]  You just, at this time, the world, I mean, the United States dollar is no longer going to be looked at upon as not only just a world currency.
[02:25:50.879 --> 02:25:54.581]  We'll be lucky to use it here for items, goods, and services.
[02:25:54.581 --> 02:25:58.783]  I mean, they're just throwing money at these... Yeah, real, obviously, people need to call and get it now.
[02:25:58.783 --> 02:25:59.784]  Now, what about those Indians?
[02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:00.765]  You said you have Indians?
[02:26:00.765 --> 02:26:02.046]  Oh yeah, $10 Indians.
[02:26:02.046 --> 02:26:04.849]  I mean, that was a real quick buy that I was able to grab.
[02:26:04.849 --> 02:26:06.010]  You can't even find those.
[02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:06.951]  How many of those do you have?
[02:26:06.951 --> 02:26:10.915]  Well, I probably, I bet I can do 500 of them before I have to stop.
[02:26:10.915 --> 02:26:11.716]  I'll hold on to it.
[02:26:11.716 --> 02:26:14.459]  I'll probably get that sold before the end of the day.
[02:26:14.459 --> 02:26:15.520]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:15.880]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:27.131]  Alex, supplies in gold and silver are so tight right now.
[02:26:27.131 --> 02:26:30.694]  Folks, Ted, they bolstered the economy for the election.
[02:26:30.694 --> 02:26:32.075]  They are going to flush it.
[02:26:32.075 --> 02:26:33.456]  Everybody's saying that.
[02:26:33.456 --> 02:26:39.681]  They're talking about a new Bretton Woods, getting rid of the dollar as the reserve currency openly and in the Boston Globe and AP.
[02:26:40.702 --> 02:26:41.743]  Uh, in three months.
[02:26:41.743 --> 02:26:46.686]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you better take advantage of this now, or you are insane.
[02:26:46.686 --> 02:26:47.026]  800-686-2237.
[02:26:47.026 --> 02:26:47.226]  800-686-2237.
[02:26:47.226 --> 02:26:55.851]  So you got Franks, you got Indians, you got Philharmonics.
[02:26:55.851 --> 02:26:57.092]  What do you got in silver?
[02:26:57.092 --> 02:26:59.273]  Silver, the dimes are the best buy right now, Alex.
[02:26:59.273 --> 02:27:01.754]  It's the most silver for the money at this time.
[02:27:01.754 --> 02:27:04.196]  Alright, well, I want one or two of those Indians.
[02:27:04.196 --> 02:27:05.717]  You know, once a month I buy one or two coins.
[02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:08.359]  Save me a couple of those Indians, Ted, okay?
[02:27:08.359 --> 02:27:08.759]  Sure will.
[02:27:08.759 --> 02:27:10.961]  800-686-237.
[02:27:10.961 --> 02:27:14.524]  Get Webster Tarpling on them, introduce him when we come back.
[02:27:14.524 --> 02:27:15.925]  We're on the march.
[02:27:15.925 --> 02:27:18.447]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:18.447 --> 02:27:24.492]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:24.492 --> 02:27:31.438]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[02:27:32.239 --> 02:27:33.501]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:27:33.501 --> 02:27:39.848]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:27:40.524 --> 02:27:49.431]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:27:49.431 --> 02:27:56.516]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:27:56.516 --> 02:27:59.699]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:27:59.699 --> 02:28:05.483]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:28:05.483 --> 02:28:08.065]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:28:08.545 --> 02:28:14.472]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:28:14.472 --> 02:28:17.536]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:28:17.536 --> 02:28:22.422]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:28:23.755 --> 02:28:27.177]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:28:27.177 --> 02:28:29.498]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:28:29.498 --> 02:28:32.800]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:39.684]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:28:39.684 --> 02:28:41.805]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:28:42.285 --> 02:28:45.588]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:28:45.588 --> 02:28:50.372]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:28:50.372 --> 02:28:54.316]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:28:54.316 --> 02:28:55.937]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:29:24.096 --> 02:29:27.439]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[02:29:27.439 --> 02:29:35.185]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[02:29:35.185 --> 02:29:43.012]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[02:29:43.012 --> 02:29:49.938]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[02:29:49.938 --> 02:29:50.578]  Please call 1-9-1.
[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:20.035]  Folks, I'm bummed out because they're openly announcing world government for and by the private banks.
[02:30:20.035 --> 02:30:21.557]  Paying carbon taxes to them.
[02:30:21.557 --> 02:30:23.298]  Ron Paul was on the first hour about that.
[02:30:24.597 --> 02:30:30.780]  Regulations on all banking under them, when they're the people that engineered all this.
[02:30:30.780 --> 02:30:32.041]  Obama's pledged to do that.
[02:30:32.041 --> 02:30:37.904]  He's got some of the grassroots zombie support, but not a huge mandate like Webster Tarpley said earlier.
[02:30:37.904 --> 02:30:45.968]  So all I would ask Webster in the next hour and twenty-seven minutes we're sitting in today, and I appreciate you doing it, because I've got to go do international TV on Press TV.
[02:30:45.968 --> 02:30:52.091]  All I would ask, and I hope folks will watch that live on the web and record it and put it on YouTube, at PressTV.com,
[02:30:53.579 --> 02:31:15.006]  All I would ask, and I'll be on there from 2 to 3 central, all I would ask is that you first give people the big picture about the Anglo-American establishment and how the international bankers are setting this up and what this neo-serfdom feudalism eugenics is so they understand what it means by sacrifice, you're not going to like what I do, and then break down the mobilization and how we deal with them.
[02:31:15.006 --> 02:31:16.067]  We're live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:17.227 --> 02:31:19.949]  We'll be streaming that with some images of Obama and things in the background.
[02:31:19.949 --> 02:31:24.994]  Webster Tarpley is in Maryland, right outside D.C., author of the George H.W.
[02:31:24.994 --> 02:31:28.097]  Bush Unauthorized Biography and two books on Obama.
[02:31:28.097 --> 02:31:31.460]  He's going to be sitting in for the next hour and a half.
[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:33.101]  And again, Webster, you've got the floor.
[02:31:33.101 --> 02:31:33.501]  Thank you.
[02:31:33.501 --> 02:31:34.482]  Go ahead.
[02:31:34.482 --> 02:31:37.685]  Thank you, Alex, and good luck in your work this afternoon.
[02:31:37.685 --> 02:31:39.507]  Thank you.
[02:31:39.507 --> 02:31:41.348]  This is Webster Tarpley.
[02:31:41.348 --> 02:31:44.151]  I'm here in Washington, D.C., or thereabouts.
[02:31:45.146 --> 02:31:47.887]  And I hope people are to some degree familiar with me.
[02:31:47.887 --> 02:31:49.688]  Let me just introduce myself briefly.
[02:31:49.688 --> 02:32:00.653]  Alex made me promise that I wouldn't try to flog my books too much, but I am the author of Obama, the Postmodern Coup, which is available at the Infowars website.
[02:32:00.653 --> 02:32:08.576]  I'm also the author of Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, which I think you can only get at Amazon.com.
[02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:15.114]  And let me just say, I'm very interested to look at the sales of my book in Germany.
[02:32:15.114 --> 02:32:29.808]  The German translation of Obama the Postmodern Coup is now about the number 65 bestseller on Amazon of Germany, meaning that I'm in the top 60 or 70 books in Germany.
[02:32:29.808 --> 02:32:36.134]  So that's interesting that they're going to be at least warned to some degree about what's approaching them.
[02:32:37.026 --> 02:32:44.028]  We're obviously at a historical turning point, and it's unfortunate that it is the making of a world tragedy.
[02:32:44.028 --> 02:32:51.289]  We have taken the leap into the abyss, but there are still lots and lots of things that we need to do about this.
[02:32:51.289 --> 02:32:57.650]  Basically, the clarion call that I would like to issue today is, we need to mobilize politically.
[02:32:57.650 --> 02:33:00.071]  Political mobilization is what is needed.
[02:33:01.286 --> 02:33:06.371]  Not other forms of self-defense activity, which, you know, survivalism or what have you.
[02:33:06.371 --> 02:33:07.732]  That will not do it.
[02:33:07.732 --> 02:33:09.874]  These, you know, you can do in your spare time.
[02:33:09.874 --> 02:33:21.205]  But your principal concern ought to be how to mobilize politically, because what we need is something that will amount to a united front against fascism.
[02:33:21.205 --> 02:33:26.450]  In other words, a united front against those economic policies, institutional policies,
[02:33:27.562 --> 02:33:33.808]  And foreign policies, too, that can be identified as in the fascist tradition.
[02:33:33.808 --> 02:33:41.214]  And when I talk about fascism, let's use the Italian fascism of Mussolini as a good example of that.
[02:33:41.214 --> 02:33:50.241]  It's one that allows us to study the thing a little bit more dispassionately, maybe, than some of the other examples, as people can readily understand.
[02:33:50.851 --> 02:34:07.961]  I would urge people, in addition to reading my books, Obama, The Postmodern Coup, and Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, just go to your public library and get any book about Mussolini, any book about fascism, about the history of Italy right after World War I, the history of the 1920s and 30s.
[02:34:07.961 --> 02:34:11.703]  There are also good books about fascism in general.
[02:34:11.703 --> 02:34:18.367]  The problem that people have today is that the understanding of fascism has been reduced to a very, very low level.
[02:34:19.272 --> 02:34:26.343]  People don't really understand that fascism is not a top-down dictatorship that becomes more and more oppressive.
[02:34:26.343 --> 02:34:27.044]  It is rather...
[02:34:27.899 --> 02:34:30.180]  A mass movement coming up out of the street.
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:36.682]  It's sort of what you've been seeing in these stadiums around the country for the Obama Stadium appearances.
[02:34:36.682 --> 02:34:38.462]  What you saw there in Denver.
[02:34:38.462 --> 02:34:41.864]  What you saw there in Oregon or in Philadelphia.
[02:34:41.864 --> 02:34:46.245]  Last night we had a big crowd out there in Grant Park in Chicago.
[02:34:46.245 --> 02:34:47.985]  The oceanic crowd.
[02:34:47.985 --> 02:34:50.226]  The orator in the middle.
[02:34:50.226 --> 02:34:52.627]  The massive mass, preferably at night.
[02:34:53.081 --> 02:35:04.367]  All of these things are very, very disturbing, hearkening back to the political liturgy, the political symbolism of the 1920s and the 1930s.
[02:35:04.367 --> 02:35:06.749]  So here's what I suggest we do.
[02:35:06.749 --> 02:35:13.893]  In that hour and a half that I have with you today, I'd like to talk myself for about 30 or 40 minutes, and then we'll go over to phone calls.
[02:35:13.893 --> 02:35:15.574]  I would suggest the following.
[02:35:15.574 --> 02:35:21.057]  First of all, there should be no honeymoon for the fascist corporate state.
[02:35:21.604 --> 02:35:24.586]  We don't need a hundred days honeymoon.
[02:35:24.586 --> 02:35:26.627]  We don't need any honeymoon.
[02:35:26.627 --> 02:35:29.268]  There should be no illusions about this.
[02:35:29.268 --> 02:35:32.449]  People are caught up in the hysteria of Obama.
[02:35:34.239 --> 02:35:35.380]  Don't be.
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:40.263]  This is a very grim and very ominous situation we're now in.
[02:35:40.263 --> 02:35:45.406]  We've come out of it, not with the worst of all possible outcomes, but with a bad one.
[02:35:45.406 --> 02:35:47.188]  We've got a one-party state.
[02:35:47.188 --> 02:35:53.292]  We've got the Repo clique, the Reid-Pelosi-Obama clique, now taking over the U.S.
[02:35:53.292 --> 02:35:54.032]  government.
[02:35:54.032 --> 02:35:58.455]  Most of the really bad stuff under Bush, in terms of the wars at least,
[02:35:59.053 --> 02:36:02.815]  Came under one-party Republican rule.
[02:36:02.815 --> 02:36:03.996]  That was bad.
[02:36:03.996 --> 02:36:06.538]  Now we're going to have one-party Democratic rule.
[02:36:06.538 --> 02:36:12.361]  I'm afraid that's going to be worse, if only because the world economic depression is going to make it worse.
[02:36:12.361 --> 02:36:14.863]  So no honeymoon, no 100 days.
[02:36:14.863 --> 02:36:19.626]  It's going to be a mockery to compare Obama's 100 days with Franklin D. Roosevelt's.
[02:36:19.626 --> 02:36:22.568]  This will be the 100 days in reverse.
[02:36:22.568 --> 02:36:23.048]  This will be
[02:36:23.519 --> 02:36:29.243]  Payments to bankers, not emergency relief to people that are starving and hurting.
[02:36:29.243 --> 02:36:30.524]  So, no honeymoon.
[02:36:30.524 --> 02:36:34.807]  Secondly, there must be no fascist censorship.
[02:36:34.807 --> 02:36:37.949]  We don't want anybody tampering with the First Amendment.
[02:36:37.949 --> 02:36:39.950]  It has served us very well.
[02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:41.691]  We are, after all, traditionalists.
[02:36:41.691 --> 02:36:45.154]  We have that saving touch of conservatism.
[02:36:45.154 --> 02:36:45.634]  We want
[02:36:46.198 --> 02:36:51.082]  The full freedom guaranteed in the First Amendment of the Constitution.
[02:36:51.082 --> 02:36:53.904]  We don't want to hear about fairness doctrines.
[02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:57.767]  We don't want government bureaucrats tampering with the media.
[02:36:57.767 --> 02:37:07.734]  We don't want Chuck Schumer with his bankrupt argument that pornography is regulated and therefore free speech on talk radio ought to be also.
[02:37:07.734 --> 02:37:08.755]  We don't need that.
[02:37:08.755 --> 02:37:11.397]  We need more media diversity, not less.
[02:37:11.397 --> 02:37:15.320]  The fairness doctrine is a way to muzzle and censor
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:18.361]  The mass media.
[02:37:18.361 --> 02:37:19.381]  So we don't want any part of it.
[02:37:19.381 --> 02:37:23.422]  We also don't want hate crime or hate speech legislation.
[02:37:23.422 --> 02:37:29.324]  We don't want politically correct speech codes being rammed down the throat of the American people.
[02:37:29.324 --> 02:37:34.866]  Watch for Pelosi and her totalitarian liberal cohorts to try to impose things of that nature.
[02:37:35.592 --> 02:37:37.193]  Another very important one.
[02:37:37.193 --> 02:37:44.376]  We don't want the institutionalization of governmental or paragovernmental fascist militias.
[02:37:44.376 --> 02:37:49.978]  We don't want a Homeland Security Corps of the type that Obama has talked about.
[02:37:49.978 --> 02:37:52.359]  We don't want a Green Corps.
[02:37:52.359 --> 02:37:55.801]  We don't want any of the four or five different kinds
[02:37:56.397 --> 02:38:04.419]  Of quasi-fascist or fascist-oid militias which Obama has proposed to create using public funding.
[02:38:04.419 --> 02:38:07.579]  ACORN is in some ways already a pilot project.
[02:38:07.579 --> 02:38:12.321]  It's a kind of a militia using government money and you can see what they do, right?
[02:38:12.321 --> 02:38:21.863]  You don't have to expect them to come forward with black shirts or brown shirts, carrying billy clubs and dosing out castor oil to make their opponents sick to their stomach.
[02:38:21.863 --> 02:38:23.223]  It's going to be in a modern form.
[02:38:23.783 --> 02:38:25.224]  We don't want any of these militias.
[02:38:25.224 --> 02:38:31.986]  Now, in terms of economic policy, there will be, in the first hundred days, the demand for more bailouts.
[02:38:31.986 --> 02:38:38.449]  We've had Jim Cramer, who speaks for the trading desk at Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.
[02:38:38.449 --> 02:38:48.773]  Jim Cramer on CNBC has called for more bailouts, more money pumped into the edifice of one quadrillion dollars of derivatives,
[02:38:49.249 --> 02:38:52.632]  That Wall Street and their international allies have built up.
[02:38:52.632 --> 02:38:54.934]  We say no to bailouts.
[02:38:54.934 --> 02:38:56.516]  No more bailouts.
[02:38:56.516 --> 02:39:03.723]  And we don't want any part of the federal government to be cannibalized and looted in order to finance these bailouts.
[02:39:03.723 --> 02:39:09.588]  That includes, Kramer, the idea we don't want Social Security looted.
[02:39:09.588 --> 02:39:14.493]  We don't want Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid tampered with in order to pay
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:24.065]  The bills for George Soros, David Rockefeller, and the boys at Goldman Sachs who have put Barkey into office.
[02:39:24.065 --> 02:39:27.868]  There's also the question of fascist austerity.
[02:39:27.868 --> 02:39:40.155]  You've noticed that under the fascist regimes in Central Europe between the two World Wars, one of the main tasks of the entire government was to drive down the standard of living, to massively transfer
[02:39:40.954 --> 02:39:47.399]  Economic resources out of the hands of the common people and into the hands of bankrupt bankers.
[02:39:47.399 --> 02:39:48.920]  That is what Obama's proposing.
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:52.343]  I had to laugh when people talked about Obama as a socialist.
[02:39:52.343 --> 02:39:53.924]  Obama's not a socialist.
[02:39:53.924 --> 02:39:55.725]  This is social fascism.
[02:39:55.725 --> 02:39:59.188]  This is not about distributing wealth to poor people.
[02:39:59.188 --> 02:40:06.313]  This is about gouging everybody and giving Soros and David Rockefeller and Goldman Sachs the proceeds.
[02:40:06.313 --> 02:40:07.194]  It's very, very
[02:40:07.694 --> 02:40:08.354]  Different.
[02:40:08.354 --> 02:40:11.996]  The chosen method for doing this, of course, requires left cover.
[02:40:11.996 --> 02:40:21.842]  We're now entering into a period of left cover government, which is different from what we've had under the right-wing reactionary period of Bush, Cheney, and the neocons.
[02:40:21.842 --> 02:40:33.989]  They're going to try to do this with a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, most likely a cap-and-trade system, which will, in effect, be a huge, unnecessary, totally ideological tax
[02:40:34.629 --> 02:40:36.652]  On all forms of production.
[02:40:36.652 --> 02:40:40.377]  This will drive down the standard of living in a dramatic way.
[02:40:40.377 --> 02:40:42.099]  So we say no to it.
[02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:45.723]  And we're going to be told, but that means you don't care about the polar bears.
[02:40:45.723 --> 02:40:47.585]  You don't care about the Arctic ice cap.
[02:40:47.585 --> 02:40:48.987]  The answer is simple.
[02:40:48.987 --> 02:40:50.709]  And I can give you this as a historian.
[02:40:50.709 --> 02:40:52.211]  I don't need climatologists.
[02:40:52.211 --> 02:40:52.672]  I don't need...
[02:40:53.412 --> 02:40:59.737]  Uh, pseudo-scientists or quackademics to come forward with their crazy global warming theory.
[02:40:59.737 --> 02:41:02.860]  We know that this is a matter of sunspot activity.
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:10.826]  We know that the medieval warm period corresponded to a high level of sunspot activity, the medieval maximum.
[02:41:10.826 --> 02:41:17.391]  We know that the Little Ice Age and the late 1500s and the beginning of the 1600s corresponded to minimums
[02:41:19.753 --> 02:41:22.715]  This is just crazy.
[02:41:22.715 --> 02:41:24.076]  This is pseudoscience.
[02:41:24.076 --> 02:41:34.543]  This is as bad as it gets in terms of junk science, pseudoscience, and the sort of thing, again, that we saw in Central Europe between the two world wars.
[02:41:34.543 --> 02:41:37.946]  Another no is no to free trade sellouts.
[02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:49.881]  We don't need any expansion of NAFTA, we don't want CAFTA, we don't want the authority of the international GATT, the World Trade Organization, and so forth.
[02:41:49.881 --> 02:41:52.524]  We don't need any more of that.
[02:41:52.524 --> 02:41:55.767]  And then, in the area of international politics,
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:01.504]  We can already see Obama has demanded the escalation of the war in Afghanistan.
[02:42:01.504 --> 02:42:05.247]  Obama was, of course, the biggest warmonger in the field.
[02:42:05.247 --> 02:42:13.113]  Certainly the biggest warmonger in the Democratic field, and in many ways the biggest warmonger of them all, although McCain's foolish bluster
[02:42:13.613 --> 02:42:16.055]  Sometimes obscured that fact.
[02:42:16.055 --> 02:42:33.147]  So, it is a question of no to a confrontation with Russia, no confrontation with China, no attack on Sudan, no escalation of the Afghan war, no attack on Pakistan, because that is the secret of that one.
[02:42:33.667 --> 02:42:42.636]  Notice that the one head of state, head of government around the world who has spoken up sharply against the Obama hysteria.
[02:42:42.636 --> 02:42:47.101]  A clear, bright warning comes from Russian President Medvedev.
[02:42:47.623 --> 02:42:52.206]  And his associate, Prime Minister Putin of Russia.
[02:42:52.206 --> 02:42:57.229]  And they are simply saying, don't put your missiles into Poland.
[02:42:57.229 --> 02:43:00.732]  Don't start the Polish Missile Crisis.
[02:43:00.732 --> 02:43:04.134]  It is going to be similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:43:04.134 --> 02:43:07.936]  It is a threat to peace and security in the world.
[02:43:07.936 --> 02:43:09.337]  We don't need it.
[02:43:09.337 --> 02:43:11.459]  We don't need the...
[02:43:12.691 --> 02:43:14.632]  Radar to go into the Czech Republic.
[02:43:14.632 --> 02:43:17.373]  We don't need the missiles to go into Poland.
[02:43:17.373 --> 02:43:21.115]  This is an incalculable folly.
[02:43:21.115 --> 02:43:30.659]  If Obama wants to prove his goodwill, if he wants to show that he represents hope and change, I would recommend that he do the following.
[02:43:30.659 --> 02:43:36.021]  He has expressed some caveats, maybe some skepticism about this Polish missile deployment.
[02:43:36.457 --> 02:43:39.480]  And the Czech phased array early warning radar.
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:41.562]  Why don't we just cancel those, Barkey?
[02:43:41.562 --> 02:43:49.470]  Why don't we just say, we will not have missiles in Poland, we will not have this modern radar put into the Czech Republic.
[02:43:49.470 --> 02:43:54.775]  Let's avoid a needless international confrontation.
[02:43:54.775 --> 02:43:58.599]  Let us tell Vice President-elect Biden, if that's really what he is,
[02:43:59.187 --> 02:44:07.573]  To stop his insane, hysterical calls for an invasion of Sudan, the biggest country in Africa.
[02:44:07.573 --> 02:44:12.377]  The country which, when the imperialist armies go there, they often don't come back.
[02:44:12.377 --> 02:44:21.484]  You remember that movie about General Gordon of the British at Khartoum and all the trouble that he had never got out of there, as it turned out.
[02:44:21.484 --> 02:44:26.647]  We don't want to extend war to an entirely new continent.
[02:44:26.647 --> 02:44:28.589]  We don't need to have Africa in flames.
[02:44:29.433 --> 02:44:34.599]  Now that the Middle East is in flames, let us turn away from the path of confrontation.
[02:44:34.599 --> 02:44:39.384]  Naturally, Obama is committed to escalating the Afghan war.
[02:44:39.384 --> 02:44:43.569]  Biden has been leading the charge for the attack on Sudan.
[02:44:46.969 --> 02:44:49.090]  I don't believe there will be an attack on Iran.
[02:44:49.090 --> 02:44:50.911]  I'll be surprised if that comes about.
[02:44:50.911 --> 02:45:04.376]  I think that the Obama-Brezhinski strategy will be to try to turn Iran against Russia and against other countries, to use them as a pawn rather than to make them into the target of confrontation.
[02:45:04.376 --> 02:45:07.177]  Totally different approach.
[02:45:07.177 --> 02:45:09.098]  The other question is Pakistan.
[02:45:10.282 --> 02:45:25.107]  Obama during the campaign, in particular in Chicago in July of last year, was the first to demand a reckless and irresponsible unilateral policy of bombing the hell out of Northwest Pakistan.
[02:45:25.107 --> 02:45:26.667]  That is now reality.
[02:45:26.667 --> 02:45:32.769]  The goal of that, of course, is not any nonsense about Al-Qaeda, bin Laden, the war on terror, or any of this foolish
[02:45:33.414 --> 02:45:33.674]  I don't
[02:45:52.088 --> 02:45:55.910]  Four or five different micro-states or mini-states.
[02:45:55.910 --> 02:46:00.813]  That's the terminology that Zbigniew Brzezinski likes to use in his books.
[02:46:00.813 --> 02:46:10.078]  We'd be dealing with Waziristan, Pushtunistan, Beluchistan, Sindh, and other micro-states or mini-states.
[02:46:10.078 --> 02:46:17.442]  None of those would be big enough to stand up to ExxonMobil or JPMorgan Chase.
[02:46:17.442 --> 02:46:19.803]  So this is now the task.
[02:46:19.803 --> 02:46:21.004]  In terms of the time frame,
[02:46:21.775 --> 02:46:27.140]  We've got two, I think, two kinds of time frames we can look at.
[02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:31.944]  One is the time between, well actually three then, between now and the election.
[02:46:31.944 --> 02:46:36.348]  We've got the assembling of the new regime, right, the transition.
[02:46:36.348 --> 02:46:37.849]  We've already got one signed.
[02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:41.973]  Obama has now named Rahm Emanuel, a corrupt
[02:46:42.597 --> 02:46:53.085]  Political hack, Congressman from Chicago, veteran of the Clinton White House, Rahm Emanuel will be the new White House Chief of Staff.
[02:46:53.085 --> 02:46:56.207]  This is about as bad as it could be.
[02:46:56.207 --> 02:47:00.971]  Rahm Emanuel was on the dark side of the Clinton White House
[02:47:01.812 --> 02:47:07.199]  He is a member of the Illinois Bipartisan Combine.
[02:47:07.199 --> 02:47:15.229]  That means the joint operation by Republicans and Democrats to loot the people of Chicago, to loot the state of Illinois.
[02:47:15.229 --> 02:47:16.171]  This is what went on.
[02:47:17.197 --> 02:47:19.780]  Uh, this is the thing that Barkey comes out of.
[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:28.990]  Obama is somebody who has swum and cavorted in the cesspool of filth, corruption, and graft of the Illinois bipartisan combine.
[02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:35.217]  Rahm Emanuel is also somebody who spent the first Gulf War as a volunteer for the Israeli Defense Force.
[02:47:35.217 --> 02:47:37.179]  This is not a good choice.
[02:47:37.179 --> 02:47:38.080]  We'll be back in a minute.
[02:47:52.569 --> 02:47:54.731]  Survival Property dot com.
[02:47:54.731 --> 02:48:01.097]  Long time survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote, A survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[02:48:01.097 --> 02:48:06.602]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without outside support.
[02:48:06.602 --> 02:48:11.607]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine and warmth
[02:48:13.837 --> 02:48:14.837]  We're good to go.
[02:48:38.822 --> 02:48:40.783]  Act now before it's too late.
[02:48:40.783 --> 02:48:49.264]  In order to find your new, high-security, self-sufficient, off-grid, beautiful retreat property, visit survivalproperty.com.

[02:48:52.105 --> 02:48:58.867]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:48:58.867 --> 02:49:00.527]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:01.505 --> 02:49:03.046]  But who is the enemy?
[02:49:03.046 --> 02:49:03.847]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:03.847 --> 02:49:04.787]  This is his ammo.
[02:49:04.787 --> 02:49:06.189]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:06.189 --> 02:49:08.210]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:49:08.210 --> 02:49:15.355]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:49:15.355 --> 02:49:15.836]  Some U.S.
[02:49:15.836 --> 02:49:21.500]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:25.701]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:49:25.701 --> 02:49:28.462]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:49:52.017 --> 02:49:55.499]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:49:55.499 --> 02:49:59.281]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:49:59.281 --> 02:50:05.585]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[02:50:05.585 --> 02:50:10.228]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:50:10.228 --> 02:50:16.251]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:50:16.251 --> 02:50:19.653]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:50:19.653 --> 02:50:20.354]  Run sump pumps,
[02:50:20.674 --> 02:50:20.974]  I think so.
[02:50:41.769 --> 02:50:42.870]  I read the news today, oh boy
[02:51:08.198 --> 02:51:10.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones program.
[02:51:10.660 --> 02:51:13.862]  This is Webster Tarpley here in Washington, D.C.
[02:51:13.862 --> 02:51:19.106]  sitting in as guest host this afternoon for Alex.
[02:51:19.106 --> 02:51:30.854]  Again, what I'm proposing now is political mobilization during the time of the transition, during the first hundred days, and essentially for the next two years.
[02:51:30.854 --> 02:51:32.595]  There will be a congressional election
[02:51:33.294 --> 02:51:41.919]  In two years, if the institutional arrangements remain as they have been, that's been fairly reliable in American history.
[02:51:41.919 --> 02:51:54.106]  We've had these congressional elections, the midterm elections, where you'll be able to register your opinions about this new regime.
[02:51:54.106 --> 02:52:00.010]  So we've got the transition, we've got the first very bad sign, Rahm Emanuel as White House
[02:52:00.774 --> 02:52:20.903]  Chief of Staff, a corrupt member of the Illinois Bipartisan Combine, that is the area otherwise inhabited by such figures as Tony Rescoe, Natsumi Auchi, Al Samari, and others, along with Janulius and Tony Jaws, Gorengo,
[02:52:21.821 --> 02:52:23.102]  And all the rest of them.
[02:52:23.102 --> 02:52:31.488]  The cesspool of corruption in which Obama has been bathing and cavorting and frolicking during his entire career.
[02:52:31.488 --> 02:52:33.290]  Multi-ethnic corruption.
[02:52:33.290 --> 02:52:38.874]  There's all kinds of ethnic groups in it, but it's the Illinois bipartisan combine.
[02:52:38.874 --> 02:52:41.716]  Republicans and Democrats can join to loot.
[02:52:42.333 --> 02:52:47.880]  The people of Illinois, that seems to be the kind of bipartisanship that Obama likes best.
[02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:50.743]  There will be a fight about other appointments, right?
[02:52:50.743 --> 02:52:52.926]  The Plumb Book comes out.
[02:52:52.926 --> 02:52:55.809]  For example, who's going to be Secretary of State?
[02:52:55.809 --> 02:53:01.276]  Will it be the effete snob John Kerry, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts?
[02:53:01.815 --> 02:53:25.925]  With his wife, whose parents were servants of the Portuguese fascist dictatorship, of Salazar, with his wife, Theresa Hines-Carrie, who comes from the heart of the foundation world, which is otherwise the world that has produced Obama, the product of the Ford Foundation, the Gamaliel Foundation, the Woods Fund, the Joyce Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation,
[02:53:26.525 --> 02:53:31.910]  And his close friend Bernardine Dorn gets her money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:41.019]  The evil social engineering, the manipulation, the fragmentation, the divide-and-conquer strategies of these foundations.
[02:53:41.019 --> 02:53:43.101]  Anyway, will it be Kerry?
[02:53:43.101 --> 02:53:46.484]  Or will it be Richard Holbrooke, the mad bomber of Serbia?
[02:53:47.272 --> 02:54:08.420]  In 1999, the Russophobe, the Russia hater who decided to make a terrible example of Serbia with 60 to 70 days of bombing in the spring of 1999 in order to show the Russians the true brutality of US and British imperialism.
[02:54:08.420 --> 02:54:10.101]  It looks like a fight between Holbrooke
[02:54:10.721 --> 02:54:12.924]  And Kerry for Secretary of State.
[02:54:12.924 --> 02:54:26.298]  Wesley Clark, the other mad bomber of Serbia back in 1999, who blocked with Tony Blair against his own government to try to get a land invasion, a ground troop invasion,
[02:54:26.878 --> 02:54:30.840]  Of Serbia, which would have been an unexampled bloodbath.
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:36.943]  Wesley Clarke may be in the running, but his chemistry with Barkey doesn't seem to be too good.
[02:54:36.943 --> 02:54:40.805]  So you'll have all kinds of struggles about these appointments.
[02:54:40.805 --> 02:54:45.707]  And perhaps during this time already, we'll begin to see the falling out among thieves.
[02:54:45.707 --> 02:54:49.169]  In other words, the Obama corruption conveyance.
[02:54:49.781 --> 02:54:58.368]  That they have all jumped on to, people like David Wilhelm out there in Illinois, that this will prove to be not enough.
[02:54:58.368 --> 02:55:07.295]  In other words, there's not enough goodies to go around for all of the various thugs and goons who have jumped on the Barky bandwagon.
[02:55:07.295 --> 02:55:08.716]  So we'll see some of that.
[02:55:08.716 --> 02:55:10.237]  Then we'll get into the 100 days.
[02:55:10.237 --> 02:55:12.039]  There will obviously be an attempt
[02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:15.012]  To try to stage unprecedented hysteria.
[02:55:15.012 --> 02:55:18.774]  We've got to be ready for that, and then we've got to be ready to hold out for two years.
[02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:21.276]  Until the next election.
[02:55:21.276 --> 02:55:23.978]  Back in a minute.
[02:55:23.978 --> 02:55:25.479]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:55:25.479 --> 02:55:26.880]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.021]  It is a big idea.
[02:55:44.021 --> 02:55:46.843]  A New World Order.
[02:55:46.843 --> 02:55:51.727]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:55:51.727 --> 02:55:54.569]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:55:54.569 --> 02:55:57.351]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:55:57.351 --> 02:56:00.534]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:56:00.534 --> 02:56:07.859]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:56:10.891 --> 02:56:16.335]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:56:16.335 --> 02:56:19.717]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:56:44.892 --> 02:56:47.272]  Waging War on Corruption!
[02:56:47.272 --> 02:56:58.495]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[02:56:58.495 --> 02:56:59.175]  Welcome back!
[02:56:59.175 --> 02:57:03.516]  This is the Alex Jones Program, but I'm Webster Toffley here in Washington, D.C.
[02:57:03.516 --> 02:57:05.496]  sitting in for Alex this afternoon.
[02:57:06.517 --> 02:57:12.379]  As guest host, and we've obviously got a lot to cover, the new regime.
[02:57:12.379 --> 02:57:15.260]  We've had the, uh, Obamageddon.
[02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:25.603]  Obamageddon has occurred, and we're still standing, and we still intend to resist the attempt to transform the U.S.
[02:57:25.603 --> 02:57:33.646]  economy and institutions in what can only be called a fascist, neo-fascist, fascistoid, social fascist
[02:57:34.474 --> 02:57:39.799]  Direction, might as well call it a plain old fascist direction.
[02:57:39.799 --> 02:57:46.745]  Notice that the American people are still majority anti-fascist.
[02:57:46.745 --> 02:57:52.790]  48%, even according to the official statistics, 48% have rejected Obama.
[02:57:52.790 --> 02:57:54.491]  This is not a landslide.
[02:57:54.491 --> 02:57:59.395]  This is nothing like LBJ defeating Goldwater.
[02:57:59.395 --> 02:58:00.416]  This is nothing like
[02:58:01.756 --> 02:58:03.797]  Nixon defeating McGovern.
[02:58:03.797 --> 02:58:06.659]  It's nothing like Reagan defeating Carter.
[02:58:06.659 --> 02:58:10.922]  Nothing like Reagan defeating Mondale.
[02:58:10.922 --> 02:58:16.505]  In those cases, the losers came out with two, three, four, five states.
[02:58:16.505 --> 02:58:18.106]  This is nothing like that.
[02:58:18.106 --> 02:58:21.128]  This is an evenly divided country.
[02:58:21.128 --> 02:58:26.532]  Notice that there is no debate in the hysterical, controlled Wall Street media.
[02:58:26.532 --> 02:58:28.533]  No debate at all about the mandate.
[02:58:28.533 --> 02:58:29.954]  Well, there is no mandate.
[02:58:30.444 --> 02:58:34.969]  There's no mandate for Obama to do anything.
[02:58:34.969 --> 02:58:41.936]  First of all, because if we add in the ACORN and related vote fraud, right?
[02:58:41.936 --> 02:58:45.220]  Remembering that this time around, in sharp contrast to 2000 and 2004,
[02:58:47.682 --> 02:58:56.210]  The ruling class, the finance oligarchs, have decreed that the vote fraud machines will be geared up in favor of the Democrat.
[02:58:56.210 --> 02:59:00.033]  This is, of course, the oligarchical consensus in favor of Obama.
[02:59:00.033 --> 02:59:14.826]  Obama being the candidate of the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberger Group, the Rand Corporation, the Chicago School of Economics, the Skull and Bones people, and the foundations, above all, the foundations.
[02:59:15.918 --> 02:59:20.684]  They have decreed that this time around vote fraud is in favor of Obama, clearly.
[02:59:20.684 --> 02:59:30.676]  There's also the media hysteria, the unprecedented corruption of the various Wall Street media whores falling all over themselves with their fawning
[02:59:31.431 --> 02:59:40.218]  Adulation, never daring to question the utopian and messianic rhetoric of the new Messiah.
[02:59:40.218 --> 02:59:55.050]  But even in the face of all of this, almost half have rejected Obama, and I think if we had an honest vote count, which we're unlikely to ever get, we'd find that it's, if not 50-50, it might even be 51-49 against Obama.
[02:59:55.050 --> 02:59:57.191]  Some of these states, of course, were very, very close.
[02:59:57.191 --> 03:00:00.414]  Wherever it was that close, you'd have to look into acorn
[03:00:01.198 --> 03:00:02.158]  Vote fraud.
[03:00:02.158 --> 03:00:11.943]  But since McCain has cravenly capitulated, we're very, very unlikely to ever get accurate vote counts in those areas.
[03:00:11.943 --> 03:00:16.445]  So, the first thing we have to remember is Obama is not a legitimate president.
[03:00:16.445 --> 03:00:19.046]  There is no legitimacy here.
[03:00:19.046 --> 03:00:21.847]  He is another tenant of the White House.
[03:00:21.847 --> 03:00:22.908]  It's unfortunate.
[03:00:22.908 --> 03:00:25.829]  For the past eight years, we've had a tenant of the White House.
[03:00:25.829 --> 03:00:27.410]  We've got another tenant of the White House.
[03:00:27.410 --> 03:00:30.611]  We do not have a constitutionally legitimized
[03:00:31.149 --> 03:00:32.790]  Presidency.
[03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:40.092]  One of the reasons for this is the questions about Obama's birth and citizenship have never been answered.
[03:00:40.092 --> 03:00:45.654]  We should obviously keep raising the demand in order to underline his illegitimacy, if nothing else.
[03:00:46.505 --> 03:00:54.608]  That Obama has to show the full, detailed, vault copy of his birth certificate.
[03:00:54.608 --> 03:00:56.749]  We demand to see it.
[03:00:56.749 --> 03:01:01.411]  It's not enough to assure us that he was born in this or that hospital in Hawaii.
[03:01:01.411 --> 03:01:09.715]  There are very credible, detailed reports that he was born in Kenya, he is a citizen of Kenya, and after that he transferred his citizenship
[03:01:10.211 --> 03:01:12.032]  To Indonesia.
[03:01:12.032 --> 03:01:14.994]  He apparently never became an American citizen.
[03:01:14.994 --> 03:01:19.137]  So we've now got an illegal alien in the White House.
[03:01:19.137 --> 03:01:21.879]  Historical models come to mind.
[03:01:21.879 --> 03:01:23.940]  In France, it was a Corsican.
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.381]  In Germany, it was an Austrian.
[03:01:25.381 --> 03:01:27.422]  And now in the U.S., it seems to be a Kenyan.
[03:01:27.422 --> 03:01:30.404]  So maybe we're following in those footsteps.
[03:01:30.404 --> 03:01:31.085]  Let's hope not.
[03:01:31.085 --> 03:01:32.686]  Let's mobilize to stop it.
[03:01:48.132 --> 03:01:48.348]  Yeah.
[03:01:52.145 --> 03:01:53.826]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:01:53.826 --> 03:01:58.590]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:01:58.590 --> 03:02:01.552]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:01.552 --> 03:02:04.595]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:04.595 --> 03:02:10.719]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:02:10.719 --> 03:02:16.524]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:16.524 --> 03:02:18.165]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:18.345 --> 03:02:22.308]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[03:02:22.308 --> 03:02:25.130]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:25.130 --> 03:02:34.277]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[03:02:34.277 --> 03:02:41.362]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:02:41.362 --> 03:02:43.364]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[03:02:43.584 --> 03:02:45.806]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:02:45.806 --> 03:02:51.490]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:02:51.490 --> 03:02:54.732]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:02:54.732 --> 03:02:58.095]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:02:58.095 --> 03:02:59.916]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:02:59.916 --> 03:03:03.639]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:03.979 --> 03:03:08.101]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:08.101 --> 03:03:15.644]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:15.644 --> 03:03:19.586]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:19.586 --> 03:03:22.827]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:22.827 --> 03:03:29.690]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:03:29.810 --> 03:03:33.071]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:03:33.071 --> 03:03:38.233]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:03:38.233 --> 03:03:44.496]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:03:44.496 --> 03:03:48.258]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:03:48.258 --> 03:03:49.538]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:03:49.538 --> 03:03:50.238]  Take action today.
[03:03:50.238 --> 03:03:52.059]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:04:00.103 --> 03:04:05.508]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:05.508 --> 03:04:07.770]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:04:26.531 --> 03:04:29.353]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones program.
[03:04:29.353 --> 03:04:34.877]  I'm Webster Copley here in Washington DC sitting in for Alex this afternoon.
[03:04:34.877 --> 03:04:39.140]  Just looking ahead now, we've got to mobilize what amounts to a united front
[03:04:39.918 --> 03:04:41.078]  Against fascism.
[03:04:41.078 --> 03:04:43.539]  We'll find a better name for that as time goes on.
[03:04:43.539 --> 03:04:47.200]  It will grow out of the mobilization itself, I'm sure.
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:48.940]  Obama's not legitimate.
[03:04:48.940 --> 03:04:50.320]  He's a usurper.
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:52.541]  He's a new tenant of the White House.
[03:04:52.541 --> 03:04:56.282]  He has not produced his detailed birth certificate.
[03:04:56.282 --> 03:04:57.542]  We don't know who he is.
[03:04:57.542 --> 03:04:58.662]  We don't know what his name is.
[03:04:58.662 --> 03:05:01.623]  We don't know where he's from.
[03:05:01.623 --> 03:05:03.703]  McCain has let us down, obviously.
[03:05:03.703 --> 03:05:05.664]  McCain needed to talk about
[03:05:06.289 --> 03:05:07.570]  The citizenship issue.
[03:05:07.570 --> 03:05:15.937]  McCain needed to call attention to the efforts of Philip J. Berg of Philadelphia at the Supreme Court.
[03:05:15.937 --> 03:05:23.804]  I was there with him last Thursday afternoon when the paperwork went in to Justice Souter of the Supreme Court.
[03:05:23.804 --> 03:05:30.989]  That was disallowed then on the late afternoon of the Monday of this week before the election.
[03:05:30.989 --> 03:05:35.133]  This issue remains open as long as we have the colorable
[03:05:35.757 --> 03:05:44.641]  The claim of a illegal alien in the White House, this issue remains open and it's a perfectly legitimate constitutional issue.
[03:05:44.641 --> 03:05:46.842]  What's the big objection to Bush and Cheney?
[03:05:46.842 --> 03:05:48.663]  They trampled on the Constitution.
[03:05:48.663 --> 03:05:51.004]  Let's start respecting the Constitution.
[03:05:51.004 --> 03:05:58.427]  And of course, if you want to get your hand on the thermonuclear button, which is what Obama is now approaching, we get to know everything about you.
[03:05:58.427 --> 03:06:00.248]  We get to know every detail of your life.
[03:06:00.248 --> 03:06:02.829]  There's no such thing as a private sphere.
[03:06:03.807 --> 03:06:09.130]  The other question that McCain let us down on are the Larry Sinclair allegations.
[03:06:09.130 --> 03:06:19.135]  The question of, well, what Larry Sinclair has talked about, encounters in November of 1999 with Obama indulging in crack cocaine.
[03:06:19.135 --> 03:06:24.397]  Those are the charges that were made, and therefore this also has got to be dealt with.
[03:06:24.397 --> 03:06:25.998]  McCain has let us down.
[03:06:25.998 --> 03:06:27.399]  Most of all, perhaps, McCain
[03:06:28.095 --> 03:06:39.148]  Forfeited his moral claim to the presidency when he voted in favor of the infamous $700 billion bailout for Wall Street derivatives.
[03:06:39.148 --> 03:06:41.851]  McCain needed to separate himself from Bush.
[03:06:41.851 --> 03:06:46.456]  What better way to do it than to reject with a spectacular gesture?
[03:06:47.048 --> 03:06:50.429]  The bankrupt bailout policy.
[03:06:50.429 --> 03:07:10.993]  He could have said no to that, and with Obama voting for it, McCain could then have pointed out that all of Obama's promises about middle class tax cuts and healthcare that will never be realized because Obama has given away $700 billion with his vote in the Senate before he ever gets to the White House.
[03:07:10.993 --> 03:07:13.114]  So this is simply not going to happen.
[03:07:13.638 --> 03:07:18.322]  If we want to look ahead, though, let's look ahead through the transition period.
[03:07:18.322 --> 03:07:23.866]  We may have economic crisis, obviously, coming back during the transition.
[03:07:23.866 --> 03:07:28.609]  We're going to have possible confrontations starting quite soon.
[03:07:28.609 --> 03:07:31.331]  But the 100 days will then be the big push.
[03:07:31.331 --> 03:07:32.092]  They'll try to have
[03:07:32.995 --> 03:07:49.544]  The Fairness Doctrine institutionalizes militias, have new bailouts imposed, cap and trade, new free trade systems, loot Social Security, and at the same time the foreign policy establishment will move towards confrontation with Russia.
[03:07:49.544 --> 03:07:57.428]  New false flag events are not ruled out, simply because those are now possible once again, once we have
[03:07:58.084 --> 03:08:11.129]  The beatific personality of Obama to come forward and say, the bomb went off, country X did it, therefore we are going to be at war with country X. Bush and Cheney had long since lost that capability.
[03:08:11.129 --> 03:08:15.870]  There are a lot of people in the ruling elite who think that with Obama, they've got it back, they may try it.
[03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:19.632]  Let us be ready to undercut that kind of nonsense.
[03:08:19.632 --> 03:08:23.113]  The question of a new 9-11 comes back on the table.
[03:08:23.573 --> 03:08:27.834]  From the moment that they've got Obama in the White House to talk about this stuff.
[03:08:27.834 --> 03:08:30.575]  Otherwise, we can go back to the Carter model.
[03:08:30.575 --> 03:08:33.176]  I've written about this in Obama, The Postmodern Coup.
[03:08:33.176 --> 03:08:37.277]  There's a good 30 or 40 page history of the Carter regime.
[03:08:37.277 --> 03:08:38.298]  It was catastrophic.
[03:08:38.298 --> 03:08:42.499]  It was made up of members of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:08:42.499 --> 03:08:46.740]  Carter immediately got into trouble with Congress, and I think Obama will too.
[03:08:46.740 --> 03:08:51.021]  Even though Carter, of course, had big Democratic majorities in the way that Obama does.
[03:08:53.047 --> 03:09:03.060]  When you run as the savior and the anointed one, you're not asking for a mandate for any specific set of policies.
[03:09:03.060 --> 03:09:04.542]  What is Obama's program?
[03:09:04.542 --> 03:09:05.844]  Well, it's to be the savior.
[03:09:06.588 --> 03:09:08.390]  Uh, what is Obama's base?
[03:09:08.390 --> 03:09:11.112]  It's personality cultists for Obama.
[03:09:11.112 --> 03:09:12.954]  There's no issue really involved.
[03:09:12.954 --> 03:09:14.255]  Hope and change.
[03:09:14.255 --> 03:09:24.463]  The problem with that is that once you get into power and you actually have to make concrete decisions, every time you make one, you're turning off half or a third or a very large proportion of your base.
[03:09:24.463 --> 03:09:25.985]  Obama has served as a screen
[03:09:26.625 --> 03:09:34.613]  For the projection of the fantasies and wishes of a whole bunch of left liberal lemmings and other people in the population.
[03:09:34.613 --> 03:09:41.240]  That will rapidly come to an end once he gets into the White House, if he does, and has to make these decisions.
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:42.581]  So that will be a problem.
[03:09:42.581 --> 03:09:44.143]  There's also the megalomania.
[03:09:44.603 --> 03:09:45.744]  Inherent in Obama.
[03:09:45.744 --> 03:09:47.126]  The guy is an egomaniac.
[03:09:47.126 --> 03:09:51.971]  His habitual position is looking down his nose at the rest of the world.
[03:09:51.971 --> 03:09:52.932]  He is an elitist.
[03:09:52.932 --> 03:09:53.893]  He's an oligarch.
[03:09:53.893 --> 03:09:59.358]  He's a typical product of the foundation-funded overclass.
[03:09:59.358 --> 03:10:04.783]  So that is not going to make for good relations with various people in the Congress.
[03:10:04.783 --> 03:10:06.225]  So we can look at Carter.
[03:10:06.225 --> 03:10:07.026]  Carter peaked
[03:10:07.674 --> 03:10:14.176]  In terms of his popularity, at the end of his 100 days, and after that, Carter went down, down, down.
[03:10:14.176 --> 03:10:21.038]  And within 12 months after the 100 days were over, Carter had lost 25 points in the polls.
[03:10:21.038 --> 03:10:24.799]  He was an unpopular president by the spring of 19... let's see, it was 1978?
[03:10:29.213 --> 03:10:39.919]  And he never regained his popularity except for a kind of rally around the flag when the hostages in Iran were taken, which was of course one of the operations of the Carter administration itself.
[03:10:39.919 --> 03:10:42.840]  So the 100 days, we've got to get through the 100 days.
[03:10:42.840 --> 03:10:44.541]  Try to block some of this legislation.
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:49.421]  Look around for institutional support in that.
[03:10:49.421 --> 03:10:52.562]  48-49% of the American people reject Obama.
[03:10:52.562 --> 03:10:54.322]  There still is a Republican Party.
[03:10:54.322 --> 03:10:58.264]  There's still a significant group of Republican Senators.
[03:10:58.264 --> 03:11:01.964]  They can be forced to block some of this legislation.
[03:11:01.964 --> 03:11:03.685]  You're basically dealing with two gangs.
[03:11:04.185 --> 03:11:05.785]  One gang is now much stronger.
[03:11:05.785 --> 03:11:07.006]  One gang is weaker.
[03:11:07.006 --> 03:11:13.087]  You've obviously got to try to play the weaker gang against the stronger gang and try to avoid the worst at that point.
[03:11:13.087 --> 03:11:15.348]  The goal is gridlock.
[03:11:15.348 --> 03:11:18.088]  The goal is partisan paralysis.
[03:11:18.088 --> 03:11:22.269]  The goal is a situation where nothing gets through the Congress.
[03:11:22.269 --> 03:11:26.590]  If we could guarantee that, that's what we would like to have.
[03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:28.811]  So, that's the 100 days.
[03:11:28.811 --> 03:11:29.251]  After that,
[03:11:30.017 --> 03:11:31.419]  We'll have to get through two years.
[03:11:31.419 --> 03:11:36.507]  Some people suggest that there might be a false flag attempt to try to refurbish Obama's image.
[03:11:36.507 --> 03:11:40.153]  That's, of course, a clear possibility.
[03:11:40.153 --> 03:11:43.599]  The other thing we need to look at, let's look back at Mussolini.
[03:11:45.177 --> 03:11:50.620]  This is a distant mirror, but I think this is, unfortunately, one of the more accurate ones.
[03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:55.522]  Mussolini, you'll remember, took power in October 1922 with the March on Rome.
[03:11:55.522 --> 03:12:00.744]  It could have easily been dispersed, but the king demanded that Mussolini be allowed to form a government.
[03:12:00.744 --> 03:12:04.346]  Now, Mussolini had to govern with a coalition.
[03:12:04.346 --> 03:12:08.548]  He had fascists, nationalists, conservatives, liberals, Catholics.
[03:12:09.384 --> 03:12:11.146]  And this was a problem for him.
[03:12:11.146 --> 03:12:17.010]  Obama, look, if you look at it, it seems like they're all Democrats, but within the Democrats there are different groups.
[03:12:17.010 --> 03:12:23.155]  There are some conservative Democrats, there are blue dogs, the old boll weevils, whatever you want to call them.
[03:12:23.155 --> 03:12:26.077]  There are also New Deal types, like Marcy Kaptur.
[03:12:26.077 --> 03:12:33.242]  There are different factions inside the House Democrats and even the House, the Senate Democrats.
[03:12:33.242 --> 03:12:34.043]  Not all of them
[03:12:34.768 --> 03:12:38.875]  Are part of the Obama Kool-Aid drinking personality cult.
[03:12:38.875 --> 03:12:44.985]  There will be some resistance, some friction there, I would think, depending on what he does.
[03:12:46.104 --> 03:12:52.385]  In the case of Mussolini, he concentrated during the first couple of years on changing the election laws.
[03:12:52.385 --> 03:12:53.726]  That was one side of it.
[03:12:53.726 --> 03:13:04.308]  I think with Obama, we're going to see an attempt to use the fairness doctrine and various kinds of hate crime or hate speech regulations to try to suppress political dissent.
[03:13:04.308 --> 03:13:10.870]  So that would be the modern analog to what Mussolini was doing then.
[03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:11.550]  The other thing is,
[03:13:12.614 --> 03:13:14.495]  The militias.
[03:13:14.495 --> 03:13:21.517]  Mussolini created, in the first year that he was in power, the Voluntary National Security Militia.
[03:13:21.517 --> 03:13:29.320]  It sounds exactly like the Homeland Security Corps, and the Green Corps, and these other things that Obama is talking about.
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:34.882]  And I believe this is probably conscious, not on the part of Obama, but on the part of others.
[03:13:34.882 --> 03:13:39.844]  There's also, with Mussolini, the fight to consolidate a dictatorship.
[03:13:39.844 --> 03:13:41.865]  You don't immediately get a dictatorship
[03:13:42.435 --> 03:13:44.997]  In a parliamentary system or even more so in the U.S.
[03:13:44.997 --> 03:13:45.857]  system.
[03:13:45.857 --> 03:13:49.780]  Therefore, there's a fight to make the dictatorship stick, right?
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:56.645]  To put it together and try to suppress dissent in the Parliament, in the Congress, and in public opinion.
[03:13:56.645 --> 03:14:00.067]  Remember, fascistization is a process by which
[03:14:00.587 --> 03:14:17.317]  The various institutions of society, political parties, trade unions, sports clubs, regional associations, any kind of institution that allows people to act together is a means by which a regime can be resisted.
[03:14:17.317 --> 03:14:21.580]  And therefore, fascism tends to go after those and try to weaken them.
[03:14:21.580 --> 03:14:25.162]  And in this country, I think talk radio would be one of the prominent ones.
[03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:41.619]  In Italy in 1924, in the midst of Mussolini tampering with the election laws, there emerged a single figure of resistance, a guy called Matteotti, who was then assassinated by people sympathetic to Mussolini.
[03:14:41.619 --> 03:14:50.266]  So, look for various individuals in various institutions coming to personify the resistance against this new regime.
[03:14:51.025 --> 03:14:55.687]  One of the mistakes that they made in Italy was that they did not understand the need to unite.
[03:14:55.687 --> 03:15:04.310]  They had all kinds of people who didn't like the fascist regime, but they were always squabbling and quibbling about this or that ideological point.
[03:15:04.310 --> 03:15:07.991]  You need to get over that relatively rapidly and form a coherent
[03:15:08.627 --> 03:15:11.930]  Opposition front around mainly this list of no's.
[03:15:11.930 --> 03:15:15.473]  That's the easiest thing, is to be able to agree on what you don't want.
[03:15:15.473 --> 03:15:20.979]  No bailouts, no fairness doctrine, no militias, and so forth.
[03:15:20.979 --> 03:15:25.002]  No confrontation with Russia, China, and so on down the line.
[03:15:25.002 --> 03:15:33.850]  The other thing that happened with Mussolini in the course of his consolidation of the dictatorship was a large part of the Italian Parliament just got up and left.
[03:15:34.611 --> 03:15:38.976]  They left the Italian Parliament and they went to the Aventine Hill, right?
[03:15:38.976 --> 03:15:40.317]  One of the seven hills of Rome.
[03:15:40.317 --> 03:15:43.721]  And they set up their own opposition counter-parliament.
[03:15:43.721 --> 03:15:45.142]  This did not work well.
[03:15:45.142 --> 03:15:47.504]  This is a topic we don't want to imitate.
[03:15:47.504 --> 03:15:53.691]  But the bottom line is, it took Mussolini two to three years before he was able to consolidate a dictatorship.
[03:15:53.691 --> 03:15:55.813]  So it means that all is not lost.
[03:15:55.813 --> 03:15:56.614]  Mobilize now!
[03:16:00.851 --> 03:16:03.532]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[03:16:03.532 --> 03:16:08.554]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[03:16:08.554 --> 03:16:10.495]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[03:16:10.495 --> 03:16:11.835]  We are under the microscope.
[03:16:11.835 --> 03:16:15.857]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[03:16:15.857 --> 03:16:19.498]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:47.090]  We're good.
[03:17:00.006 --> 03:17:02.169]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:17:02.169 --> 03:17:04.612]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:17:04.612 --> 03:17:07.256]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:17:07.256 --> 03:17:08.437]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:17:08.437 --> 03:17:10.140]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:17:10.140 --> 03:17:13.043]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:17:13.043 --> 03:17:16.668]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:17:26.339 --> 03:17:31.130]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:17:37.420 --> 03:17:42.524]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:17:42.524 --> 03:17:45.286]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:17:59.856 --> 03:18:00.636]  Gold.
[03:18:00.636 --> 03:18:02.177]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:18:02.177 --> 03:18:08.439]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:18:08.439 --> 03:18:12.641]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:18:12.641 --> 03:18:14.562]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:18:14.562 --> 03:18:17.002]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:18:17.002 --> 03:18:23.985]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[03:18:24.085 --> 03:18:25.006]  We're good to go.
[03:18:41.465 --> 03:18:42.165]  I don't know.
[03:18:59.969 --> 03:19:03.371]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.
[03:19:03.371 --> 03:19:07.152]  If you're ready to start saving at the pump, Fuel Saver technologies can help.

[03:20:05.078 --> 03:20:06.759]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.759 --> 03:20:10.241]  This is Webster Topley here in Washington, D.C.
[03:20:10.241 --> 03:20:15.345]  I am Alex's guest host, standing in for him today, this afternoon.
[03:20:15.345 --> 03:20:21.728]  I'm the author of Obama, the Postmodern Coup and Obama, the Unauthorized Biography.
[03:20:21.728 --> 03:20:24.990]  The Postmodern Coup, you can get it at Infowars.com.
[03:20:24.990 --> 03:20:28.893]  The Unauthorized Biography, you've got to go to Amazon.com.
[03:20:28.893 --> 03:20:33.055]  And I'm happy to say that the German edition of the Postmodern Coup is number 65.
[03:20:34.540 --> 03:20:38.183]  on Amazon of Germany, meaning that it's the best-seller.
[03:20:38.183 --> 03:20:40.525]  It's the number one book on the U.S.
[03:20:40.525 --> 03:20:46.910]  election that people are turning to, and I hope they watch out, because it is a warning to people in Europe.
[03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:56.638]  Don't be made into a kamikaze puppet for Zbigniew Brzezinski's apocalyptic confrontation and settling of accounts with Russia, because that's what he wants to do.
[03:20:56.638 --> 03:21:01.682]  Wipe out Russia, wipe out China, and the Anglo-American empire can go on for another hundred years.
[03:21:02.282 --> 03:21:09.345]  Just to sum up, the way to think about the current time, I think, is to go back to this Mussolini model.
[03:21:09.345 --> 03:21:12.246]  October 1922, March on Rome.
[03:21:12.246 --> 03:21:15.168]  It's a bunch of ragtag goons and hooligans.
[03:21:15.168 --> 03:21:22.331]  It's sort of like the stuff we see with Obama, but it's a pretext to make Mussolini then the Prime Minister.
[03:21:22.927 --> 03:21:27.932]  In the first year that he's in power, he creates the Voluntary National Security Militia.
[03:21:27.932 --> 03:21:29.674]  So, learn something from that.
[03:21:29.674 --> 03:21:34.459]  No militias, no volunteer groups under any circumstances.
[03:21:35.071 --> 03:21:38.172]  And at the same time, he's tampering with the election law.
[03:21:38.172 --> 03:21:51.114]  Today, it would be tampering with free speech under the Fairness Doctrine and other pretexts that these totalitarian liberals, politically correct fanatics, may come up with.
[03:21:51.114 --> 03:21:58.376]  In 1924, we have the emergence of resistance around this Matteotti, who is then liquidated.
[03:21:58.376 --> 03:22:01.857]  So, political assassinations coming forward.
[03:22:01.857 --> 03:22:02.497]  Possibility.
[03:22:04.264 --> 03:22:08.107]  Then we have the crushing of the opposition inside the Parliament.
[03:22:08.107 --> 03:22:11.529]  This is the so-called Aventine Succession.
[03:22:11.529 --> 03:22:17.053]  And after that, by 1925, Italy is in effect a one-party state.
[03:22:17.053 --> 03:22:21.617]  So it takes two years plus to get to that.
[03:22:22.239 --> 03:22:26.080]  By December of 1925, Mussolini is head of government.
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:29.961]  It means he doesn't have to turn to the parliament to get a majority anymore.
[03:22:29.961 --> 03:22:36.703]  And by 1928, all the other parties, except the fascist party, are banned.
[03:22:36.703 --> 03:22:38.984]  So that's about a timetable.
[03:22:38.984 --> 03:22:42.065]  That's a timetable of five to six years.
[03:22:42.065 --> 03:22:49.567]  The crisis today, of course, is the stock market is reminding us, even as we speak, this is obviously a very acute crisis.
[03:22:50.882 --> 03:22:53.884]  Maybe our institutions are a little bit stronger.
[03:22:53.884 --> 03:23:00.608]  The concept of the Constitution is stronger, I think, in the American people than in the Italians of those days.
[03:23:00.608 --> 03:23:01.609]  Let's hope so.
[03:23:01.609 --> 03:23:04.070]  We're going to need every bit of help we can get.
[03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:08.653]  So I urge people now to think about developing that kind of a perspective.
[03:23:08.653 --> 03:23:13.096]  The transition, the hundred days, and then the two years.
[03:23:13.096 --> 03:23:19.800]  Looking forward to essentially ending the one-party state by November
[03:23:20.507 --> 03:23:24.188]  of the year 2010, two years from now.
[03:23:24.188 --> 03:23:30.690]  I urge people, don't look to any established political party or faction to do this for you.
[03:23:30.690 --> 03:23:33.270]  You will have to do this yourself.
[03:23:33.270 --> 03:23:44.033]  People should begin to look around for Congressional seats, and indeed Senate seats, that they can compete for in the coming years.
[03:23:44.033 --> 03:23:47.414]  And that means having a two-year perspective towards November of 2010,
[03:23:49.201 --> 03:23:51.282]  To take back the government.
[03:23:51.282 --> 03:23:56.585]  The goal of all of this is not to get government out of your lives, it's to get you into the government.
[03:23:56.585 --> 03:24:07.172]  That you take over the government and run it according to the needs of the American people, which are, of course, constitutional government, the continuation of freedom,
[03:24:08.004 --> 03:24:16.430]  And economic recovery conducted under the all-important General Welfare Clause of the preamble to the U.S.
[03:24:16.430 --> 03:24:17.311]  Constitution.
[03:24:17.311 --> 03:24:19.212]  Alex kidds me, he calls me a liberal.
[03:24:19.212 --> 03:24:20.133]  I'm not a liberal.
[03:24:20.133 --> 03:24:22.375]  I'm an American system traditionalist.
[03:24:22.375 --> 03:24:25.096]  This is the main line of American history.
[03:24:25.096 --> 03:24:29.740]  Government, the Governor Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony,
[03:24:31.104 --> 03:24:33.726]  Benjamin Franklin, the founder of the Post Office.
[03:24:33.726 --> 03:24:42.450]  Alexander Hamilton, without whom the country would have collapsed within the first 10 to 15 years when the British had us on their death watch.
[03:24:42.450 --> 03:24:48.474]  Henry Clay of Kentucky, who coined the term the American System, meaning a protective tariff.
[03:24:49.134 --> 03:24:53.556]  Internal improvements, a national bank, and the promotion of science.
[03:24:53.556 --> 03:24:58.639]  That's the big influence, of course, on Lincoln, along with Matthew Carey and Henry Carey.
[03:24:58.639 --> 03:25:04.822]  We then have the prairie populace of the 1880s and 1890s, the Omaha Convention, which is the same idea.
[03:25:05.402 --> 03:25:07.144]  Get you into the government.
[03:25:07.144 --> 03:25:09.186]  You take over the government.
[03:25:09.186 --> 03:25:11.268]  Mobilize politically.
[03:25:11.268 --> 03:25:17.094]  Don't go into the wilderness and live in a hut, but go to Washington and take over the Congress.
[03:25:17.094 --> 03:25:20.477]  Because if these people can do it, by God, anybody can.
[03:25:20.477 --> 03:25:24.461]  If that guy can become president, then anybody can get into the Congress.
[03:25:24.981 --> 03:25:32.427]  And then, of course, the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the attempted revival of that, the New Frontier of John F. Kennedy.
[03:25:32.427 --> 03:25:33.868]  That's the American tradition.
[03:25:33.868 --> 03:25:36.590]  That is what we have to work with.
[03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:43.495]  And I urge you to mobilize, even if you don't agree with all of that, mobilize to take over the Congress in November of 2010.
[03:25:43.495 --> 03:25:50.561]  And this means you.
[03:25:50.561 --> 03:25:51.942]  We're on the march.
[03:25:51.942 --> 03:25:53.463]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:25:54.475 --> 03:26:00.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:04.102]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:26:04.102 --> 03:26:09.846]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:26:09.846 --> 03:26:14.170]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:26:14.170 --> 03:26:16.631]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:26:16.631 --> 03:26:22.756]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and
[03:26:22.776 --> 03:26:27.999]  And longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around.
[03:26:27.999 --> 03:26:36.704]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[03:26:36.704 --> 03:26:39.846]  The result is a delicious nutty, buttery flavor.
[03:26:39.926 --> 03:26:44.848]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:26:44.848 --> 03:26:46.729]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:27:09.833 --> 03:27:11.354]  But who is the enemy?
[03:27:11.354 --> 03:27:12.175]  Bin Laden.
[03:27:12.175 --> 03:27:13.196]  This is his M.O.
[03:27:13.196 --> 03:27:14.517]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:27:14.517 --> 03:27:16.538]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:27:16.538 --> 03:27:23.683]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:27:23.683 --> 03:27:24.164]  Some U.S.
[03:27:24.164 --> 03:27:29.828]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:27:30.508 --> 03:27:34.009]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:27:34.009 --> 03:27:36.810]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:00.603 --> 03:28:10.367]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[03:28:10.367 --> 03:28:13.609]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[03:28:14.302 --> 03:28:16.083]  Face was my own face.
[03:28:16.083 --> 03:28:18.545]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties.
[03:28:18.545 --> 03:28:20.727]  A movie the government does not want you to see.
[03:28:20.727 --> 03:28:23.328]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[03:28:23.328 --> 03:28:26.330]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping and more.
[03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:29.653]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

[03:29:01.245 --> 03:29:07.747]  As we've been trotted on the wine spread, through the much too long street bell,
[03:29:18.260 --> 03:29:19.981]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Program.
[03:29:19.981 --> 03:29:22.382]  This is Webster Tarpley in Washington, D.C.
[03:29:22.382 --> 03:29:26.744]  filling in, or attempting to fill in, for Alex this afternoon.
[03:29:26.744 --> 03:29:28.505]  Let me just sum it up.
[03:29:28.505 --> 03:29:31.886]  You've got to look for means of institutional resistance.
[03:29:31.886 --> 03:29:36.168]  You've got about half of the American people who don't like the new regime.
[03:29:36.168 --> 03:29:37.728]  This is no landslide.
[03:29:37.728 --> 03:29:40.990]  There is no mandate for any kind of radical change.
[03:29:40.990 --> 03:29:41.950]  Nothing of that sort.
[03:29:43.328 --> 03:29:49.170]  It's essentially another close-to-a-draw, 50-50 situation.
[03:29:49.170 --> 03:29:53.352]  This is not a permanent realignment of the party system in any way, shape, or form.
[03:29:53.352 --> 03:29:57.933]  It all depends on the figure of Barkey Obama, who won't be there forever.
[03:29:57.933 --> 03:30:01.414]  He can't be the center of a 40-year cycle.
[03:30:01.414 --> 03:30:03.355]  Same thing would have been true with McCain.
[03:30:03.355 --> 03:30:06.796]  It means that the party realignment remains open.
[03:30:06.796 --> 03:30:11.338]  The question of the permanent majority, one way or the other, remains open.
[03:30:12.150 --> 03:30:15.271]  Look around for possible institutional resistance.
[03:30:15.271 --> 03:30:18.453]  Look for those Republicans in the Congress.
[03:30:18.453 --> 03:30:20.534]  Look for conservative Democrats.
[03:30:20.534 --> 03:30:22.355]  Look for some New Deal Democrats.
[03:30:22.355 --> 03:30:28.878]  The kind of combination that came together in the House against the bailout the first time around is your
[03:30:29.938 --> 03:30:31.119]  Guideline, I would say.
[03:30:31.119 --> 03:30:34.661]  And, of course, don't forget the Supreme Court.
[03:30:34.661 --> 03:30:39.085]  Nobody's used to looking to the Supreme Court for anything positive these days.
[03:30:39.085 --> 03:30:43.247]  What with Robert Toledo, Thomas, and Scalia running around there.
[03:30:43.247 --> 03:30:46.470]  But, you know, lots of things have turned into their opposite this year.
[03:30:46.470 --> 03:30:50.232]  And maybe some of these characters will, too, right?
[03:30:50.232 --> 03:30:52.294]  That is the genius of the founders, right?
[03:30:52.294 --> 03:30:55.676]  That John Adams, dead for 200 years and more,
[03:30:57.455 --> 03:31:05.381]  is more powerful than some of these little schemers like Axelrod, Plouffe, and Favreau.
[03:31:05.381 --> 03:31:07.683]  We now have time for some calls.
[03:31:07.683 --> 03:31:09.044]  We have lines open at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:31:09.044 --> 03:31:09.445]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[03:31:09.445 --> 03:31:10.706]  So let's go right to your calls.
[03:31:10.706 --> 03:31:11.807]  Let's go to William in Texas.
[03:31:11.807 --> 03:31:13.028]  Welcome, William.
[03:31:13.028 --> 03:31:13.208]  Webster.
[03:31:22.911 --> 03:31:29.972]  I'd love to listen to you, but the first hour is always the hardest.
[03:31:29.972 --> 03:31:38.394]  After you've talked for about an hour, you get a little fatigued and tired, and you fall under the heading of easy listening, which I love.
[03:31:38.394 --> 03:31:51.757]  But your work, man, your IQ is, I think, obviously higher than most of the audience, because you are a wealth of information, and you are firing with both barrels.
[03:31:54.293 --> 03:31:55.573]  Certainly, initially.
[03:31:55.573 --> 03:31:59.394]  And, you know, it's just, you've got a lot to say and that's a good thing.
[03:31:59.394 --> 03:32:00.795]  Great.
[03:32:00.795 --> 03:32:03.156]  So look, did I convince you to do anything is the point.
[03:32:03.156 --> 03:32:04.096]  You've got to bear with me.
[03:32:04.096 --> 03:32:09.918]  I've been on the radio probably more hours in the past 48 than I care to mention.
[03:32:09.918 --> 03:32:12.499]  So if I get a little bit hoarse, you've got to bear with me.
[03:32:12.499 --> 03:32:14.200]  This is warfare, my friend.
[03:32:14.200 --> 03:32:15.040]  This is war.
[03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:17.701]  Tell me about your plans to run for Congress.
[03:32:19.033 --> 03:32:20.154]  I'm sorry?
[03:32:20.154 --> 03:32:22.254]  Tell me about your plans to run for Congress.
[03:32:22.254 --> 03:32:27.897]  You're not going to sit there like a literary critic and say, well, the voice was a little bit hoarse in the upper registers.
[03:32:27.897 --> 03:32:30.138]  What are you going to do?
[03:32:30.138 --> 03:32:34.180]  Well, you know, I really thought about this a lot.
[03:32:34.180 --> 03:32:46.245]  And I can tell you that how I feel and from what I see, I think there were more people that voted against the other opponent than voted for.
[03:32:46.245 --> 03:32:46.865]  I think you're right.
[03:32:48.146 --> 03:32:52.307]  I think you're right, but we've got acorn vote fraud and we've got the mass brainwashing.
[03:32:52.307 --> 03:32:54.227]  This was a postmodern coup.
[03:32:54.227 --> 03:32:56.248]  This was a CIA people power coup.
[03:32:56.248 --> 03:32:57.208]  I wrote a book about it.
[03:32:57.208 --> 03:32:59.268]  It's called Obama the Postmodern Coup.
[03:32:59.268 --> 03:33:01.229]  It's the same thing they did in Kiev.
[03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:02.649]  They did it in Tbilisi.
[03:33:02.649 --> 03:33:04.589]  They tried to do it in Beirut.
[03:33:04.589 --> 03:33:06.950]  Interestingly, in Beirut, they couldn't do it.
[03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:12.211]  If you have an actual mass organization, which in that case was Hezbollah, there's no way around it.
[03:33:12.211 --> 03:33:13.631]  Hezbollah stopped them cold.
[03:33:13.991 --> 03:33:17.312]  If we had a mass organization, we could stop them cold, too.
[03:33:17.312 --> 03:33:20.753]  Obviously, it wouldn't be Hezbollah, but you get the idea.
[03:33:20.753 --> 03:33:22.254]  Yes.
[03:33:22.254 --> 03:33:40.359]  Well, I think, though, that in looking at the states that voted against, I don't want to say it the other way, that voted against Obama, I've lived in a majority of those states in my years, and I know how those people are.
[03:33:41.548 --> 03:33:54.296]  And if they think that there's going to be any kind of Obama honeymoon here, they are totally too far up in their ivory towers and out of touch.
[03:33:54.296 --> 03:34:02.161]  I think that people... It's not that Obama is so great.
[03:34:02.161 --> 03:34:07.684]  It looks to me like it's just that George Bush is that bad.
[03:34:07.684 --> 03:34:08.244]  Sure thing.
[03:34:08.244 --> 03:34:09.625]  Thank you for your call, William.
[03:34:09.625 --> 03:34:10.606]  We look forward to you
[03:34:11.604 --> 03:34:15.425]  Coming forward politically, obviously there were counter-currents, right?
[03:34:15.425 --> 03:34:28.069]  One current was the hatred of Bush, Cheney, the neocons, the desire to punish the Republicans for their deregulation agenda, for letting the derivatives monsters run wild.
[03:34:28.069 --> 03:34:38.532]  Then, of course, there was a counter-current, which was the fear and loathing of the unknown Obama with all of the very, very sordid and unsavory
[03:34:39.381 --> 03:34:41.602]  Associations that he brought in.
[03:34:41.602 --> 03:34:46.665]  So, um, I think, yes, there is an anti-fascist majority in this country.
[03:34:46.665 --> 03:34:49.627]  Anyway, that's the historical bet we've got to place.
[03:34:49.627 --> 03:34:58.953]  Place a bet on the fact that the American people are still anti-fascist in spite of all of this brainwashing, 9-11, Iraq War, and so forth.
[03:34:58.953 --> 03:35:03.876]  This is the anti-fascist country par excellence, and we don't want to forget it.
[03:35:03.876 --> 03:35:06.137]  Let's remind people the lines are open at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:35:09.423 --> 03:35:12.165]  And let's go to Sean in California.
[03:35:12.165 --> 03:35:12.985]  Hey, Webster.
[03:35:12.985 --> 03:35:16.407]  Just a couple of quick comments and then a question.
[03:35:16.407 --> 03:35:25.032]  Excellent intro into Obama and specifically what to be aware of in terms of his policies and how to start to combat them.
[03:35:25.032 --> 03:35:27.033]  But just two quick comments.
[03:35:27.033 --> 03:35:36.178]  You know, I find continued discussion of Obama's citizenship status and his passions and drugs really futile and mostly a diversion and waste of energy.
[03:35:36.178 --> 03:35:37.819]  And we've got bigger things to
[03:35:39.441 --> 03:35:45.104]  I'm concerned that those are going to be used as divisive and diversionary tactics.
[03:35:45.104 --> 03:35:48.625]  Look, just on that, I think any issue is legitimate.
[03:35:48.625 --> 03:35:55.808]  And again, some guy said to me, it sounds like you want to have the Napoleonic Code, where you're considered guilty until you're proven innocent.
[03:35:55.808 --> 03:35:56.668]  Yes!
[03:35:56.668 --> 03:36:00.110]  For presidential candidates, we want the Napoleonic Code.
[03:36:00.569 --> 03:36:02.510]  In other words, you've got to prove to us.
[03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:05.052]  You want to get your hand on the thermonuclear button.
[03:36:05.052 --> 03:36:06.713]  You want to get the launch code.
[03:36:06.713 --> 03:36:08.455]  You've got to prove to us.
[03:36:08.455 --> 03:36:10.656]  Therefore, the burden of proof is on Obama.
[03:36:10.656 --> 03:36:11.917]  You want to be considered a U.S.
[03:36:11.917 --> 03:36:12.598]  citizen.
[03:36:12.598 --> 03:36:15.299]  You want us, you want this to shut up and go away.
[03:36:15.299 --> 03:36:19.302]  As Phil Berg said repeatedly, bring out the birth certificate.
[03:36:19.302 --> 03:36:21.264]  Why is this so hard?
[03:36:21.264 --> 03:36:25.267]  And I don't, I'm not in the business of declaring any issue off the table.
[03:36:25.267 --> 03:36:28.409]  You've obviously, you've got a pretty heterogeneous, like, different, uh,
[03:36:29.301 --> 03:36:34.645]  Groups that are coming together now in fear of Obama, want to resist him.
[03:36:34.645 --> 03:36:36.867]  Every one of those will bring its own outlook.
[03:36:36.867 --> 03:36:41.291]  In other words, for some people, the issue of the illegal alien is going to be the big one.
[03:36:41.291 --> 03:36:44.673]  That's not the case for me, but fine.
[03:36:44.673 --> 03:36:46.335]  All of this stuff is on the table.
[03:36:46.335 --> 03:36:48.416]  It's a smorgasbord of reasons.
[03:36:48.416 --> 03:36:50.318]  Any reason to oppose Obama is a good one.
[03:36:52.052 --> 03:36:53.953]  Um, well, I would just say prioritize.
[03:36:53.953 --> 03:36:59.976]  I mean, I think we're in a situation now where we've really got to stay focused, and so prioritization is really key.
[03:36:59.976 --> 03:37:04.598]  And focusing on that one issue, I don't think it's going to... Now, didn't you do that today?
[03:37:04.598 --> 03:37:11.402]  I gave you about a dozen issues that I think are more important, but this obviously remains... Look, the Constitution.
[03:37:11.402 --> 03:37:12.162]  Think of it.
[03:37:12.162 --> 03:37:13.943]  We had a terrible civil war.
[03:37:13.943 --> 03:37:15.984]  I think we've got to learn from that.
[03:37:15.984 --> 03:37:19.166]  If you don't have the Constitution, you may have civil war.
[03:37:19.166 --> 03:37:21.467]  I'll take the Constitution, and it says in there,
[03:37:22.139 --> 03:37:24.741]  Natural-born citizen, and I don't think he is.
[03:37:24.741 --> 03:37:28.443]  So, if he wants to shut us up, bring forward the birth certificate.
[03:37:28.443 --> 03:37:30.645]  And let's push on.
[03:37:30.645 --> 03:37:38.370]  Okay, well let me go back to what I think is a bigger issue here, and that is, we've got a situation now where, what was the vote?
[03:37:38.370 --> 03:37:38.430]  45?
[03:37:38.430 --> 03:37:42.473]  You've got 47% of the population voted for him across the country, something like that?
[03:37:42.473 --> 03:37:43.934]  Well, those are the official figures.
[03:37:43.934 --> 03:37:46.196]  We've got a factor in acorn vote fraud, right?
[03:37:46.196 --> 03:37:50.499]  We've got the graveyard vote, we've got the Axelrod, Ploof, Daily, Machine,
[03:37:51.303 --> 03:37:52.625]  So, factor that in too.
[03:37:52.625 --> 03:37:53.646]  I think it's about 50-50.
[03:37:53.646 --> 03:37:57.011]  Or maybe anti-fascist 51.
[03:37:57.011 --> 03:38:06.624]  I think what concerns me the most is we've got now some 40-odd percent of the population who have really become just Obama bots.
[03:38:06.624 --> 03:38:08.947]  Who are now looking at this man as some sort of deity.
[03:38:09.434 --> 03:38:14.417]  Now, of course, the mass media has done a lot of work to present him as such.
[03:38:14.417 --> 03:38:25.485]  So we've got a situation where the rest of us, or some subset of the rest of us who are actually thinking clearly, now have an administration, an incredibly powerful administration and private industry we've got to battle.
[03:38:25.485 --> 03:38:36.953]  But we've got some 40-odd percent left-wing fruitcakes who view this as a deity who we also have to fight, who will be the perfect candidates as brownshirts going forward.
[03:38:37.412 --> 03:38:40.893]  How in the heck are we going to deal with that mess?
[03:38:40.893 --> 03:38:42.833]  Yeah, look, I think you're much too pessimistic.
[03:38:42.833 --> 03:38:56.417]  The Obama vote total is not composed exclusively or even primarily of the Kool-Aid drinking, fanatical, lemming personality cultists.
[03:38:56.417 --> 03:38:57.597]  It's not.
[03:38:57.597 --> 03:39:03.159]  There's probably a group, I mean, it seems to me that it's the left liberals who are the worst offenders
[03:39:04.002 --> 03:39:18.527]  In this regard, right, which is maybe 10 or 15 percent, a lot of those people who voted for Obama did so in desperation because they're looking for a way out of this terrible economic situation.
[03:39:18.527 --> 03:39:20.268]  Now, the Republicans didn't help.
[03:39:20.268 --> 03:39:21.888]  The Republicans had ads.
[03:39:21.888 --> 03:39:25.449]  I was, you know, listening to the ones for the battleground state of Virginia.
[03:39:25.449 --> 03:39:29.951]  The Republicans were saying, if you vote for Obama, government-sponsored health care is on its way.
[03:39:30.441 --> 03:39:40.632]  Well, a lot of people hear that and they'll say, hallelujah, I need healthcare, I don't care who's giving it to me, don't tell me about free enterprise and, you know, the Austrian school.
[03:39:40.632 --> 03:39:44.195]  We need healthcare, not lectures about economic theory.
[03:39:44.195 --> 03:39:49.661]  So the Republicans, by their primitive and stupid economic propaganda,
[03:39:50.419 --> 03:39:51.640]  Uh, have played into this.
[03:39:51.640 --> 03:39:55.182]  A lot of people really think that Obama's going to redistribute the wealth.
[03:39:55.182 --> 03:39:56.323]  A lot of those people are hurting.
[03:39:56.323 --> 03:39:57.764]  Now, naturally, he's not going to do that.
[03:39:57.764 --> 03:40:05.128]  The wealth will be redistributed into the pockets of Soros and Rockefeller and Roehattan and Rubin and Goldman Sachs.
[03:40:05.128 --> 03:40:06.629]  That's going to be the reality.
[03:40:06.629 --> 03:40:14.334]  But I would not, in a million years, say that there's half of the American people who are in the Lemming category of the Kool-Aid
[03:40:15.130 --> 03:40:15.950]  Obama drinkers.
[03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:17.991]  I'd say it's more like 10 or 15 percent.
[03:40:17.991 --> 03:40:24.592]  There is a special case of the black community where you can understand the mechanisms that were involved.
[03:40:24.592 --> 03:40:26.232]  It's unfortunate, right?
[03:40:26.232 --> 03:40:29.433]  There was a demagogic ploy aimed at them as well.
[03:40:29.433 --> 03:40:30.813]  Some of them have succumbed.
[03:40:30.813 --> 03:40:31.333]  Not all.
[03:40:31.333 --> 03:40:33.933]  There are very important black voices.
[03:40:33.933 --> 03:40:38.174]  There's Glenn Ford, who's talked about Obama as the war hoe.
[03:40:38.174 --> 03:40:42.535]  There are authoritative... There's people like Kedi Awadu at the LIB Network in
[03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:50.332]  In Los Angeles, who's been very, very critical, and a number of others, but I would not be pessimistic.
[03:40:50.332 --> 03:40:58.435]  In other words, the 50% that seem to support Obama are the ones who have projected their wishes onto this blank slate.
[03:40:58.435 --> 03:41:06.378]  As soon as he gets into office, he's going to start losing large chunks, both on his left and on his right, because of the things that he's going to do.
[03:41:09.151 --> 03:41:09.811]  I hope you're right.
[03:41:09.811 --> 03:41:15.937]  I just went back to Clinton and gave him quite a few years of free reign.
[03:41:15.937 --> 03:41:17.939]  Listen, I don't know where you get this.
[03:41:17.939 --> 03:41:25.686]  Clinton, the only thing we can say about Clinton is that he was better than Bush the Elder, better than Dole, and better than Bush the Younger.
[03:41:25.686 --> 03:41:30.030]  And the idea that Clinton was somehow the end of the world is, I find, fantastic.
[03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:32.893]  This is where I part company with the right-wing
[03:41:33.977 --> 03:41:35.217]  A brand of thinking, right?
[03:41:35.217 --> 03:41:45.221]  Clinton was, if anything, a relative respite compared to what had come before, the alternative with Dole and then the Bush regime.
[03:41:45.221 --> 03:41:50.702]  Anyway, Obama is... Forget it, there's just no comparison between Clinton and Obama.
[03:41:50.702 --> 03:41:58.065]  You can compare Obama to Carter, but then as soon as you've said Carter, you've got to say, yes, like Carter, but a hundred or a thousand times worse.
[03:41:58.065 --> 03:41:58.705]  That's your real
[03:41:59.475 --> 03:42:01.277]  Last comment, if you like.
[03:42:01.277 --> 03:42:02.999]  Yeah, I'll disagree with you on that.
[03:42:02.999 --> 03:42:04.560]  They came out of it.
[03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:05.501]  These guys are all insane.
[03:42:21.687 --> 03:42:24.329]  One's ruling one or one's ruling the other.
[03:42:24.329 --> 03:42:26.411]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:42:26.411 --> 03:42:27.071]  Here's the difference.
[03:42:27.071 --> 03:42:27.812]  Thank you for your call.
[03:42:27.812 --> 03:42:31.494]  We've got to push on, but let me just, this comment in transition.
[03:42:31.494 --> 03:42:39.520]  The big difference is who has a fascist mass movement or who has something that looks like a fascist mass movement.
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:40.781]  Clinton never had this.
[03:42:41.423 --> 03:42:44.124]  Nor did Bush the Elder, nor did Bush the Younger.
[03:42:44.124 --> 03:42:46.105]  McCain had no movement.
[03:42:46.105 --> 03:42:52.267]  There was no group in the population that was fanatically, hysterically devoted to the personality cult of McCain.
[03:42:52.267 --> 03:42:54.828]  That is what made McCain more attractive.
[03:42:54.828 --> 03:42:58.209]  It made him a lesser evil because he was, quite frankly, weaker.
[03:42:58.209 --> 03:43:02.251]  He didn't have the 200,000 German lemmings at the Brandenburg Gate.
[03:43:02.251 --> 03:43:05.192]  He could not inflame Africa to kick out the Chinese.
[03:43:05.192 --> 03:43:06.313]  He couldn't do any of that.
[03:43:06.313 --> 03:43:09.834]  As an imperialist, as a strikebreaker, as an austerity enforcer,
[03:43:10.279 --> 03:43:12.520]  McCain was just weaker up and down the line.
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:18.863]  We would have been better off with McCain, no matter what, how evil his subjective intentions might have been.
[03:43:18.863 --> 03:43:27.447]  And now you're going to see what it's like when you get the power of the executive combined with this aspect of the fascist mass movement.
[03:43:27.447 --> 03:43:31.289]  Now, let me stress, it's a theatrical movement.
[03:43:31.289 --> 03:43:33.370]  It's not a real movement.
[03:43:33.370 --> 03:43:34.771]  It's not, you know, like some
[03:43:35.644 --> 03:43:42.389]  Uh, you know, worker-based, uh, left-wing party that can put, you know, real people into the streets in a serious way.
[03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:53.216]  It's the sort of, uh, well, the stuff you saw on TV last night in Grant Park, but that's enough to allow the media to go to work and use that for mass brainwashing purposes.
[03:43:53.216 --> 03:43:55.018]  So that's the problem we face.
[03:43:55.018 --> 03:43:56.459]  How about John in Ohio?
[03:43:56.459 --> 03:43:59.541]  You still with us, John?
[03:43:59.541 --> 03:44:00.862]  Yes, I am, uh, Webster.
[03:44:00.862 --> 03:44:03.884]  I think you say some, uh, wonderful things, but I do have some differences.
[03:44:04.810 --> 03:44:08.331]  I do believe that we can't pander to some of these right-wing attitudes.
[03:44:08.331 --> 03:44:30.437]  I think the best way of exposing and attacking Obama's false face is to link him with exactly the policies of the people who voted for him out of hatred for the Bush-Cheney team, showing on every issue, from the police state to the wars, that he's every bit as much a reactionary warmonger
[03:44:30.837 --> 03:44:31.578]  Yes, we are.
[03:44:51.701 --> 03:44:58.425]  of the PNAC neocons, and this is now being carried out in its second phase by Obama.
[03:44:58.425 --> 03:45:11.413]  And I think if we show that his warmongering is, as you very eloquently do, is even more dangerous, because it's simply the extension of the Bush-Cheney operation.
[03:45:11.413 --> 03:45:18.498]  And if we constantly link him to the people who voted for him because of hatred for Bush and Cheney, I think that's a good
[03:45:19.654 --> 03:45:36.890]  Approaching and I also resent this idea that you know a pandering to some of these right-wing attitudes like Jerome Corsi bottom feeders like that because I think those people are exactly perpetrating the kinds of attitudes the kind of hysteria against
[03:45:38.270 --> 03:45:43.592]  Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and China.
[03:45:43.592 --> 03:45:53.555]  We can't deal with these people because they are using their attacks of Obama in an exactly inverted way, calling him ridiculously a socialist.
[03:45:53.555 --> 03:45:54.635]  Socialists detest
[03:45:55.273 --> 03:45:55.553]  I think?
[03:46:10.453 --> 03:46:18.159]  Everybody should vote for Obama because he will put a better face, a more effective face, on the policies of the elite.
[03:46:18.159 --> 03:46:29.068]  So I think, you know, we've got to constantly link Obama with the hated Bush and Cheney policies, and I think this is the best way to go.
[03:46:31.347 --> 03:46:38.956]  I just feel that any pandering to some of these right-wingers is actually playing into their hands.
[03:46:38.956 --> 03:46:39.998]  No pandering here.
[03:46:39.998 --> 03:46:41.059]  John, thank you for your call.
[03:46:41.059 --> 03:46:42.100]  We just got a breakdown.
[03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:44.283]  We'll be back in a minute to wrap up, I believe.
[03:47:00.791 --> 03:47:09.715]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:47:09.715 --> 03:47:14.858]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:47:14.858 --> 03:47:25.983]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:47:26.383 --> 03:47:32.167]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:47:32.167 --> 03:47:38.430]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:47:38.430 --> 03:47:39.471]  What about you?

[03:48:10.231 --> 03:48:12.012]  America, freedom to fascism.

[03:49:00.727 --> 03:49:02.408]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[03:49:03.024 --> 03:49:06.507]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[03:49:06.507 --> 03:49:15.333]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident, which will force unpopular decisions.
[03:49:15.333 --> 03:49:25.520]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted it on Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available is in a government breadline.
[03:49:25.520 --> 03:49:29.263]  When the President is faced with the expected national security incident,
[03:49:29.701 --> 03:49:34.363]  The in-place Patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[03:49:34.363 --> 03:49:38.706]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[03:49:38.706 --> 03:49:44.809]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:47.991]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself.
[03:49:47.991 --> 03:49:50.312]  Food for these unknown times.
[03:49:50.312 --> 03:49:51.793]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[03:50:03.061 --> 03:50:09.684]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:50:09.684 --> 03:50:14.025]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:50:14.025 --> 03:50:23.089]  This is actually Webster Tarpley filling in this afternoon for Alex from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
[03:50:23.089 --> 03:50:26.410]  In answer to the last caller, I have to defend Corsi.
[03:50:26.410 --> 03:50:28.831]  Naturally, Corsi's stuff about Iran I wouldn't agree with.
[03:50:29.471 --> 03:50:33.292]  But Corsi's book on Obama performed an important public service.
[03:50:33.292 --> 03:50:37.733]  It has limits that I would regard as the ideology.
[03:50:37.733 --> 03:50:41.074]  I would say the way to deal with Obama is to tell the truth.
[03:50:41.074 --> 03:50:51.276]  It's unfortunately the case that his ideological matrix is that of neo-fascism, and this is true, and it's also better politics.
[03:50:51.276 --> 03:50:56.197]  It would have served the Republicans better, but they obviously were just incapable
[03:50:57.057 --> 03:51:07.954]  of doing this, but within the limits of what he did, of course he performed an important public service, and of course Obama is an exponent, not just of escalated wars in Afghanistan, Sudan,
[03:51:08.584 --> 03:51:17.591]  And vis-a-vis Russia, China, but by voting for the FISA law, he gave this retroactive immunity to the telecoms.
[03:51:17.591 --> 03:51:19.072]  Look, we've got three callers left.
[03:51:19.072 --> 03:51:20.693]  Let's give each caller 30 seconds.
[03:51:20.693 --> 03:51:24.335]  You talk 30 seconds, I'll try to answer you in 30, and we'll get all three in.
[03:51:24.335 --> 03:51:26.037]  Let's go to Daryl in Hawaii.
[03:51:26.037 --> 03:51:30.060]  You've got half a minute.
[03:51:30.060 --> 03:51:33.082]  Okay, let's go to Don in New York City.
[03:51:33.082 --> 03:51:34.042]  Hello?
[03:51:34.042 --> 03:51:35.543]  I just wanted to ask a question.
[03:51:35.543 --> 03:51:36.004]  How would Obama
[03:51:39.124 --> 03:51:42.806]  How would he use to fight against our Second Amendment rights?
[03:51:42.806 --> 03:51:44.487]  And how would he do this?
[03:51:44.487 --> 03:51:45.868]  What laws would he pass?
[03:51:45.868 --> 03:51:47.609]  Stuff like that.
[03:51:47.609 --> 03:51:48.790]  What are we talking about?
[03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:50.070]  Gun control?
[03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:51.872]  Yes, Obama's plan for gun control.
[03:51:51.872 --> 03:51:55.854]  He comes up with a good thing called the Joyce Foundation.
[03:51:55.854 --> 03:52:06.260]  And the Joyce Foundation is one of the ones that represents the ruling class commitment to gun control as a blanket federal regulation.
[03:52:08.271 --> 03:52:10.473]  You want to see what Obama's going to do?
[03:52:10.473 --> 03:52:18.660]  Don't listen to the words coming out of Obama's mouth, but go to the website of the Joyce Foundation and look at the kind of stuff that they've been doing.
[03:52:18.660 --> 03:52:26.326]  Probably on the Joyce Foundation website, you can figure out who Obama's principal advisor is in areas of gun control.
[03:52:26.326 --> 03:52:28.868]  It's always better to listen to the advisors.
[03:52:28.868 --> 03:52:31.030]  If you listen to Obama, you get rhetoric.
[03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:32.391]  If you listen to the advisors,
[03:52:32.973 --> 03:52:38.017]  They'll tell you what he's going to do, like Brzezinski, who says it's time to get tough with Russia.
[03:52:38.017 --> 03:52:40.298]  So that, I think, would be the guide.
[03:52:40.298 --> 03:52:46.282]  How about, we have a caller, I think, Ronnie in Texas.
[03:52:46.282 --> 03:52:47.503]  Yeehaw!
[03:52:47.503 --> 03:52:48.864]  Fire away!
[03:52:48.864 --> 03:52:59.532]  I ran in 2000 to defeat your lapdog, Lloyd Doggett, but you were challenging us to participate, and I'm proud to do so.
[03:53:00.225 --> 03:53:12.374]  Anyway, Clinton, and I disagree with you, I think Clinton is still an evil, traitorous stooge for Zionism, and really only to be topped by the Jeanne Bush regime.
[03:53:12.374 --> 03:53:16.037]  And look out for Vice President... What?
[03:53:16.037 --> 03:53:26.124]  As one of our callers was saying, you cannot essentially start saying, I won't cooperate with Corsi because of his biography or this or that.
[03:53:26.124 --> 03:53:27.585]  In the case of these politicians,
[03:53:28.837 --> 03:53:30.538]  You're playing one against another.
[03:53:30.538 --> 03:53:33.680]  In other words, think of it as using an instrument.
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:39.763]  The ambition and the hatred felt by Bill and Hillary against Obama might be an asset.
[03:53:39.763 --> 03:53:40.924]  Don't rule it out.
[03:53:40.924 --> 03:53:42.145]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:53:42.145 --> 03:53:49.909]  Okay, I misunderstand you, but I was just also going to say that Joe Builderberger Biden is really the one, the control agent.
[03:53:49.909 --> 03:53:51.410]  He keeps Obama in line.
[03:53:51.410 --> 03:53:55.272]  Obama doesn't, there's not a chance we're going to get anything good out of Obama because
[03:53:56.132 --> 03:53:59.973]  Like I said, Joe Biden's been a Build-A-Burger for literally decades.
[03:53:59.973 --> 03:54:01.033]  Quite right.
[03:54:01.033 --> 03:54:06.975]  And so if people would learn about that, Google Build-A-Burger and you'd be amazed.
[03:54:06.975 --> 03:54:08.415]  Okay, well that's what Obama is.
[03:54:08.415 --> 03:54:09.595]  I'm afraid we've run out of time.
[03:54:09.595 --> 03:54:10.436]  Thank you, Ronnie.
[03:54:10.436 --> 03:54:14.937]  It's the Build-A-Burger, bilateral, Rand Corporation regime.
[03:54:14.937 --> 03:54:19.818]  Joe Biden, of course, from the PNA credit card gouging.
[03:54:19.818 --> 03:54:22.739]  Remember, Obama, the post-modern coup here at InfoWars.
[03:54:23.849 --> 03:54:27.492]  Obama the Unauthorized Biography at Amazon.com.
[03:54:27.492 --> 03:54:31.835]  And I thank Alex for letting me sit in for him this afternoon.
[03:54:31.835 --> 03:54:36.279]  And remember, more than ever, get active or get radioactive!
