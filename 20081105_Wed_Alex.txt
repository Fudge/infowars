[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:30.080]  what has been most concerned about the 44th president Barack Obama is that I've never seen in the
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.280]  United States politics in our history someone being called world president messianic leader our
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.240]  savior when the corporate press is behind somebody like this look out Congress from Ron Paul joins
[00:41.240 --> 00:46.800]  us out of the gates for his analysis his breakdown the congressman from Texas of course the
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.360]  presidential candidate who since shockwaves through the political system the control left
[00:51.360 --> 00:58.000]  right paradigm is worth us for the next 20 minutes to break down what we're facing congressman are
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.480]  you feeling the dread that many of us are feeling right now yes I do but I don't think it's brand
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.040]  new I didn't wake up with it I've had it for a while I don't think the election was a surprise
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.240]  but the rhetoric is getting pretty strong and they are getting very bold I think McCain was
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.720]  obviously backup candidate in case something happened where Obama didn't win they'd have been
[01:20.720 --> 01:28.120]  okay they'd have been satisfied with McCain but they've been not positioning Obama for a long
[01:28.120 --> 01:36.080]  long time you know he's a man of the people and yet he was the first guy to spend you know more
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.760]  money than anybody else he probably spent more money than everybody else put together in his
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.760]  last two years and that was you know on the books it's about 750 million dollars but when
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.480]  you look at all the free stuff you look at all the things they've gone on in the last three or
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.840]  four years I consider the fact that he's probably had a two billion dollar campaign but we have to
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.280]  realize this started a long time before he even announced to be president if anybody who would
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.560]  have gotten that much favorable coverage for so long you know you know that the plans are laid
[02:07.560 --> 02:14.680]  for him to be the individual that's going to be taken care of the corporate elite well he's
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.960]  the guy who helped ram through the banker takeover bill and now what you predicted another's
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.120]  predicted is happening they're openly announcing the end of the dollar a new Bretton Woods a
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.560]  new world monetary system run by a small group of private international banks we will buy our
[02:30.560 --> 02:37.520]  carbon credits from them and Barack Obama is a signal that he will do whatever they say yep
[02:37.520 --> 02:43.560]  and I think it's no doubt about that he wouldn't be there he didn't tow the line and you know when
[02:43.560 --> 02:50.200]  the meeting starts on November 15th for the new monetary system this could be you know the
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.560]  beginning of the end of what we see is what's left of our national sovereignty I don't know how
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.960]  long it'll take for their announcement I guess the meeting starts on November 15th it won't be
[03:00.960 --> 03:05.560]  November 16th I think it'll be a little while before the announcement is made and before we
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.880]  fully understand it but I think the fact that the markets are relatively calm right now and the
[03:10.880 --> 03:17.600]  dollar has not totally crashed is all being orchestrated by all the central banks the message
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.320]  is out that the dollar is doomed they can't keep doing it I think temporarily they've been able to
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.920]  hold it together but something something has to give and it's on the business news station now
[03:27.920 --> 03:32.760]  it's not just your radio show and others talking about it I was watching a business station yesterday
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.760]  and they were very very upstake let's work on I guess you've heard it to her to that guy he was
[03:37.760 --> 03:44.240]  very much bragging about this thing you know about a new world reserve currency and world
[03:44.240 --> 03:50.720]  regulations that means world government and it looks like it's coming rather rapidly right now
[03:50.720 --> 03:56.120]  that's right he we played the clip yesterday he said over the banks over the stocks over every
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.200]  nation a trilateral world currency everything the trilateral commission announced in the 70s
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.840]  everything we warned people about an Obama is saying he's going to give us change but the
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.480]  change with class warfare is robbing the middle class and transferring at all for the multinational
[04:11.480 --> 04:17.920]  corporations you know I guess you heard a statement by Sarkozy from France he said that we
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.520]  want to reform capitalism but our president you know came right back and he says he's all for this
[04:23.520 --> 04:31.680]  world summit but only on one condition that we not tamper with the free market system and people
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.800]  believe this stuff you know they listen to that it just goes over their heads and it's so sad
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.360]  congressman Ron Paul is our guest we're going to be back in three minutes for one more long
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.720]  segment with him and I've got a list of important questions but I'm not having to ask them because
[04:48.720 --> 04:54.720]  he's already on the same page defending the republic defending the true free market defending
[04:54.720 --> 05:02.080]  sovereignty we'll break down the new 44th president when you're back hello friends this is Alex Jones
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.400]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.960]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg
[05:14.960 --> 05:19.440]  for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected
[05:19.440 --> 05:24.000]  representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.280]  not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at
[05:29.280 --> 05:34.560]  least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.600]  that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities
[05:39.600 --> 05:45.440]  particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf
[05:45.440 --> 05:51.120]  of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing
[05:51.120 --> 05:56.400]  so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.960]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:00.960 --> 06:05.920]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[06:05.920 --> 06:10.720]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[06:10.720 --> 06:15.680]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:15.680 --> 06:19.760]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by having
[06:19.760 --> 06:24.160]  a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.800]  it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.360]  of your family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship
[06:33.360 --> 06:38.320]  storable food that's safe from ecoli salmonella genetic alteration or chinese imports and they

[07:07.120 --> 07:19.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[07:20.640 --> 07:30.400]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones congressman
[07:30.400 --> 07:36.720]  ron paul is our guest for those that just tuned in the last second we were discussing other openly
[07:36.720 --> 07:41.360]  announcing a world government oven by a private good for central banks the same international
[07:41.360 --> 07:48.000]  institutions that created the derivatives implosion that we're seeing right now reuters obama urges
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.880]  to shape new economic order uh biden on the last week his running mate the new vice president elect
[07:54.880 --> 08:00.160]  has called for world government twice last week and a new world order everything we told you decades
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.120]  ago you are now seeing it so they move out the old puppet bush they're moving in the new puppet
[08:05.120 --> 08:10.640]  to fool the left now to get on this bandwagon and congressman i've been interviewing a lot of
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.200]  international experts uh by the way including sticklets who's pushing all of this right now
[08:16.480 --> 08:21.440]  and they are saying yes the big announcement that pal's talking about on the 21st or 22nd
[08:21.440 --> 08:29.760]  of january will be uh devaluing the dollar and basically announcing a new economic order
[08:29.760 --> 08:34.960]  run by the very people that orchestrated all of this uh but other world leaders are saying it's
[08:34.960 --> 08:43.120]  also going to be economic uh uh uh uh implosions and military adventures pakistan uh what is this
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.560]  huge event where they're naming dates but then won't tell us what it is well they're just getting
[08:48.560 --> 08:55.200]  us prepared and they are doing the planning and they're they're in charge and unfortunately the
[08:55.200 --> 09:02.320]  people get distracted i i consider our election this whole past year or two is just a distraction
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.040]  making everybody think boy this is really critical this election means everything you know if we
[09:07.040 --> 09:12.320]  don't have mccain uh the world is going to the go the dogs are vice versa we don't have obama
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.400]  we're not going to be able to take care of the people and the poor are all going to suffer and
[09:16.400 --> 09:23.520]  die and and it's it's all orchestrated that people so people are misdirected from the important issues
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.960]  that war and peace and money and the federal reserve and and a business cycle and all these
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.840]  calamities that are going on uh so they don't want us to know and and by time we do know and
[09:35.840 --> 09:40.960]  figure it out then it's so hard to reverse the trend you know it's sort of like the patriot
[09:40.960 --> 09:47.040]  action had been defeated before we passed it once it's passed it's really tough to repeal laws like
[09:47.040 --> 09:53.280]  that congressman uh pal is saying the 21st the 22nd others are naming that day um you're there at
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.080]  the hill uh you know you're closer to the inside of the actual workings of power than the general
[09:58.080 --> 10:05.120]  public is uh i mean have you uh heard anybody uh who has inside knowledge about what the crisis is
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.280]  or is it going to be the announcement of the new world order well i think it's going to be an
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.600]  announcement of a new monetary order and they'll probably make it sound it's very limited they're
[10:13.600 --> 10:19.440]  not going to say this is world government even though if you control the world money uh and you
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.280]  control the military which they do indirectly uh they they do control the world that they're mainly
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.240]  interested in controlling the money and natural resources and uh right now it's not in the hands
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.040]  of private property owners here in texas you know we we developed natural resources pretty much by
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.080]  private property ownership and and we all survived rather well but compare that to what happens in
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.640]  alaska but what happens when it's a world central bank worldwide regulation and world control of
[10:46.640 --> 10:55.120]  uh of the of the whole system of all of all the uh of all the commodities and uh all the natural
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.000]  resources uh what else can you call that other than world government and it's going to be controlled
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.200]  by the very financial institutions that orchestrated the controlled crisis and and they're openly
[11:05.200 --> 11:09.760]  saying for those that don't know and i'd like to comment on this now but these i met from world
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.480]  bank chiefs the head of the international bank of settlements treasury secretaries others
[11:14.480 --> 11:20.160]  of fed chairman are saying that we will pay a different stock taxes different derivatives
[11:20.160 --> 11:26.000]  taxes different uh you know taxes on the stock market transactions and there's going to be world
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.360]  carbon taxes that you buy from this group of banks i mean that is total control and as barack obama
[11:33.360 --> 11:37.840]  said he's going to bankrupt the coal industry that gives us 49 percent of our power this is the
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.920]  neo feudal model yep it is it's indirect control they're not going to own the coal mines but they
[11:43.920 --> 11:50.640]  what they and and the coal processes what they can do is just tax you and they can control us
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.880]  uh and i've argued the case that we don't have private property in this country anymore because
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.280]  uh we have all the responsibility and liability but can you use your land without getting permission
[11:59.280 --> 12:04.080]  you have to get 20 permits to use your uh use your own land in order to stay on the land you
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.040]  have to pay huge taxes so we pay around to stay our own property can't use unless you get government
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.400]  control and and government permission but here now the permission isn't going to just come from
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.080]  austin or just come from washington now we're going to have to go to a hagar or you know
[12:20.080 --> 12:27.200]  wherever wherever they uh control things and uh and the big the big thing here is it slows things
[12:27.200 --> 12:32.320]  up so much that they uh i imagine a few of them think that they'll be able to manage this and
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.200]  and we'll be able to help take care of everybody but obviously that is in the case they're going
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.560]  to make this world a lot poorer so obama is the pied piper after eight years of george bush and
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.800]  all of his new world order policies to lead america into the new world order that's why
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.040]  newsweek's calling him the president of the world they're calling him that in british
[12:51.040 --> 12:58.560]  and german and french newspapers uh obama mania in germany i mean they are calling him the one
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.440]  they are calling him the leader i mean anytime you see that in history congressman isn't that
[13:03.440 --> 13:11.680]  dangerous i mean that that means uh not only dangerous but maybe we have uh cross to rubicon
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.400]  you know maybe it's going to be very difficult so we have to look for sources of optimism what do
[13:16.400 --> 13:23.360]  we do ultimately though all that happens to us is a result of philosophy and beliefs and convictions
[13:23.360 --> 13:27.600]  and that's where i think we've made some inroads uh you know in spite of the shortcomings of our
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.080]  campaign i think we made some inroads in calling attention to a lot of people in this country
[13:32.080 --> 13:38.800]  the importance of monetary policy the importance of central bank uh the importance of uh of how
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.280]  government causes so much problems is that we're in the minority that's right your campaign covered
[13:43.280 --> 13:50.240]  all the issues that are now unfolding center stage on the world uh but as you said the the global
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.920]  crisis they were going to engineer for decades you've said this that when we came to that point
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.640]  it would be with the free market and liberty and freedom be able to use the crisis to expand
[14:00.640 --> 14:06.640]  liberty or with the establishment who orchestrated it use it to bring in more bondage now i want to
[14:06.640 --> 14:12.560]  get into the trifecta the house the senate the so now the legislative uh and the executive
[14:13.200 --> 14:19.680]  at least for a year or two with just just just absolute power uh how dangerous is that with
[14:19.680 --> 14:25.360]  chucky schumer talking about all these new taxes and more gun control and fairness doctrine
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.480]  restricting free speech i think it's very dangerous in the first year is probably going to be the most
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.960]  dangerous year and just think of bush's first year but he also had the 9 11 thing that he could use
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.640]  to scare everybody to death and obama will use the financial crisis the crisis will get worse
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.680]  and there'll be some more military skirmishes around the world so he'll say well we gotta do this
[14:47.680 --> 14:54.320]  gotta do this and just as the republican congressman say boo to our republican president you know
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.920]  the democratic congress is never going to stand up there'll be a couple maybe a dentist percentage
[14:59.920 --> 15:07.680]  and a few others who are principled in anti-war uh but the the democratic congress will not stand up
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.960]  uh to the president and matter of fact a lot of republicans might say hey how do i stay in here
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.200]  with obama so popular i better go along with i don't want to look like i'm in opposition to this
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.280]  sort of like how many people went along with the bailout oh i don't want to look like i don't care
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.440]  about the financial crisis i better vote for this oh i don't want to look like i don't care about
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.160]  you know the danger of the terrorists coming here i better vote for the patriot act there's
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.120]  gonna be a lot of that and there's gonna be a lot of legislation uh passed i think in the first year
[15:35.680 --> 15:41.440]  well that's the issue obama's called for a million-man youth brigade uh as large as the
[15:41.440 --> 15:48.480]  military domestically spying on us he supports the warrantless wiretaps the air force has now
[15:48.480 --> 15:56.320]  announced more brigades being added to north com uh to talk about crossing the rubicon what is the
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.320]  left again you know the mainline left going to do when they realize that barack obama is actually
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.760]  going to intensify all of the policies that george buschett well there's not too many left i mean
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.880]  you have the ralph natives and others but they get uh marginalized just as uh i was in the republican
[16:12.880 --> 16:19.280]  party so those who are principled who object to this uh aren't going to be heard from and uh people
[16:19.280 --> 16:26.400]  are going to going to go along with it and that of course is uh where our problem is uh so i don't
[16:26.400 --> 16:34.240]  know it doesn't doesn't look all that good no no it doesn't congressman how do we prepare for this
[16:34.240 --> 16:41.600]  how do we stop uh the i mean we already have the government triple under george bush now obama's
[16:41.600 --> 16:48.240]  talking about expanding and even more uh i mean what do we do in your educated opinion to somehow
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.880]  save the republic well they're going to claim they're saving it because they take all these people
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.600]  up and put them in all these organizations in the military on top of things all unemployment rates
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.400]  are are going down that's what they'll probably argue no we have to continue to do what we're
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.400]  doing you're in the business of passing on and spreading information that to me is the most
[17:06.400 --> 17:11.120]  crucial getting more people engaged more people understanding what the issues are nothing else
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.560]  is more important than that and then when you uh see an opportunity then we have to turn this
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.240]  into political action and hopefully we don't give up on that too soon but it does get rather
[17:22.240 --> 17:26.960]  frustrating especially after elections like this but there's going to be special elections so you
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.880]  know we're gonna there's two senators have to resign now there'll be special elections there
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.040]  there'll be uh you know congressman that'll you know there'll be special elections in special
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.400]  elections that give you a better opportunity uh for us to spread our message and identify
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.400]  because turnouts are lower that's how that's how i went off it's the very first time if i
[17:46.400 --> 17:51.200]  hadn't won that thing i'd have never been in politics congressman congressman do you think
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.760]  that we are in danger of not just them using the staged economic crisis that they created
[17:55.760 --> 18:01.200]  to get total control but gulf of tonkens because they're also talking about terror attacks
[18:01.200 --> 18:07.200]  inaugural bombings al qaeda al ciaida wants to test the resolve of the united states do you think
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.040]  that's in the cards oh it sure is uh but back to the philosophy is the philosophy of the bush
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.160]  doctrine which was that we have the right to preemptively strike anybody and then he even
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.360]  he even expanded that recently by saying well we don't have to invade and conquer
[18:23.360 --> 18:28.240]  but we have the right to go in and bomb anybody without their permission that's why we went into
[18:28.240 --> 18:36.560]  in it we go into pakistan and the syria which are acts of of war so uh they uh they they have
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.600]  the tools to do it and they have and then they have the sentiment and most americans are oblivious
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.160]  to what's happening so you're saying you think members of the establishment might stage something
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.720]  so that people will then support more warmongering but this time by obama yeah of course we've
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.320]  been worrying about that for a long time i thought it would have occurred sooner because bush was
[18:56.320 --> 19:01.760]  so anxious to go into our round uh it hasn't happened so far so maybe our talking about it
[19:01.760 --> 19:05.920]  made him back off a little bit commerce that means we should be complacent hold on one second

[25:45.840 --> 25:59.760]  i'm not sad that john mccain didn't win i don't care you heard ron paul say he was never meant
[25:59.760 --> 26:09.840]  to win they ran a corpse against barack obama they have been grooming barack obama for a
[26:09.840 --> 26:17.520]  long time to sell the progressives and the left in this country to go along with any evil
[26:17.520 --> 26:24.880]  committed by the new world order i'm upset to watch people calling him the world president the
[26:24.880 --> 26:31.120]  leader crying watching those crowds last night during his speech like they had seen jesus return
[26:31.120 --> 26:41.920]  and touchdown because i know his policies spy brigades fema camps wars handing everything

[28:23.920 --> 28:28.880]  he supports it you're not going to see them stop using spy satellites against the american people
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.440]  with the local police departments and warrantless wiretaps you're not going to see any of that

[34:18.320 --> 34:24.080]  a carbon emission from almost every form of human activity it doesn't matter if the north
[34:24.080 --> 34:27.840]  and south pole's got 30 plus percent bigger this year it doesn't matter if we're already
[34:27.840 --> 34:31.920]  having record cold temperatures it doesn't matter if it's because the sun has cooled off
[34:31.920 --> 34:39.280]  and the entire solar system is freezing again including the ice caps on mars the moons of

[35:08.560 --> 35:14.400]  are openly calling for it they are making their move and they put a new frontman in there they're
[35:14.400 --> 35:22.160]  calling the president of the world to sucker the planet into going along with it it's basic child
[35:22.160 --> 35:27.280]  psychology they talk to you like your children oh george busch says global warming isn't real
[35:27.280 --> 35:32.880]  he's dumb and stupid he's from texas meanwhile he signed on to it has actually been pushing
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.160]  it signed us back on to get us go and endorsed it so did john mccain but then the left all said well
[35:38.160 --> 35:47.280]  that it must be real it must be real you know if george busch says it isn't we better be for it see
[35:47.280 --> 35:55.680]  that basic reverse psychology that good cop bad cop game that they play with you

[36:22.000 --> 36:26.880]  he was a puppet it had nothing to do with george busch senior these people are frontmen
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.640]  for the social engineers nothing is going to change other than the fact they're going to
[36:32.640 --> 36:38.880]  turn the heat up even more the height of the flame the intensity of the flame burning this country
[36:38.880 --> 36:44.960]  to bits destroying our freedoms decimating liberty that's the only change there will be no change
[36:44.960 --> 36:51.600]  in reducing and reversing tyranny only an intensification of it with a public confused and
[36:51.600 --> 37:00.480]  bamboozled into believing that they're seeing real change and the most dangerous sign the most
[37:00.480 --> 37:09.200]  dangerous issue that we're dealing with is that i have watched newsreels going back in the 1930s
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.720]  i have read the historical books on every
[37:18.720 --> 37:26.080]  time period in the last 300 years in the united states 234 years since our country was officially
[37:26.080 --> 37:37.040]  founded and i have never seen the media worshiping someone like they were kim jong il of north korea
[37:37.760 --> 37:48.880]  or stalin of russia or adolf illis hitler of the right i have never seen it in fact it took them
[37:48.880 --> 37:56.320]  five six years after hitler got in power in 33 they didn't start worshiping him till 39
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.880]  they didn't start using all of those messiah terms until they were getting the public ready
[38:02.880 --> 38:08.560]  to go into war to go into empire to go into unpopular things and now they're doing it with
[38:08.560 --> 38:22.080]  obama out of the gates from the very beginning and you notice in his speech last night we're
[38:22.080 --> 38:30.720]  going to play it later in the show you notice that he said now i'm going to do a lot of things
[38:30.720 --> 38:38.720]  you're not going to like but i'm never going to lie to you that was a lie he swore to vote against
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.480]  warrantless wiretapping against the american people now he's for it he swore to end the war
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.680]  immediately now they're saying well we'll probably keep troops there forever you know we'll have a
[38:49.680 --> 38:56.240]  drawdown to 50 60 000 and that's it and i've been on international tv and radio with people part of
[38:56.240 --> 39:01.680]  his campaigns and they go oh that's right yeah we're going to keep 60 000 troops there
[39:04.960 --> 39:08.640]  because they're done they've done their dehumanization their mass murder millions dead they've taken
[39:08.640 --> 39:11.520]  over they got to move those troops on they got to move them back here
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.640]  you notice the army and the air force are announcing more brigades more units
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.120]  well if you read the original army times article it mentioned units that we exposed
[39:23.120 --> 39:28.000]  as being part of covert military operations domestically paying off mayors politicians
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.360]  in the late 90s all the brigades and units we list in the takeover released in 2000
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.560]  police state to the takeover those are the very brigades and units listed by me
[39:43.840 --> 39:46.240]  in the film that was in the army times a month ago
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.840]  and Naomi wolf on the left are like oh my gosh George Bush is getting ready for martial laws
[39:51.840 --> 39:58.000]  get ready to suspend things he's getting ready to stop the election i said no they're not this is
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.920]  all being set up like when bill clinton passed the baton to george bush and george bush went to
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.640]  congressman dan burtons committee and threatened them and said you will shut down the pardon gate
[40:06.640 --> 40:11.440]  of cocaine dealers and the chinese gate and all the corruption investigations and you're
[40:11.440 --> 40:24.080]  going to see george bush protected by barack obama and so you are going to witness
[40:29.920 --> 40:31.120]  you are going to witness
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.480]  the new world order go absolutely wild this is their jump point this is their big move
[40:38.480 --> 40:44.000]  this is a sensory plus according to Cecil Rhodes and the club of Rome and all the official government
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.360]  documents of the british empire now the anglo-american empire this is their move they are going to
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.240]  destroy the united states economically in the world's eyes they are going to merge us into a new
[40:56.240 --> 41:05.120]  monetary world government system of regulatory control they are going to have a million plus
[41:05.120 --> 41:11.280]  as strong as large the general military civilian spy corps bigger than the east german stasi per
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.640]  capita a million to begin with he talked about that in his speech last night
[41:19.280 --> 41:23.280]  and i got people in the message board in the comment sections of prisonplanet.com and info
[41:23.280 --> 41:30.960]  wars.com saying alex what's wrong what's wrong with youth corps what's wrong with it's like the
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.160]  peace corps yeah but they got guns and they spy on you what for where are the terrorists it's
[41:36.160 --> 41:42.080]  not existent it's not real it's us the american people because they know there's going to be
[41:42.080 --> 41:48.000]  resistance to taking the farms and the ranches and the homes they're they're playing classic
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.200]  class warfare telling people oh we're going to get the rich people we're going to tax people
[41:53.200 --> 41:56.640]  that make over two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year and now you really look at the tax plan
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.200]  it's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year that's not the rich that's not the elite
[42:01.840 --> 42:08.000]  especially as the currency's devalued that is the middle class being robbed and that money's not
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.240]  going to go to you the american people barack obama when mccain to try to get some campaign
[42:14.240 --> 42:17.520]  points i don't believe you would have done it he's a horrible little wicked devil as well
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.480]  just not as slick as obama so not as dangerous he said well let's actually give people money
[42:24.480 --> 42:28.880]  for their mortgages let's actually forgive part of their mortgages with the money rock obama said no
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.920]  and then that bailout didn't go even to the mortgage companies it went to the private
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.920]  inner group of banks as money to forcibly with regulators aiding them
[42:38.560 --> 42:41.920]  that government regulators aiding the private group of banks setting up world government
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.280]  to come in and force vertical integration of insurance companies banks
[42:45.280 --> 42:56.080]  and other banking institutions like credit unions and there's a massive closing of the net
[42:58.880 --> 43:03.920]  and we got three million cops up from only five hundred thousand ten years ago they're
[43:03.920 --> 43:11.040]  talking about millions more than a three million in viral cops federal in viral cops in your yard
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.400]  in your factory in your farm in your ranch and you read the premises id the animal id the big
[43:18.400 --> 43:22.320]  companies they're exempt from almost all the regulations they're only for the small farms
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.600]  and ranches that are all already shutting down and so you're going to pay more for everything
[43:27.600 --> 43:35.840]  energy food shelter oh yeah they'll be government jobs as spies as tattletales already one tenth
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.120]  of the ten percent of the college grads or homeland security related they're talking about massively
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.840]  increasing that they're going to shift the military industrial complex funding now a trillion dollars
[43:46.560 --> 43:49.120]  and around 300 billion of that is for domestic operations
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.640]  who runs the red light cameras lockheed martin going in everywhere who runs the face scanning
[43:56.640 --> 44:02.960]  cameras other defense contractors they are militarizing the united states they are taking
[44:02.960 --> 44:08.000]  over the economy and conduiting all the new jobs and funds not just into government but
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.080]  into private corporations with government contracts a reign of terror
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.320]  now again get it through your head for people out there in obama worship i understand you
[44:20.320 --> 44:25.600]  hate george bush i understand it was horrible i understand he was a tyrant i led the fight against
[44:25.600 --> 44:33.440]  him and i even said well yeah we should throw the republicans out because the democrats say they
[44:33.440 --> 44:38.240]  are going to end the war i said i don't really believe that but let's show the public let's
[44:38.240 --> 44:43.120]  give them a shot it's very dangerous because they'll try to ban guns it's very dangerous but
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.360]  let's go ahead because i said down the road it'll shatter the left right paradigm
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.840]  perhaps if people see that when they're given two years of having control of the house and
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.760]  senate that they will not stop these wars they will not stop the patriot act they will not
[44:57.760 --> 45:01.360]  reverse anything the warrantless spying the torture and they didn't
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.720]  and so they got into power and you saw what i predicted unfold wasn't hard to predict that
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.480]  so understand it's like george bush was a locomotive pulling the new world water train
[45:16.480 --> 45:22.320]  pulling us into hades pulling us deeper into tyranny and now they pulled into a side yard
[45:22.320 --> 45:31.600]  they hooked a new shiny fancy engine bush was a battered you know green and yellow engine and they
[45:31.600 --> 45:39.440]  put a big pretty bed and yellow engine on there and the people are all hailing the engine but it's
[45:39.440 --> 45:46.000]  going down the same tracks the same place and it's bigger it's faster it's better it hadn't been through
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.520]  eight years of having everything blamed on it see they blame everything on the puppet
[45:49.520 --> 45:53.120]  white bird cage liner they lay it in there under the bird it's the new world order
[45:55.120 --> 45:59.920]  all the blame for what the bird does what the new order does goes on to the bird cage liner
[45:59.920 --> 46:03.760]  and they pull it out after eight years and they stick a new one in there everybody's fooled for a
[46:03.760 --> 46:09.680]  while and then they carry the agenda down the field again like a drive and football
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.960]  but instead of bush staging the terror attacks his controllers and getting a few feet and getting
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.840]  a first down and getting a touchdown and it slowed down to where he couldn't you know he was worn out
[46:21.840 --> 46:26.240]  people knew his games they knew his plays well now they sent in a whole fresh team
[46:30.320 --> 46:35.200]  now they've sent in the super quarterback barack obama and he plays for the new world order he's
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.840]  on the new order team he said on every issue he's for it every issue he's for what the new
[46:39.840 --> 46:47.360]  world order bankers want every issue and he says i know you love me and even tells the
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.480]  mainline socialist we're going to cut the teacher's pay yay you're not going to get any help
[46:52.480 --> 46:56.400]  yay which is bad enough but see they don't need the welfare anymore they've got control of the
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.440]  government they've taken the money and given it to the corporations they've built up their
[46:59.440 --> 47:03.840]  war chest they're just openly looting trillions right in front of you now and so hey we're going
[47:03.840 --> 47:08.560]  to cut your welfare we're going to cut your teacher's pay when you give me to play him saying it
[47:08.560 --> 47:12.800]  i talk about people email me saying i'm a liar we're going to uh
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.800]  tax you to pay the corporations a bunch of money but you're going to get nothing again i'm against
[47:18.800 --> 47:22.240]  socialism because it gives the globalist control they've always used it but only in the earlier
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.640]  stages getting us domesticated we're going to have socialism why not literally rain a hundred
[47:26.640 --> 47:30.720]  dollar bills out of helicopters like ben Bernanke said but on the american people they're going to
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.000]  kill the currency might as well while it still has some value get the economy going with it
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.720]  i mean it's bad but it's not as bad as transferring it all offshore while the banks cut off all the
[47:40.720 --> 47:45.520]  liquidity to main street the general public and other institutions that aren't part of the elite
[47:45.520 --> 47:53.040]  inner group so they can consolidate it all this is cold-blooded military economic precision domination
[47:55.600 --> 48:05.440]  here's another parallel or parable another analogy it's like Rome the corrupt roman imperial
[48:05.440 --> 48:11.600]  system enslaving the people taxing and regulating and arresting and torturing them and one Caesar
[48:11.600 --> 48:15.840]  and then they would do this routinely they would overthrow a Caesar or banish him or kill him because
[48:15.840 --> 48:19.680]  they knew he was unpopular they would blame it on him and the public for a few years would buy it
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.920]  and accept the exact same policies and they put a new Caesar in and the Caesar really didn't run
[48:25.920 --> 48:29.920]  anything he was controlled by his inner court and a group of senators that's the same thing again here
[48:29.920 --> 48:36.400]  and so all the work we did exposing the new world order all the work we did exposing government
[48:36.400 --> 48:40.720]  sponsored terrorism all the work we did exposing torture is wrong and wars is wrong and killing
[48:40.720 --> 48:47.760]  Iraqis is wrong a lot of that's going to be reversed now and the new world order is going
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.480]  to be able to start new wars kill more people just like the left love bill clinton and the right
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.480]  loved it too bombing and attacking Serbia they just like the image of killing people they like
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.720]  the image of power these weak-minded people associate their personal destiny and power
[49:00.720 --> 49:03.200]  with the elite the very elite that's destroying us
[49:08.320 --> 49:11.680]  and so when i talk about barack obama and people like myself arrested they're openly
[49:11.680 --> 49:15.680]  talking about shutting down talk radio restricting free speech shutting down restricting the web
[49:15.680 --> 49:20.000]  europe's doing it it's happening everywhere it's unfolding right now they're they're they're coming
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.880]  in with uh... limited websites you can visit through comcast and time warner it's all happening
[49:24.880 --> 49:30.320]  right now and they've geared up the secret police they're gearing up the military
[49:31.440 --> 49:36.560]  democrats tend to go after their opposition more set people up audit them go after them
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.560]  i'm telling you folks we're going into the real danger zone here now
[49:45.520 --> 49:49.680]  and so to see the public fool again i'm not saying i wish
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.120]  john mccain would have gotten elected i'm saying they're calling him a messianic leader to set up
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.800]  their new world order he works for the bad guys we need to shatter the left-right paradigm understand
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.360]  they control both parties until we do that we're just beating our heads up against the wall
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.160]  i feel so sorry for all the people being caught the day unlike any other in the long
[50:10.160 --> 50:16.240]  course of american history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemies struck america on
[50:16.240 --> 50:22.320]  september 11th but who is the enemy bin laden this is his ammo we have to look to the middle east
[50:22.320 --> 50:27.200]  we have to look to his home of bin laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close
[50:27.200 --> 50:32.000]  look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the united states some us
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.280]  investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the
[50:37.280 --> 50:43.920]  us i'm aware that uh... some israeli citizens have been detained in laden's connections to the cia
[50:43.920 --> 50:48.960]  the hijackers ties to the fb i the saudi arabian connection the israeli intelligence network

[53:27.120 --> 53:34.320]  to bring in the trial lateral world currency so many things i got webster tarply popping in
[53:34.320 --> 53:39.600]  the next hour and i've got to go in the last hour and be in studio for tv for our press tv
[53:39.600 --> 53:44.400]  world vibe and i think i'm gonna ask tarply if you can do it you'll just want to sit in and do
[53:44.400 --> 53:50.480]  the fourth hour today if he agrees to that if he can he's just gonna pop in briefly in the next
[53:50.480 --> 53:54.400]  hour because there's no point in having him on twice and then he can come on and take your phone
[53:54.400 --> 53:59.360]  calls uh as soon as tarply leaves us regardless i do want to take a lot of your phone calls today
[53:59.360 --> 54:03.440]  so you can chime in on what's happened specifically with the election and the economy
[54:03.440 --> 54:07.760]  and all the mainstream newspapers announcing a new world order run by the banks i mean that
[54:07.760 --> 54:13.600]  yeah that's change that's going out of the fire into hell itself out of the frying pan into hades
[54:16.640 --> 54:20.960]  it's just staggering to see them saying he's the messianic world leader of the world president
[54:23.920 --> 54:28.960]  it's just unbelievable that he admits he used cocaine but you watch the drug war is just going
[54:28.960 --> 54:35.360]  to expand and you know at the end of the day that's who the right wing you know that's who
[54:35.360 --> 54:38.240]  the funny right wing are that they didn't care what george bush did it was about
[54:38.240 --> 54:42.480]  their party winning and their little puppet being in there so they supported gun control and open
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.880]  borders and quadruple in the size of the federal government and all of this and now it's the same
[54:48.880 --> 54:54.640]  with obama the democrats in mass you know it was about hating george bush it wasn't about caring
[54:54.640 --> 55:00.320]  about iraqi kids or torture it's just about feeling like they're winners oh we won our guy got in
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.000]  hey they stole the election twice for bush before that carry his cousin and a skull and bones mate
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.520]  take a fall on top of it that election was currently stolen you don't think with obama
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.520]  went in by six seven points you don't think they couldn't have stolen it again no they needed a new
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.920]  frontman and i have no doubt the popular vote people didn't really vote for him i i'm saying i
[55:21.920 --> 55:27.040]  believe he was really elected they didn't have to steal it but they were stealing senate races
[55:27.040 --> 55:34.160]  house races they were stealing county races city races those fraud machines were there
[55:36.640 --> 55:39.760]  we have bev Harris coming on tomorrow i could have her on today but let's want to cover this
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.280]  today we're going to get into all the fraud and now the left saying oh i guess the machines really
[55:43.280 --> 55:49.200]  do work i guess i guess it's all right now see how perfect barack obama is for them
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.640]  we're all going to be hurt very badly by this a very tiny group of global
[55:54.640 --> 56:00.000]  elitist a few thousand of them they're going to be empowered by it and barack obama is going
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.520]  to turn a hellish police state loose on us you're not going to hear him say stop taser and people
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.160]  to death you're not going to hear him talk about how they have laws tailored to put black men in
[56:10.160 --> 56:15.360]  prison you're not going to hear any of that you're going to hear him push planned parenthood and
[56:15.360 --> 56:20.080]  exterminating black people and white people and brown people he's a big pusher of that
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.960]  and so now the debate's over get it straight i was never for john mccain i said i stayed out of it
[56:26.960 --> 56:34.640]  i said there were both puppets and both evil and there's no doubt that frankly people voting
[56:34.640 --> 56:42.640]  for chuck balvin people voting for Ralph nader and people voting for bob bar definitely with
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.080]  the bob bar and then the libertarians and the constitutional party with um
[56:49.520 --> 56:55.680]  i mean they got a good percentage of the vote what is it 10 percent or so that was
[56:56.640 --> 57:01.120]  what would have pushed mccain over the edge and he would have won and then you'd have had this
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.680]  corpse this this lame duck who couldn't have gotten anything done
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.960]  but see the system needs your acquiescence they need your support they need you to be
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.120]  suckered in that's why he's saying we need your help america we need you to help build this new
[57:15.120 --> 57:22.880]  world order we need you i'll never lie to you all he does is lie i'll never betray you i need you
[57:22.880 --> 57:28.960]  to help me i need you to get behind what we're doing we need you to acquiesce that's what the
[57:28.960 --> 57:36.000]  system said they said barack obama can bring the suckers back to the table and he does have
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.160]  grassroots fashion support they were out the streets just eyes lit up like they were on some drug last
[57:42.160 --> 57:54.800]  night just no celebrating oh oh change change change thank you for listening to gcn visit gcn

[58:56.000 --> 59:13.280]  martial law waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcn radio networks big brother
[59:13.920 --> 59:22.400]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[59:22.400 --> 59:37.680]  on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[59:42.560 --> 59:49.360]  i think he's the most credible resistor against the obama zombies and that's why we've been having
[59:49.360 --> 59:56.160]  him on quite a bit i um you know i give people the benefit of the doubt all of these uh controlled
[59:57.120 --> 1:00:00.880]  neo libs out there who have no idea what they're in store for that they think they're robbing in
[1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:04.960]  the middle class and the carbon taxes quote going to get the rich people and that's anybody that's
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:12.400]  got a dollar more than them they have no idea that this is neofutilism this is serf and they're
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:20.640]  going to be hurt very very bad um you know i'm on record here i'm on record here saying john
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:26.480]  mccain's evil you know i can't vote for either one of them and i didn't get suckered but i said
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:31.680]  well obama says he'll end the war obama says he'll do this and that obama says he'll end
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:36.560]  the wiretapping of the american people without warrants he reversed all that and now to see
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:42.160]  the media literally calling him world president the hope he will change the world i've never
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:46.880]  seen this in u.s politics i've never i mean they're already saying he's greater than jack kennedy and
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:53.040]  martin luther king out of the gates and he's now calling for a new world order run by the private
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:58.960]  banks global carbon taxes global regulation it's all being announced so we're gonna have tarply
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:09.520]  on with us for 20 minutes and then i've got to leave i've got to leave uh coming up in the uh
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:14.960]  fourth hour today we have record audience by the way just on the internet alone so tarply is
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:21.200]  going to host the show in the last hour so i'm not going to have him on then for for long in this
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:26.320]  hour but but but i want his basic boil down now and now the battle plan to stop what's happening
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:31.440]  because the whole agenda the neocons the new order they now have their new pony that the
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:40.240]  fresh pony the fresh engine but the train is going to be pulled down the same tracks uh and and this
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:45.520]  is worse than i thought i mean i've never seen warship as a world leader at warship as the messiah
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:52.880]  and um so websher tarply we're about to break but uh his lordship uh is now our new furor
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:02:01.200]  and uh where do we go from here websher i think we need to create what amounts to a united front
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:08.080]  against fascism we'll have to find a suitable name for it but a a resistance front of anti-fascist
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:15.200]  principled people from left right center and any coloration uh that there will be no honeymoon
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:22.560]  for the fascist obama that we don't want the carbon uh cap and trade system we don't want
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:29.840]  fascist censorship of radio and other mass communications media we don't want any more
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:38.240]  bailouts we don't want confrontation with russia china sudan and pakistan uh we don't want any
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:42.800]  more free trade sellouts with latin america or any other part of the world in other words what we've
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:50.800]  got to do is to get a catalog of the probably half a dozen main thrusts of an obama administration
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:56.000]  we're going to go into an attempt by the obama zoids to have a fascist hundred days in other
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:02.080]  words i would call it a hundred days in reverse it will be the implementation of fascist political
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:08.640]  reforms to go with the fascist corporate state that the bailout has already largely implemented
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:15.040]  so i think we've got to we've got to gear up uh no honeymoon uh people say they hear america
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:20.480]  singing if they hear america singing it's the horse vessel song and jovi netsa that they
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:27.200]  they hear those of the uh various fascist anthems left over from the 1920s and 30s uh i don't believe
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.160]  that most people realize the enormity of what's gone on so we've got to conduct a very vigorous
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:38.720]  emergency campaign of mass political education and uh encourage people they're not alone this is
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:44.800]  not a landslide this is anything but a mandate for fascist transformation it's a it's really a
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:52.480]  very close election well the good news is the left is going to find out very soon that this is the
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:57.600]  man of the new world order and i want to talk about secky schumer when we get back i've seen him on
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:04.560]  tv seething with power seething with evil they are getting ready to rampage i agree with tarpoli
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:10.400]  hell is about to be released a little bit right back hello friends this is alex jones i've told
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:14.880]  you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:19.680]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:23.920]  you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen to take care of
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:29.040]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:33.360]  bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:39.280]  telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:44.400]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:49.840]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:55.360]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:05:00.640]  it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there
[1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:05.600]  may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:10.160]  stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay
[1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:15.280]  in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:20.080]  and on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:25.200]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:29.120]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:33.680]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:38.320]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:43.280]  but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from ecoli

[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:31.280]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network the anglo-american power elite are in
[1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:37.760]  control in power because they are absolutely ruthless you are seeing economic warfare
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.160]  none of the money is being given to the economy to get going they've said they've
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:49.040]  shut the money off to implode it you're seeing 500 million and bigger bonuses out of the money
[1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:54.560]  at goldman sacks to their execs 500 million apiece in some cases tens of billions per company
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:01.040]  i saw chuckie schumer on fox news and seeing in last night and then again this morning and when
[1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:06.960]  he was talking about shutting down talk radio and other things and he was seething and just just
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:11.520]  i've never seen him so emboldened and i was watching others uh the democrats are not nice
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:16.720]  people folks they want your guns they want the middle class uh you know we clutch our guns we
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:21.360]  clutch our bibles they are coming and they're going to use the money they squeeze out the
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:27.280]  middle class to regulate control your life over all the poor mainline socialist i don't like
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:31.600]  socialism but let me tell you something it's a lot better than this this ain't socialism jack
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:37.600]  okay when they take five trillion that's what ron paul said at the start of the show today
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:44.080]  it's five trillion now just like woomburg reported and they suck that into their gullets and give
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:50.000]  none of it to the people that in socialism now socialism is bad overall because it makes it
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:54.240]  domesticate people it it i'm not against the government with your base seed money to get
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:59.280]  things going i know tarpley is along those lines and he's got his own political nomenclature
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:04.960]  and and and he's outside the left-right paradigm this is sophisticated folks we're playing chess
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:12.400]  the public isn't even playing chess uh checkers here now webster i've been watching their body
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:18.160]  language and i've studied history just like you've done i have never seen worship like this
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:23.760]  and i'm going to be honest with people i have promised that i will not evacuate the country
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:28.080]  unless they shut all the radio off there's no point of even being on the air but let me tell
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:31.680]  you during the first hundred days and i agree with webster they're going to go absolutely ape
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:36.800]  i'm going to let you know on air if i evacuate my family i am literally
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:42.960]  had a list of countries i'm looking at it now the passports are in order and folks i
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:46.800]  don't i'm not like some hollywood person or some leftist who left when george bush got in
[1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:52.000]  and i said he was going to blow those towers up folks we predict when they're going to blow
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.640]  towers up we know what they're going to announce with the banking system we're right about everything
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:02.160]  we should have people just absolutely hanging on our every word we have the scholars the research
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:08.160]  on terribly i'm just freaking out my god i have total dread it's worse than i thought i should
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:13.200]  have gotten behind this earlier to fight this i probably but i didn't want to be in the left
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  right paradigm i didn't want to be suckered into all that because that's key to shatter that
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:21.680]  but now you know maybe it's better that it'll all get bad and come down on us now or maybe
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:25.760]  would have been better we'd have told the third parties vote for mccain to stop this because
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.200]  because god they've got the zombies now and and and this is it terribly i know it now you're right
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:36.240]  they're going for broke webster tarpley well let's uh let's also remember that there are still
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:41.760]  important uh institutional factors of resistance which of course obama will try to uh to destroy
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:48.240]  47 to 48 percent of the american people are against this and maybe if you see complete
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:54.560]  vote totals when you add up everything the anti-obama vote approaches 50 percent it's
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:59.040]  somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent no matter how we cut it we've also got to figure
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:04.400]  that the acorn induced and related vote fraud intelligence community vote fraud because it
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:09.600]  was clear that that was going to be in favor of obama this time that this considerable vote
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:16.080]  fraud also skews the figures so this is once again a 50-50 country obama's attempt to install
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:23.040]  pan oligarchy or uh sort of an oligarchical consensus this has obviously been a failure
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:28.560]  notice there's very little discussion about what's the mandate uh i don't see any mandate obama
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:34.720]  ran on nothing except i'm the savior vote for me that is not a mandate for any policy
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:38.000]  and most of the policies that obama is now going to pull out of his hat
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.680]  are the ones that he's talked about least because they're the oppressive ones the
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:47.280]  onerous ones the austerity the sacrifice um if you happen to be watching some of these
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:53.840]  networks with doris kerns goodwin a very meretricious professor of history from harvard says yes
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:59.360]  now shared sacrifice has to be the watchword of our entire government right you've got
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:04.720]  various oil companies going on saying the the great task of the future is to use less
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.280]  let's have a malfeasy and zero growth i mean this is it and and and the key is he keeps talking
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.240]  about unity unity unity because they know what they're going to do is they know what they're
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:21.200]  going to do is incredibly unpopular so he's telling everybody hey the change is we're
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:27.440]  going to screw you real bad you're not going to like what i do but we love you so get ready to
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:32.800]  sacrifice and unify and and and basically we're coming after you if you're not for us i mean
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:37.440]  they are and that's what biden has said get ready for unpopular stuff my god tarpley
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:43.040]  yes but on the other hand uh there are significant factors of resistance and we've got to basically
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.000]  regroup around those right you got almost half the country have looked at this and said no thanks
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.960]  no bomber uh you've got a significant number of uh republicans who have been reelected the
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:12:01.520]  the attempt to get the filibuster proof majority in the senate as far as i can see i haven't looked
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.480]  too much this morning but it looks like that has fallen short and you've got to realize that the
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:13.040]  democratic party always needs more than 60 because you've got the various um conservative
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:19.120]  democrats the sort of blue dog or bold weevil type democrat in there who is unlikely to go with it
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:25.120]  this is this is not hitler really this is musulini musulini when he came to power with
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:30.800]  the march on roland october of 1922 had to deal with a coalition government now this is not
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:36.240]  not a coalition in name it's a democratic one party state but if we look inside the democratic
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:41.120]  party you'll see that there are people like the the marci captors the new deal democrats and then
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:47.360]  these other blue dog or bold weevil types there's going to be significant tension between obama
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:53.520]  and the congress even though it's all democrats the founders built this in if you go back to
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.880]  carter you'll see that carter had a very large majority in both houses of congress and still
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:04.160]  his relations with them were very very bad he got into these conflicts with tip o'neill now
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.640]  right now the leadership is not there the leadership was policy and read and there is
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:14.000]  rotten as can be but there will be the possibility of peeling off some democratic votes and then
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  maybe together with those right wing republicans you can make an anti-obama blocking position
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:25.200]  that will be able to stop certain things for going through we've got to hold out for two years
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:31.680]  you've got to figure that within about two years uh... the the entire rage and resentment for the
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:37.440]  economic crisis will be that will be directed against the democrats in other words they will
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:43.440]  be holding the bag for the worst economic depression in human history push will be out the door
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:49.040]  republicans will be gone and the democrats will be sitting there imposing austerity and that's
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:55.680]  right i don't want the indeed the the neocons are evacuating to do but do by switzerland uh...
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.560]  england uh... perigway now webster i'm gonna make this announcement now webster is going to host

[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:48.720]  poor well-meaning zombies who see things in a one-dimensional and even two-dimensional
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:53.840]  way they don't understand that bush and all these guys are puppets they think oh well
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:58.800]  he's black you know he's a democrat they haven't looked at the policies tell people what the
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:03.280]  first hundred days is going to be like i mean it's clear the new world order is making its move
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.560]  that's why they're trying to give him total support calling him the the literally the one
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:15.840]  they're calling him the one like the matrix the the uh... messianic moses uh... jesus the messiah
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:22.480]  mainstream news saying world president world leader uh... i mean they're not doing that for him
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:24.400]  for no reason
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.000]  no course it's it's going to be an attempt to do some some pretty thorough uh...
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.960]  institutional reform and we want to block that
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:35.840]  uh... it will be things like this if you look at muesli the first thing muesli wanted to do
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:40.320]  was to change the laws that govern the elections he wanted to change the way
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:44.320]  the parliament was elected and stuff like this i would say with obama
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:50.400]  it's going to be this question of suppressing uh... voices of dissent suppressing various forms
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:53.280]  of talk radio internet radio
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:56.320]  uh... trying to muzzle and censor
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:15:59.840]  the political opposition they're saying they're going to do it
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:02.320]  and i've got democrats i mean i think we're very old
[1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:05.040]  never been a democrat williams all the way out today when he said
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:07.920]  i'm for the fairness doctrine
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:11.920]  yeah i think that's the big the night of the long lives will be coming for a lot of
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:13.400]  people who think that that
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:15.880]  that obama is for them they're gonna find that that
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:18.520]  that he's not obama will be unnecessarily
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:21.960]  turn on his base attack his base betray his own
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:25.320]  okay so let's look at what they're going to do it will be some version of the
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:28.520]  fairness doctrine and hate speech to muzzle dissent
[1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:32.040]  they will try to have this fascist cap and trade system
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:34.960]  built on the hoax of global warming
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:37.240]  uh... with the nazis you remember the
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:39.640]  the doctrine was uh... blood that
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:43.840]  right that the description of arian blood you have to see that you were
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:45.080]  you were a subversive
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:46.440]  what sort
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:50.080]  in the case of these people today that if you don't believe in global warming
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:52.800]  you're a subversive in the green core will come to you
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:53.920]  that was the other thing
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:58.360]  musulini created the voluntary militia for national security
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:02.640]  voluntary militia for national security it sounds exactly like obama's
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.520]  homeland security
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:08.760]  uh... core or his green core obama has four or five
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:10.960]  different volunteer organizations
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:13.520]  that he will attempt to institutionalize
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:17.400]  uh... as a kind of a para governmental militia
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:20.880]  that will allow him then to deal with dissent and try to crush people i'm
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:23.720]  going to tell him right now stay away from my family
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:25.520]  you scum you nazi
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:27.720]  blood-sucking maggots
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:31.560]  and i mean i've got them on my website right now webster saying so what yeah
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:33.360]  we're going to be armed cores
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:35.560]  a million others to defend against terrorist
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:39.000]  and those terrorist arrest folks anybody that i i can't believe this is
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.720]  happening webster
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:44.680]  yeah it's uh... it's unfortunate i mean you know bush and cheney did a great
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.760]  deal of damage and then this in some ways is the is the final culmination of
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:49.560]  the
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:52.440]  the damage right that they've opened the door to this anyway

[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:39.400]  puppet
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:42.200]  webster continuing with their first hundred days they've said they're coming
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:43.600]  after free speech
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.040]  they're setting up all these brigades of idiot youth
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.800]  going to admit coming classic fascism
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:54.320]  and he said you'll give all the money everything to the foreign banks nothing
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:55.640]  for the people
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:59.520]  i mean it's just the opposite of what you think of a classic democrat bang
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:02.720]  and uh... and and and what's this big crisis
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:06.240]  a lot of experts are saying dollar devaluation in this new britain woods
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:07.800]  world banking system
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:09.920]  on the twenty-first and twenty-second
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:12.800]  uh... they're saying he's into all these unpopular things
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:14.680]  do you think stage terror
[1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:16.320]  is in the mix
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:20.760]  yes well that's implicit in the biden remarks in Seattle on october nineteenth
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:24.000]  when when we're told that we're going to have a an international confrontation
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.600]  most probably with russia
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:28.040]  or possibly involving the middle east
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:31.480]  it's going to be generated and the righteousness of the u.s. position will not
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:33.080]  be immediately obvious
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:37.000]  i take it to mean other one of two things one is that they want to return
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.160]  using the credibility of the new messiah here
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:44.320]  return to the path of full flag that path had been barred to them
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:48.280]  by the fact that bush and cheney was so hated and so discredited
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.960]  that nobody would believe anything they said and indeed the
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:55.760]  the the the lemmings uh... at the at the new world that the atlantic monthly
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:58.120]  we're complaining about that they said look you know we want to have an
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:00.240]  imperialism we've got to have full flag
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:02.040]  but we can't do that anymore
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:05.840]  because that nobody will believe bush now they probably think they can
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:08.800]  go back to that i know some of them openly right
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:11.080]  i mean there's been a whole bunch of other worlds where they say we love big
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:13.080]  terror attacks we wish we could have more
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:16.920]  but the public doesn't buy it i mean these murders are right on the open
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:20.400]  right the other thing of course is they have these puppet states right you've
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:21.520]  still got uh...
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:24.280]  package really seems to have hung on in georgia
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.240]  you've got this
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.120]  despicable you shanko a native agent an i m f agent
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:30.880]  in kiavin ukraine
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:34.160]  and they'd like to get something going against russia you'll notice
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.640]  the one clear voice in the world that had no praise for the new messiah
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:43.160]  was russian president yet yet if we have to regard such people as allies
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:44.680]  at least in terms of uh...
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:47.520]  power combinations because he got up there and said listen
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  if you insist on putting those missiles into poland
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:52.080]  we will have a
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:54.920]  response for them in the form of a new missile of our own
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:24:58.640]  which you will not be able to match will be specific and we're not here to
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:00.840]  all the systems are corrupt but you're right
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:04.520]  the only country in the world not even china
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:06.480]  that has come out
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:07.680]  on the record
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:10.800]  and said we don't want a new world order
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:14.520]  with your banks running everything we're against this new
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:16.800]  monetary system we want one
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:20.000]  uh... that is uh... free market of currencies
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.360]  we don't want to power grab we don't want your new world order
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:27.320]  uh... i mean russia seems to really be understanding what's happening
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.480]  as you didn't well the secretary of the navy under lincoln said in eighteen
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:32.680]  sixty three
[1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:34.800]  thank god for the russians
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:38.720]  uh... and that is a center of uh... of resistance in the world other countries
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:39.720]  i think will
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:42.480]  will tend to gravitate to them as the uh...
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:44.280]  the bankruptcy of obama
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:47.520]  becomes evident obviously right now you've got the full flush
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.880]  of hysteria but the blooms will go up the road we've got to hold on for two
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:52.640]  years
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:55.360]  we've got a hold on during the hundred days
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:57.520]  uh... if you look back at carter
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  carter peak at the end of the hundred days and then began inexorable decline
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:05.560]  and let me be specific let me be specific during the hundred days they're
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:09.560]  going to be bring us into open depression blaming it on bush still
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:11.760]  which again they all are the same people
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:15.080]  and then saying you've got to do everything we say to turn this around
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:18.520]  and most of it will have nothing even do with the economy it'll just be do this
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:19.200]  do this
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:22.640]  just like the terrorism we saw a month ago of past this
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:24.040]  we're gonna have a depression
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.360]  but it'll be it'll be cap and trade so we want to say no to the fairness doctrine
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:30.040]  no to cap and trade
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:34.840]  no to these fascist militias and fascist volunteer organizations
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:37.760]  we don't want any extension of free trade
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:40.640]  uh... we don't want that extended any more countries in latin america we've
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.320]  had quite enough of that
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:43.200]  and
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:48.080]  we don't want confrontation with russia china sudan and
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:49.200]  pakistan
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:53.440]  obama wants to escalate afghanistan that war is lost take a new look at
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:57.600]  afghanistan the situation there is more hopeless than ever you want to join the
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:00.040]  red army in bloody defeat
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:01.800]  that's the only thing you'll get out of it
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.160]  uh... biden is associated with this hysteria to attack sudan
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:09.440]  no attack on sudan or if they do that biden
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:11.000]  lead the charge put him
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.840]  in the first uh... tank
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:14.480]  and see how far it gets them
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:17.760]  uh... armies imperialist armies that go into sudan
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:22.600]  have a habit of not coming back same thing with uh... with afghanistan so
[1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:24.160]  the appropriate
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:28.560]  uh... for all of this rapidly shipped to obama and in some ways he's already
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:29.640]  been the
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:33.320]  the incumbent for the best part of the year now
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:36.560]  uh... he will be left holding the bag for all the stuff
[1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:41.720]  his regime will tend to collapse even more rapidly than carter but we've got
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:44.520]  to hang on during that critical hundred days
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:47.960]  and then hold on to the to the first two well i think they'll do is at the
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:51.120]  hundred-day mark right around and then they'll stage a terror attack and try to
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:53.400]  get another hundred days webster

[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:27.560]  approval rating for congress but see primitively all the leader of the new mail he will lead the
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:33.000]  tribe see we're primitively designed to to you know to think that this one man's running something
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:40.680]  so our whole psychological makeup our our whole anthropology gears us towards going along with
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:48.280]  it so

[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:44.920]  read history because they're more on a dangerous idea they're more on idiots okay they're more
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:54.520]  on idiots who who who were told that they're going to get some of this money they were told that
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:37:00.360]  that oh the economy is in trouble we're going to we're going to have a bailout of all this free
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:04.280]  money that the idiots are going to be paying back and that they're not going to be able to have jobs
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:07.640]  because the economy is going to implode so bad they don't understand we're being eluded and
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:13.480]  consolidated and so they think oh socialism fix the economy i want some money you're not getting
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:19.960]  jack squat you got that slaves and by the way we don't we open the phones up and then it's
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.120]  whoever we happen to answer they're always ringing we just don't answer them now and
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:29.800]  keep people on hold like we used to so it's luck of the draw uh who calls in uh patrick at one
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:35.400]  eight hundred two five nine nine two three one but but i mean they're a nation of morons that watch
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:41.320]  four or five hours of tv a day and drink poison water and eat poison food and are into believing
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.880]  that they just imagine they're powerful and in charge they just want to feel good and imagine
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:51.400]  that you know they're empowered by the president and again suckers you're going to get everything
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:57.880]  you want go ahead patrick i think it also has to do with the fact that they think that this system
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:02.360]  actually has a way of working but it comes down to the same questions well who's rationing you
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:10.760]  know who's deciding who gets what and all this but to move on uh also i'm astounded by people
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:15.960]  with disbelief in fema camps because they definitely exist and i was talking to my friend last night
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:21.640]  and he was like oh yeah but i could show you anthropologists uh with degrees talking about

[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:50.600]  bid i mean i've got scores of newscast where they admit they built camps for the american people
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:53.960]  where they admit they've got them ready for political dissidents where they're announcing
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:40:00.120]  they've activated north com and multiple brigades of army troops to quote fight the american people

[1:41:55.080 --> 1:42:00.680]  a couple points let's call made a valid point uh when uh debating uh truthful topics i find
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:05.400]  that when i'm spreading the word of freedom people almost often with the losing argument
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:11.080]  always have don't always don't have the facts and they always fall back on some you know bogus
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:15.800]  issue and and try and uh you know change the subject well they say oh the black helicopters

[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:28.840]  riot gear and in 1997 because i saw the federal documents and then by 99 they were out on the
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:33.880]  streets yeah exactly uh regarding elected officials alex uh you know the bottom line is when the
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:39.560]  elected officials of the people fail to do the bidding on behalf of the people the people must
[1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:44.200]  mobilize and our elected officials obviously as we all know have truly failed in all areas the
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.840]  people must mobilize now um you know regarding schumer uh you know you're right you know i've
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.680]  spoken with him i've met him uh as a matter of fact uh you're probably very familiar with the

[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:05.000]  susannah gracia hubs parents and many other people there's a youtube video on this topic
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:09.880]  where she's testifying in front of congress which he said is very prophetic she was telling congress
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:14.840]  that guns and the second amendment are not for hunting but for protecting the people against
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.280]  tyrannical politicians and governments and the camera looks directly a tumor so you know it's
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:25.160]  very interesting you're you're definitely on the right track about this uh he's so predatory how he

[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:06.680]  is getting rolled that's why this country is getting taken over by hardcore tyranny because they know
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:11.720]  your cowardly wheat needs scum and they know they can fool you with your propaganda and you'll take
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:21.560]  it ray in indiana you're on the air go ahead yeah uh alex i've got a couple questions for you two
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:27.640]  of them actually you keep talking about the uh system and uh what's coming down the pipe but
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:34.760]  then you talk positively about russia and i'm wondering uh why you do that because they are
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:41.080]  one of the most fascist communist systems and they still do that and then my other question is
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:47.880]  you keep talking about new world order and so on and so forth um and how do you uh i know you are
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:54.680]  a bible-believing man uh how do you define prophecy that it that it is prophesied this is how i
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:46:00.040]  define it world order this is how i define it i do not use that as a larsonist wicked way to
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:04.760]  hand over my responsibility and do nothing like 99 percent of phony christians out there
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:09.960]  and so i do the right thing i stand up to evil i stand up to corruption i stand up to the new
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:16.520]  world order i say no to it and i do you know justice be done may the heavens fall i just don't
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:21.160]  cop out and say oh it's all a foregone conclusion abortion it's all a foregone conclusion wars
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:26.120]  it's all a foregone conclusion microchips it's all a foregone conclusion and then just run around
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:31.240]  and feel good and ignore what's happening and live in la la land denial now as for russia
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:35.480]  i just said earlier it's an evil new world order country every country's run by wickedness i said
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:40.760]  this about 40 minutes ago but i said that clearly between them and the angle american establishment
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:46.120]  there is some real friction going on and they say they don't want this new world banking system
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:53.400]  they want a quote multi uh polar new world order so so so that's what i said and i was clear
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:58.200]  about that and i am against the sneak attack against russian held territories to try to start
[1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:03.400]  a new cold war because i'll order out of chaos and and and that's where i stand and i don't
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:08.840]  care people say i'm a liar and that russia snuck attack georgia i know the truth we have the facts
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:12.760]  it's even admitted by the state department now and i'll just tell the truth no matter what it is
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:19.160]  i'm not indoctrinated all this phony anti russian garbage our government put the comies in there
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:23.560]  they slaughtered 60 million good russian people the new order gave them the nuclear weapons the
[1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:29.160]  new order propped the whole thing up okay and now we're in a whole different system does that answer
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:36.760]  your question yeah except for the fact that the russians uh according to uh you know a lot of
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:44.520]  people shouldn't have been in georgia to begin with so so so you're telling me what what happened
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:51.320]  there was good i'm not saying either way but i'm glad you made it clear that you're not necessarily
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:57.880]  saying that russia is is on track and and you're not necessarily thinking about evacuating to russia
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.560]  right that's a smartass you know what you're gonna get everything you want you're gonna get your
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:08.680]  new world order no i don't want it absolutely not look you you know good and well i'm not

[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:38.840]  they seem so satisfied they seem so happy they're not worried about nothing
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:43.880]  i've got so much more to think about if you really care about what's happening and you know
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:50.920]  anything about what's going on you're freaked out right now what to leave in what to leave out
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:56.200]  the united states through georgia launched a sneak attack on salvosetia it's been held by
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:04.520]  russia for close to 300 years so the international peace agreement in 91 russians had been there
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:11.320]  ever since that they snuck attack them and and you call in and ask if i'm a ruski i mean that's
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:17.880]  so ridiculous i'm reaching out when i go on these shows on british and on french and on iranian tv
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:22.760]  i go on there and i explain this is not the american people this is the bankers out of england
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:27.960]  who've seized us this is not in our name and i talk about the free market and liberty and freedom
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:32.360]  that's my message it's always the same it's from the heart it's from my soul
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:39.960]  and it isn't about me all day long i'm talking about the media saying we've got this messianic
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:47.480]  leader barack obama and and and i mean you know people subconsciously don't want to hear about
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:53.240]  the responsibility i'm trying to get them to accept here on air to fight back to speak out
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:56.760]  and so you can put on me whatever you want
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:54:02.520]  i had a lot of tension earlier i feel better after i blew up though
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:12.040]  oh will in colorado you're on the air go ahead can i call alex uh it's my second time on the air
[1:54:12.040 --> 1:54:18.440]  with you you know i i'm here in colorado um you know i'm in boulder and it's uh it's pretty much
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:23.080]  a prototype for the kind of things that you you talk about it's uh you know we got our
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:28.840]  viral cops out here we got uh you know last night the streets were as mob with all types of people
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:33.640]  getting drunk and feeling cool about obama and it's pretty depressing it's a tough day for the
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:39.480]  info warriors today but i just want to you know i guess call it and say that i'm not a christian
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:42.920]  but i gotta believe that there's some angels watching over us or something because something's
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:48.840]  gotta give here it's let me say this for the people that just tuned in we're not sad that
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:55.080]  mccain lost we're sad that people were suckered by obama into the left right paradigm and that
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:59.560]  they are openly announcing world government where we will pay our taxes to the bankers
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:03.960]  ron paul was on the start of the show i mean i mean this is horrible it's all happening
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:09.080]  these people are eugenicists they're poisoning our water and i got people calling up saying

[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:19.640]  not easy easy for you to handle but i do appreciate the fact that it did clear up a little bit of my
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:25.000]  questions about um the article on info wars about medvedad uh supporting new world order
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:30.680]  because it seemed a little contradictory to uh some of webster's points earlier but i just uh
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:35.400]  overall i like they all say they want a new world order they argue about how they want it set up
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:39.560]  i just said they're a separate branch of it i said that last out i said that this hour
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:47.240]  no i i got it it's it's crystal clear um i i appreciate that uh you know that question

[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:09.000]  and i blew up earlier it it it's just that i had to know the truth to know how evil

[1:59:13.640 --> 1:59:18.360]  telling me oh you just don't like black people and you just don't like democrats it's not about

[1:59:36.600 --> 1:59:44.200]  every facet of your life mike in california on the air how you doing alex i'm all right
[1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:48.680]  all right friend yeah we spoke yesterday actually got cut off so i couldn't continue to ask you
[1:59:48.680 --> 1:59:53.160]  some more questions but um i guess the most important question i have is what are the
[1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:57.960]  options we uh do you have in place just in case they shut you down i remember you were talking
[1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:02.440]  about uh setting up some other things maybe a phone thing or some kind of uh i don't know maybe some
[2:00:03.160 --> 2:00:07.320]  radio i don't know what do you have in place we put in a system where people can call in
[2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:12.840]  five one two six four six five thousand and that's limited to a hundred and eighty eight lines or
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:22.840]  something but that's just a one two six four six six four six five thousand five thousand and uh i am um
[2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:26.280]  i mean i mean they're openly announcing ways they're going to shut down the free internet
[2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:31.000]  ways to shut down mainline talk radio but they'll keep limbaugh and stuff on i mean they're just
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:37.400]  they're just coming for everything man hmm my next question and i know it's not me you know
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:43.080]  you're focusing on everyone but since i represent or come from you know the hood or south central
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:49.480]  represent the black community why in european do do black folks consistently wrote democratic despite
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:54.120]  the fact that nothing has changed for them in their environment well things have changed we've
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:01:00.600]  gone from 90 percent legitimacy in the black community to 92 percent illegitimacy uh what uh
[2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:07.160]  one in three black males is in prison uh they've sent an evil corporate culture they openly broke
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:11.480]  up uh with the eugenics they've done it to everybody now but they tested it on the blacks
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:15.480]  and uh their poverty pimps and they're there to control them and i'm not even saying black
[2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:21.960]  should have voted for john mccain my whole thing is it's the policies barack obama is slick and
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:28.040]  is better spoken and and looks different so he's going to be able to carry the ball for the same
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:33.400]  people george bush was carrying the ball for just a lot worse and uh you know i don't blame black
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.600]  folks want the black president seeing that as a milestone what's going to be sad is when they're
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:41.800]  done with the rock obama they're going to destroy him too and it's going to be very you know they're
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:47.720]  going to try to embarrass blacks with that i mean it's just disgusting i definitely agree um but i
[2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:51.720]  could you kind of addressed it in that last evening because i was going to ask you does obama
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:57.480]  realize that he won't be able to keep the promises or does he believe in what he said no no no he's
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:01.320]  already saying it's going to hurt there's going to be austerity there's going to be sacrificed
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:05.960]  i'm going to do things you don't like because he's going to have wars and everything else
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.120]  because because he's a puppet they wouldn't let him in there but it's not just it's not that
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:22.680]  they're just running things it's that he is for it all and how long how long would it take for
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:29.000]  people in general to realize that this man didn't keep his promise well they're going to lot we'll
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.680]  see a lot of people are wedded to him now just like republicans wouldn't wake up to george bush
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:37.880]  being evil how was open borders and tripling the size of government and gun control conservative
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:43.640]  they said well we you know we bet on bush we voted for him he's our man you're an evil liberal alex
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:47.880]  you just don't like conservatives i even got all these emails you don't like white people
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:53.560]  because you're not for george bush you know they're racist whites and i was like no no no he's a
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:57.800]  puppet he's a puppet well now it's the same thing with barack obama it's just now they're saying i'm
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:03.800]  a fascist you understand um can i hang on yeah just real quick we'll come back to you let me
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:10.840]  finish up then chris don william erin and others uh i'm very tired folks i'm very upset i'm sorry
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:19.720]  about that blew up earlier hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:24.040]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:28.360]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in the bread line if you have your own
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:33.080]  bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for fema to take care of your family in any
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:37.640]  emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:42.120]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:46.600]  and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:51.880]  this money now owns the america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:57.160]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[2:03:57.160 --> 2:04:02.360]  many americans reach in pre-nancy germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:08.040]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:13.000]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.400]  to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:22.360]  of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:26.680]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[2:04:26.680 --> 2:04:31.960]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:36.200]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply
[2:04:36.200 --> 2:04:41.080]  of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:45.480]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:50.360]  in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:55.240]  safe from ecoli salmonella genetic alteration or chinese imports and they do it at almost half

[2:05:02.520 --> 2:05:07.880]  visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the final list of high quality freeze dried and dehydrated foods
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:15.080]  they have to offer watch the free videos look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:22.360]  again 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com take action today the first step is getting
[2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:29.960]  storable food ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:39.000]  again what i'm bummed out about is the fact that obama went back on all his promises he says get
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:45.480]  ready basically be sucked dry they're gonna attack the middle class the people that give everybody
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:52.520]  their jobs hand all that money over to the trillionaire bankers and people could say well
[2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:57.400]  there's a you know good message here we got 80 some percent turnout uh the public said no to all
[2:05:57.400 --> 2:06:02.440]  the bush policies that's right it is positive in a way but but then it's not because they got
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:08.680]  suckered um but yes the good news is down the road the democrats when the wars are continuing
[2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:12.760]  and everything's happening they're finally gonna get it i mean the left-right paradigm has been
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:17.400]  breaking down more and more this is kind of a last gasp of it but that's why they're throwing
[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:21.880]  everything behind obama and i mean anytime the media that's owned by the bomb makers and the
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:27.880]  bankers starts uh in the military industrial complex starts calling somebody the one and
[2:06:27.880 --> 2:06:31.800]  starts calling him the leader and the world president that's because he's gonna lead us
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:36.200]  right into the death of the dollar they're talking about that in three months they're
[2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:41.480]  announcing it see there's no more copouts anymore folks there's so many world leaders
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:46.040]  calling for a new world order and so many big bankers saying the banks are gonna run everything
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:51.480]  and be the world government as they always said they would there's no more copping out
[2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:56.520]  meanwhile everybody's giggling and smirking and laughing and acting like jesus just landed
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:03.000]  oh it's just amazing i want to get to don william erin and others
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:09.480]  we got some economic news coming up here in a minute um but uh who was i just talking to

[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:23.640]  have so many questions oh no you're a great caller everybody's great we should go ahead
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:28.840]  all right now being that okay you got america you got britain and france they're kind of allies
[2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:35.160]  and i guess in this whole thing um in order for them to interject this um this new financial
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:42.120]  system wouldn't they have to get or eliminate uh i guess russia and china's influence our power
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:48.440]  and uh i'll try to ask one more question after that go ahead man that's a super complex question
[2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:53.640]  i should have passed it i mean they're not trying to eliminate any though they're they're
[2:07:53.640 --> 2:07:59.720]  expanding all government's power uh and it it all governments want more power more control so
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:04.920]  they're all getting more and more evil that's the nature of government uh but yes the anglo-american
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:11.160]  establishment is going to sacrifice the united states economically in our name on the altar
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:16.120]  of a larger world government so we're about to see the decline of the united states by design
[2:08:16.120 --> 2:08:20.680]  with the globalist running it obama's saying that uh and all the other leaders are saying it
[2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:24.920]  man into the larger official world government which russia and china will be part of
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:33.080]  hmm all right my last question is uh what is the difference between you know an obama type
[2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:37.400]  socialism or the type of socialism that he represents on the left on the left in the
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:43.240]  in the kind of socialism that mckay and attic attic advocated for on the right really if you
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:47.240]  looked at the real policies there was almost no difference just different different ways
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:52.600]  that they put it different rhetoric uh just like ron paul said at the start of the show
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:55.000]  that'll re-ear at the end of the show today on the internet you'll be able to hear ron paul
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.440]  about the start of the show bombshell interview uh he broke it all down and said that mccain was
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.480]  just a backup guy that the system had this stage that they'd been grooming obama for a long time
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:10.360]  this stuff is thought out by the social engineers and the think tanks openly and then the presidents
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:15.240]  just carry it out that's what i'm saying and i feel so sorry for black folks that think because
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:18.680]  i mean i don't blame black folks if i was you know especially if i was black i would
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:22.760]  you know want to think oh my gosh you know we're real equality but then i know it's actually
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:26.520]  just going to get worse for everybody and now they're going to say see blacks have got a quality
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:31.480]  now and then obama is going to have left cover to keep putting all the black folks in prison
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:36.360]  to keep the phony drug laws in place you watch it's going to get worse for black people you just
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:43.000]  watch you you do realize that that blacks suffer a higher degree of brainwashing than let's say
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:46.840]  you know white people i mean look at you look at you and your family and your family history you
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:52.280]  you wouldn't know what you know or have the instincts that you have have if your family
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:57.080]  or your your family tree was enslaved and and i guess you know people well it's more than that
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:01.480]  and i'm not attacking my family tree because that was the way of the world but in my family tree
[2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:08.680]  there were at least in their regions aggressive dominant king kingpins and so and so king rats
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:15.000]  and kingpins and i've actually had some you know back in the they pass on the real tricks
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:18.840]  and so it's not and then you and then i've got a good family down the line but but but again it's
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:25.240]  that world smart street smart of people that have been more middle-class than absolutely people who
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:31.640]  were taken off a slave boat you're absolutely right no no you're absolutely right yeah because
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:35.640]  you know you have the 300 year period where blacks are physically enslaved and then another
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:39.560]  hundred and something years of of uh financial sanctions where they couldn't work i guess you
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:43.320]  called the uh jim courier but let me ask is one well i mean hold on that's an important point
[2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:49.240]  but it was more than that half on average half the people grabbed in africa a lot of times they
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:55.160]  were grabbed in the interior they were tied up and marched hundreds of miles and i've actually
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:10:59.160]  read the histories of this it's very interesting that's why i got into history it's it's riveting
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:04.200]  i mean history's a lot better than fiction and they would march them 200 300 400 miles
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:12.200]  uh uh or to the coast uh they would normally try to escape a lot of them were wounded 10 percent
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:18.520]  on average or more uh sometimes they get fevers and more would die would die uh being marched
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:24.840]  then half of those so we're now 60 percent would die on the way over because they wouldn't even feed
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:30.040]  them the slave ships would just give them water and they were down there with the rats living
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:36.200]  for on average about two months and then the ships got blown back by uh hurricanes or by storms
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:42.280]  everybody would die uh and then sharks would follow the ships to and fro uh the caribbean the
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:50.840]  americas uh you know to and fro africa especially from africa and so then they got here and then
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:57.240]  the first social engineering of marriage licenses and and feminism putting the black women up above
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:03.800]  the men as as the house slaves and there's handbooks on this and so yes that's what it is today and
[2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:11.320]  those same systems the caesars developed in rome over other slaves who are from all over the world
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:20.040]  um predominantly caucasian and so the systems uh look i've got to go but uh yeah i mean it's just
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:27.640]  absolutely absolutely horrible that all of this is happening but but now we're all
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:36.440]  becoming slaves um go ahead and ask your last question we okay well uh okay what what aspects
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:43.000]  of the patriot patriot act should we fear the most and and can be factually linked obama
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:46.440]  as a supporter of it the reason i'm asking that so i want you to get information out to people
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:50.840]  so they can do their research and see just sure what he's about sure i appreciate your call
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:59.240]  morocco obama is extremely powerful right now he's the most powerful world leader though he's a
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:06.680]  puppet but he's the most powerful person in the world right now on paper a public political
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:11.000]  personality you'll only have that for maybe six months to a year maybe not even that long
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:18.920]  but he's the most powerful person on the surface the men and he didn't do what they say they'll
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.880]  kill him but that's not a problem he's one of them so it's a judo scope
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:33.400]  and john what was the question he was asking i i got off thinking about morocco obama
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:40.200]  i was asking about the patriot act he said that he would repeal the patriot act i don't
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:45.080]  remember it was like a year ago when he was first running he said um that he would repeal the
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:49.880]  warrantless wiretapping he said he would repeal a whole bunch of police state provisions and now
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.240]  he's saying he's not so the point is democrats were all upset and wanted that stuff repeal okay well
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:14:01.160]  now they got the house the senate and the executive let's see it repeal let's see it all repeal all
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:08.440]  these leftists against the drug war good let's see it repeal i want some change what the people want
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:15.320]  what's constitutional what you promised not fake change of getting deeper into the new world order
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:20.840]  so that's it everything the democrats didn't like the bush did rightfully
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:25.960]  let's see it reverse now because you got the power you're in the driver's seat right now
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:31.320]  but obama has said he's not doing any of it so there's the basic facts i want to bring
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:34.600]  chet anerson up for this segment part of the next and then tarp was coming up we'll get to all your
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:38.360]  calls i i said that call around for 15 minutes because it was a lot of important questions
[2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:43.560]  chet i don't you know i'm really freaked out today i'm exhausted i was up here till past midnight
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.200]  and doing a bunch of broadcasts i'm kind of out of control today but and i'm freaked out that open
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:52.200]  world government's being announced i know you're freaked out dean marty lost last night only got
[2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:56.520]  15 but we resisted and that's enough so i want to thank all the listeners for that but i wanted to
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:02.520]  get you up about financials um gold is exploded oil is exploding they did that on purpose for the
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:08.760]  election kept it down uh they're talking about devaluing the dollar in january
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.040]  ted people need to get gold coins and i just want to make it clear to the listeners that you have
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:21.320]  gold coins that you bought when gold was 50 bucks less than it is now and so you're not
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:26.040]  tacking a premium on your you're not even selling gold for what it cost right now as it's gone up
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:31.960]  when everywhere else it's at a 30 40 50 premium to get gold you you don't have a premium on it you
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:37.560]  have it below the price it is when most dealers are still sold out ted yeah that's while i you
[2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:42.120]  know i try to take advantage of everything i can and and when the prices get down there i buy it up
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:46.280]  here's an example right here and i've only got 30 and it's going to be a first come for serve thing
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:53.320]  i've got philharmonics the of the austrian philharmonics right now if i go into the marketplace
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:16:00.200]  and buy these from dealers i pay 825 right now i can sell them to you guys for 800 bucks
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:05.400]  why can i do that because i bought it back when gold was lower and i'm passing on the savings to
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:10.760]  you that's 25 dollars less than they cost me or any other dealer across the united states you
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:15.560]  won't buy them for less than that that's the best price out there on the market bar none but it's
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:22.120]  first come first serve i also have a bunch of ten dollar liberties at 673 that is almost a hundred
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:27.480]  dollars less than what i'd be training i'm sorry ten dollar indians at 673 it's about a hundred
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:32.360]  dollars less than i'd be than i'd be doing it if i just bought them out in the marketplace today

[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:00.840]  of the united states is going to be a puppet and that's why they're calling him president of the
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:05.720]  world because he's going to be the titular head the frontman who brings us into this and he's
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:11.000]  going to be hated that you know they know that's their job when they become president and he knows
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:15.880]  what his job is i feel so sorry for black folks especially because you know i would love to support

[2:29:35.320 --> 2:29:40.760]  been thinking of a nutrient dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family

[2:29:47.960 --> 2:30:08.440]  in these trying times ahead please call 1 9 i wish your buck was still silver it was bad when the
[2:30:08.440 --> 2:30:16.040]  country was wrong folks i'm bummed out because they're openly announcing world government for
[2:30:16.040 --> 2:30:23.240]  and by the private banks paying carbon taxes to them ron paul was on the first hour about that
[2:30:24.440 --> 2:30:29.240]  regulations on all banking under them with other people that engineered all this
[2:30:30.600 --> 2:30:35.720]  obama's pledged to do that he's got some of the grassroots zombie support but not a huge mandate
[2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:40.440]  like wepster tartley said earlier so all i would ask wepster in the next hour and 27 minutes we
[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:43.960]  were sitting in today and i appreciate you doing it because i've got to go do international tv on
[2:30:43.960 --> 2:30:49.720]  press tv all i would ask we hope folks will watch that live on the web and record it and put it on
[2:30:49.720 --> 2:30:57.560]  youtube at press tv dot com all i would ask i'll be on there from two to three central all i would
[2:30:57.560 --> 2:31:01.880]  ask is that you first give people the big picture about the angle american establishment and how
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:08.440]  the international bankers are setting this up and what this neo serfdom feudalism eugenics is
[2:31:08.440 --> 2:31:13.080]  so they understand what it means by sacrifice you're not gonna like what i do and then break down
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:17.640]  the mobilization and how we deal with them we're live on prison planet dot tv we'll be screaming
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:21.400]  that with some images of obama and things in the background wepster tartley's in maryland
[2:31:21.400 --> 2:31:27.080]  right outside dc uh... author of the george h w bush the unauthorized biography and two books on
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:32.600]  obama he's going to be sitting in for the next hour and a half and again wepster you've got the
[2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:37.480]  floor thank you go ahead thank you alexon good luck uh... good luck in your work this afternoon
[2:31:37.480 --> 2:31:43.480]  thank you from the hell this is uh... wepster tartley i'm here in uh... washington dc or
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:49.160]  thereabouts and i hope people uh... some degree familiar with me let me just introduce myself
[2:31:49.160 --> 2:31:53.960]  briefly alex made me promise that i wouldn't try to flog my books too much but i am the
[2:31:53.960 --> 2:32:00.680]  author of obama the postmodern coup which is available at the uh... info wars website i'm
[2:32:00.680 --> 2:32:07.080]  also the author of barack h obama the unauthorized biography which i think you can only get
[2:32:07.080 --> 2:32:13.320]  uh... at the amazon dot com and let me just say i'm very uh... interested to look at that
[2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:18.920]  the sales of my book in germany the the german translation of obama the postmodern coup is
[2:32:18.920 --> 2:32:24.920]  now about the number sixty five bestseller on amazon of germany meaning that i'm i'm in the
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:31.480]  top uh... sixty or seventy books uh... in uh... in germany so that's uh... that's interesting
[2:32:31.480 --> 2:32:36.920]  that they're gonna be at least uh... warned to some degree about what's what's approaching them uh...
[2:32:36.920 --> 2:32:41.880]  we're obviously at a historical turning point and it's unfortunate that it is a uh... it is the
[2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:48.040]  making of a world tragedy we have taken the leap into the abyss but uh... there are still lots
[2:32:48.040 --> 2:32:52.840]  and lots of things that we need to do about this and the the uh... basically the clarion
[2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:59.080]  call that i would like to issue today is we need to mobilize politically political mobilization
[2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:04.200]  is what is needed uh... not other forms of uh... self-defense activity which
[2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:08.760]  you know survivalism or what have you that will not do it of these you know you can do in your
[2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:15.240]  spare time but your principal concern ought to be how to mobilize politically because what we need
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:22.760]  is something that will amount to a united front against fascism in other words a united front
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:29.560]  against those economic policies institutional policies uh... and uh... foreign policies too
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:36.280]  that can be identified as in the fascist tradition and when i talk about fascism let's use the
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:42.680]  italian fascism of musolini as a good uh... example of that uh... it's one that allows us to study
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:47.480]  the thing uh... a little bit more dispassionately maybe than uh... some of the other examples
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:53.640]  as as people can readily understand i would urge people in addition to reading my book so obama
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:58.840]  the postmodern coup and barrage obama the unauthorized biography just go to your public library
[2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:04.360]  and get any book about musolini any book about fascism about the history of italy right after
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:09.480]  world war one the history of the nineteen twenties and thirties there are also good books about
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:16.120]  fascism in general the problem that people have today is that the understanding of fascism has
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:22.520]  been reduced to a very very low level uh... people don't really understand that fascism is not a
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:29.160]  top-down dictatorship it becomes more and more oppressive it is rather a mass movement coming
[2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:34.200]  up out of the street to sort of what you've been seeing in these stadiums around the country for
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:40.600]  the obama stadium appearances what you saw there in denver what you saw there in aragon or in
[2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:47.800]  philadelphia last night we had a big crowd out there in grant park in chicago the oceanic crowd
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:54.520]  the orator in the middle of the massy mass preferably at night all of these things are
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:35:01.320]  very very disturbing harkening back to the political liturgy the political symbolism
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:05.640]  of uh... the nineteen twenties and the nineteen thirties so here's what i suggest we do
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:10.360]  do uh... in that hour and a half that i have to you with you today i'd like to talk myself for
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:15.400]  about thirty or forty minutes and then we'll go over to phone calls i would suggest the following
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:23.000]  first of all there should be no honeymoon for the fascist corporate state we don't need a hundred
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:29.720]  days honeymoon we don't need any honeymoon there should be no illusions about this people are
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:39.160]  caught up in the hysteria of obama don't be uh... this is a very grim and very ominous situation
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:45.080]  we're now in we've come out of it not with the worst of all possible outcomes but with a bad one
[2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:51.320]  uh... we've got a one-party state we've got the repo clique the reed pelosi obama clique
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:57.960]  now taking over the u.s. government most of the really bad stuff under bush in terms of the wars
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:05.320]  at least came under one-party republican rule that was bad now we're going to have one party
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:11.320]  democratic rule i'm afraid that's going to be worse if only because the world economic depression
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:17.000]  is going to make it worse so no honeymoon no hundred days it's going to be a mockery to compare
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:22.600]  obama's hundred days with franklin d roosevelt this will be the one hundred days in reverse this
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:29.560]  will be payment to bankers not emergency relief to people that are starving and hurting so no
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:36.520]  honeymoon secondly there must be no fascist censorship we don't want anybody tampering
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:42.440]  with the first amendment it has served us very well we are after all traditionalists we have that
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:49.880]  saving touch of conservatism we want the full freedom guaranteed in the first amendment
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:54.760]  of the constitution we don't want to hear about fairness doctrines we don't want
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:37:00.040]  government bureaucrats tampering with the media we don't want chuck schumer with his bankrupt
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:06.680]  argument that that uh... pornography is regulated and therefore free speech on talk radio ought to
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:12.680]  be also we don't need that we need more media diversity not less the fairness doctrine is a
[2:37:12.680 --> 2:37:20.360]  way to muzzle and censor the mass media so we don't want any product we also don't want
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:26.680]  hate hate crime or hate speech legislation we don't want politically correct speech codes being
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:32.120]  rammed down the throat of the american people watch for policy and her totalitarian liberal
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:38.440]  cohorts to try to impose things of that nature another very important one we don't want the
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:45.480]  institutionalization of governmental or power governmental fascist militias we don't want
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:52.200]  a homeland security core of the type that obama has talked about we don't want a green core
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:59.480]  we don't want any of the four or five different kinds of quasi-fascist or fascistoid militias
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:06.360]  which obama has proposed to create using public funding a court is in some ways already
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:11.800]  a pilot project it's a kind of a militia using government money and you can see what they do
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:15.720]  right though you don't have to expect them to come forward with black shirts or brown shirts
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:21.720]  carrying billy clubs and and dosing out castor oil to make their opponent stick to their stomach
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:25.480]  it's going to be in a modern form but we don't want any of these militias now
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:31.880]  terms of economic policy there will be in the first hundred days the demand for more bailouts
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:37.720]  we've had jim kramer who speaks for the trading desk at goldman sacks and morgan stanley and jp
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:44.920]  morgan chase jim kramer on cnbc has called for more bailouts more money pumped into the
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:51.560]  edifice of one quadrillion dollars of derivatives that wall street and their international allies
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:59.400]  have built up we say no to bailouts no more bailouts and we don't want any part of the federal
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:04.680]  government to be cannibalized and looted in order to finance these bailouts that includes
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:11.720]  kramer the idea we don't want social security looted we don't want social security medicare
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:19.480]  medicaid tampered with in order to pay the bills for george soros david rockefeller and the boys
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:27.320]  at goldman sacks who have put barkie into office there's also the question of fascist austerity
[2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:33.640]  um you've noticed that under the fascist regimes in central europe between the two world wars
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:39.400]  one of the main tasks of the entire government was to drive down the standard of living to massively
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:46.360]  transfer economic resources out of the hands of the common people and into the hands of bankrupt
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:52.200]  bankers that is what obama's proposing i had to laugh when people talked about obama as a socialist
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:59.080]  obama's not a socialist this is social fascism this is not about distributing wealth to poor people
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:05.560]  this is about gouging everybody and giving soros and david rockefeller and goldman sacks the
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:11.880]  proceeds it's very very different the chosen method for doing this of course requires left cover
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:16.920]  we're now entering into a period of left cover uh government which is different from what we've
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:22.040]  had under the right-wing reactionary period of bush cheney and the neocons they're going
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:27.560]  to try to do this with a carbon tax or a cap and trade system most likely a cap and trade system
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:35.640]  which will in effect be a huge uh unnecessary totally uh ideological tax on all forms of
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:41.880]  production this will drive down the standard of living uh in a dramatic way so we say no to it
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:46.120]  and we're going to be told but that means you don't care about the polar bears you don't care
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:51.000]  about the arctic ice cap the answer is simple and i can give you this as a historian i don't need
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:58.440]  climatologists i don't need uh pseudo scientists or quackademics to come forward with their crazy
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:03.480]  global warming theory we know that this is a matter of sunspot activity we know that the
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:10.680]  medieval warm period corresponded to a high level of sunspot activity the medieval maximum
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:16.680]  we know that the little ice age and the late 1500s in the beginning of the 1600s corresponded to
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:24.680]  minimums of solar and sunspot activity so this is just crazy uh this is pseudo science this is as
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:31.480]  bad as it gets in terms of junk science pseudo science uh and the sort of thing again that we
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:37.880]  saw in central europe between the two world wars another no is no to free trade sellouts
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:45.000]  we don't need any expansion of nafta we don't want kasta we don't want the authority of the
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.480]  international um gatt the world trade organization and so forth we don't need any more of that
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:59.640]  and then in the area of international politics we can already see obama has demanded the escalation
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:05.560]  of the war in afghanistan obama was of course the biggest war monger in the field certainly the
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:10.840]  biggest war monger in the democratic field and in many ways the biggest war monger of the mall
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:19.320]  although uh mccain's foolish bluster sometimes obscured that fact so it is a question of no
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:27.080]  to a confrontation with russia no confrontation with china no attack on sudan no escalation
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:34.440]  of the afghan war no attack on pakistan because that is the secret of that one notice that the
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:41.560]  one head of state head of government around the world who has spoken up sharply against the obama
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:49.160]  hysteria a clear bright warning comes from russian president midyadev and his associate
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:57.160]  prime minister pruten of russia and they are simply saying don't put your missiles into poland
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:04.280]  don't start the polish missile crisis it is going to be similar to the cuban missile crisis it is
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:11.800]  a threat to peace and security in the world we don't need it we don't don't need the um
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:17.720]  radar to go into the check republic we don't need the missiles to go into poland this is
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:25.880]  an incalculable folly if obama wants to prove his goodwill if he wants to show
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:30.920]  that he represents hope and change i would recommend that he do the following he has
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:36.600]  expressed some caveats maybe some skepticism about these polish missile deployment and the
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:42.600]  check phase the rate early warning radar why don't we just cancel those barky why don't we just say
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:49.320]  we will not have missiles in poland we will not have this modern radar put into the check republic
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:57.480]  let's avoid a needless international confrontation let us tell the vice president elect biden if
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:05.080]  that's really what he is to stop his insane hysterical calls for an invasion of sudan
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:11.560]  the biggest country in africa the country which um when the imperialist armies go there they often
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:17.000]  don't come back you remember that movie about general gordon of the british at cartoom and
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:23.320]  all the trouble that he had uh never got out of there as it turned out uh we don't want to extend
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:30.040]  war to an entirely new continent we don't need to have african flames uh now that the middle
[2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:36.840]  east is in flames let us turn away from the path of confrontation naturally obama is committed
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:43.880]  to escalating the afghan war biden has been leading the charge for the attack on on uh
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:50.920]  on sudan i don't believe there will be an attack on iran i'll be surprised if that comes about i
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:58.200]  think that the the obama burjinsky strategy will be tried to turn iran against russia and against
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:04.280]  other countries to use them as a pawn rather than to uh make them into the target of confrontation
[2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:13.240]  totally different approach uh the other question is pakistan uh obama during the campaign in particular
[2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:20.200]  in chicago in july of last year was the first to demand a reckless and irresponsible unilateral
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:27.560]  policy of bombing the hell out of northwest pakistan that is now reality the goal of that of course
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:34.360]  is not any nonsense about al qaeda bin laden the war on terror or any of this foolish uh discredited
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:40.600]  mythology it is for the purpose of breaking up pakistan instead of having one pakistan
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:45.720]  they'd like to have five or six instead of dealing with a single government in islamabad
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:50.680]  armed with nuclear weapons with medium range nuclear missiles of some sort to deliver them
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:57.000]  they want to have four or five different micro states or mini states that's the terminology
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:02.520]  that uh big new burjinsky likes to use in his books would be dealing with wasiristan
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:11.080]  push tunistan beluchistan send and other micro states or mini states none of those would be
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:20.360]  big enough to stand up to xon mobile or jp morgan chase so this is now the task in terms of the
[2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:28.360]  time frame we've got two i think two uh kinds of uh time frames we can look at one is the time
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:33.720]  between well actually three then the between now and the election we've got the assembling of the
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:39.160]  of the new regime right the transition we've already got one sign obama has now named
[2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:47.320]  rom emmanuel a corrupt political hack congressman from chicago veteran of the clinton white house
[2:46:47.880 --> 2:46:55.400]  rom emmanuel will be the new white house chief of staff this is about as bad as it could be
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:04.440]  rom emmanuel was on the dark side of the clinton white house he is a member of the illinois
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:12.120]  bipartisan combine that means the joint operation by republicans and democrats to loot the people
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:18.920]  of chicago to loot the state of illinois this is what went on uh this is the the thing that barchy
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:25.720]  comes out of obama is somebody who has swum and cavorted in the cesspool of filth corruption
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:31.400]  and graft of the illinois bipartisan combine rom emmanuel is also somebody who spent the first
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:37.720]  gulf war as a volunteer for the israeli defense force this is not a good choice we'll be back in a

[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:07.400]  oh
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:14.120]  welcome back to the alex jones program this is webster topley here in washington dc sitting
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:21.400]  in as guest host this afternoon for alex uh again what i'm proposing now is political
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:29.400]  mobilization during the time of the transition during the first hundred days and essentially
[2:51:29.400 --> 2:51:36.120]  for the next two years there will be a congressional election in two years if the institutional
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:42.200]  arrangements remain as they have been right that's been fairly reliable in american history we've had
[2:51:42.200 --> 2:51:48.040]  these congressional elections the midterm elections uh where you'll be able to register
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:57.080]  your uh opinions about this new regime uh so we've got the transition we've got the first
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:52:04.680]  very bad sign ron emmanuelle as white house chief of staff a corrupt member of the illinois
[2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:11.560]  bipartisan combine that is the area otherwise inhabited by such figures as tony rescoe
[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:20.920]  not to me ouchie alfamari and others along with the janulias and tony jurors go rango
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:25.640]  and all the rest of them the cesspool of corruption in which obama has been
[2:52:25.640 --> 2:52:33.480]  in bathing and cavorting and frolicking during his entire career multi ethnic corruption there's
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:38.760]  you know there's all kinds of uh ethnic groups in it but it's the illinois bipartisan combine
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:44.760]  republicans and democrats can join to loot the people of illinois that seems to be the kind
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:50.760]  of bipartisanship that obama likes best there will be a fight about other appointments right the
[2:52:50.760 --> 2:52:57.560]  plum book comes out um for example who's going to be secretary of state will it be the ify snob
[2:52:58.120 --> 2:53:04.840]  john carry senator carry of massachusetts with his wife whose parents were servants of the
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:11.480]  portuguese fascist dictatorship of the salazar with his wife teresa heintz carry who comes from
[2:53:11.480 --> 2:53:18.120]  the heart of the foundation world which is otherwise the world that has produced obama
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:24.440]  the product of the ford foundation the gemaliel foundation the woods fund the joys foundation
[2:53:24.440 --> 2:53:30.920]  the annenberg foundation and his close friend bernardine dorne gets her money from the macarthur
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:38.120]  foundation the evil social engineering the manipulation the fragmentation the divide
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:43.960]  and conquer strategies of these foundations anyway will it be carry or will it be richard
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:52.120]  holbrook the mad bomber of syria in nineteen ninety nine the russo fob the russia hater
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:58.600]  who decided to make a terrible example of syria with uh sixty to seventy days of bombing
[2:53:58.600 --> 2:54:06.520]  in the spring of nineteen ninety nine in order to show the russians the true brutality of u.s
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:12.760]  and british imperialism it looks like a fight between holbrook and carry for secretary of state
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:18.360]  westley clark the other mad bomber of syria back in nineteen ninety nine
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:25.240]  who uh blocked with tony blair against his own government to try to get a land invasion a ground
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:31.400]  troop invasion of syria which would have been an unexampled bloodbath russo westley clark
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:37.320]  may be in the running but his chemistry with barkie doesn't seem to be too good so you'll have
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:43.560]  all kinds of struggles about these appointments and perhaps during this time already we'll begin
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:49.960]  to see the falling out among thieves in other words the obama corruption conveyance that they
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:56.360]  have all jumped on to people like david wilhelm out there in uh in illinois that this will uh
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:55:01.880]  prove to be uh not enough in other words there's not enough goodies to go around for all of the
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:08.520]  various thugs and goons who have jumped on the barkie bandwagon so we'll see some of that
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:13.560]  then we'll get into the hundred days there will obviously be an attempt to try to stage
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:17.320]  unprecedented stereo we've got to be ready for that and then we've got to be ready to hold out
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:37.960]  for two years until the next election back in a minute you are listening to gcn visit gcn

[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:10.840]  sitting in for alex this afternoon as guest host and uh we've obviously got a lot to cover the new
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:19.560]  regime we've had the uh obama giden obama giden has occurred and we're still standing and we
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:28.600]  still intend to resist the attempt to transform the u.s economy and institutions in what can only
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:35.800]  be called a fascist neo fascist fascist storage social fascist direction might as well call it a
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:44.600]  plain old fascist direction uh notice that the american people are still majority anti-fascist
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:52.680]  um 48 percent even according to the official statistics 48 percent have rejected obama
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:58:00.600]  this is not a landslide this is nothing like lbj defeating goldwater this is nothing like
[2:58:00.600 --> 2:58:07.240]  uh nixon defeating mcgovern it's nothing like reagan defeating carter nothing like
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:14.840]  uh reagan defeating mondale in those cases the losers came out with two three four five
[2:58:15.480 --> 2:58:21.880]  states uh this is nothing like that this is an evenly divided country notice that there is
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:28.520]  no debate in the hysterical controlled wall street media no debate at all about the mandate well
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:35.880]  there is no mandate there's no mandate for obama to do anything uh first of all because
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:43.800]  if we add in uh the acorn and related vote fraud right remembering that this time around in sharp
[2:58:43.800 --> 2:58:51.640]  contrast to 2000 and 2004 the ruling class the finance oligarchs have decreed that the
[2:58:51.640 --> 2:58:57.720]  vote fraud machines will be geared up in favor of the democrat this is of course the oligarchical
[2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:03.480]  consensus in favor of obama obama being the candidate of the trilateral commission the
[2:59:03.480 --> 2:59:10.520]  builder burger group the rand corporation uh the chicago school of economics the skull and bones
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:16.920]  people uh and the foundations above all the foundations um they have decreed that this
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:23.480]  time around vote fraud is in favor of obama clearly there's also the media hysteria the
[2:59:23.480 --> 2:59:29.720]  unprecedented corruption of the various wall street media whores uh falling all over themselves
[2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:38.120]  with their falling adulation never daring to question the utopian and messianic rhetoric
[2:59:38.120 --> 2:59:44.280]  of the new messiah but even in the face of all of this uh almost half have rejected obama and i
[2:59:44.280 --> 2:59:49.800]  think if we had an honest vote count which were unlikely to ever get we'd find that it's it's not
[2:59:49.800 --> 2:59:57.000]  50 50 it might even be 51 49 against obama some of these states of course were very very close
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:03.720]  wherever it was that close you'd have to look into acorn vote fraud but since mccain has
[3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:11.320]  cravenly capitulated uh we're very very unlikely to ever get accurate vote counts in those uh
[3:00:11.320 --> 3:00:16.920]  areas so the first thing we have to remember is obama is not a legitimate president there is no
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:23.560]  legitimacy here uh he is uh another tenant of the white house unfortunate for the past eight
[3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:28.440]  years we've had a tenant of the white house we got another tenant of the white house we do not have
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:35.400]  a constitutionally legitimized presidency one of the reasons for this is the questions about
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:41.640]  obama's birth have and citizenship have never been answered uh we should obviously keep raising
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:49.320]  the demand in order to underline his illegitimacy of nothing else that obama has to show the full
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:58.360]  detailed vault copy of his birth certificate we demand to see it it's not enough to assure us
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:03.800]  that he was born in this or that hospital in hawaii there are very credible detailed reports
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:10.040]  that he was born in kenya he is a citizen of kenya and after that he transferred his citizenship
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:17.560]  to indonesia he apparently never became an american citizen so we've now got an illegal alien
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:24.600]  in the white house historical models come to mind in france it was a corsican in germany it was
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:30.280]  in austria and now in the u.s it seems to be a kenyan so maybe we're following in those footsteps
[3:01:30.280 --> 3:01:46.200]  let's hope that let's mobilize to stop it
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:55.960]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:02:00.280]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[3:02:00.280 --> 3:02:04.600]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:09.400]  never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:13.800]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:18.360]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:23.000]  voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:28.120]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.560]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:39.080]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:44.360]  it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:49.320]  may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:53.880]  stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:59.000]  in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:03.800]  it on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[3:03:03.800 --> 3:03:08.920]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:12.840]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:17.400]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[3:03:17.400 --> 3:03:22.040]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:27.000]  but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from ecoli
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.800]  salmonella genetic alteration or chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:39.640]  year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com visit efoodsdirect.com
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:43.880]  and look over the final list of high quality freeze dried and dehydrated foods they have to
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:50.680]  offer watch the free videos look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:57.960]  again 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com take action today the first step is getting
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:15.800]  storable food the genesis communications radio network probably presents the alex jones show
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:32.360]  welcome back to the alex jones program i am webster talk to you here in washington dc sitting
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:38.200]  in for alex this afternoon just looking ahead now we've got to mobilize what amounts to an
[3:04:38.200 --> 3:04:44.680]  united front against fascism we'll find a better name for that as time goes on it will grow out of
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:51.320]  the mobilization itself i'm sure obama's not legitimate he's a usurper he's a new tenant of
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:57.560]  the white house he has not produced his detailed birth certificate we don't know who he is we
[3:04:57.560 --> 3:05:03.560]  don't know what his name is we don't know where he's from uh... mccain has let us down obviously
[3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:10.360]  mccain needed to talk about the citizenship issue mccain needed to call attention to the efforts
[3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:17.480]  of philip j berg of philadelphia at the supreme court uh... i was there with him last thursday
[3:05:17.480 --> 3:05:24.760]  afternoon when the paperwork went in to justice suitor of the supreme court that that was disallowed
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:32.440]  then on the late afternoon of the monday of this week before the election this issue remains open
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:40.040]  as long as we have the colorable uh... claim of a illegal alien in the white house this
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:45.560]  issue remains open and it's a perfectly legitimate constitutional issue what's the big objection
[3:05:45.560 --> 3:05:50.760]  to bush and cheney they trample on the constitution let's start respecting the constitution
[3:05:50.760 --> 3:05:54.520]  and of course if you want to get your hand on the thermonuclear button which is what
[3:05:54.520 --> 3:05:59.880]  obama is now approaching we get to know everything about you we get to know every detail of your
[3:05:59.880 --> 3:06:05.800]  life is no such thing as a private sphere uh... the other question that mccain let us down on
[3:06:05.800 --> 3:06:12.200]  of the larry cinclair uh... allegations the question of uh... well what what larry cinclair
[3:06:12.200 --> 3:06:18.200]  has talked about uh... encounters in november of nineteen ninety nine with obama indulging in
[3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:24.040]  crack cocaine those are the charges that were made and therefore this also has got to be dealt
[3:06:24.040 --> 3:06:30.440]  with mccain has let us down most of all perhaps mccain forfeited his moral claim to the presidency
[3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:37.160]  when he voted in favor of the infamous seven hundred billion dollar bailout for wall street
[3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:43.880]  derivatives mccain needed to separate himself from bush what better way to do it than to reject
[3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:51.800]  uh... with a spectacular gesture the bankrupt bailout policy he could have said no to that
[3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:57.320]  and uh... with obama voting for it mccain could then have pointed out that all of obama's promises
[3:06:57.320 --> 3:07:03.400]  about middle-class tax cuts and health care that will never be realized because obama
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:09.560]  has given away seven hundred billion dollars with his vote in the senate before he ever gets
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:15.080]  to the white house so this is simply not going to happen if we want to look ahead though let's
[3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:21.800]  look ahead through the transition period uh... we may have you know economic crisis obviously
[3:07:21.800 --> 3:07:27.480]  coming back during the transition we're going to have uh... possible confrontations uh... starting
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:34.280]  quite soon but the hundred days will then be the big push they'll try to have the fairness doctrine
[3:07:34.280 --> 3:07:40.440]  institutionalize these militias have new bailouts impose cap and trade new free trade systems
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:46.760]  uh... loot social security and uh... at the same time the foreign policy establishment will move
[3:07:46.760 --> 3:07:53.000]  towards confrontation with russia new false flag events are not ruled out simply because
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:57.400]  those are now possible once again once we have
[3:07:57.960 --> 3:08:04.360]  the beatific personality of obama to come forward and say the bomb went off country x did it
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:08.440]  therefore we are going to be at war with country x bush and shaney had
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:12.520]  had long since lost that capability there are a lot of people in the ruling elite who
[3:08:12.520 --> 3:08:18.440]  think that with obama they've got it back they may try it let's us be ready to undercut
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:23.480]  that kind of nonsense the question of a new nine eleven comes back on the table
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:28.600]  from the moment that they've got obama in the white house to talk about this stuff otherwise
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:33.880]  we can go back to the carter model i've written about this in obama the postmodern coup there's a
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:39.240]  good thirty or forty page history of the carter regime it was catastrophic it was made up of
[3:08:39.240 --> 3:08:44.920]  members of the trilateral commission uh... carter immediately got into trouble with congress and
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:50.120]  i think obama will too even though carter of course had big democratic majorities in the way that
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:59.000]  obama does uh... when you run as the savior and the anointed one you're not asking for a mandate
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:06.600]  for any specific set of policies uh... what is obama's program well it's to be the savior uh...
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:13.080]  what is obama's base it's personality cultists for obama there's no issue really involved hope
[3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:17.080]  and change the problem that is that once you get into power and you actually have to make
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:22.600]  concrete decisions every time you make one you're turning off half or a third or a very large
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:29.000]  proportion of your base obama has served as a screen for the projection of the fantasies and
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:34.760]  wishes of a whole bunch of left liberal lemmings and other people in the population that will
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:39.400]  rapidly come to an end once he gets into the white house if he does and has to make these
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:45.720]  uh... decisions so that will be a problem there's also the megalomania inherent in obama the
[3:09:45.720 --> 3:09:52.200]  guys in egomaniac his habitual position is looking down his nose at the rest of the world he is an
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:59.640]  elitist he's an oligarch he's a typical product of the foundation funded overclass uh... so that
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:05.240]  is not going to make for good relations with various people in the congress so we can look
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:10.840]  at carter carter peaked in terms of his popularity at the end of his hundred days
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:17.240]  and after that carter went down down down and within twelve months after the hundred days
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.920]  were over carter had lost twenty five points in the polls he was an unpopular president
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:30.760]  by the spring of nineteen let's see was nineteen seventy eight and he never regained his popularity
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:35.720]  except for a kind of rally around the flag when the hostages in iran were taken which was of course
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:41.800]  one of the operations of the carter administration itself so the hundred days we've got to get
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:46.760]  through the hundred days try to block some of this legislation uh... look around for institutional
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:52.920]  uh... support in that forty eight forty nine percent of the american people reject obama there still
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:59.080]  is a republican party there's still a significant group of republican senators uh... they can be
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:04.680]  forced to block some of this legislation you're basically dealing with two gangs one gang is
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:09.000]  now much stronger one gang is weaker you've obviously got to try to play the weaker gang
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:15.240]  against the stronger gang and try to avoid the worst at that point the goal is gridlock
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:22.120]  the goal is partisan paralysis the goal is a situation where nothing gets through the congress
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:28.600]  if we can if we could guarantee that that's what we would like to have so that's the hundred days
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:33.160]  after that we'll have to get through two years some people suggest that they might be a false
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:40.360]  flag attempt to try to refurbish obama's image that's of course a clear possibility the other
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:46.440]  thing we need to look at let's look look back at Mussolini um... this is a distant mirror but i
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:51.960]  think this is unfortunately one of the more accurate ones Mussolini you'll remember took power
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:58.440]  in october 1922 with the march on rome it could have easily been dispersed but the king demanded
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:04.200]  that Mussolini be allowed to form a government now Mussolini had to govern with a coalition
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:10.920]  he had fascist nationalist conservatives liberals catholics uh... and this was a problem for him
[3:12:10.920 --> 3:12:15.880]  obama look if you look at it it seems like they're all democrats but within the democrats
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:20.040]  there are different groups there are some conservative democrats there are blue dogs
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:25.400]  the old bull weevils whatever you want to call them there are also new deal types like marci
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:31.480]  captor they're different factions inside the house democrats and even the house the senate
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:38.760]  democrats not all of them are part of the obama kool-aid drinking personality cult
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:44.920]  there will be some resistant some friction there i would think depending on what he does
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.480]  in the case of Mussolini he concentrated during the first couple of years on changing the election
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:57.240]  laws that was one side of it i think with obama we're going to see an attempt to use the fairness
[3:12:57.240 --> 3:13:03.160]  doctrine in various kinds of hate crime or hate speech regulations to try to suppress
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:08.440]  political dissent so that would be the modern analog to what obama what uh... what Mussolini
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:16.920]  was doing then the other thing is the militias uh... Mussolini created in the first year that
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:23.960]  he was in power the voluntary national security militia it sounds exactly like the homeland
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:29.720]  security core and the green core and these other things that obama is talking about and i believe
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:35.400]  this is probably conscious not on the part of obama but on the part of others there's also
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:41.080]  with Mussolini the fight to consolidate a dictatorship you don't immediately get a
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:46.600]  dictatorship in a parliamentary system or even more so in the u.s. system therefore there's a
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:52.840]  fight to make the dictatorship stick like to put it together and try to suppress dissent in the
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:14:00.440]  parliament in the congress and in public opinion remember fascistization is a process by which
[3:14:00.440 --> 3:14:08.360]  the various institutions of society political parties trade unions sports clubs regional
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:14.840]  associations any kind of institution that allows people to act together is a means by which
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:21.480]  a regime can be resisted and therefore fascism tends to go after those and try to weaken them
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:27.640]  and in this country i think talk radio would be one of the one of the prominent ones in
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:33.400]  italy in nineteen twenty four in the midst of Mussolini tampering with the election laws
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:39.240]  there emerged a single figure of resistance a guy called matéotti who was then assassinated by
[3:14:39.240 --> 3:14:46.200]  people sympathetic to Mussolini so look for various individuals in various institutions
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:52.360]  coming to personify the resistance against this new regime one of the mistakes that they made in
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:57.400]  italy was that they did not understand the need to unite they had all kinds of people who didn't
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:15:02.840]  like the fascist regime but they were always squabbling and quibbling about this or that
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:09.240]  ideological point you need to get over that relatively rapidly and form a coherent opposition
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:14.680]  front around mainly this list of knows that's the easiest thing is to be able to agree on what
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:22.040]  you don't want no bailouts no fairness doctrine no militias and so forth no confrontation with
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:27.240]  russia china and so on down the line the other thing that happened with Mussolini in the course
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:32.600]  of his consolidation of the dictatorship was a large part of the italyan parliament

[3:19:58.120 --> 3:20:11.400]  welcome back to the alex joneshow this is webs to talk to you in washington dc i am alex's guest
[3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:17.320]  post standing in for him uh... today this afternoon on the author of obama the postmodern
[3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:23.960]  coup and obama the unauthorized biography the postmodern coup you can get it in four wars dot
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:30.360]  com the unauthorized biography you've got to go to amazon dot com and i'm happy to say that the
[3:20:30.360 --> 3:20:37.400]  german edition of the postmodern coup is number 65 on amazon of germany meaning that it's the
[3:20:37.400 --> 3:20:42.280]  best seller it's the number one book on the uh... u.s. election the people are turning to and i hope
[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:48.680]  they watch out because it is a warning to uh... people in europe don't be made into a kamikaze
[3:20:48.680 --> 3:20:54.520]  puppet for his big new bryzinski's apocalyptic confrontation and settling of accounts with
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:20:59.640]  russia because that's what he wants to do wipe out russia wipe out china and the anglo-american
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:05.480]  empire can go on for another hundred years just to sum up the uh... the way to think about uh...
[3:21:05.480 --> 3:21:12.440]  the current time i think is to go back to this musolini model october 1922 march on rom it's a
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:17.960]  bunch of rag tag goons and hooligans it's sort of like the stuff we see with with obama but it's
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:24.520]  a pretext to make uh... musolini than the prime minister in the first year that he's in power he
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:31.800]  creates the voluntary national security militia so learn something from that no militias no volunteer
[3:21:31.800 --> 3:21:38.600]  groups under any circumstances and at the same time he's tampering with the election law today
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:44.840]  it would be tampering with free speech under the fairness doctrine and other pretext that these
[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:52.120]  totalitarian liberals politically correct fanatics may come up with in uh... nineteen twenty
[3:21:52.120 --> 3:21:58.680]  four we have the emergence of resistance around this uh... marty opti who is then liquidated so
[3:21:58.680 --> 3:22:05.880]  um... political assassinations coming forward possibility uh... the then we have the crushing
[3:22:05.880 --> 3:22:12.040]  of the opposition inside the parliament this is the so-called aventine succession and after that
[3:22:12.040 --> 3:22:19.960]  by nineteen twenty five italy is in effect a one-party state so it takes uh... two years plus
[3:22:20.680 --> 3:22:26.520]  to get to that by december of nineteen twenty five musolini is head of government means he
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:31.480]  doesn't have to turn to the parliament to get a majority anymore and by nineteen twenty eight
[3:22:31.480 --> 3:22:39.080]  all the other parties except the fascist party are banned so that's about a timetable that's
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:44.440]  a timetable of five to six years uh... the crisis today of course is the stock market
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:49.480]  is reminding us uh... even as we speak this is obviously uh... very acute crisis
[3:22:50.120 --> 3:22:55.800]  uh... maybe our institutions are a little bit stronger the concept of the constitution
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:23:00.440]  stronger i think in the american people then in the italians of those days
[3:23:00.440 --> 3:23:05.560]  let's hope so we're going to need every bit of help we can get so i urge people now to think
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:12.920]  about developing that kind of a perspective the transition the hundred days and then the two years
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:21.480]  looking forward to uh... essentially ending the one-party state by november of the year twenty
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:29.080]  ten two years from now i urge people don't look to any established political party or faction
[3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:35.720]  to do this for you you will have to do this yourself people should begin to look around for
[3:23:35.720 --> 3:23:43.320]  congressional seats and indeed senate seats that they can compete for in the coming years
[3:23:43.880 --> 3:23:48.440]  and that means having a two-year perspective towards november of two thousand and ten
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:54.440]  to take back the government the goal of all of this is not to get government out of your lives
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:24:00.440]  it's to get you into the government that you take over the government and run it according
[3:24:00.440 --> 3:24:05.640]  to the needs of the american people which are of course constitutional government
[3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:12.040]  the continuation of freedom and economic recovery conducted under the all important general
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:19.080]  welfare clause of the preamble to the u.s. uh... constitution alex kids may he calls me a liberal
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:25.000]  i'm not a liberal i'm an american system traditionalist this is the main line of american history
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:32.200]  government uh... the uh... governor winthrop of the massachusetts bay colony benjamin franklin the
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:37.160]  founder of the post office alexander hamilton without whom the country would have collapsed
[3:24:37.160 --> 3:24:42.280]  within the first ten to fifteen years when the british had us on their death watch
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:48.440]  henry clay of kentucky who coined the term the american system meaning a protective tariff
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:54.440]  internal improvements a national bank and the promotion of science that's the big influence
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:25:00.120]  of course on lincoln along with matthew carrey and henry carrey we then have the prairie populace
[3:25:00.120 --> 3:25:05.320]  of the eighteen eighties and eighteen nineties the omaha convention which is the same idea
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:11.800]  get you into the government you take over the government mobilize politically don't go into
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:17.320]  the wilderness and live in a hut but go to washington and take over the congress because
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:23.080]  if these people can do it by god anybody can if that guy can become president than anybody
[3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:27.960]  can get into the congress and then of course the new deal of franklin the roosevelt and
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:33.240]  the attempted uh... revival of that the new frontier of john f kennedy that's the american
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:38.520]  tradition that is uh... that is what we have to work with and i urge you to mobilize even if you
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:43.800]  don't agree with all of that mobilize to take over the congress in november of two thousand and ten
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:50.360]  and this means you
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:53.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:29:22.840 --> 3:29:28.920]  or attempting to fill in for alex uh... this afternoon let me just sum it up you got to look
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:34.360]  for uh... means of institutional resistance you've got about half of the american people who don't
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:40.840]  like the new regime this is no land slide there is no mandate for any kind of radical change
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:49.000]  nothing of that sort uh... it's essentially another close to a draw fifty fifty situation
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:54.120]  this is not a permanent realignment to the party system in any way shape or form it all depends on
[3:29:54.120 --> 3:30:00.440]  the figure of baki obama who won't be there forever he can't be the center of a 40-year cycle
[3:30:00.440 --> 3:30:05.880]  uh... same thing would have been true with mccain it means that the party realignment remains
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:13.320]  open the question of the permanent majority one way the other remains open look around for possible
[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:19.240]  institutional resistance look for those uh... republicans in the congress look for uh...
[3:30:19.240 --> 3:30:23.880]  conservative democrats look for some new deal democrats the kind of combination that came
[3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:31.480]  together in the house against the bailout the first time around is your guideline i would say
[3:30:31.480 --> 3:30:36.920]  and of course don't forget the supreme court of nobody is used to looking to the supreme court for
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:43.480]  anything positive these days what with robert solito thomas and scalia running around there but
[3:30:43.480 --> 3:30:48.600]  you know lots of things have turned into their opposite this year and maybe some of these characters
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:55.720]  will too right that is the genius of the founders right that uh... john adams uh... dead for 200
[3:30:55.720 --> 3:31:03.960]  years and more is more powerful than uh... some of these little schemers by kakso rod ploof and
[3:31:03.960 --> 3:31:11.160]  favreau we now have uh... time for some calls we have lines open at one eight hundred two five nine
[3:31:11.160 --> 3:31:17.960]  nine two three one that's one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one so let's go right to
[3:31:17.960 --> 3:31:24.040]  your calls let's go to william in texas welcome william webster uh... let the listen to you
[3:31:24.600 --> 3:31:32.760]  but the first hour is always the hardest after after you talk for about an hour you get a little
[3:31:32.760 --> 3:31:39.080]  fatigued and tired and you fall under the heading of easy listening which i love but you're worth
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:46.120]  man you're you you got your iq is uh... i think uh... obviously higher than most of the audience
[3:31:46.120 --> 3:31:52.280]  it's uh... because you are a wealth of information and you are firing with both barrels
[3:31:52.280 --> 3:31:59.000]  uh... certainly initially and uh... you know it's just uh... you got a lot to say and that's a good
[3:31:59.000 --> 3:32:04.280]  thing uh... so that i can get you to do anything is the point you gotta bear with me i've been
[3:32:04.280 --> 3:32:09.720]  uh... i've been on the radio probably more hours in the past forty eight than i care to mention
[3:32:09.720 --> 3:32:15.000]  so if i get a little bit of horror you know how i would be this is warfare my friend this is war
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:18.920]  oh well i don't have plans to run for congress
[3:32:18.920 --> 3:32:23.320]  i'm sorry you tell me about your plans to run for congress you're not going to sit there like a
[3:32:23.320 --> 3:32:27.800]  literary critic and say well the voice was a little bit hoarse in the upper registers
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:34.920]  what are you going to do well you know uh... i'm really thought about this a lot and uh...
[3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:42.520]  i can tell you that how i feel and from what i see i think there were more people that voted
[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:48.040]  against the other opponent than voted for i think you're right
[3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:52.200]  i think you're right but we got a corn vote fraud and we've got the mass brainwashing
[3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:57.400]  this was a postmodern coup this was a cia people power coup i wrote a book about it it's called
[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:03.320]  obama the postmodern coup it's the same thing they did in kiav they did it in typhus they tried to do
[3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:08.920]  it in beirut interestingly in beirut they couldn't do it if you have an actual mass organization
[3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:13.800]  which in that case was hezbollah there's no way around it hezbollah stopped them cold
[3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:18.680]  if we had a mass organization we could stop them cold too obviously it wouldn't be hezbollah
[3:33:18.680 --> 3:33:26.280]  but you get the idea yes uh... it well i think though that uh... in looking at the states
[3:33:26.280 --> 3:33:31.720]  that uh... carried that they voted against i don't want to say it the other way that voted against
[3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:40.200]  obama uh... i've lived in a majority of those states in my years and i know how those people are
[3:33:41.240 --> 3:33:48.200]  and uh... if they think that there's going to be any kind of obama honeymoon here
[3:33:48.760 --> 3:33:55.240]  they are they are at totally uh... too far up in their ivory towers and out of touch i think that
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:34:05.240]  people it's not that obama uh... it's so great it looks to me like it's just that george bush is
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:10.920]  that bad sure thing thank you for your call william we we look forward to you uh...
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:15.800]  coming forward uh... politically obviously there were countercurrents right one current
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:21.960]  was the hatred of bush cheney the neocons the desire to punish the republicans for their
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:28.680]  deregulation agenda for letting the derivatives monsters run wild then of course there was
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:36.360]  a countercurrent which was the fear and loathing of the unknown obama with all of the uh... very
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:43.880]  very sorted and unsavory associations that he brought in so um i think yes there is an
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:49.480]  anti-fascist majority in this country anyway that's the historical bet we've got the place
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:55.560]  place a bet on the fact that the american people are still anti-fascist in spite of all of this
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:35:02.120]  brainwashing nine eleven iraq warren so forth this is the anti-fascist country par excellence
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:06.760]  and we don't want to forget it let's read remind people the lines are open at one eight hundred
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:13.240]  two five nine nine two three one and let's go to shon in california hey webster just a
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:19.240]  couple of quick comments and then a question um excellent intro into the uh... into obama and
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:24.840]  specifically what to be aware of in terms of his policies and and and how to start to combat them
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:30.760]  but um just two quick comment you know i i find continued discussion of obama citizenship status
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:36.280]  and passions and drugs really really a futile and mostly a diversion and waste of energy
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:41.000]  i mean we've got bigger things to to uh... to worry about i'm concerned that that those are
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:44.600]  going to be used as divisive and and diversionary tactics
[3:35:44.600 --> 3:35:49.480]  um look just on that i i think any issue is legitimate and again
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:53.880]  some guy said to me it sounds like you want to have the napoleonic code where you're considered
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:59.720]  guilty until you're proven innocent yet for presidential candidates we want the napoleonic
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:04.360]  code in other words you've got to prove to us you want to get your hand on the thermonuclear
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:09.480]  button you want to get the launch codes you've got to prove to us therefore the burden of proof
[3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:14.040]  is on obama you want to be considered a u.s. citizen you want to you want this to shut
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:20.520]  up and go away as phil berg said repeatedly bring out the birth certificate why is this so hard
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:25.080]  and i don't i'm not in the business of of declaring any issue off the table
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:28.520]  you've obviously you've got a pretty heterogeneous like different uh...
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:33.640]  groups that are that are coming together now in fear of obama want to resist them
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:38.200]  uh... every one of those will bring its own outlook in other words for some people
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:43.000]  the issue of the illegal alien is going to be the big one that's not not the case for me
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.280]  but uh... fine all of this stuff is on the table right it's a smorgasbord of reasons
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:51.720]  any reason to oppose obama is a good one
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:56.280]  um... why would you say prioritize i mean i think we're in a situation now where we really
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:37:01.560]  got to stay focused and so prioritization is really key and and focusing on that one issue
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:06.760]  i don't think it's gonna now they do they try to i gave you about a dozen issues that i think
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:12.040]  are are more important but this obviously remains look the constitution think of it
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:15.800]  we had a terrible civil war i think we've got to learn from that
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:19.000]  if you don't have the constitution you may have civil war
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:24.600]  i'll take the constitution and it says in their natural born citizen and i don't think he is
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:29.160]  so if he wants to shut us up bring forward the birth certificate and let's push on
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:34.680]  okay well let me let me go back to what i think is a bigger issue here and that is
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:39.400]  is we got a situation now where what was the vote forty five you got forty seven percent
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:42.280]  of the population voted for him across the country something like that
[3:37:42.280 --> 3:37:46.200]  well those are the official figures we got a factor in acorn vote fraud right that we've
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:52.760]  got the graveyard vote we've got the axelrod ploof daily machine so factor that into i think
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:59.000]  it's about fifty fifty or maybe maybe uh... anti-fascist fifty one i think what i think
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:03.960]  what concerns me the most is we've got now some forty odd percent of the population who have
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:09.320]  really become just obama box that who are now looking at this man is some sort of deity
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:13.960]  now of course the mass media has done a lot of work to uh... to present him as such
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:18.360]  but so we've got a situation where the rest of us or some subset of the rest of us who are
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:22.680]  actually thinking clearly now have an administration and incredibly powerful
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:27.400]  administration and private industry we got a battle but we've got some forty odd percent
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:34.200]  left-wing bootcakes uh... who who view this kind of day we also have to find who will be the
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:39.720]  perfect candidate for brown shirts going forward how in the heck are we going to deal with that mess
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:47.240]  yeah look i think you're much too pessimistic the the obama vote total is not composed
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:56.280]  exclusively or even primarily of the kool-aid drinking fanatical lemming personality cultist
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:02.520]  it's not there's probably a group i mean it seems to me that it's the left liberals who are the worst
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:09.240]  offenders in this regard right which is maybe ten or or fifteen percent a lot of those people who
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:17.240]  voted for obama did so in desperation because they're looking for a way out of this terrible
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:22.760]  economic situation now the republicans didn't help the republicans had ads i was you know listening
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:27.800]  to the ones for the battleground state of virginia the republicans were saying if you vote for obama
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:31.880]  government sponsored health care is on its way well a lot of people hear that and they'll say
[3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:37.800]  hallelujah i need health care i don't care who's giving it to me don't tell me about free enterprise
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:44.040]  and uh... you know the austrian school we need health care not lectures about economic theory
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:51.240]  so the republicans by their primitive and stupid uh... economic propaganda uh... have played into
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:55.560]  this a lot of people really think that obama is going to redistribute the wealth a lot of those
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:59.800]  people are hurting now naturally he's not going to do that the wealth will be redistributed into
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:05.640]  the pockets of soros and rockerfeller and rohattan and ruben and goldman fact that's going to be the
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:11.320]  reality but i would not in a million years say that there's half of the american people who
[3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:16.760]  are in the lemming category of the of the kool-aid uh... obama drinkers i'd say it's more like ten
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:21.720]  or fifteen percent there is a special case of the black community where you can understand
[3:40:21.720 --> 3:40:27.320]  the mechanisms that were involved uh... it's unfortunate right they they was a demagogic
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:33.320]  ploy aimed at them as well some of them have succumbed not all there are very important black
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:39.160]  voices there's uh... glenn ford who's talked about obama as the war hole there were authoritative
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:45.160]  there's people like kitty owado at the lib network in uh... in los angeles who's been very very
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:51.320]  critical and and a number of others but uh... i would not be pessimistic in other words
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:55.880]  the the fifty percent that seem to support obama are the ones who have projected
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:41:01.240]  their wishes onto this blank slate as soon as he gets into office he's going to start losing
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:06.360]  large chunks both on his left and on his right because of the things that he's going to do
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:12.760]  i uh... i hope you're right i just look back to clinton and that we gave him uh... you know
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:17.800]  quite a few years of uh... free reign for any kind of clinton listen i don't know where you get this
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:23.080]  clinton the only thing we can say about clinton is that he was better than bush the elder
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:27.480]  better than dull and better than bush the younger and the idea that clinton was somehow the end of
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:33.080]  the world is i find fantastic this is where i part company with the right wing uh...
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:39.640]  brand of thinking like clinton was uh... was if anything a relative respite compared to
[3:41:39.640 --> 3:41:45.880]  what had come before the alternative with dull and then uh... the bush regime anyway
[3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:50.840]  obama is you forget that there's just no comparison between clinton and obama you can
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:55.000]  compare obama to carter but then as soon as you've said carter you've got to say yes
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:00.440]  like carter but a hundred or a thousand times worse that's your real uh... connection
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:07.080]  uh... obama in some ways is is the most corrupt candidate since aron burr you've got to go way
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:12.040]  back to get something comparable to obama last comment if you like
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:18.520]  um... i just yeah i'll disagree with you on that uh... i think he matter that these guys are all
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:24.280]  the same boat um... you know just because one's one's willing one or one's willing the other
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:27.960]  doesn't really matter i have a different here's the difference thank you for your call we gotta
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:34.680]  push on but let me just this comment in transition the big differences who has a fascist mass
[3:42:34.680 --> 3:42:40.680]  movement or who had something that looks like a fascist mass movement clinton never had this
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:46.760]  nor did bush the elder nor did bush the younger mccain had no movement that there was no group
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:52.280]  in the population that was fanatically hysterically devoted to the personality cult of mccain that
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:58.040]  is what made mccain more attractive it made him a lesser evil because he was quite frankly weaker
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:02.760]  he didn't have the two hundred thousand german lemmings at the brandenburg gate he could not
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:07.800]  inflame africa to kick out the chinese couldn't do any of that as an imperialist as a strike
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:12.920]  breaker as an austerity enforcer mccain was just weaker up and down the line we would have been
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:19.000]  better off with mccain no matter what how evil his subjective intentions might have been and now
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:25.320]  you're going to see what it's like when you get the power of the executive combined with this
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:31.800]  aspect of the fascist mass movement now let me stress it's a theatrical movement it's not a
[3:43:31.800 --> 3:43:38.440]  real movement it's not you know like some uh... you know worker-based uh... left-wing party
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:43.720]  that can put in a real people into the streets in a serious way it's the sort of uh... well the
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:50.040]  stuff you saw on tv last night in grand park but that's enough to allow the media to go to work
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:55.800]  and use that for mass brainwashing purposes so that's the problem we face how about john and
[3:43:55.800 --> 3:44:02.920]  ohio you still with us john yes i am uh... let's try thank you say some wonderful things but i do
[3:44:02.920 --> 3:44:07.720]  have some differences uh... i do believe that that we can't pander to some of these right wing
[3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:14.840]  attitudes i think the best way of exposing and attacking obama's uh... false face is to link him
[3:44:14.840 --> 3:44:20.840]  with exactly the policies of the people who who uh... voted for him out of hatred for the bush
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:27.240]  uh... cheney team showing on every issue of from up the police state to the wars that he's
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:33.480]  every bit as much uh... a reactionary war monger as these uh... gangsters are and and he's going
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:39.400]  to be more slick and if we if we link him to the fact that uh... the uh... project for new american
[3:44:39.400 --> 3:44:44.360]  century had not only those uh... middle east countries as their targets to dominate the world
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:50.360]  but only as a first step as a uh... as a lever against uh... china and russia this was their
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:56.360]  plan of the of the peanut neocons and this is uh... now being carried out in its second phase
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:03.880]  by obama and i think if we show that uh... his uh... war mongering is uh... as you very uh...
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:09.560]  eloquently do is even more dangerous because it's simply the extension of the bush uh...
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:16.120]  cheney uh... operation and if we constantly link uh... him to the people who voted for him because
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:21.480]  of hatred for a bush and cheney i think that's that's a good uh... approach and i also resent
[3:45:21.480 --> 3:45:26.440]  this uh... idea that uh... uh... you know uh... pandering to some of these right wing attitudes
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:31.000]  like uh... uh... jurom course the bottom feeders like that because i think uh...
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:35.880]  those people are exactly uh... perpetrating the kinds of uh... attitudes the kind of
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:43.400]  hysteria against uh... uh... iraq iran uh... uh... pakistan afghanistan russia and china
[3:45:43.400 --> 3:45:49.160]  we can't deal with these people because they are uh... using their attacks of uh... obama
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:54.600]  in an exactly inverted way uh... calling him in ridiculously associate socialist detest
[3:45:55.160 --> 3:45:59.080]  detest obama's policies that w s w s dot org and others
[3:45:59.080 --> 3:46:02.120]  have been pointing out constantly that he's just the new face
[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:07.000]  and that he is the man of the uh... financial elite the they've been quoted for instance the
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:12.040]  elite economist and financial times of london saying that everybody should vote for obama
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:16.200]  because he will put a uh... a better face a more effective face
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:21.000]  on the policies of the elite so i think uh... you know we've got to constantly
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:27.320]  a link uh... obama with uh... the uh... the hated bush and cheney uh... policies
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:30.840]  and i think this is the best way to go and uh... uh...
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:36.360]  i i just feel that uh... any uh... uh... any uh... pandering uh... to some of these
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:40.520]  right wingers is actually playing into their hands no pandering here john thank you for

[3:47:04.840 --> 3:47:09.160]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[3:47:09.160 --> 3:47:13.960]  water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into

[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:08.280]  we're entering a holiday season never before seen in america we're thankful for the warning given by
[3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:14.200]  members of mr obama's campaign team of the coming international incident which will force unpopular
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:19.560]  decisions without this warning many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:24.680]  wasted on christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available is in a government
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:30.360]  breadline when the president is faced with the expected national security incident the in-place
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:35.640]  patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food those of us who are able
[3:49:35.640 --> 3:49:40.840]  to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food this will free up the relief organizations to
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:47.160]  give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare the greatest gift this christmas is life

[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:09.480]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[3:50:09.480 --> 3:50:16.520]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network this is actually a webster talk they're feeling in this
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:23.880]  afternoon for alex uh... from the uh... suburbs of washington dc um... in answer to the last
[3:50:23.880 --> 3:50:28.760]  caller i have to defend coursey uh... naturally coursey stuff about iran i wouldn't agree with
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:35.000]  but coursey's book on obama performed an important public service it has limits that i would regard
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:42.680]  as uh... the ideology i would say the way to deal with obama is to tell the truth it's um unfortunately
[3:50:42.680 --> 3:50:50.040]  the case that his uh... his ideological matrix is that of neo-fascism and this is true and it's
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:54.440]  also better politics it would have served uh... the republicans better but they
[3:50:54.440 --> 3:51:00.440]  obviously were just incapable of of doing this uh... but within the limits of what he did coursey
[3:51:00.440 --> 3:51:06.200]  he performed an important public service and of course obama is an exponent not just of escalated
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:11.880]  wars in afghanistan sudan and vis-a-vis russia china but by voting for the
[3:51:11.880 --> 3:51:18.200]  faiza uh... law he gave this retroactive immunity to the telecoms but we've got three
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:22.440]  callers left let's give each caller thirty seconds you talk thirty seconds i'll try to answer you
[3:51:22.440 --> 3:51:26.840]  in thirty and we'll get all three and let's go to darrell in hawaii you got half a minute
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:32.120]  okay let's go to dawn in new york city
[3:51:32.920 --> 3:51:39.000]  hello i just want to ask a quick question how would uh... how would obama get uh...
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:42.040]  how would he what would he use to play against our second amendment rights
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:47.400]  and how would he do this like what laws would he pass and stuff like that
[3:51:47.400 --> 3:51:49.320]  what are we talking about gun gun control
[3:51:49.880 --> 3:51:53.800]  yes obama's plan for gun control how he comes out of the good thing called the joys
[3:51:53.800 --> 3:51:58.200]  uh... the joys foundation and the joys foundation is one of the ones that uh...
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:04.120]  it represents the ruling class commitment to gun control uh... as a uh... blanket
[3:52:04.120 --> 3:52:06.200]  uh... federal regulation and uh...
[3:52:06.920 --> 3:52:11.400]  want to go to you want to see what obama is going to do don't listen to the words coming out of
[3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:16.120]  obama's mouth but go to the website of the joys foundation and look at the kind of stuff that
[3:52:16.120 --> 3:52:20.840]  they've been doing uh... probably on the joys foundation website you can figure out who
[3:52:20.840 --> 3:52:27.320]  obama's principal advisers in areas of gun control uh... it's always better to listen to the advisers
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:32.280]  if you listen to obama you get rhetoric if you listen to the advisers they'll tell you what he's
[3:52:32.280 --> 3:52:38.120]  going to do like brzezinski who says it's time to get tough with russia so that i think would be the
[3:52:38.120 --> 3:52:42.680]  guide how about uh... we have a call i think ronnie in texas
[3:52:42.680 --> 3:52:48.840]  ronnie in texas
[3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:51.400]  i ran in uh... two thousand
[3:52:51.400 --> 3:52:55.720]  to defeat your lapdog loy dogged but uh...
[3:52:55.720 --> 3:53:00.040]  you were challenging us to participate and i'm proud to do so but
[3:53:00.040 --> 3:53:04.200]  anyway clinton and i disagree with you i think clinton is still
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:10.520]  an evil traitorous stooge for zionism and really only to be taught by the cheney bush regime and
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:17.800]  and look out for our vice president for all these what as one of our callers was saying
[3:53:17.800 --> 3:53:23.240]  you you cannot uh... essentially start saying i won't uh... cooperate with corcy because of
[3:53:23.240 --> 3:53:29.640]  his biography or this or that uh... in the case of these politicians you're you're playing one
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:34.760]  against another in other words think of it as using an instrument uh... the ambition and the
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:41.960]  hatred felt by bill and hillary against obama might be an asset don't rule it out that's all i'm saying
[3:53:41.960 --> 3:53:46.920]  okay all right i understand you but i i was just also gonna say that joe bill de berger biden
[3:53:47.720 --> 3:53:53.080]  is really the one the control agent he keeps obama in line obama doesn't there's not a chance
[3:53:53.080 --> 3:53:58.120]  we're gonna get anything good about obama because like i said joe biden who's been a bill de berger
[3:53:58.120 --> 3:54:04.360]  for literally decades quite right and so if people would learn about that and i google bill
[3:54:04.360 --> 3:54:09.480]  de berger you'd be uh... amazed in the okay well that's what obama is i'm afraid we run out of time
[3:54:09.480 --> 3:54:15.640]  thank you ronnie it's the bill de berger primateral ran corporation regime uh... joe biden of course
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:23.080]  from the pna uh... credit card gouging remember obama the postmodern coup here at info wars and
[3:54:23.640 --> 3:54:28.840]  obama the unauthorized biography at amazon dot com and i thank alex for letting me
[3:54:28.840 --> 3:54:36.200]  sit in for him this afternoon and remember more than ever get active or get radioactive
