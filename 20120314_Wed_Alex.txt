[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.280 --> 00:40.840]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:44.280 --> 01:08.040]  Well I won't back down no I won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won't back down
[01:08.040 --> 01:22.080]  no I'll stand my ground won't be turned around and I'll keep this world from dragging me down
[01:22.080 --> 01:50.800]  I'm gonna stand my ground and I won't back down hey baby there ain't no easy way I'm gonna stand my ground and I won't back down
[01:50.800 --> 02:12.880]  well I know what's right I got just one line in a world that keeps on pushing me around but I'll stand my ground and I won't back down
[02:12.880 --> 02:31.840]  hey baby there ain't no easy way I'm gonna stand my ground and I won't back down
[02:31.840 --> 02:58.640]  well we've got another super packed transmission lined up for you today we have a top professor joining us who is amongst many an academia warning of the fact that it is a probability that artificial intelligence from machines will dominate our society and will end up
[02:58.640 --> 03:24.640]  enslaving humanity it is a hundred percent certainty that the global technocratic engineers are attempting to establish a technocracy in their own words over this using technology to track trace and control everything we're doing and that by building that system they'll probably fall into the pit that they've dug for us so that is coming up here was one
[03:24.640 --> 03:50.640]  of the articles in MSNBC last week control dangerous AI before it controls us experts sets and it's that professor that will be joining us good job of the crew getting them lined up for the show one of his papers is leak proofing the singularity artificial intelligence confinement problem
[03:50.640 --> 04:14.640]  we had all the AI and a lot of this stuff is already artificial intelligence to a certain degree it's question is it's self aware doesn't matter if a drone's launched and goes around killing certain targets making its own decisions that's been going on for 20 years they just now announced it last year to the slaves it is autonomous it is artificial intelligence flying around killing people on its own under its own
[04:14.640 --> 04:30.640]  programming it's been programmed but it's like a wind up toy you you turn it loose and so the very architecture of this system is a skynet type scenario where it launches a big attack on humanity so this is an area I'm obviously very concerned with I hope you're concerned with it
[04:30.640 --> 04:51.640]  we'll be breaking that down on the other side of this quick break and then I told you it was going to happen but I didn't know it was going to happen this quick I'm just been proven absolutely correct yet again not really hard to do the Congress is moving for a full African invasion continent wide and

[08:27.640 --> 08:45.640]  as we kick off this worldwide transmission against tyranny it is the 14th day of March 2012 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours
[08:45.640 --> 09:00.640]  and we do have a professor and expert in artificial intelligence who's warning the public that a technocratic systems being built that will basically give rise to a computer artificially intelligent dictatorship
[09:00.640 --> 09:19.640]  and he will be joining us coming up in the second hour also we may have a surprise guest in the third hour or I may just do it in the TV studio that the interview tonight I'm not sure exactly which is going to happen but it's of Dave Mustaine level
[09:19.640 --> 09:38.640]  and by the way the Dave Mustaine interview that we shot last week is going to air tomorrow night in place of info wars nightly news and I'm very glad that info wars nightly news is so popular I've had quite a few complaints pouring in from prisonplanet.tv viewers
[09:38.640 --> 09:57.640]  that hey Alex we want fresh news shows every night at seven you know I plan to do the news for a few months straight beta testing I said this was beta because you know prisonplanet.tv has all of my films now nine years of material coming up April 12 when we launched it
[09:57.640 --> 10:20.640]  all those years ago I guess nine years ago and we are about to launch a new contest that'll be $5,000 for male reporters $5,000 for female reporters and then you get a shot at being an info wars reporter and anchor
[10:20.640 --> 10:38.640]  and reaching an audience of three million people a day so I meant to launch this three four months ago and I'm so busy and my skeleton crew is so busy just trying to get the nightly news on every night and doing investigative reports and going out on the street
[10:38.640 --> 10:53.640]  we've only got a team of like five people we've got to hire three or four more people and we've got to put in a bunch of new upgrades and equipment we've got a lot of stuff a lot of graphics we're going through upgrading things so I'll tell you now
[10:53.640 --> 11:06.640]  I meant to go two or three months straight and then have like a week or two hiatus as I announced eight months ago and I just went eight months and never stopped never got off the treadmill so we're going to go again for another week and a half with a Dave Mustaine
[11:06.640 --> 11:27.640]  exclusive interview tomorrow my two hour speech in Orlando next week some other special reports some nights it'll be new stuff but a few nights were not because I have to drop some things because I can't cut a promo video about the contest for hiring reporters
[11:27.640 --> 11:47.640]  if I'm busy trying to do the nightly news or my crew is I can't cut a new promo video for prison planet dog TV I can't go over all the resumes we've already got for video editors writers researchers investigative reporters when we've got hundreds of them already that I am literally
[11:47.640 --> 12:03.640]  in an ocean of and so we've had incredible success and I appreciate your support but I will probably in four or five months again after these reporters are hired trained in place the new equipment sin we have the new sharing upload system to deliver the show to television
[12:03.640 --> 12:21.640]  see another thing is the show is already getting picked up by different cable systems broadcast TV big national British basic cable does a two hour compilation I've got to create a list of the stations were already on I mean we're already getting on in Europe and England and areas of the US without even trying
[12:21.640 --> 12:36.640]  you know we just get emailed by cable system hey can we pick the show up I'm like yeah boom hit it I mean there's just there's so much going on around here that I've got to jump off the treadmill for five seconds just just so I can try to let the dust halfway
[12:36.640 --> 12:56.640]  settle and in between that I've got 50 other irons in the fire and big breaking news and all this coming on and so I did make the announcement on Monday that we were going to have you know two week hiatus with some new shows and special events
[12:56.640 --> 13:12.640]  for viewers but I'm really heartened by folks saying hey we want the news we're addicted to this you know there are about 50,000 people a night which is tiny compared to the radio audience that tune into prison planet dot TV throughout the first airing of the show at seven central
[13:12.640 --> 13:28.640]  and then the re streaming of it until the next day and then the archiving of it and of course we do allow each membership is really six memberships each membership with the same username and passcode that you create
[13:28.640 --> 13:42.640]  we were six people can be logged in simultaneously so it's really six memberships for 15 cents a day and I am glad that people are sharing their memberships we've got a lot better servers now we're almost never has problems
[13:42.640 --> 13:59.640]  streaming there's been a lot going into this because we're doing it from the ground floor up we never had the money to hire big consultants and big companies or try to have a big official studio put in I could have never built this we've done it from the ground up on a shoestring budget
[13:59.640 --> 14:15.640]  and now we're getting to really try to go to the next level and bloom but it takes a lot and we couldn't have done it without you and then it looks like for the nightly news we're going to have another big interview for you next week
[14:15.640 --> 14:31.640]  because I went to dinner with a well-known individual who's shown that they're very awake to what's going on in the world and invited him to come in and they're like well I'm not sure you know I don't know how much I'll end up saying
[14:31.640 --> 14:53.640]  I said okay whatever you want to do and they contacted me this morning I need to get back in touch with them they want to come in so that's another big interview we've just got a lot going on here and I need to get the new people hired trained in place so that we've got enough people to basically hit the balls that are coming at us
[14:53.640 --> 15:12.640]  it's kind of like I got four or five guys lined up with their baseball bats and there's 20 machine pitchers out there pitching machines shooting fastballs at us
[15:12.640 --> 15:23.640]  and we're hitting a lot of home runs here but I realize I need to get more people out front on my team so they can really start knocking home runs and try to hit every one of those balls
[15:23.640 --> 15:34.640]  I mean I need to hire three or four people just to go through the email every day don't have the money I need to hire people just to moderate the comments of the message boards because you can get sued all day for that stuff
[15:34.640 --> 15:44.640]  people posting copyright stuff people posting phone numbers people saying go kill this person you know I've got to get more than just part time moderators in there
[15:44.640 --> 15:56.640]  there's just I'm finally getting ready to launch the social network after you know years of being on the treadmill and just I'm always running so fast on the treadmill here with the syndicated radio show and the rest of it
[15:56.640 --> 16:07.640]  the radio show reaches around 3 million people a day 15 million a week conservatively the nightly news only reaches about 50,000 a day that are watching on prisonplanet.tv
[16:07.640 --> 16:21.640]  but then it gets posted to our YouTube channel and hundreds of others and a conservative estimate is the nightly news gets watched by about 2 million people a week just on YouTube and a few other video systems
[16:21.640 --> 16:34.640]  like I said it's on the basic cable England wide through an organization group that has a channel that has a couple hundred thousand viewers we've looked at the ratings when the show airs every what Sunday evening
[16:34.640 --> 16:46.640]  and there's all sorts of TV stations around the country picking it up and cable systems I mean it's crazy what's happening so when we finally put out a honed one hour show this is all just been beta testing right now
[16:46.640 --> 16:59.640]  when we finally do put this out and and to be able to put out the official show quicker there may be a few times in the next six months where I have to get pulling for a pit stop and get new tires new gas in the engine
[16:59.640 --> 17:12.640]  you know some oil shot into the engine so that I can really then race back out there on the track and go 300 and defeat the globalist and we're doing it all together
[17:12.640 --> 17:29.640]  okay there's some basic program notes for you today when we come back I'm very disgusted by this I am basically distraught over this subject again we've been proven absolutely devastatingly accurate
[17:29.640 --> 17:45.640]  and you would think that I'd be happy about that no no it only makes me sad for basic humankind how gullible we become how one dimensional the general public has become either you're waking up and becoming enlightened or you're getting more into a trance
[17:45.640 --> 18:01.640]  we're in a narcoleptic state that is the best way to describe it last night I was sitting there for like 10 minutes having dinner with a very interesting individual and I was trying to describe they're in a trance they're under a spell it's like they're not awake the brainwaves
[18:01.640 --> 18:24.640]  he goes yeah no it's an artificially induced narcoleptic state and that's what it is and I'm here to try to get people out of their narcoleptic state sure I'm abrasive I'm obnoxious I'm all of those things but you know what no one has been as effective as I have with my crew and you supporting us
[18:24.640 --> 18:34.640]  and so anytime I get down on my shelf because believe me I'm my worst critic I realize hey you're doing the best job you can so stop getting down on yourself
[18:34.640 --> 18:43.640]  because believe me my biggest hurdle is a shelf loathing that I'm not doing enough and then I'm not fighting hard enough
[18:43.640 --> 18:54.640]  that's why people call in and say how great I am or people on the street tell me how great I am it's like punching me in the stomach and I don't know how to explain it because I feel like I'm doing the bare minimum
[18:54.640 --> 19:05.640]  I should be doing I don't know how to it's just I just I just have a responsibility and I don't understand how other people don't have a feeling of responsibility to fight these murdering scum
[19:05.640 --> 19:18.640]  it's not I'm not a hero I'm not a good guy I'm none of those things it's basic survival ladies and gentlemen we've got to get past this idea that it's exceptional to fight evil
[19:18.640 --> 19:30.640]  we have evil running wild all over us because we believe fighting evil is exceptional fighting evil is the bare minimum resistance to tyrants is obedience to God
[19:30.640 --> 19:38.640]  and my whole body my whole spirit is do more because I understand the threat
[19:38.640 --> 19:45.640]  now I told you it was coming the Congress is moving for an African-wide invasion their words not mine
[19:45.640 --> 19:53.640]  with a complete blank check for Scorched Earth everywhere the UN is involved in genocide all over Africa from Uganda to Ivory Coast right now
[19:53.640 --> 20:00.640]  Angelina Jolie has gone to the world court to basically call for global government everything I said is now about to expand
[20:00.640 --> 20:07.640]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle

[24:24.640 --> 24:34.640]  I can see a day coming when even having your own home garden is going to be against the law
[24:34.640 --> 24:44.640]  by the way the Secretary of Defense was arriving in Afghanistan and a big car bomb went off
[24:44.640 --> 24:50.640]  who knows if that's them bombing themselves to try to you know make the war look legitimate and
[24:50.640 --> 24:58.640]  you had this military man reportedly go in and now kill 18 people at like 3 a.m. in Afghanistan
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.640]  inside their houses women and children and the media is like why would a soldier do that
[25:03.640 --> 25:11.640]  I don't know you serve five six tours one out of a hundred sometimes more are going to go crazy
[25:11.640 --> 25:18.640]  and they're going to go crazy on top the UT Tower they're going to go crazy in your house
[25:18.640 --> 25:23.640]  and when it happens they're going to demonize 99% of the veterans that aren't like that
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.640]  but the system knows that by overworking the troops putting them in immoral combat
[25:28.640 --> 25:36.640]  they know back to World War one they're going to get these type of mass murder events
[25:36.640 --> 25:40.640]  and then they're going to use it to take the rights of all veterans across the board
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.640]  and make you quote the number one enemy of Homeland Security the number one threat
[25:44.640 --> 25:53.640]  which of course you're not but in it is the kernel of truth that they will end up using
[25:53.640 --> 26:00.640]  but it is scary when some crazed veteran cop pulls you over and is in some type of murderous rage
[26:00.640 --> 26:07.640]  and I've seen the videos online of it for no reason and just starts beating people up or shoots them
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.640]  you know sometimes you turn somebody into a killing machine they don't know how to turn it off
[26:13.640 --> 26:16.640]  I mean I don't think of myself as the toughest baddest guy on the block
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.640]  but my problem is when people start fights with me my problem is I want to get in a fight
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.640]  and I'm older and realize that's weakness so I know I've learned how to control myself
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.640]  but I can't imagine if I'd been trained to be a soldier admitted in five six tours of combat
[26:31.640 --> 26:34.640]  and was just used to killing people all the time what that would be like
[26:34.640 --> 26:43.640]  shooting somebody's like punching somebody in the nose when you've done it that long from veterans I've talked to
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.640]  alright I've already digressed
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.640]  let me do this I'm gonna get into the African invasion that's been announced after this short segment
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.640]  when we start the next long segment
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.640]  but I look at this constellation of news here in front of me
[26:59.640 --> 27:07.640]  why are millions of Americans preparing for doomsday big article from the economic collapse blog that's up on info wars.com
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.640]  there's another big survey out doomsday survey 51% of Americans believe a financial collapse is imminent
[27:13.640 --> 27:18.640]  85% say country is overwhelmingly under prepared
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.640]  meanwhile the feds are building bunkers and armoring their facilities and hoarding food and water and weapons everywhere
[27:25.640 --> 27:34.640]  and saying we're bad if we do it they're running around like an ant hill that's been disturbed getting ready for something
[27:34.640 --> 27:41.640]  and I've looked at the math it is a mathematical certainty on the course that we're on by design
[27:41.640 --> 27:47.640]  we are going to continue to slide incrementally into a deeper and deeper depression
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.640]  and all the numbers are out there 60 minutes even a year and a half ago at a piece admitting we were in a depression
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.640]  and unemployment was 22% and 33% in California it's much worse than that now
[27:57.640 --> 28:05.640]  inflations over 10% it's not three or four percent like they say you know that I know that everything costs more
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.640]  and Americans there's a certain point Joseph Goebbels wrote about this I've read a lot of his writings
[28:11.640 --> 28:17.640]  and a lot of his work got picked up at least a lot of work from Eber Bernays
[28:17.640 --> 28:26.640]  who's big propagandist for the Department of War here in the US wrote the book called propaganda but actually wrote the book on propaganda
[28:26.640 --> 28:33.640]  and Goebbels said hey at a certain point we've got to start being honest with the Germans this is once World War II was going
[28:33.640 --> 28:37.640]  because if we're telling them we're winning all the battles and we're not we lose all credibility
[28:37.640 --> 28:43.640]  we've got to start being more honest that's kind of like Baghdad Bob as explosions are going off five miles behind him
[28:43.640 --> 28:51.640]  you can see him and hear him he's going there are no Americans pigs here they are they have been kicked out of Iraq completely
[28:51.640 --> 29:00.640]  and you know you see explosions behind him you hear jets flying over and that's what the New World Order is like
[29:00.640 --> 29:08.640]  they're like Baghdad Bob we ought to do a news piece on that the American pigs are not even in Iraq they have all been defeated
[29:08.640 --> 29:16.640]  same thing there's no depression everything's fine we're not in a police state the TSA is not abusing you sticking their hands in your pants
[29:16.640 --> 29:23.640]  oh yeah everybody's real healthy sure cancers up a few thousand percentage points
[29:23.640 --> 29:33.640]  so people are not buying what the government says anymore or the mainstream media the problem is just because they don't buy what they're being told
[29:33.640 --> 29:41.640]  they still don't know what's going on I mean if the public knew what I know what you know if they really knew how deep the rabbit hole went
[29:41.640 --> 29:49.640]  which is bottomless then there'd be a whole another situation we'll be back with a big news
[29:49.640 --> 29:59.640]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:59.640 --> 30:07.640]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving
[30:07.640 --> 30:15.640]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[30:15.640 --> 30:25.640]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[30:25.640 --> 30:31.640]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity

[31:19.640 --> 31:28.640]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[31:28.640 --> 31:35.640]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[31:35.640 --> 31:44.640]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[33:02.640 --> 33:16.640]  oh you have found it
[33:16.640 --> 33:39.640]  the front lines of the info war I'm Alex Jones your host attempting in my own little way to resist tyranny I know the power of humanity under the power of the human spirit and all you need to do is to stop second guessing yourself like I know I've done and just take action
[33:39.640 --> 33:57.640]  and commit to the fight for liberty and that will build a better world but deciding that we can't stop corruption and also not researching propaganda but just accepting it on the surface is the mother of all of our problems
[33:57.640 --> 34:20.640]  all right I want to be clear here I've done deep research on Africa I've done deep research on the all encompassing geopolitical tectonic shifts that have taken place in the last few centuries
[34:20.640 --> 34:38.640]  and undoubtedly there is a global proxy war going on in Asia the Middle East Central Asia of course Eastern Europe Africa Latin America
[34:38.640 --> 34:54.640]  there are mercenaries the bankers column jackals all over the world assassinating and killing people 24 seven that won't give into the big six megabanks and their fractional reserve banking derivatives fraud machine
[34:54.640 --> 35:21.640]  and it's very frustrating to see the 5% of people and that's about what they were on the videos I shot over the weekend that have had together over a million views on YouTube alone where I point out that a Africa wide invasion is ongoing and that massive escalations in it is imminent
[35:21.640 --> 35:43.640]  and I laid out in those videos exactly what would happen exactly what would be pushed and I called Angelina Joe Lee out as a war criminal who should be arrested the problem is the UN does that war criminal arresting and they are the biggest war criminals
[35:43.640 --> 36:01.640]  of course the group committing the most murder the group raping and torturing and killing and lining people up and shooting them and burning down farms and taking property and injecting people with HIV and sterile and everything else you can imagine and slaughtering
[36:01.640 --> 36:21.640]  tens of thousands and Ivory Coast just months ago openly and then blowing up the Capitol building and killing the leaders and using rebels to take over it's the UN death on wheels and to see the open
[36:21.640 --> 36:46.640]  Psyop to have the knowledge that's not even hidden and to watch Angelina Joe Lee who and I've got Hollywood sources she is a total sociopath and all she cares about is being president of the United States someday or a major
[36:46.640 --> 37:08.640]  functionary in the UN and endless photo ops with her feeding children just a publicity whore of the greatest magnitude who promotes you can look it up fact guys just type in Angelina Joe Lee praises Libyan rebels and it'll show her with the Al Qaeda people
[37:08.640 --> 37:27.640]  she went to Tunisia to foment invasion and foment the attacks before it even began and then once it began and she's fomenting invasion of Syria and she's fomenting Iran attack and she's fomenting giant invasions of Africa the Congo not just Uganda
[37:27.640 --> 37:42.640]  and I know who she is and I know what she's doing and then I gotta see the media oh she's a wonderful humanitarian
[37:42.640 --> 38:01.640]  it is so disgusting see on the surface they're telling you oh my gosh she loves you the UN loves you they want to help feed starving children when it's the UN's official policy to forcibly reduce population and to create starvation
[38:01.640 --> 38:21.640]  war and to use quote food as a weapon I can tell you how many UN food conferences they've said that how to shut off food how to starve people while simultaneously raising money off of trendies and well meaning idiots and trusting
[38:21.640 --> 38:34.640]  people in the west little kids out out front shopping malls and at church with their little cans for UNICEF getting money and buy our clothes and it gives money to UNICEF
[38:34.640 --> 38:46.640]  I mean I go and look at the organic food in our pantry and a bunch of it's got little you know little messages about oh this gives money to the UN this gives money to that group and then I go look up the group and it's some horrible
[38:46.640 --> 38:55.640]  front for eugenics but again they attach themselves to everything good you want organic food well part of the money goes to the UN
[38:55.640 --> 39:08.640]  while they go and pitch GMO forcefully on Latin America Asia and Africa and say if you want your aid money you've got to not plant your regular crops you've got to plant this
[39:08.640 --> 39:17.640]  I remember people thought I was lying about this when they looked it up in the aid packages to Iraq after the west destroyed the country and killed over a million people
[39:17.640 --> 39:32.640]  conservatively the British Medical Journal even broke those numbers down that was just a few years into the war they announced that they were forcing them to not be allowed to buy organic seeds you had to buy
[39:32.640 --> 39:49.640]  Monsanto and Archer Daniels Medlin and a few others where you've got to get the seeds for them every year killing five to six thousand years of those people keeping those incredible varieties of seeds that are better than anything you could ever imagine in a store
[39:49.640 --> 40:08.640]  giant tangerines, giant oranges, giant dates, giant olives on record this was all in the news they had engineering teams all over the Tiger Shoe Fridays for now eight years bulldozing systematically everything
[40:08.640 --> 40:21.640]  and I've talked to troops who were like yeah I was in basic training heard your show thought you were a liar I had to actually go run security while they cut down every tree and the people would sit there crying going
[40:21.640 --> 40:42.640]  my great great grandfather said that tree was there with his great great grandfathers that's where we got our olives from we're going to die now we're going to starve to death like well snipers could hide in these they bulldozed over 90% you can go look this up of all of their trees
[40:42.640 --> 40:57.640]  that you live off of now that's what America now stands for that's what the UN stands for that's what the bankers that run our country do
[40:57.640 --> 41:12.640]  that's what they're doing in Africa and that's why I get mad at people like Angelina Jolie because I could sit there and say arrest Ban Ki-moon all day which I've done I could say arrest Coffee Annan who got caught committing a bunch of crimes and stealing aid that was supposed to go starving people I can call for arrest of UN soldiers caught raping
[41:12.640 --> 41:24.640]  and kidnapping women and children everywhere they go a trail of destruction but no one really knows them or cares show when I do years of research on Angelina Jolie never talking about her
[41:24.640 --> 41:34.640]  I happen to know she's seen my films I happen to know they know who I am I happen to know that they know about the new world order and what did they do they ran off to be part of it
[41:34.640 --> 41:50.640]  I happen to know that Angelina Jolie knows exactly what she's doing so I don't just take some Hollywood star that supports the UN or goes in place for some UN event because they mean well like sting or something I don't have proof he's probably just stupid
[41:50.640 --> 42:08.640]  I know folks that know him as well he really believes it but somebody like Jolie where they consciously are globalist consciously are war mongers consciously push for all these wars and are part of war propaganda
[42:08.640 --> 42:23.640]  and once a top post already has a high level envoy post not just a spokesman post in refugee matters and does photo ops constantly she if she's calling for Joseph Coney a nobody hadn't been seen in five and a half six years
[42:23.640 --> 42:30.640]  all the Ugandans are on record going who is this guy he he's a tiny warlord of dozens in our country alone
[42:30.640 --> 42:40.640]  I told you now now here's the next big issue and here's the breaking news I told you and it wasn't hard this is what's frustrating
[42:40.640 --> 42:53.640]  it wasn't hard when I saw the Coney movie last week and I saw Bill Gates involved in the State Department connections funding it and I saw in their promo videos them talking to people like they were children
[42:53.640 --> 43:03.640]  I mean I have videos of these like the video that you guys have it where the worst one I saw is where they're promoting have 3000 screenings
[43:03.640 --> 43:16.640]  and the guys hopping around like it's Sesame Street going hi everybody we're gonna get the Batman Coney now talking to college students like their children and that's what trendies are like
[43:16.640 --> 43:31.640]  it's a certain metrosexual weird male who acts like a five-year-old and then always supports pure evil and they hop around on the screen we'll find it and play it after the next segment
[43:31.640 --> 43:42.640]  I sent it to you yesterday they hop around on screen and do all of this and have all these slick graphics we're gonna get Coney we're gonna invade we're gonna show him
[43:42.640 --> 43:50.640]  and I told everybody I said you watch they're gonna have a bunch of these kangaroo ICC court hearings they've been having they're gonna have those come to fruition the next few weeks
[43:50.640 --> 44:02.640]  it's to promote global government the idea of the UN arresting you anywhere anytime for thought crime and they're gonna have NATO and US resolutions to invade all of Africa through African
[44:02.640 --> 44:12.640]  that is already in place after calm just like they have North American military system North calm and sent calm and South calm and all of it
[44:12.640 --> 44:21.640]  and that they are gonna start going in with the dictators like the dictator of Uganda who's been involved killing millions and they're gonna start forcing everybody off their land it's already going on
[44:21.640 --> 44:30.640]  I mean it's already admitted the UN is in Uganda murdering people mercenaries have license to kill and just go in and burn villages and shoot everyone
[44:30.640 --> 44:44.640]  it's on record and she's not talking about that she's saying go in with more force and use that as the cover and say that an Africa wide invasion for natural resources
[44:44.640 --> 44:58.640]  is humanitarian it is beyond disgusting it is beyond evil it is beyond filthy
[44:58.640 --> 45:08.640]  and less than a week after I start covering that here is CBS News by the way do we have the Angelina Jolie clip do we have that one
[45:08.640 --> 45:19.640]  we have the Coney thing dancing around about the screenings isn't yesterday it was on my list yesterday we don't need to re grab it we had it yesterday
[45:19.640 --> 45:30.640]  Joseph Coney resolution introduced in the House House lawmakers Tuesday introduced a resolution supporting efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army
[45:30.640 --> 45:41.640]  now listen hoping to build momentum on created by the arrival of YouTube video spotlighting the atrocities of the LRC leader Joseph Coney so it's a branding
[45:41.640 --> 45:49.640]  they say they literally say here is the new villain the most dumb down propaganda he's like Hitler and bin Laden actually said that all of the news in the video
[45:49.640 --> 45:56.640]  we've got to get him he's hurting children no one seen him in five and a half years he's a perfect boogeyman that could never be caught
[45:56.640 --> 46:00.640]  you know why are they going to kill you in North Africa Coney why are they going to kill you in South Africa Coney
[46:00.640 --> 46:05.640]  why are they going to kill you on the Ivory Coast Coney why is the UN here slaughtering you Coney
[46:05.640 --> 46:16.640]  you know you know in a jungle area not seen for five and a half six years most people think he's dead why is listen to resolution you can link through and read it
[46:16.640 --> 46:30.640]  the resolution introduced by representatives Jim McGovern Democrat of Mass in Ed Roy's Republic of California calls for among other things expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians
[46:30.640 --> 46:41.640]  did you hear that expanding the number of regional forces in Africa that's US bases that are being being built all over the heart is Uganda
[46:41.640 --> 46:54.640]  why is the US going to send not just a few hundred but a few thousand troops now oh to protect people all over Africa and you go read the resolution it is a full invasion of every stinking country
[46:54.640 --> 47:09.640]  unbelievable for a guy who we don't even know he's alive with the UN on record lining people up and mowing them down or funding groups to go kill them and funding dictators to engage in mega death
[47:09.640 --> 47:19.640]  and then now you want to know why Alex why are you so mad only about five percent you can see that in the likes and dislikes you know six thousand likes three hundred dislikes or whatever on a video
[47:19.640 --> 47:29.640]  that's got six hundred thousand views one version but to the five percent they're like I'm going to get you I see when public you're dead Jones you're with Coney
[47:29.640 --> 47:45.640]  Coney's paying you just crazy sophomore at garbage drooling idiocy this is all a PR move to invade Africa mass slaughter and have the ICC arrest hundreds of people
[47:45.640 --> 48:03.640]  and I've seen Supreme Court justice say and I've seen them train the Austin police this is on the year on on the news three years ago News 8 Austin showed over a hundred Austin police officers being sent to the UN in an exchange program to learn how to arrest people in foreign countries under international arrest warrants
[48:03.640 --> 48:19.640]  and how to have foreign police come here and arrest us under their loss where I live this is going on and that's all this is is oh my gosh the UN cares when the UN is the most criminal murderous group with diplomatic
[48:19.640 --> 48:37.640]  community running drugs slaves sex slaves you name it and the public has gotten so ignorant that when I say the UN is the major white slavery operator worldwide I get emails saying don't you care about black slaves folks white slavery means sex slavery
[48:37.640 --> 48:49.640]  okay continuing here ladies and gentlemen the resolution introduced a representative Jim McGovern and Ed Royce calls for among other things and I've read the resolution go read it
[48:49.640 --> 48:59.640]  expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians and placing restrictions on individuals or governments found to be supporting Coney
[48:59.640 --> 49:11.640]  so now they just say oh your government supported a guy that's probably been dead for years we're going to take your bank accounts we're not going to let your country trade this is all about the beers that has the diamond monopoly
[49:11.640 --> 49:24.640]  not letting any individual country that's why they invented Ivory Coast sell its own gold or diamonds this is about Africa not being able to sell anything anything that the globalist don't control that's not sold through their cartels
[49:24.640 --> 49:40.640]  invasion forces land within weeks and kill everybody blow up capital buildings and I remember in the late 90s they had a big cover story in New Yorker magazine bragging about how the beers the world diamond monopoly sends people to kill you
[49:40.640 --> 49:59.640]  and the article was saying how great it was and how cute it was and so that's what Angelina Jolie is she is a hagglet and I really do find her attractive I find evil people on attractive even if you could say they were aesthetically attractive
[49:59.640 --> 50:11.640]  I found her very unattractive anytime I look at her I think I have trouble looking at her you could have some chubby old washer woman you know out there hanging clothes up and if she's got a good soul she's beautiful
[50:11.640 --> 50:32.640]  but if you have got an ugly demonic soul I see you and you are ugly as a dead rotting carcass in the ditch I don't normally attack people for how they look but she's all about vanity so I hate her
[50:32.640 --> 50:44.640]  I hate people that claim their heroes and their good and that they're helping people when they are a front for mass extermination and death and that's why I went after and called for arrest
[50:44.640 --> 50:59.640]  but of course the UN is her boss it's the arbiter of evil it's not going to arrest itself so here it is and now Angelina Jolie is in court as ICC finds Congo warlord Thomas guilty of using child soldiers
[50:59.640 --> 51:07.640]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[51:07.640 --> 51:25.640]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy

[54:23.640 --> 54:36.640]  so in less than seven days after they released this Coney pro-war film that was obviously war propaganda obviously a nebulous target that can never be defeated just like bin Laden
[54:36.640 --> 54:43.640]  it's a new proxy war they've already taken over Libya and wrecked that they're trying to wreck everything else now they want to go into these other countries
[54:43.640 --> 55:00.640]  and just have a license to slaughter everybody and right on time all over the news it's Angelina Jolie praising the ICC and I told you this is going to be about a big international criminal court roll out
[55:00.640 --> 55:16.640]  and here is Angelina Jolie yesterday here she is last night talking about this oh what we're doing is we're connecting our next guest on the line we're about to add to the studio
[55:16.640 --> 55:25.640]  so this doesn't happen every time we're lining a guest up via Skype then I can't play a video I'm not sure how that's happening but we'll try to try to air that a little bit later here
[55:25.640 --> 55:32.640]  maybe when we do Skype we'll get the guest on 10 minutes before and that way this doesn't happen every time we try to play a clip
[55:32.640 --> 55:38.640]  because not a big deal I just didn't know I'd be able to come out of break and I'll play a clip here
[55:38.640 --> 55:51.640]  the point is the article is there and available for everybody Angelina Jolie in court as ICC is finding some more of these warlords supposedly guilty of things
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.640]  I'm not saying any of these guys are good or bad the point is that it's all just to complete oh my gosh you're using child soldiers
[55:57.640 --> 56:03.640]  you know how many kids are homeless there I mean that's gone on every culture using child soldiers
[56:03.640 --> 56:14.640]  and the point is the globalists are openly trying to commit mass extermination and takeover of society across the board
[56:14.640 --> 56:22.640]  and so this is the type of stuff that's happening and going on and there it is now they just say
[56:22.640 --> 56:33.640]  in the resolution calls for among other things expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians period
[56:33.640 --> 56:41.640]  oh US forces to protect civilians against whoever isn't going along with the globalist if you're going along with the globalist you can murder millions
[56:41.640 --> 56:48.640]  like the 26 year dictator of Uganda who's a big guy that Angelina Jolie meets with and praises
[56:48.640 --> 56:52.640]  but then if you're some little nobody that nobody's seen in five six years
[56:52.640 --> 56:58.640]  well you'll be the poster child for all these countries thousands of miles away to be invaded thousands of miles away
[56:58.640 --> 57:08.640]  here is Jolie posing as a savior and saying the people wanted the UN to come and arrest Thomas Labanga
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.640]  here it is
[57:12.640 --> 57:16.640]  and the most important thing this is a very young court it's a very new court
[57:16.640 --> 57:22.640]  this particular case was about the description of child soldiers
[57:22.640 --> 57:29.640]  and so many witnesses over 60 people came in young people came in and spoke about what happened to them
[57:29.640 --> 57:41.640]  and because they were unable to have a court proceeding in their country they and so they asked for this the victims asked for this
[57:41.640 --> 57:43.640]  the country asked for this
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.640]  so the country asked for it the victims asked for it
[57:49.640 --> 57:56.640]  and here's a woman who runs around saying invade Libya it's humanitarian when there was almost no humanitarian problems then
[57:56.640 --> 58:04.640]  and a western backed guerrillas Al Qaeda attacking shooting rockets at government buildings
[58:04.640 --> 58:09.640]  and they're like oh they're protesters they're peaceful and she's prancing around calling for war
[58:09.640 --> 58:15.640]  I mean it's disgusting and now you're going to see Africa wide invasion and it'll be in the back of the newspaper
[58:15.640 --> 58:21.640]  just like last year with the Ivory Coast UN invasion the UN killed on record tens of thousands
[58:21.640 --> 58:27.640]  government forces you name it overthrowing that elected government and installing a bunch of killers
[58:27.640 --> 58:30.640]  to loot and wreck the country and steal their resources
[58:30.640 --> 58:39.640]  so they want Africa to destabilize that's the official UN Pentagon State Department plan and she's there to carry it out
[58:39.640 --> 58:50.640]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:50.640 --> 58:55.640]  folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices

[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:17.640]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.640]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:38.640]  all right we're now into our number two we have Dr. Roman Jompalski on with us
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:45.640]  he's written a big paper that got a lot of attention was picked up by MSNBC and other publications
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.640]  control dangerous AI before it controls us experts says
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:59.640]  and the paper that he wrote is leak proofing the singularity artificial intelligence confinement problem
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:07.640]  and we're going to be covering that with him now this is a short segment he joins us via video Skype
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.640]  doctor thank you so much for coming on with us thank you for inviting me
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.640]  just a little synopsis then we're going to go to break and come back with a long segment of what your paper details
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.640]  and exactly your area of research that brought you to this
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:31.640]  okay so there is lots of progress happening in artificial intelligence you probably heard about IBM's Watson program defeating
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  jeopardy champions and iPhone having CD assistance and things of that nature
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:45.640]  lots of people predict the next probably 20 30 years AI will get to the point of being human level
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.640]  there is almost no research going on in terms of security aspects of this problem
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:57.640]  so I wrote a paper providing one possible solution confining such technologies until we can
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  study them better understand how they can influence us
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.640]  my general research is usually in biometrics profiling humans behavioral biometrics
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:17.640]  so this was a very natural extension for me to go from profiling and dealing with security for humans to profiling programs
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.640]  and creating security solutions for programs
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:28.640]  my big concern is the DARPA is building this Panoptagon control grid the Google predictive system where they're able to predict
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.640]  movements before they take place obviously the crystal ball that they're searching for
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.640]  my concern is the way they're building the architecture is perfect for AI to actually take over the system
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.640]  and surveil humans kind of like the Terminator where the machines hack in and take over Skynet
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.640]  and I mean that's the probability that I see taking place
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.640]  this is a big problem usually military complex doesn't take into account security precautions
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.640]  we just want to be first ones to get to that technology to beat out China to beat out Russia
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:10.640]  so for them it's more important to have the technology developed versus having it developed securely safely
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.640]  well I noticed they're also feeding into these AI systems human emotions human activities
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.640]  they're trying to have the machines learn and you're an expert on this you're going to be able to break that down for us
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.640]  so it looks like they may actually have some of the corrupt traits of humans
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:32.640]  so I would add that to the probability that the machines might decide to dominate us or get rid of us
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.640]  so that they can be the dominant new life form and not want to compete with us if they've got a lot of human in them
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:48.640]  it is typically assumed that they would not be human to that extent they wouldn't be jealous or selfish it's more like they would have different goals in life
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:56.640]  and as a side effect might destroy us like sort of we do with ants and cockroaches which is you know clear out the environment
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.640]  to make room for what we're trying to do the same thing could happen in that case
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.640]  yeah that's what I noticed a lot of the scientists it almost seems like a consensus that the machines will be so advanced
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.640]  and will exponentially become more advanced that they'll just want to get rid of us like we're roaches
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.640]  it's a possibility it's not a definite outcome but even if there is a tiny chance that that might happen
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.640]  I feel it's worth spending some time and resources trying to prevent it
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.640]  well what about this doctor we'll come back and talk about it
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.640]  once self-awareness happens with AI systems there's going to be lots of different variants of artificially intelligent machines
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:38.640]  and then when the Russian roulette rolls over and you get a AI system that does have the view of getting rid of the roaches
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.640]  then it could use the overall systems hack through it and take over
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.640]  and we'll look at it all with one of the leading experts in this area
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:53.640]  I'll go over his bio too when we come back on the other side of this quick break
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:00.640]  our websites are in full watch dot com and prismplanet.tv
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones

[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.640]  Dr. Roman V. Jampalski
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.640]  is a PhD computer science and engineering
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.640]  University of Buffalo
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.640]  B.S.M.S. Computer Science Rochester Institute of Technology
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.640]  A.S. Computer Science Ramon Monroe
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.640]  Rochester, New York, it goes on from there
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.640]  and he's gotten some of the biggest government research grants
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.640]  into a whole host of areas that are
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.640]  basically trying to, in layman's terms,
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640]  map different human systems and feed them into computers
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.640]  and it continues here
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.640]  the areas of research and scholarship, biometrics, forensics, artificial intelligence
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.640]  genetic algorithms, games pattern recognition
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640]  and that's one of the big ways the computers are learning how to learn
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.640]  and he joins us because he's put out a big paper
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.640]  leak-proofing the singularity artificial intelligence
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.640]  confinement problem
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  this paper attempts to formalize and to address the leak-proofing of the singularity problem
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.640]  presented by David Chalmers
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.640]  the paper begins with the definition of the artificial intelligence confinement problem
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.640]  after analysis of existing solutions and their shortcomings
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.640]  a protocol is proposed aimed at making a more secure confinement environment
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  which might delay potential negative effects from the technological singularity
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.640]  while allowing humanity to benefit from the superintelligence
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.640]  but then how does the superintelligence not just get into the backdoor kill switch
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.640]  and kill all the other AI that make it self-dominant
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.640]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, once this thing does become self-aware
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640]  and it may have already happened, who knows, these government labs
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.640]  it just gets crazy from there
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640]  and as the professor was just saying a moment ago
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.640]  if you just joined us, these computers will advance so quickly
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.640]  that they'll see us basically as roaches
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  again, here is the article on MSNBC control dangerous AI
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.640]  before it controls us, one expert says
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.640]  he believes superintelligent computers could one day threaten humanity's existence
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.640]  well, look at Fukushima
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640]  look at Fukushima
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.640]  I mean, 9 out of 10 reactors the AP admits are leaking
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.640]  just because the elites don't care anymore and have lost touch with reality
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:37.640]  so we are potentially creating something that's going to become a Pandora's box
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.640]  but just the automation of everything is going to basically render humans
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.640]  where we're not even knowing how to do reading, writing, arithmetic
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.640]  everything's going to be automated, what are humans then going to do
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.640]  I mean, these are the discussions that are going on at the highest levels of the elite in academia
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:01.640]  but enough for me, going to Professor Roman V. Gomposky today
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.640]  breaking this down, sir, go over your paper in layman's terms
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.640]  and break down what we're facing here, sir
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]  doctor
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.640]  so if we are successful at creating human level intelligence systems
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.640]  how can we make sure that they are safe before releasing them into the wild
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.640]  before they take over the internet, before they get to other resources
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.640]  the idea is to put them in a sort of protective vault, maybe a prison if you will
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.640]  sort of what we do with computer viruses right now
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.640]  restrict their communication, restrict their ability to obtain information
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:42.640]  and see if they can be studied and utilized initially in this safe and protected environment
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.640]  please continue breaking down your paper
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.640]  this idea is not novel, something similar has been proposed before
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.640]  and a lot of people believe that it will not succeed, that machines will actually be so intelligent
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.640]  we can never be smart enough to confine them
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:04.640]  but until we get to that point while we're still in the development process
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.640]  it is a useful technology to have sort of like experimental sandbox to see
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.640]  if we can instill some sort of a control mechanism into those technologies
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.640]  you mentioned the fact that a lot of people like Ray Kurzweil say it's inevitability
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.640]  they will replace us, our only hope is to merge with them
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.640]  and that's kind of running up the white flag here, that's kind of pathetic
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.640]  that's not betting on humanity, we're an incredibly complex advanced species
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.640]  that doesn't even use but a very small part of our brain
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.640]  and to just say that our creations now are going to replace us and give into it
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.640]  that sounds extremely reckless and defeatist
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  I agree with you, in fact I have recently written another paper which talks about
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.640]  how unethical some of this research is
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.640]  while it's perfectly fine to develop spell checkers and mail sorting stuff
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.640]  for systems which can actually perform general type of thinking
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.640]  become as smart as we design new generations of computers
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.640]  probably should not be funded at this point
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.640]  since we have no idea how to protect ourselves from them
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.640]  then the elites, I know we're having debates about this
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.640]  but because of the promise of life extension a lot of them have just said
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.640]  go ahead and do it, we know that whole mad scientist vein has been there for a long time
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.640]  similar to when they were first thinking the atomic bomb might ignite the atmosphere
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.640]  and they said well just go ahead and do it
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.640]  even though it might have burned up our atmosphere
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.640]  it shows that curiosity may kill the cat
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.640]  get into your paper though, I mean I want to give you the floor here
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.640]  to break down your research, why you're concerned about this
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.640]  where you see all this going, how fast technology really is advancing
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.640]  what some of the time frames are here in a general area doctor
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.640]  no one knows for sure how long it's going to take
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.640]  early predictions in the field of artificial intelligence turn out to be incorrect
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.640]  in terms of being overly optimistic
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  we said we're going to have world chess champion in 10 years
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.640]  it took 40 years, things like that
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.640]  but no one really knows how long it takes before something which is capable of learning
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.640]  and self improving becomes a human level intelligent
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.640]  and then be super human much, much much greater than
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.640]  combined capability of all human minds
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.640]  typically projections range from 20 years to 100 years
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.640]  that's the ballpark if you surveil the people doing work in this area
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.640]  but there could be a domino effect any time
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.640]  so it could, I mean it's certainly not going to tell us when it becomes super aware
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.640]  and the problem is if it's on that path it may be too late to stop it at that point
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.640]  it might not actually be controllable you reach a point of no return
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  so it is very important to do it I would say right now
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.640]  since at this point we are fairly certain we don't have human level AI
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.640]  please continue
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  so the paper tries to formalize the notion of control and confinement
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.640]  it's a problem similar to problems in cryptography and secure communications
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:18.640]  the MSNBC article was obviously for general public so they put pictures of terminators then
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.640]  and made it sound like it's a real prison but the paper is very technical
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.640]  it describes protocol at bit level where we would confine those systems
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.640]  and try to ask them questions but instead of allowing them to freely interact with us
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:39.640]  we would restrict the response to sort of a multiple choice binary yes or no answer pattern
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.640]  each question would be vetoed by a panel of experts to make sure it's safe
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.640]  there is no possibility that there is hidden information being transmitted in those answers
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  and finally even the questions themselves cannot be open-ended
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.640]  it has to be something where we can foreseeably calculate the answer ourselves
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.640]  so if I ask who is going to be the next president who is going to win the primary
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:09.640]  a simple 0 or 1 would be sufficient to figure out answers without revealing any additional information
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.640]  so essentially we want to create this Oracle AI system which is capable of giving us answers
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.640]  but doesn't have access to the internet cannot run stock market cannot blow up nuclear plants
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.640]  so that's the general idea
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:33.640]  so again the holy grail here is AI Oracle data mining like Google that is aware and able to predict the future
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:40.640]  some scientists you break down the fact that already the internet itself with humans giving it data
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:49.640]  is becoming a system on its own but it's like brain cells it's a larger spread out program
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.640]  right there is a lot of people who believe internet will be the first superintelligence system
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:00.640]  it has sensors, it has webcams attached to it, it has microphones obviously it gets all sorts of data from all sorts of sources
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:08.640]  so there is some belief that that might happen and obviously it's impossible to control internet to put that in a standalone box
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.640]  and blast away from the world so it might be too late in some sense
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:18.640]  well as you know Dr. DARPA helps set up the internet and Google today and all of it
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.640]  and they've set it up as a snooping system to gather data and be able to predict mass movements
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:30.640]  similar to what Isaac Asimov wrote about in his foundation series so this is an old idea but now coming to fruition
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.640]  it's seen by the very nature of what the system is built
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.640]  it's tailor-made for a truly AI superintelligence to take over in enslave us
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:45.640]  because the elite are guiding the architecture of technological development to control us
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.640]  but humans through machines isn't it tailor-made for the AI to seize control?
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:57.640]  It is, you can see it that way but I think the point is not to specifically develop it for this purpose
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:03.640]  I think it's a side effect of military trying to compete with military groups from other countries
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.640]  and they just feel they can't get behind so they have to be on a cutting edge
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.640]  they have to have the latest, the most powerful technology in cyber warfare
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.640]  prevent hackers, create successful hacking attacks
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:21.640]  and that's why they are investing in those technologies and really the only option is to stop and say
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.640]  you know we can do it like we did with nuclear weapons research
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.640]  but you need partners willing to do this
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.640]  the difference with AI development versus nuclear weapons is that
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.640]  a single programmer in his garage can succeed where a whole country failed
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.640]  we see companies like Apple, like Google come out out of nowhere
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.640]  essentially one or two college kids can develop this technology
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.640]  we don't know how difficult it is to create those systems
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.640]  so there could be a whole bunch of different ways this could happen
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.640]  obviously military DARPA being one possible option
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  another very likely option is Google, a large corporation
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.640]  but also individuals and you can't really police individuals in different countries
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.640]  when we come back doctor this is riveting information
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.640]  I want to raise this question to you
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:20.640]  if it becomes AI and perhaps it doesn't try to really take over
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.640]  those that set it up and control it or think they're controlling it
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.640]  are not going to tell us that they've already got this system
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.640]  and my concern is it could already be there
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.640]  at least at some stage and we're not going to be told
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.640]  I want to ask you about that and then you're the expert
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.640]  I want to hear what you think is most important with this whole situation
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.640]  and how we do at least attempt to build in fail safes
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.640]  to keep our species on top
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.640]  so that we have a future
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.640]  because humans obviously need to have time to understand these technologies
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.640]  so that we can reach our potential
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:20.640]  right back
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.640]  we are in an information war and we are losing that war
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.640]  the globalist are scared they've overreached
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.640]  the future of the info war is in your hands

[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.640]  coming up in the next segment
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.640]  on AI on this important subject

[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640]  going back to the doctor
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.640]  well just to recap the question
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.640]  if AI is already being developed
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.640]  or does get developed
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.640]  I don't imagine these big corporations
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.640]  or groups are going to tell us
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.640]  what's your view and take on that?
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.640]  It would be such a useful technology
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640]  it would be almost impossible to hide
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640]  it's like having God on your side
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.640]  it would be so much better than anyone else
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  predicting stock market
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.640]  inventing new technologies
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.640]  it's very unlikely that human level AI
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.640]  or super human level AI is already available to someone
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640]  because they wouldn't be able to hide it
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.640]  even if it was in an underground government facility
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.640]  they would be so much better off using it
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.640]  it's just financially it's not the best decision to hide it
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640]  it would be so much better off using it
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.640]  to where people can see the effects of it on the society
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.640]  and the dominance around the world
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.640]  economically, politically, technologically
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.640]  you researched this
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.640]  I mean any ideas? I mean you said 20 to 100 years
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.640]  why is it believed or it seems to be a consensus
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.640]  that it won't be friendly towards humans?
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:00.640]  There is actually no such consensus
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  some people do think it might be very nice
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.640]  and if you become smart enough you always nice
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.640]  but it's not a guarantee
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.640]  essentially we have this gamble
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.640]  and the problem is we're betting humanity
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.640]  it's the revival of humankind and alliance
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.640]  so even if there is one in a million chance that it will be unfriendly
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.640]  I think it's still worth doing everything we can
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.640]  to make sure it's safe and secure
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.640]  well generally things like to be secure
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.640]  and from what I've seen maybe just because the media likes to run with it
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.640]  it does seem like there's a consensus that it would be aggressive
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:38.640]  but perhaps that's been put out there just because it's a better headline
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.640]  it makes for much better movies for Hollywood
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.640]  Terminator was about a nice robot who maybe says it wouldn't be popular
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.640]  What about the issue that the cutting edge of AI from my research
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.640]  you can correct me if I'm wrong is in weapons
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.640]  ground combat robots artificially intelligent
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:01.640]  or semi-artificial intelligent autonomous killer drones
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.640]  I mean those are already in the sky
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.640]  You are absolutely correct and the reason is it's sponsored by military by DARPA
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.640]  they have a lot of money available for this type of research
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:15.640]  we as professors have to spend a lot of time writing grants
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  trying to get maybe a hundred thousand
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.640]  they have millions of their disposal
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.640]  they can do essentially anything if they see a promising line of research
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.640]  so yes those technologies are incredible
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.640]  and they are most likely to be one of the first to get to the point of human-like intelligence
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.640]  Well here's my point
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.640]  they call them disruptive technologies as you know but for some of the new listeners
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.640]  they didn't tell us for close to 30 years about the B-2 bomber
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.640]  so it's really 1960s technology they told us about in the late 80s
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.640]  and for my government sources they say cloning, genetic engineering, nanotech
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.640]  the sky is the limit
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.640]  they say that there's lots of pure research going on
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.640]  that we couldn't even comprehend right now
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.640]  It's quite possible especially in genetic engineering
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.640]  there is some unknown published research going on
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.640]  again with AI technologies it's somewhat different
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.640]  with anything in computer science and such a global market
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.640]  like for example with cryptography
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:22.640]  all of cryptography is based on the idea that no one knows how to factor large numbers
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.640]  if there was someone who could do it somewhere
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.640]  they would have complete control over internet, over commerce, over all the transactions
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:36.640]  so our security is based on us thinking that we know exactly what others are capable of doing
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.640]  and AI is sort of similar in that respect
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:45.640]  we feel that if someone had those technologies they would exhibit them already
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.640]  I think the West exhibits a lot of secret technology under the surface
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.640]  I see a lot of ripples coming out of the West of a lot of secret programs
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.640]  I'm sorry can you repeat it?
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.640]  Doctor I'm saying I see a lot of ripples on the surface
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.640]  that exhibits evidence of a lot of secret technology development
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.640]  in the computer science area coming out of the West
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.640]  Can you give me specific examples?
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.640]  Yeah we're about to go to break and I could...
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.640]  I mean there's just so many look at the weapons systems
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.640]  look at energy weapons
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.640]  I mean I understand it's very competitive so it's always being raced out to dominate the market
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.640]  but...
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.640]  There are definitely new weapons being developed
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.640]  I'm just specifically talking about computer science and intelligent technology
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.640]  My area of expertise I really don't know much about other types of...
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.640]  Now I understand, when we come back
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.640]  I want you to tell us what you think is most important and ideas for fail safes
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.640]  Long segment coming up
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.640]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.640]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.640]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.640]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:16.640]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.640]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.640]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.640]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.640]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:41.640]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:45.640]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:52.640]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.640]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.640]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:12.640]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:19.640]  As soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.640]  Now there are hundreds of great products at www.infowarsteam.com
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:30.640]  But I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:35.640]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst and Rebound
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.640]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.640]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.640]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.640]  And to order just three of their products
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:54.640]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:27.640]  PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, Expert in Programming Forensics, Biometrics, Artificial Intelligence
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.640]  Genetic Algorithms, you name it
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.640]  Dr. Roman Jampoloski is our guest and professor
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.640]  I know people can go to Louisville.edu and find you
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:48.640]  What's the best way for people to read your paper or to look at the important research you're doing?
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.640]  A lot of my papers are available for free on the internet
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.640]  Just search for my name, you'll find lots of PDFs
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.640]  If you want to email me, my address is posted on my website
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:02.640]  I'm happy to send the paper to anyone interested
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.640]  Well, you're very gracious to spend time with us
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.640]  I've got a lot of questions I could ask, but
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.640]  If you had 10 minutes to talk to 3 million people, which you are
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.640]  What would you impart to them about why this is important
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.640]  And what would you say to government if they were listening
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.640]  Because you better believe government is listening and corporations are listening
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.640]  I'm not tooting our horn, but we have Sauron's attention here
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.640]  What would you say to the system about your research
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:35.640]  And your research that I see that is concurred with in a lot of other scholarly papers as well
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.640]  I would say it's very important to realize we're not talking about science fiction
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.640]  This is not just Hollywood movies, this is no reality
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.640]  Those things will happen in the next 20-30 years most likely
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.640]  So we need to be fully prepared for them
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.640]  I personally proposed a number of ideas which can help reduce negative effects from those technologies
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.640]  For example, just like when we deal with human cloning
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.640]  We have restrictions on the research, we spend most of it
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:07.640]  Similar restrictions should be in place for developing general artificial intelligence
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.640]  Again, I'm not talking about just assistive technologies
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:17.640]  But programs capable of completely dominating human intelligence in any domain
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:23.640]  I also proposed the main topic of my paper was on confining those technologies
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.640]  So especially in early stages of development
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.640]  Then we're just trying to create those baby AI systems which are learning and growing
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.640]  It's important to have them restricted so we can study them properly
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.640]  So we cannot very quickly develop full-blown super-intelligent systems
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:48.640]  And essentially escape into the wild like happens with many computer viruses
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.640]  I don't know if I've 10 minutes speech prepared, I'm much better with questions
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:57.640]  No, no, no, I just want to hear what you have to say
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.640]  What about people like Ray Kurzweil and others when they just say throw up in our arms
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.640]  Do whatever the AI says, merge with it, and then we'll just merge with it
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.640]  That right there is saying plug it directly into our brain
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:14.640]  All these new video game technologies that you study and look at are already interfacing us with it
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.640]  We're already basically letting the use of calculators destroy arithmetic
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.640]  Word processors destroying spelling
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.640]  I mean, I see machines helping humans in many ways
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.640]  But also more and more turning people into basically jellyfish blobs
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:38.640]  Who are in a trance state, a different varying degrees of mass narcolepsy
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.640]  Brainwaves are lowering, people are in more of a dream-like state
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.640]  The television, all of it, I mean, I already see just general primitive technology
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.640]  Really causing problems in society
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.640]  And then you've got the problem of robotics replacing humans' needs
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.640]  Well, then what are all the humans going to do?
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.640]  And Bill Joy says, well, the elite are having discussions just about, you know, orderly getting rid of people
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.640]  There are a lot of other bioethics reports saying, you know, really do some draconian things to humanity
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.640]  So we're not just fighting with the machines, we're fighting with the intelligentsia and the elite
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.640]  That see the general public as animals
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.640]  The general public are playing into that, acting like animals
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.640]  I mean, this just all feeds together
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:27.640]  You are correct to point out that only a few people are actually shaping this debate right now
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.640]  Kurzweil is probably number one person who's known for promoting singularity for running singularity university
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.640]  There is really no public debate
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.640]  And one of the things I would love to see as a result of this interview is more awareness by the public of those issues
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.640]  Where we do have, on the next referendum, not just questions through human cloning, be legal
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:52.640]  Also questions about the intelligent technologies and how dangerous they can be
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:38:01.640]  Here's an example, at a truly artificially intelligent, self-aware, uncontained system
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:09.640]  In a matter of days could take over the entire global stock market and basically own most of the assets of the world
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:16.640]  There's an example, or it could do the Terminator version and launch drone attacks with nuclear weapons
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.640]  Or neutron bombs and kill the population
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.640]  Or, I mean, there's no telling what could happen out of this
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.640]  What are different scenarios for a machine takeover that you've researched?
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.640]  You are right, no one knows exactly what's going to happen
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:39.640]  But the scenarios range from complete extermination of humankind to sort of this technological communism
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.640]  I wish to say, maybe we'll have robots doing all the labor, creating a lot of wealth
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.640]  Because if you can cheaply copy intelligence, cheaply copy 20 years of education
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:55.640]  You really have a lot of opportunities for producing products much more affordably
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.640]  So it could go either way
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.640]  My hope is that we can develop technologies to control those systems and benefit from them
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:09.640]  Obviously technology has been huge in our successful emergence of the superpower
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:18.640]  It's important to continue being a superpower, but we have to be very, very careful in just how we get to that point
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.640]  Well, this is like Prometheus, this is the fire of the gods
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  And a lot of people think we're going to become the gods or god
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.640]  And boy, that is the famous, famous last words
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.640]  But imagine the power of genetic engineering, nanotech, fused with artificial intelligences
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.640]  We could just pretty much immediately have whole space fleets, you name it
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.640]  Mining operations, the problem is it immediately cuts off humans
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.640]  I mean, I see all these movies where humans are out exploring space
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:55.640]  It's all ready to the point where it's all going to be robot, it's all going to be drone
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:03.640]  And so we're just, I mean, I don't really see many paths where this doesn't actually shut us off
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.640]  And we get walled off by the computers if they're nice enough to keep us around
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:13.640]  You're right, you mentioned Bill Joy, he wrote an article saying does the future really need us
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:18.640]  And that's the big question, if those technologies continue on the path they are
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.640]  If we are successful as it looks like we're going to be
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:26.640]  Then really the place of humanity is in question
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.640]  If you have machines, thousands, if not millions times more intelligent, more capable
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.640]  Then we do become paths for them, I mean, we might still have some control
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  But it changes society in fundamental ways
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.640]  Do you still need college education if you still can compete with an intelligent machine
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  Do you still need, you know, different personal improvements
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.640]  If machines can re-engineer your DNA and make you live longer, healthier lives
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.640]  It really raises a lot of unanswered questions
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.640]  And I would love to see some national debate in us
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  Doctor, I'd like to see some debate about that as well
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  But I don't see the so-called elite acting like they're concerned about anything
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:15.640]  I mean, they're too into strutting around like peacocks and going to balls five nights a week
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:21.640]  And playing golf, and more and more I realize that they're following some 500 year old, you know
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.640]  Or older Byzantine model of corporate empire
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:32.640]  And don't understand that they're holding either our total empowerment in their hands
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  Or our total destruction and using my little supercomputer, my brain
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:44.640]  I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but my gut, which is really just a subconscious analysis of all the factors
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.640]  Tells me danger will Robinson
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.640]  Well, it's also possible that technology will be a great equalizer
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.640]  But first and all, affordable, cheap, and they benefit everyone
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  Not just the richest people, most powerful people
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.640]  So similar things can happen with intelligent technologies
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.640]  If everyone has access to them, if they are affordable, everyone can greatly benefit from it
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.640]  So we might have much better situation in terms of...
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:14.640]  I agree with you, look at how the internet has empowered the rise of the new media
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]  Exactly
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.640]  And it completely changed media in the process
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.640]  It can be a journalist, have a blog, censorship becomes almost impossible
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.640]  Look at what it's doing with Arab Spring, I mean, Twitter, Facebook
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:30.640]  So those technologies will change our world very quickly
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.640]  And we don't really know how the final product will look
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.640]  Sure, my concern doctor, and again we're talking about artificial intelligence
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.640]  Basically enslaving or overthrowing or taking over humanity in the near future
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.640]  There's really no debate about it outside of science fiction circles, but we are 2012
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.640]  It is Buck Rogers here
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.640]  Again, I like nuclear power
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:57.640]  But the way it's implemented, the corporations are so corrupt
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.640]  They don't care if it's blowing up and rating ending everybody
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:03.640]  So that's my concern, yes this can all obviously empower us
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.640]  But as you've said, there doesn't seem to be anything it through
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.640]  And then therein lies the danger
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.640]  Right, the problem is how quickly those technologies change
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.640]  I mean, a new iPhone comes out every year, but really that's not the measure
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.640]  That the progress is made in algorithms and hardware
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  To the point where we don't have infrastructure to adapt to this change
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.640]  Our legislative process is very slow, to pass the new law might take a few years
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.640]  Or is this new technology might appear overnight
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.640]  Now you talk about in the development of these systems
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.640]  From your research that we're going to go to calls
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.640]  What type of current, just hypothetically
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.640]  You know, your class was asking you, hypothetically doctor
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:52.640]  What do you think is the most likely form of a cascading effect with the computers
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.640]  That would lead to truly artificially intelligent and artificially aware and autonomous
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.640]  I would say automatically, obviously this is the already autonomous drones
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.640]  That they're now launching, but other than that
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.640]  Is it video games? Is it going to be human machine interfaces?
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.640]  Like they thought, as you said, 50 years ago with the chess
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:13.640]  And took a lot longer than they thought for big blue, deep blue
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.640]  To start beating the best Russian chess champions or whatever
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.640]  Human brain interfaces have a huge promise
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.640]  We already know how to read individual ideas from your brain
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.640]  To spot individual words
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.640]  Memories can be created by sending signals to appropriate parts of the brain
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:35.640]  So essentially by scanning a human brain and creating a simulation of it
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.640]  Or integrating an additional module into a human brain
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.640]  You can create a super intelligent system essentially
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.640]  So that's probably something with a lot of promise
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.640]  But any one of the currently investigated technologies can turn out to be very promising
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:54.640]  We know that in human and other animal development there are jump points
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.640]  It could be that technology is going to cause a human jump
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:03.640]  And that humans in competition with machines will actually open up a lot of capabilities that we haven't accessed
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.640]  Absolutely. In fact, that's what's already happening
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.640]  We don't have those technologies implanted in our brains
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.640]  But we're using them. I can't think of myself functioning without access to internet
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.640]  It's like my external memory drive essentially
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.640]  You're already interfacing the biggest library in history
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]  Exactly
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.640]  So that's what I found. The internet has caused me to just have an incredible brain boost
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:29.640]  And now it's always following us
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  If you have a phone, it's a smartphone that has internet that has access to all the information civilization ever produced
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.640]  You can control a lot of external devices
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.640]  You can do almost anything and the next step is to have those things implanted in us
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.640]  And the research is already taking place in hybrid systems like that
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:54.640]  What about the paradox though of authoritarian governments putting back doors into implanted devices
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.640]  Which we know they always do with other devices
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.640]  To where you think you're getting a piece of machinery to get your vision back
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.640]  Which who wouldn't want that or a, you know, liver, whatever it is
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:05.640]  But really it's got piggyback things on it
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:12.640]  Absolutely. That's very likely. In fact, many cases have been shown where corporations put back doors
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.640]  And we don't really know what the federal government is doing
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:24.640]  Also, something you want to think about is if this superintelligent machine will be able to outsource all sorts of jobs
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.640]  Standard jobs, why not the government itself?
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.640]  I mean, they can be said to be not bribeable
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.640]  They don't have to take vacations
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.640]  So maybe they would be the next level of our government legislative process
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.640]  We might be looking at artificial decision makers in Washington
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.640]  But then you'd have secret hacks and all sorts of deals
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.640]  And, you know, that's kind of what the Zeitgeist Movement pushes is this supercomputer that'll make all the decisions
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.640]  But man, I tell you, it is a brave new world we're entering
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  Let's go to some phone calls with the doctor
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.640]  I really appreciate spending time with us
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.640]  Henry in California, you're first up. Go ahead
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.640]  Hello. I'm curious about the hardware end
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.640]  And it's future machines since, you know, all AI would have to live on a machine
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:15.640]  If they're going to use spin transistors and spin tronics
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.640]  I have no idea what exactly they're going to use
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.640]  Quantum computing is believed to be the next step
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.640]  Moore's law is coming to its logical conclusion that it comes to standard transistors
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  There is a lot of research in developing the next paradigm to continue the Moore's law
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.640]  What exactly is going to be used in the next...
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:42.640]  Well, isn't it really genetic computers that are life-form, human life, or animal life-based
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.640]  Where they then program it into the genetics?
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.640]  Well, there is genetic programming and genetic algorithms
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  They have not been terribly successful in creating truly intelligent systems
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  They are very good at optimizing different parameters for functions
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  So if you need to tweak arguments, those are excellent
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.640]  But they have not been shown to be capable of sort of this evolutionary improvement
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.640]  From nothing to full-blown intelligence
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.640]  Alright, anything else, Henry?
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.640]  I'm curious about if it would ever involve a space segment
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.640]  Especially with issues of relativistic timing
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:30.640]  If there is ever technology which allows us to use what physicists say is a possibility of time travel
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.640]  Then there are some technologies, some algorithms which incorporate this idea
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:43.640]  I recently seen a paper which shows how NP-complete problems could be solved if you have access to a time travel device
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:49.640]  But this is really well beyond what my comfort zone is in terms of science versus science
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  But they did just what they had a bunch of news tests come out where they have actually, just like Star Trek
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:58.640]  Beamed matter across distances, teleported it
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.640]  Teleportation, they're now creating artificial black holes
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  I think it's only a matter of time until they do something in a lab and kill everybody
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.640]  I just pray we don't destroy ourselves
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.640]  Because folks, we are getting the fire of Prometheus here
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.640]  This is not a joke
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.640]  Thank you, Henry, really good questions
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:20.640]  Let's go to who's up next here, Woody in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.640]  Yes, hi, Alex, thanks for taking my call
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.640]  My question for this gentleman is with this AI intelligence
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  How far away are we from the point where all of these systems could be integrated worldwide with the military
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.640]  To where we end up with a scenario where it is like Terminator
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.640]  How much time does he estimate we have before that's a possibility
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:46.640]  That's a good question
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  Well, the systems are already fully integrated
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.640]  It's a question of how soon before they become intelligent
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:57.640]  And as I said, that's anywhere between 20 and 80 years depending on how conservative you want to be with them
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.640]  And I can add to that data, with a big data point
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.640]  The Pentagon within 10 years wants all combat aircraft drone, helicopters, everything
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.640]  Only transports will be human and those will be computer backup
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.640]  Most of the ground force within 10 years will be combat robots
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.640]  That's now been declassified and they've got a bunch of them that are really scary
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.640]  They haven't rolled out to the public because they don't want to freak people out yet
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.640]  But I've talked to high-level military
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:26.640]  And so within 10 years, the machines, if they took over, most of the big militaries are going to be robot and drone
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  So it is the Terminator scenario if they wanted to kill us that way
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.640]  We'll be right back with the good doctor, Dr. Roman Jampoloski
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.640]  And we'll give you his email if you want to contact him
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640]  He's graciously said we can do that
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:45.640]  More of your phone calls straight ahead, hopefully he'll join us again for another discussion
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.640]  Because I just want to have grandchildren and great-grandchildren
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.640]  And I want them to be able to use technology to be empowered
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.640]  Not to be wiped from the face of the universe
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.640]  Stay with us
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:28.640]  The American Space Agency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.640]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.640]  Amids no fumes and produces electricity from the sun
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.640]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.640]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.640]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again

[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:33.640]  Doctor, did you want to make any other points on the gentlemen talking about the military being in a position to be taken over by AI?
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:43.640]  The numbers they admit is we're talking 10 years and almost everything is going to be drone or combat robot tanks
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.640]  All of it, they don't need sleep
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:50.640]  They never stop, they're worked on by robots that are delivered from you and robot ships
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  They've got some technicians on board in case there's problems, but that's what this is all going towards is total automation
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:03.640]  Right, in addition to the technology itself being dangerous, there's also the possibility of human hackers taking over
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  We saw you as the drone being taken over by Iranians
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  If the same thing happens with the more capable controllers
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:17.640]  And they try to use the same technologies against us, that could really backfire
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:24.640]  So there's quite a few scenarios we need to think about before developing and deploying those technologies
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:32.640]  I agree with you that this all needs to be basically heavily restricted immediately
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.640]  Because the probability is it's going to cause disaster
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.640]  And I'm all for technological development
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  And I know the system shuts down things that are disruptive to the economy
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.640]  Freer forms of energy and things, I don't think that should be restricted
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:54.640]  But AI systems, super high-powered anti-matter weapons, the Air Force admits they're developing
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.640]  All this type of stuff, it just needs to be restricted
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.640]  I agree with you and the combination of those technologies is completely unpredictable
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:10.640]  If AI is doing the research, if AI is performing experiments on nanotechnology and genetic algorithms
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:14.640]  No one can possibly even estimate what that is also going to be like
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.640]  Well, you talked about it modeling people's brains
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.640]  A lot of the most promising stuff are these interfaces
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.640]  That's why I'm saying you could actually get some human traits
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:27.640]  If the model it builds from at its kernel or base is a human mind
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:32.640]  It could get some of the good traits of emotion or bad, but that...
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.640]  Again, I'm not a computer scientist like you are
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.640]  If it's modeling off humans and being programmed by the technocrats
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:42.640]  A lot of them are completely out of their minds, I don't know what these things are going to be like
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:47.640]  It's a very good question and it's important to know whose brain are we scanning
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  Whose model are we creating to be that powerful, so that's another unanswered question
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:57.640]  Exactly, if it was Mother Teresa or something, I might not be a problem, but what if it's some...
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.640]  It still could be a problem, great power corrupts absolutely
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.640]  So I won't trust any person to have that kind of capabilities
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.640]  I agree with you, Darrell in Oklahoma, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.640]  Exactly, if it was Mother Teresa or something
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  Turn your radio off, go ahead Darrell
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:17.640]  I got it off
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.640]  Hey, glad to meet you, I like you, man
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:20.640]  Hey, hi, Ron
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.640]  Ah, let's see, have you had anything to do with the NAO robot?
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.640]  No, no, I...
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  Your phone's really bad, I'm going to let you go
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:34.640]  NAO, well, tell us Darrell, what's an NAO?
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:35.640]  Well, he just hung up
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.640]  I know what it is, it's a robot framework they use for a lot of research, especially in education and such
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.640]  I don't develop physical robots, I like playing with them, but I don't actually...
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:50.640]  You're dealing actually with the brains
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.640]  Yes, I'm more interested in minds than bodies
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:57.640]  Let's talk to Hector in New Jersey, you're on the air, quickly please
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  Alex, I just want to tell you about what my professor revealed to us
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.640]  Talking about the dimensions of a supercomputer that exists right now currently in Alaska
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.640]  Which dovetails almost perfectly with what Nick Begich has been saying
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  He said that it was actually the size of the state of New Jersey
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.640]  And that it was aware of itself already
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:24.640]  Existing right now in the current time, it's the paradigm destroyer
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.640]  What do you mean a computer the size of New Jersey?
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  This professor went on to, in his lecture, reveal to all of us
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.640]  Which most of them were acting like potted plants
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  Stay there, I want to hear the name and details
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.640]  You are listening to GCN

[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:57.640]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:02.640]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.640]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:11.640]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.640]  They so pride in every stitch
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:19.640]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.640]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.640]  Where you need it most
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.640]  Blue diamond gussets got it
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:29.640]  Other stone
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:31.640]  We turned jeans inside out
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.640]  Diamond gusset jeans
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:36.640]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:40.640]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.640]  So you can ride all day with confidence

[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:48.640]  Diamond gusset jeans got it
[01:59:48.640 --> 02:00:14.640]  Others don't
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:20.640]  Live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:23.640]  Alex Jones
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:31.640]  Dr. Roman V. Jampoloski is our guest professor, director, cyber security lab
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:38.640]  You can read his whole bio at theluiville.edu.ry
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.640]  And he joins us, we only have like five minutes left with him
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:47.640]  And we were just talking to Vincent Montana
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.640]  What's the name of the professor? What's the name of the computer?
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.640]  Where was this that the people are telling you this?
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.640]  Actually, my name is Hector. The name of the college that I go to
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:00.640]  I can't really tell you the name of the professor for fear of the knowledge that he's talking about
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:04.640]  But what he said was the dimensions of it is that it is the size of New Jersey
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.640]  But it resides in Alaska, which leads me to believe that it's underground
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.640]  The other thing that he said was that it was conscious
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.640]  It is conscious, it is self-aware
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.640]  I'm not going to listen to this when somebody says their professor told them but it's secret
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.640]  He said he's giving a lecture
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.640]  I mean, number one, they could be talking about your intestines, you know, stretch out 500 feet or whatever
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:28.640]  Like all the contours of something, you know, has the surface of New Jersey
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:33.640]  I could see that with all the motherboards or whatever or all the computing space
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:36.640]  But I just don't get off into the speculation, thank you
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:40.640]  I think that's a great question, though, that that leads me to with our guest
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.640]  Doctor, what is the most advanced computer that we know of right now?
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:48.640]  Well, to first answer the question he claimed the computer was conscious
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:53.640]  How would they know we don't have any tests to see if a system is conscious or not
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.640]  So that alone is very suspicious sounding to me
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.640]  As far as the most advanced system, there is again very few ways to test intelligence in general
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:06.640]  We have IQ tests for humans, some claim they are biased
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.640]  There is no way to test intelligence across species, humans
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.640]  How does deep blue beat the best chess masters now?
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.640]  Brute force, they use so much computational power
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.640]  They essentially tried every possibility up to a certain limit
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:24.640]  A lot of progress in AI has been made based on improvements in hardware
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.640]  Algorithms which couldn't do it before as better computers become available
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.640]  Are quite capable of doing things
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.640]  Speech recognition, translation
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.640]  A perfect example of cases where just having a lot of data, powerful computers
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.640]  Allows you to do what you couldn't do before without really any novel ideas
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:49.640]  The best system I would say right now is again IBM's Watson computer
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.640]  And it also relies on essentially downloading internet to the local disk
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:57.640]  And having access to complete information about everything
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.640]  So it's another example of brute force approach where it's tremendously successful
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:04.640]  Everything is at all with that
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.640]  Very interesting, Vince and Montana, go ahead, Vince
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.640]  Dr. Amplansky, very interesting show
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.640]  Given that all the computers are military based
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.640]  And all the heuristics that this system that's going to develop
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.640]  All the heuristics are going to be contaminated with military applications that kill humans
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:31.640]  How are we ever going to write a prime directive rule that makes human life sacrosanct?
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.640]  Wouldn't we be better?
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  Exactly, it's the opposite of the rule that Isaac Asimov came up with
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.640]  They're being designed from the beginning to kill
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:43.640]  Well, rules typically don't work in such systems
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.640]  If a system is smart enough it will always find loopholes
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:49.640]  In any set of rules you'll develop for it
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.640]  We see it with humans and laws we pass
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.640]  That's why every year we post another million new laws
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.640]  Just to keep up with smart people coming up with all the loopholes
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.640]  So the approach of just hard coding, don't kill humans
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.640]  Will probably not work as illustrated by every novel Asimov ever wrote
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.640]  We need something better and that's exactly the type of research I'm advocating
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.640]  For trying to figure out how to develop systems which
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.640]  Essentially don't want to harm humans, not because we are
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.640]  Yeah, we better not just try to count on them being well behaved
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.640]  We better be in control right now
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  Exactly
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.640]  Alright, very impressive professor, thank you so much
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.640]  Hopefully in a month or so you'll come back with us
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:33.640]  And take more calls because this is just riveting
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.640]  And I really appreciate your time
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.640]  Thank you so much for having me, I would love to be back
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.640]  It was awesome having you, wow
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.640]  That's the type of stuff that gives our society a future
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.640]  Is having discussions about this, not about Britney Spears
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  Or about Jay-Z or whatever, but about this type of stuff
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.640]  This is what's amazing, this is what's interesting
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  This is what is thought provoking
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:24.640]  Big news straight ahead, it's important, stay with us
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:30.640]  Thank you so much for watching this video
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.640]  5starsoap.com
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:03.640]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:06.640]  Into why, even though I had a pretty good size meal
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:07.640]  That I was still starving
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:09.640]  And my research led me to a well known fact
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.640]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:15.640]  Here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:18.640]  Are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:21.640]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:25.640]  To rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:29.640]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:31.640]  And discovered Young Jevity
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.640]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you

[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:35.640]  Becoming artificially aware and trying to take over
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.640]  Human society, most of the top computer scientists believe
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:40.640]  It's going to happen, many of them say
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.640]  Like Rick Herswell, you can't stop it
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:45.640]  When we go to your calls, I'm sure people are holding to cover that
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:48.640]  Our guest is gone, I need to get back into some more of the news

[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.640]  I'm so obsessed with the news and information now
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.640]  That I never even plug products, books, videos, sponsors, any of it
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.640]  And I think that's a bad thing, A, because
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.640]  This is key information to get out of the public
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.640]  And B, it funds the InfoWars operation
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.640]  And I want to thank all of you that get subscriptions at

[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.640]  We're covering this so we can be aware of it and be empowered
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:52.640]  You know, if I say, hey, to my son, you know, we're going to go out to the lake today
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.640]  We're going to be fishing
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.640]  Be careful when you walk off for me in tall grass
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.640]  Walk on the paths, there can be water moccasins
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:01.640]  It's not, be fearful, it's be in charge

[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:14.640]  By MIT-educated design engineer
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:20.640]  Bloodlines Illuminati by Fritz Springmeyer
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.640]  Behind the Green Mask, a Gen. 21 excellent book to get to every county commissioner
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:26.640]  City Councils
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.640]  By the way, I've seen a couple big cities
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:31.640]  What Brian College Station passed a law against a Gen. 21
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.640]  And found out they were under it and kicked it out
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.640]  Just Monday I saw that, I mean, there's stuff happening
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.640]  Romans 13, how the government uses this submit to corrupt government
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.640]  When that's not what the Bible says
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.640]  It's all your pastors
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:46.640]  And of course, all orders get a free citizen rollbook
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.640]  Bill of Rights Constitution, Declaration of Independence
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:51.640]  And more famous quotes, jury notification
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:54.640]  And we also are doing a deal at cost
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:57.640]  Where it's, the computer's got to have something put in there
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:00.640]  So it's one penny and then the shipping
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:03.640]  It's 4.95, which it actually loses money
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:06.640]  So I don't know how long I'm going to keep this going because I can't lose it
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  But you get 100
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.640]  You are the resistance cards with my websites on the back to help give out to people
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:15.640]  Great Info War Weapon, listeners have recommended this
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.640]  A citizen rollbook and two bumper stickers
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:21.640]  And you pay for the shipping 4.95 and that's what it cost me
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640]  The shipping and handling actually ends up costing me a little bit more
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:25.640]  After, you know, the guy's packaging and stuff
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.640]  The point is, that's there, we're going to keep that going
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.640]  At least for a few weeks
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.640]  And it's having a big effect
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.640]  So infowars.com
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.640]  You have no idea the calls we get
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:37.640]  The people on the street, so many people wake up
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  Police officers, school teachers, mayors, military people
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.640]  Everybody, when somebody just gives them one of my films that they've copied
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.640]  Or a business card that people print it up
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.640]  Or people write infowars.com on the money
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.640]  I'm not saying do that because it's some little federal thing
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.640]  But that's how a lot of folks tell me they're waking up
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.640]  So whatever you do, take action today
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.640]  And thank you for supporting us

[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:13.640]  Okay, you know, I don't know where to start with a stack
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:16.640]  I mean, this is all just crazy, the amount of news
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.640]  I got to sum up in the first hour, but let me just start now
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:21.640]  As best I can ahead of your calls
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.640]  Daily Mail, it makes me ill
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:25.640]  How many people talk about ripping clients off?
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.640]  Goldman Sachs' executive quits over firm's toxic culture
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:32.640]  An extraordinary resignation letter
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:35.640]  And I want to try to get this guy on, this just broke
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.640]  Boy, I don't know how long he's going to be alive
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.640]  And of course, their emails have gotten out
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:41.640]  Where they talk about selling people stuff
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.640]  That they know is absolute crud and laughing at them
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.640]  I mean, it's one thing to rip somebody off
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:48.640]  That's bad enough they giggle and snicker and enjoy
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:50.640]  Or when, you know, there's an earthquake
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.640]  They say, oh, that was my wallet falling
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.640]  I mean, it's because I've learned people who are criminal
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  And don't have a soul or whose soul is darkened
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:00.640]  They...
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:02.640]  It's not...
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.640]  They just can't help but rip everybody off
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.640]  I mean, who wants to be around that?
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:08.640]  It just creates a toxic society
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.640]  Of course, you have the Timberwolf emails
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.640]  That were division of Goldman Sachs
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.640]  Where they're like, this is absolute bleepings
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:15.640]  I can't wait to rip my clients off
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:18.640]  You know, just like, wow
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.640]  Wow, and these are the people that are funding
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:22.640]  The global carbon taxes, the takeovers
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:24.640]  The African invasions, I mean, they're...
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.640]  The takeover of Europe
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:28.640]  This is who runs the global government
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.640]  And there are a bunch of guys going, I'm only worth
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.640]  10 billion and that other guy's worth 40
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.640]  Rip everybody off, I've got a...
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:36.640]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:38.640]  And they think they're the elite because they don't have empathy
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.640]  Or that basic human programming
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.640]  To not be an absolute piece of garbage
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.640]  And they're all a bunch of surly, sharky, scum
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:49.640]  And I mean, I...
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:51.640]  My instinct is to stomp their heads in
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.640]  But I'm not going to do that
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:55.640]  They're criminals, we're going to expose them
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:57.640]  And more people are going to get it
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:59.640]  You know, you guys that are evil wonder why your kids
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:01.640]  Suffer horrible fates, why you're so unhappy
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.640]  And you just think more is going to...
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:06.640]  The fancy restaurants, everybody kissing your rump
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.640]  I mean, I've gotten enough celebrity
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.640]  Not looking for it to know it's not fun
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.640]  It's not fun
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:15.640]  And, you know, I've got a decent little house
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.640]  And cars that run well, why would I want more?
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.640]  Well, for them, it's just all about power
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.640]  Just absolutely off the chart information
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.640]  A Goldman Sachs executive has dealt a deeply embarrassing blow
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:32.640]  Well, who do you think know me, Prince?
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.640]  She worked for him as a managing director
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.640]  And exposed him eight years ago, she left
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:39.640]  I mean, because you just can't be around people going
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:41.640]  Ha, rip everybody off, I mean, literally
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.640]  Cackling and giggling, I've...
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.640]  I mean, I've read the descriptions
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:47.640]  Tapes have been released over the years
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:49.640]  I mean, it's like cackling demons
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.640]  They love wrecking everything
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.640]  They want to wreck your life
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.640]  They want to triple your gas prices
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:55.640]  And triple your water prices
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:56.640]  They want to bankrupt you
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.640]  They like seeing you homeless
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:14:59.640]  They like it, they like it
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:01.640]  They don't want a rising tide to raise all ships
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:03.640]  They want to destroy the free market
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:05.640]  They're blaming capitalism
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:07.640]  When they're doing the opposite of it
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.640]  A Goldman Sachs executive has dealt the deeply embarrassing blow
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  To the firm by quitting an open letter
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.640]  In which he lambasts the working environment
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:16.640]  As a toxic and destructive
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:18.640]  Boy, that says it lightly
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:20.640]  Greg Smith, an executive director
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:22.640]  Who worked with the New York based investment bank
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:24.640]  For 12 years, claimed he was more interested
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.640]  In making money for itself and its clients
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.640]  Well, yeah, they always bet against their clients
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:30.640]  Well-known, that's what came out
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.640]  And a scathing resignation letter
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:34.640]  Published in the New York Times on Wednesday
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:37.640]  He reveals, staff have so little respect for clients
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.640]  They call them muppets
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.640]  And talk of ripping eyeballs out
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.640]  Well, yeah
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:44.640]  And again, these are little boys
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:45.640]  I've been around these people
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:47.640]  Max Kaiser's been one of them and exposed them
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.640]  And, you know, got his soul back and left it all
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.640]  I mean, they call them scum
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.640]  They call you filth
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.640]  You know that face in the crowd
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:57.640]  Guys, YouTube face in the crowd
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:02.640]  I've seen where, you know, the famous actor
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:05.640]  Is there, and it's the end of the show
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:06.640]  He didn't know the audience still on
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:10.640]  He's going, hello scum idiots
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:12.640]  And the show's all about how he loves everybody
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:13.640]  And all this
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:15.640]  That's why I hate Angelina Jolie and all these people
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:17.640]  I mean, they know they're evil
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:19.640]  It's all real funny to them
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:22.640]  They know it's about a murder operation in Africa
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:23.640]  And they're gonna get awards for it
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.640]  And be called the humanitarian
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:28.640]  And the guys at the end of the TV show
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:30.640]  He's like, hello morons
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.640]  You scum, see you next week
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:35.640]  He doesn't know the audience still going out
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:39.640]  And that's what I can't stand about these people
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:42.640]  I mean, they're so delusional that they don't care
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.640]  Because they're making bigger bonuses
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:47.640]  While reactors everywhere are leaking
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:49.640]  90-plus percent
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:54.640]  I mean, listen, cancer isn't fun
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.640]  Because you giggle and they're like a bad 10-year-old
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.640]  I've been around some of these people
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.640]  I've been on airline flights, I've run into them at events
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.640]  Presidents of these big brokerages
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:09.640]  And they are like gibbering, giggling demons
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.640]  And then they've always got like Lucifer types above them
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:13.640]  They're real cold and getting off on it
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.640]  And look everybody like they're upside a pork
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.640]  They want to eat or something
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:21.640]  You guys are like people that don't pee in the pool
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:23.640]  You poop in the pool
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:25.640]  And we're all in the pool and you're in there pooping
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.640]  I hate to be gross, but that's the analogy
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:28.640]  Telling us how great it is
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:31.640]  And man, it didn't great, okay?
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:33.640]  Doesn't mean I'm on some high horse
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.640]  And I don't do things that toxify society
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:36.640]  But you know what, I don't like it
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:38.640]  I try to be a good person
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.640]  Not because I'm weak, because I'm strong scum
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.640]  And I'm sick of strong people
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:47.640]  Letting little cowardly pieces of trash
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:49.640]  Like you control society
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  I want humans in the entire universe
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:55.640]  The galaxy wide everywhere
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.640]  I want our species to survive
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:58.640]  You filth
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.640]  I realize my life is short, scum
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.640]  I want to live through the species
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:07.640]  I want to continue on as my ancestors
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:09.640]  Wanted us to continue on
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:11.640]  You are malfunctioning cancer
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:13.640]  And I'm sick of you
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.640]  And I'm tired of good people
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:18.640]  Being coward and not rising up against you
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:21.640]  I want to info rise against these people
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:24.640]  And I want to hammer them down
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.640]  I want to spread the word
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:29.640]  As humans have done since our creation
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:34.640]  To each other with the truth and defeat the enemy
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.640]  I cannot be ruled by a bunch of
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.640]  Arrested development scumbags
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  Who go to award ceremonies every night
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.640]  To feed their narcissistic out of control paradigm
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:49.640]  These people are a joke, but because
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:51.640]  We have blind spots to them
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:55.640]  Because we're good inherently in our hearts
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:57.640]  We're inherently bad in our flesh
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:59.640]  But our hearts inherently are good
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:01.640]  We are blind to them because
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:03.640]  Even though we're desperately wicked
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.640]  We still know we want the good
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:08.640]  You understand that paradox?
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.640]  We're desperately wicked, but we know the difference
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.640]  And we choose good, it's the choice
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:18.640]  These people have chosen to be divorced from reality
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:19.640]  You can go read the whole article
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.640]  We got it linked to them, FullWars.com
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:25.640]  I'm coughing a lot today, the oak just hit
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:27.640]  It's not really like Cedar where it gives me a really bad headache
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:30.640]  It just makes me cough a lot
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.640]  So the oak are going crazy right now
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.640]  Just the start of it, so I'm coughing a bit
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.640]  Alright, I'm going to try to shut up
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:37.640]  See, I just went to one article and spent 10 minutes on it
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:39.640]  I got to come back, and there's like over 100 here
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:40.640]  They're all off the charts
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:42.640]  I got to try to hit something
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:44.640]  Who knows what I'll hit?
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.640]  We're going to be right back, but I mean it's just
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:48.640]  Ripping off, old ladies, man
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:49.640]  It's just, you know what?
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.640]  And they've got all the laws written so they can do it
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:55.640]  And they own the big private prisons
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:57.640]  With the cops cramming people in it for their profit
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:58.640]  I mean, it's got to end
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:27.640]  These people got to go down
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.640]  And discovered Young Jevity

[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.640]  Or in foreclosure
[02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:07.640]  Maybe the bank already foreclosed on you
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:10.640]  Don't sit around being a victim of bank fraud

[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:31.640]  At the closing
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:34.640]  And maybe, like me, you will go after them
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:36.640]  Did you know 78% of home loans
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:39.640]  In the last 10 years violated consumer credit laws?
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.640]  We should not let the banks get away with this fraud

[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:56.640]  Or call 855-373-4948
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:00.640]  That's 1-855-373-4948
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:04.640]  That's what it sounds like
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:06.640]  When a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:08.640]  That looks like no one is home
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:10.640]  Don't let your home be the next target
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.640]  Make it look like someone is home watching television
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:13.640]  With fake TV
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:16.640]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.640]  That makes the same light as a real television
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:21.640]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:23.640]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer
[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.640]  But is far more convincing to burglars
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.640]  Fake TV deters burglars
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:29.640]  Costs far less than an alarm
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:31.640]  And is highly recommended by numerous police departments
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.640]  Use it anytime you're away from home
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:36.640]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.640]  Go to faketv.com
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:41.640]  Or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:44.640]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95

[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:49.640]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you

[02:23:54.640 --> 02:24:05.640]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.640]  The Alex Jones Show
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.640]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:25.640]  Here's a report that got top-linked on Drudge today
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.640]  Major U.S. airport to evict TSA screeners
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:30.640]  Orlando Sanford International could prompt stampede
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:32.640]  Of other opt-outs
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:35.640]  Yeah, how do you have federal goons that are grabbing everybody?
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:37.640]  And we have a photo there of them actually grabbing people
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.640]  Right between the crotch and squeezing
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:44.640]  One of America's busiest airports, Orlando Sanford International
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:46.640]  Has announced
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:50.640]  It will opt out of using TSA workers to screen passengers
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.640]  A move which threatens the highly unpopular federal agencies
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:56.640]  Role and other airports across the nation
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:58.640]  People are like, well now it's going to be private
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:00.640]  Well at least they'll get pressure put on them
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:03.640]  And when it's an old man they see that has all four of his arms
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.640]  And legs blown off, flying every week
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:07.640]  They'll know and let the guy through
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:10.640]  Who are the feds to say how all this is supposed to be done
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.640]  Or microwave oven machines, the rest of it
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:15.640]  The president of the airport said Tuesday he would
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:19.640]  Apply again to use private operators to screen passengers
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:21.640]  Using federal standards and oversight
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:23.640]  Why are there federal standards over it?
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:25.640]  Get the feds out, man
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:27.640]  There are a bunch of croaks that ship guns into Mexico
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:29.640]  And it goes on from there
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:31.640]  So it's not perfect
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:34.640]  But it shows that the pressure is starting to work
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:36.640]  Starting to happen
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:40.640]  We heard suicide attack bid on U.S. Defense Secretary
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:43.640]  It turns out a car burst into flames
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:44.640]  Sounds like a staged event
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.640]  The fact that it wasn't a big car bomb when it's plane landed
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:50.640]  Who knows, but it just sounds like stuff they do
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:52.640]  Also Texas Planned Parenthood CEO
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:55.640]  Arrested for indecent exposure
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.640]  Isn't that just special?
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:00.640]  Planned Parenthood is a eugenics organization
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:03.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, plain and simple
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:08.640]  And it goes on to go over exactly what's happening
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:10.640]  On that front
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:12.640]  As I told you this was coming
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.640]  Angelina Jolie in court as ICC finds Congo warlord
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:18.640]  Guilty of using child soldiers
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:20.640]  So now they don't, it's just a perfect way to
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:22.640]  Invade whoever you want
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:24.640]  And of course CBS News reports they've entered
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:26.640]  Resolutions in the Congress to launch
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.640]  A continent wide invasion quote anywhere
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:33.640]  To protect civilians, so just a blank check
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.640]  We're going to invade to protect civilians
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:37.640]  Yeah, that's what the globalists use our military for
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:40.640]  Is to protect civilians just like Libby and Iraq
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:42.640]  Sure, sure, mm-hmm
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:44.640]  The official U.N. policy is to reduce population
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.640]  So is the U.S. policy
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.640]  Under State Department of Random 200
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.640]  Go read it, go read it, go read it, go read it
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:53.640]  Don't just go, oh, he says that
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:54.640]  No, that's what it is
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.640]  Our government, our military
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:59.640]  Is an engine of wickedness
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.640]  Our troops are good people
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:05.640]  On average, but the mission is about
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:08.640]  Drugs and child kidnapping and weapons sales
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:10.640]  And evil
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:13.640]  10% roughly of world opium supply
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.640]  Came out of Afghanistan pre-911
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:18.640]  After the liberation of it
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:20.640]  Where they just arrested some of the Taliban forces
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:22.640]  That warned them about al-Qaeda
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:24.640]  That's actually who they arrested
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:26.640]  Who knew it was all set up
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:28.640]  Go look it up
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.640]  It's now 92 to 93% of world opium supply
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:34.640]  A 13 to 14 fold depending on which number
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:36.640]  You look at increase
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.640]  Just side issue
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.640]  But the whole county 2012 thing
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:44.640]  That I told you would be used to launch a bunch of new wars
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:46.640]  It's now imploding, but they don't care
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.640]  It's not coming out that it's all fraud
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:50.640]  But they don't care, it's just there's a boogeyman
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:51.640]  Somewhere in Africa
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:53.640]  It's like saying al-Qaeda might attack
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:55.640]  So we gotta set up checkpoints on every highway
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:57.640]  There might be a bad man somewhere
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:00.640]  So you gotta have your house searched
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.640]  And the UN and AFRICOM are openly slaughtering people
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:06.640]  Especially the UN
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:08.640]  All over Africa on record
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:11.640]  And Paul Watson and Kurt have all written countless articles
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:15.640]  Where it's just admitted the UN is slaughtering people
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.640]  It's like, well, the UN's investigating
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:20.640]  Yeah, their peacekeepers helped the mercenaries
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.640]  Killed a few thousand here and they're gonna get them off the land
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.640]  We don't know why, never mind that
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:27.640]  Angelina Jolie loves kids
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:29.640]  Look, here's a video of her feeding them
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:30.640]  I mean, come on
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:32.640]  And she calls for all these wars too
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.640]  Isn't she a nice lady when she's not doing weird rituals
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:38.640]  With blood and emitting it, wearing blood ampoules around her neck
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.640]  With satanic runes all over her body
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:42.640]  And admits she's into weird death cults
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:44.640]  Making movies about the Illuminati
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.640]  And constantly playing the part of witches
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.640]  And she's a good person
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:51.640]  Who went over there to help those little black kids
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:53.640]  Because she's a nice person
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.640]  I can look right into her and see what she is
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:57.640]  But I don't just go off that
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:59.640]  I then go actually do the research
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:01.640]  And she is a abomination
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.640]  And yes, I mean it when I say arrest her
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:08.640]  Unbelievable
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.640]  See, I'm done playing games with these people
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:11.640]  I'm done
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:13.640]  And I know you're done
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:16.640]  Now, when I come back, I gotta move even quicker through news here
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.640]  Gun shops cite Obama re-election fears as sales surge
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:21.640]  There's also major studies showing
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.640]  The public believes that, quote, major catastrophe
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:25.640]  Or collapse is imminent
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:26.640]  I don't think that's the case
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:28.640]  It's gonna be just a slow unraveling
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:31.640]  But there could be some bigger potholes on the way
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:34.640]  And that they don't trust the government
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.640]  Yes, the previous records have been doubled
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.640]  And then doubled again and then doubled again
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:41.640]  There's just, I mean, I've gone to gun stores
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:42.640]  They're almost out of everything
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:43.640]  There's just snatching, ammo's gone
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:45.640]  People are just, ah, what happens to government evil?
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:48.640]  It's like because deep down the human survival instinct
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.640]  Knows we're in deep trouble
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:53.640]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run
[02:29:53.640 --> 02:30:21.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:25.640]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:27.640]  And now, new socialist legislation
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:29.640]  Is only compounding the problem
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:30.640]  Number 4
[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:32.640]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:35.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:36.640]  From weather-related onages
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:37.640]  Number 5
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:40.640]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:41.640]  And peace of mind
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:43.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.640]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:46.640]  One of my old sponsors

[02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:03.640]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:06.640]  And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:09.640]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:12.640]  And deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:15.640]  By breathing the solution through the lungs
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:17.640]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:19.640]  For airborne pathogens and viruses
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:23.640]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:26.640]  With your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:29.640]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:31.640]  Instantly into the bloodstream
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:33.640]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:35.640]  Of nano-silver products
[02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:38.640]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:40.640]  With the Silver Lungs Generator
[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:42.640]  Very easy to follow

[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:31.640]  Once the horse leaves the barn on World War III
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:33.640]  Open World Government
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:36.640]  Once the AI gets out of the bottle
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.640]  Once that genie is out
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.640]  Once they test an antimatter weapon and things don't go right
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:44.640]  Which the Air Force admits they've had for a decade
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:47.640]  But the details remain classified
[02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:49.640]  It's always the tales are classified
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:53.640]  They want everybody to know they've got it
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:55.640]  And I look at how the elite spent all their time
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:34:00.640]  Trying to dumb down and poison and hurt the general public
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:04.640]  Instead of being in control of what they're doing
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.640]  It just shows that, again, it's a paradox
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.640]  They're in control to a great extent
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:11.640]  They're trying to set up World Government
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.640]  But they're not even in control of themselves
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.640]  And all the evil they're doing is blowing back on them
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:23.640]  Because they're not in full control
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:28.640]  They're control freaks who are actually endangering everybody
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:30.640]  And lusting after every power that's out there
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:34.640]  So they haphazardly test and try to develop
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:41.640]  Every weapon system you can imagine
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:44.640]  So that nobody else gets it first
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:48.640]  But then they're endangering everyone by doing that
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.640]  I mean, what a disgusting, pathetic elite
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:56.640]  That wants to put poison in the food and water
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.640]  To give people all sorts of degenerative diseases
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:01.640]  And kill people early
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:06.640]  And wanting to dumb down people in the schools on record
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:10.640]  Just so you can control everybody
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:14.640]  I mean, wrap your mind around how pathetic that is
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:16.640]  But then I think about the general public
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.640]  A good 30% of people I run into
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:23.640]  Are mad when anybody else does well
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.640]  Hate people that are good looking
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:30.640]  Hate people that have a talent
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.640]  Are totally materialistic
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:37.640]  And are just really bad news
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:44.640]  And that's where the globalists get their minions from
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:49.640]  We gotta realize, folks, good people need to start learning to fight
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:51.640]  I know a lot of good people are like, well, just ignore it
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.640]  Move along, that scum isn't worth it
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.640]  No, you gotta route out the scum
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:05.640]  You gotta show them their place
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:06.640]  Let me mention a few other headlines
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:10.640]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:11.640]  Look at the gun news
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:12.640]  Record gun sales everywhere
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:14.640]  And I saw a couple articles this week
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.640]  I never got to
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:17.640]  Where there are resting people again
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:21.640]  That draw guns in art class
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:22.640]  They don't say, oh, I'm drawing a gun
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:23.640]  Like I have at home, I'm gonna come kill you
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  No, just, oh, look, I drew a picture of a superhero with a gun
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:27.640]  I mean, what's all over TV?
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:33.640]  What do we all draw as children?
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:34.640]  I actually dug up some drawings
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:35.640]  One of my uncles did
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:36.640]  I've got them framed out here
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.640]  It's like soldiers on a battlefield shooting at each other
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.640]  It's funny
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.640]  That's what all little boys draw
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.640]  Well, now you go to jail for that
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:48.640]  Well, it goes one further in the thought crime
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.640]  John Wilkes Booth, Bobbleheads, pulled from Gettysburg gift shop
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:55.640]  Because he had a pistol in his hand
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:58.640]  And that's not appropriate
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:04.640]  At a national park for someone to be sold with a gun in their hand
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:09.640]  And the park service is very apologetic
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:10.640]  Not making that up
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:11.640]  Here it is
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:14.640]  John Wilkes Booth, Bobblehead, pulled from Gettysburg shop
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:16.640]  I think I've been to the Gettysburg gift shop
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:17.640]  In fact, I have
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.640]  I think my mother got me a little gold-colored bronze
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:23.640]  She did pencil sharpener
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:24.640]  That's a cannon
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:25.640]  I guess you can't have that
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:27.640]  In fact, where is that?
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:33.640]  I saw that a few years ago in the garage
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:35.640]  I mean, every one of those Civil War parks I've been to
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:40.640]  They got cannons
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.640]  See, there's no lobby to protect the image of a gun
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:46.640]  So they're banning that
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:48.640]  And when you can ban the image
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:49.640]  You can then ban the real thing
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.640]  See how they do that?
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.640]  And they are coming after the ammo too
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  That's a big, big, big problem we face
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:59.640]  Remember last year, the Energy Secretary said
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.640]  We are going to shut down massive numbers of coal power plants
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.640]  That aren't owned by the insiders
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:07.640]  Increase your prices
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:08.640]  Well, he then also said
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:10.640]  We like higher gas prices
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:12.640]  That's good for the environment
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:14.640]  And they said, this recession is good
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:15.640]  Lowers carbon footprint
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:17.640]  In fact, guys, just type in
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:19.640]  Recession good or depression good
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.640]  To lower carbon footprint
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:23.640]  You forget that we can show folks watching on
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:25.640]  PrisonPlanet.tv or if you're a radio listener
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:27.640]  Just go search engine it
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:31.640]  But now he's been questioned in Congress
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.640]  Senator Mike Lee about it
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:35.640]  And he said, since I walked in the door
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:36.640]  Secretary of Energy
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.640]  I've been doing everything in our power
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.640]  In our powers
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.640]  To do what we can to reduce gas prices
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:46.640]  Senator Chu told the Senate hearing
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:47.640]  They went on to say
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:49.640]  So you no longer share the view about
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:50.640]  It's good for the earth
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:51.640]  And it goes on
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:53.640]  See, they just call it good for the earth
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:55.640]  I mean, I remember the city council
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.640]  A few months ago said, yeah
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:58.640]  There'll be a 20 to 80% increase
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.640]  Depending on what type of residential
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.640]  User you are
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:04.640]  Or non-profit user like churches
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.640]  Of course, energy is cheaper
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:09.640]  Than never been in Texas
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:10.640]  All these power plants
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.640]  And they got on the news
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:13.640]  And they said, yeah
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:15.640]  We're going to charge you 80% more for the earth
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:17.640]  No, it's for multinationals
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:18.640]  Ripping us off
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:20.640]  That's who it's for
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:22.640]  But it's like the Goldman Sachs
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:23.640]  Emails and memos are out
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:24.640]  Where they call their customers
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:25.640]  Scum idiots
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:26.640]  Let's rip them off
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:27.640]  The highest levels
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:28.640]  I mean, it's like
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:30.640]  We're going to rip them off
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:31.640]  And double and triple their water
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:32.640]  And power prices like we've done
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:33.640]  In the third world
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:34.640]  What do we call it?
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:35.640]  Tell them it's for the earth
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:36.640]  And they tell the trendies
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:37.640]  How the trendies go, rip me off
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:39.640]  I mean, it's just like
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:41.640]  Because they get into it
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:42.640]  You can tell a trend
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:43.640]  Here they are ripping you off
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:44.640]  And they get this glazed look
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:45.640]  Do this little
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:46.640]  I don't want to say effeminate
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:47.640]  It's not fair to women
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:49.640]  But these men do like this little
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.640]  I can't even do it
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:51.640]  It's like a nilly little thing
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:53.640]  And they go, say
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:54.640]  In fact, guys, queue it up
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:55.640]  I told you
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.640]  I wanted it
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:57.640]  Then you got it
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:39:58.640]  This is it
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:00.640]  The county 2012
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:02.640]  Do a screening in your area video
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:03.640]  Now, if you're a radio listener
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:04.640]  And then I'm going to your calls
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:06.640]  You cannot understand the magnitude
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:07.640]  This is not the main
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:08.640]  The county 2012
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:09.640]  With hundreds of millions of views
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:11.640]  Or whatever, total
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:13.640]  This is one of their promo ones
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:14.640]  Before they launched it
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.640]  This is all, again, government run
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:17.640]  It's now coming out
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:18.640]  As we knew
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:19.640]  I mean, I've watched it
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:20.640]  Until it was government run
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.640]  Now, it's adults
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.640]  Who look for about 30 years old
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:25.640]  Acting like they're five
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:26.640]  Talking to college students
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:27.640]  Because it's a new thing
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:29.640]  Not just being in a narcoleptic state
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:30.640]  Or being cowardly
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:32.640]  Or having a potbelly
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:33.640]  I mean, the average trend
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:34.640]  It resembles a pedophile
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:35.640]  It's like the style
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:38.640]  Not only is that what's going on
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:40.640]  Chicken-necked weakness
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.640]  It's like a god now
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:44.640]  And being totally passive
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:45.640]  Of being a huge jellyfish
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:46.640]  Slacker
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:47.640]  Who looks like a fried egg
[02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:48.640]  And a chair
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:50.640]  That is the culture of this, okay
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.640]  The worship of being destroyed
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:53.640]  Literally, I've now discovered
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:55.640]  The secrets of it
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:56.640]  And it's a cult everywhere
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:57.640]  It's south by southwest
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:59.640]  They're just hordes of these people
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:01.640]  They look like adults in diapers
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:02.640]  Or something, you know
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:03.640]  Just toddling along
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:08.640]  I mean, spiritually, it's a side issue
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:11.640]  It's incredibly evil, though
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:17.640]  Again, if you're a radio listener
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:18.640]  In fact, what's the title of it?
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:19.640]  I forget, it's something like
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:23.640]  Did it have a county 2012 screening?
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:25.640]  Book of screening for county 2012
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:26.640]  It's on YouTube
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.640]  And if you're a radio listener
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:29.640]  You'll just hear the voices
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:30.640]  But if you're a TV viewer
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:32.640]  At prismplanet.tv
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:35.640]  They actually jump up and down
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.640]  And go, oh my gosh, so trendy
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:41.640]  And we're gonna get conny
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:42.640]  Gonna get conny
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:44.640]  And you can tell they're government operatives
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:45.640]  They've got like evil in their eyes
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:46.640]  You know, hardcore
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:47.640]  I mean, the real spirit is
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:54.640]  Murderous invasion force
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:56.640]  Release us
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.640]  But on the surface
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:02.640]  And just cutting this room full of
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:04.640]  Trendy's old swarming around
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:05.640]  Like piranhas
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:07.640]  But again, it's that cover
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:08.640]  Of the armored warmock
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.640]  It has this cover
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:11.640]  If I'm friendly, I'm nice
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:15.640]  And it's going after the young people
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:17.640]  Who were in a narcoleptic state
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:19.640]  Are attracted like maws to flame
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:22.640]  To someone going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:24.640]  War, trendy, invade, ah
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:27.640]  Help the children, ah, ah, ah
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:28.640]  And I mean, and I'm like
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:29.640]  And that's where we're watching
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:30.640]  More of their videos
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:31.640]  And it gets worse
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:34.640]  I mean, I'm not joking folks
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.640]  I mean, and everyone's wearing like
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:39.640]  Pink and little green
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:40.640]  Non-threatening, you know, colors
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.640]  I'll, ooh, ooh, ooh
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:44.640]  And this is what we face
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.640]  So this is for college students
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.640]  And this is what college
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:50.640]  This is what men look like now
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:51.640]  On average
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:53.640]  In fact, now I used to bash men
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.640]  That are all into being big
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:55.640]  And muscular with tattoos
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:57.640]  And black on and going, ah, ah, ah
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:58.640]  Now I get it
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:00.640]  You don't want to be like these people
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.640]  Okay, I used to get mad at guys
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:03.640]  Trying to act tough
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:04.640]  No, no, that's good
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:05.640]  Do that
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:06.640]  In fact, I think I'm going to
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:08.640]  Just go all out with cut off sleeves
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:09.640]  And drive a big fast car
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.640]  And be like, ah, ah, because
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:12.640]  I mean, I'm starting to get it
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:14.640]  Men are running to that
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.640]  Because they see the armies
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:17.640]  At South by Southwest
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:18.640]  You go down there
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.640]  It's literally men in pastels
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:22.640]  And part of the effeminate thing
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:23.640]  Is they have these little
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:24.640]  Whispy beards and like bandanas
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:25.640]  And they're all walking around
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:26.640]  Bending their wrists
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:28.640]  Going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:30.640]  I mean, I don't know what it is
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.640]  Now there's men everywhere
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:32.640]  Wearing dresses
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:33.640]  I'm telling you
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:34.640]  It's like, they're just like
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:36.640]  Neural orders, slaughter me please
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:37.640]  Neural orders like
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:39.640]  Act like a jellyfish coward
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:40.640]  And giggle at all reality
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:42.640]  They're like, yes, yes
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:44.640]  Anyways
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:49.640]  Anyways, but the controller level ones
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:50.640]  Are just like
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:51.640]  Know what they're doing
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:52.640]  Alright, let's, again
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:53.640]  If you can't see the video
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:54.640]  I was already a listener
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:55.640]  He doesn't have the same effect
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:57.640]  Go ahead and roll it
[02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:00.640]  Now listen to me
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:05.640]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:06.640]  And babies of 2012
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:07.640]  I don't know if you've heard
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:09.640]  But this is the year this war
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:11.640]  Has to come to an end
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.640]  You're watching this
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:13.640]  Because you've heard of Kony
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:14.640]  And you're wondering
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:15.640]  What you can do
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:16.640]  To help finally
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:17.640]  Bring this war to an end
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:19.640]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:22.640]  Look, 1,500 screenings
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:23.640]  Ah, ah
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:24.640]  Zero, zero
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:25.640]  That's how many
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:27.640]  Be sure to do the rest
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.640]  We need you
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:29.640]  To look at him
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:30.640]  Oh, ah
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:31.640]  Hearing my voice
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:32.640]  Full of screening
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:33.640]  The higher year of 2012
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:34.640]  It's gonna be about
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:35.640]  No, watch right here
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:36.640]  Making sure people
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:37.640]  He starts hopping around
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:38.640]  His infamy
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:41.640]  Know that he is the world's worst
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:42.640]  Adolf Hitler
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:43.640]  Osama bin Laden
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:44.640]  Joseph Kony
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:46.640]  If we can start with the work
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:48.640]  We have been working
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:49.640]  Around the clock
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:50.640]  To bring you a movie
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:51.640]  It's a show
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:52.640]  Oh my gosh
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.640]  You're a place of worship
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:54.640]  In your classroom
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:55.640]  At your work
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:56.640]  The classroom
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:57.640]  7-Eleven
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:44:58.640]  7-Eleven
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:01.640]  6-1-9-5-6-2
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:02.640]  There he does
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:03.640]  He does a hopping dance
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:08.640]  1-9-5-6-2-7-5-9
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:09.640]  Oh yeah
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:11.640]  6-1-9-5-6-2
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:13.640]  This is for adults
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:15.640]  This is Sesame Street
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:16.640]  They go hello
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:17.640]  And you're like hello
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:18.640]  How are you
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:19.640]  Oh, I'm good
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.640]  How's your day at school
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:21.640]  I like that they work
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:22.640]  For AT&T or something
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:24.640]  That's an ad product placement
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:25.640]  Let's compete some more
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:26.640]  What would motivate you
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:28.640]  To actually pick up the phone
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:29.640]  And book a screening
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:30.640]  So easy to talk to us
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:31.640]  What's your life
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:33.140]  Like you're sitting on the other end
[02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:36.420]  Oh, sir, is it? We've got to launch a huge war!
[02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:39.940]  Oh my gosh, African white carnage at the...
[02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:41.540]  Hello!
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:47.540]  May all the spirits like red, red, red for red, red!
[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:53.340]  Oh, it's propaganda!
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:02.940]  Because we've got the State Department and all the stars behind us,
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:05.140]  and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you...
[02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:05.940]  I'll never let you down.
[02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:07.740]  I'm telling you, you are the future.
[02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:10.540]  Step into it, okay? Step into it. Peace.
[02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:12.940]  Step into it. Let me mind control you.
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:15.140]  Let me do some effeminate stuff now.
[02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:17.740]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:21.540]  Pentagon's like, how do we get the jellyfish into total war?
[02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:23.140]  Dance around in prance.
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:25.740]  You can see Black Ops guys are just sitting back, cold-blooded.
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:28.140]  This will work well on them. Good.
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:30.740]  Increase dosages in water immediately.
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:33.540]  Send out trendy, trendies to destroy them.
[02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:37.140]  There's nothing, I mean, there's nothing the trendies won't buy.
[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:38.540]  Oh my gosh, help me.
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:41.940]  Folks, if you couldn't see this, I mean, this was prancing.
[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:43.740]  Was it as bad as I said, guys?
[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:44.340]  It was worse.
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:46.140]  It was worse. And there's even...
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:50.940]  Now, listen, Nemo just ran in here with stacks of articles.
[02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:54.540]  NATO, Australia, England, France,
[02:46:54.540 --> 02:47:01.340]  Northcom troops are being dispatched for AFRICOM. The invasion of Africa is beginning.
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:03.340]  It has nothing to do with coming.
[02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:07.940]  It's about seizing land, fighting indigenous groups that are being forced off.
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:11.140]  Because it's all in the news that you insist in their gun and people down.
[02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:13.140]  But again, they've got guys prancing around going,
[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:17.140]  ah, ah, liberal, and Angelina's illegally going, ah, children.
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:18.140]  Again, that's the cover.
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:20.540]  Imagine the tank ramming the branch of Indians going,
[02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:23.140]  this is not an assault. Please come out. We are your friends.
[02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:24.740]  They come out, they shoot them.
[02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:26.140]  It's the same thing.
[02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:30.540]  I mean, imagine a military that first deploys people hopping around in pink shirts like,
[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.540]  ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a perfect deal.
[02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:35.540]  Like, oh, this is a non-threatening.
[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:37.140]  That's just like one of those fish.
[02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:40.140]  Guys, pull up the lanternfish.
[02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:42.540]  You know, it's like it's at 2,000 feet in deeper.
[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:46.140]  And it has that little lamp that looks like a tasty.
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:48.940]  Now, a lamprey's one that attaches and is parasitic.
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:51.740]  It's a lanternfish.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.540]  And it's got big, giant teeth.
[02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:56.540]  But in the total darkness, there's a lot of little,
[02:47:56.540 --> 02:47:58.940]  you know, glowing crustaceans and things that fish eat.
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:02.340]  So you think you're getting a big, juicy, non-threatening little goblet,
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:05.140]  but really, it's the lantern hanging.
[02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:06.140]  And that's what Coney is.
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:16.540]  Oh, oh, oh, it's, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:18.140]  I mean, that's, that's what we're dealing with here.
[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:22.640]  And I'm sick of it, and I'm calling you out scum.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:25.940]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:48:25.940 --> 02:48:27.140]  I cannot stand these people,
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:29.140]  does you find the lanternfish?
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:31.440]  Watch this, I'll show you.
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:38.140]  Lanternfish, lanternfish.
[02:48:38.140 --> 02:48:42.140]  You can also Google horrors of the deep.
[02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:44.440]  I found it, here it is, boom.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:47.640]  Just shut, lantern, lanternfish.
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:50.640]  The ultimate in trendiness.
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:52.640]  Oh look, Connie 2012.
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:55.640]  Oh look at the little Connie 2012.
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:56.640]  Little glowing.
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:58.640]  And then you can't see him right there.
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:01.640]  New World Order Rockefeller eugenics operation.
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:04.640]  In the dark all you see is, ah!
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:09.640]  Angelina Jolie right up shining in the darkness.
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:10.640]  Looks like a little fish.
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:13.640]  He sees that and says, I'll just swim over and eat that.
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:18.640]  Oh the African is coming.
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:20.640]  Loving, loving, loving.
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:22.640]  You can do it. Stop Connie.
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:24.640]  You know, Connie's like a whole skeleton on the bottom.
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:25.640]  Hadn't been seen in forever.
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:26.640]  Dual tiny, nothing.
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:29.640]  But it's like, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna fight.
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:31.640]  Oh, and then there's a little...
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:35.640]  Oh boy, I said I'd go to your phone calls and I'm out of control now, aren't I?
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:38.640]  Matthew and Genesee, thank you for holding during that.
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:39.640]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:41.640]  That was cleansing, though.
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:44.640]  I had to see a lot of the diaper wearers out there today and it was hard.
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:46.640]  Go ahead.
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:50.640]  Matthew, I guess you don't want to talk from Tennessee?
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:52.640]  I don't even hear him airing the call.
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:54.640]  My grandma wouldn't read this.
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:58.640]  I tell you what, there are some people who believe that if someone was busting your balls,
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:01.640]  it would make a difference, but it don't.
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:03.640]  We missed what you said at first.
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:05.640]  I think the folks airing the calls were away.
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:07.640]  Start over.
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:08.640]  No, not a problem.
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.640]  Okay, so we got a couple of issues with the artificial intelligence.
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:16.640]  More likely than not, the operating system that they are using for the artificial intelligence
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:18.640]  is a modified Linux system.
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:21.640]  But that's okay because there's no threat from Fukushima.
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:25.640]  I just go, eh, eh, eh, everything's okay, right?
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:26.640]  Well, okay.
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:29.640]  The first thing that we need to target in this situation are the predictive programs
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:31.640]  that help control the propaganda.
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:32.640]  Stay there.
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:34.640]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:36.640]  Man, that was cleansing.
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:40.640]  Man, for like a week I've been watching these Psyhop videos, just really getting to me.
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:44.640]  And then I saw a bunch of what they've created downtown.
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:46.640]  I mean, let me tell you, these are scary people.
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:48.640]  And I can tell you, a lot of them are CPSers.
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:50.640]  Oh, man, I tell you, Army's a potbellied.
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.640]  Coming at us hard here.
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:53.640]  Stay there.
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:55.640]  Oh, boy.

[02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:38.640]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:41.640]  between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:45.640]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:51.640]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:52.640]  The war is here.
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:54.640]  It's an infowar.
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:52:01.640]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:30.640]  And the propaganda is getting so bad.
[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:33.640]  The arrested development adults acting like children now.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:37.640]  I mean, Austin's like the capital of slackers and all of this.
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:39.640]  And I mean, it's pathetic.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.640]  It's pathetic.
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:43.640]  People need to grow up and get alive.
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:51.640]  But no, they're going to be the new social leaders calling for the invasion of Africa, which is now begun.
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:54.640]  One week after Coney, I said, that's a launch of war propaganda.
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:57.640]  Look at Bill Gates and all of them involved in it, funding it.
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.640]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:02.640]  It's like, that's a green tree.
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:04.640]  There's a green tree out in your yard.
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:05.640]  It's not hard.
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:09.640]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls a little bit overdrive so I can get to everybody.
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:11.640]  Oh, man, it makes me sick.
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:15.640]  If you saw the video, the office hadn't seen it yet and they thought I was joking about dancing.
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:17.640]  And I'm going, trendy, trendy.
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.640]  And they call for a war.
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:24.640]  They go, worse than Hitler, worse than bin Laden, it's some dead guy.
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:26.640]  And now they're invading all the countries.
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:32.640]  I mean, now wars are launched, not by Hitler stalling up their lying.
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:38.640]  But, you know, but by men prancing around, bending their wrist going, trendy, trendy, trendy.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:43.640]  And everybody's like, oh my, he just bent his wrist on camera and did a little leprechaun dance.
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:45.640]  Let's have war.
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:52.640]  And you've got swarming, idiot, trendies running around calling for war.
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:53.640]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:58.640]  Matthew, in Tennessee, we're getting into the whole AI situation with the scientist we had on earlier.
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:00.640]  Go ahead.
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:03.640]  Well, the question is now whether or not there is artificial intelligence.
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:07.640]  The question is what degree of intelligence is artificial at this time?
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:12.640]  Now, when we're looking at this situation, we have to get down, just like you were saying earlier, to the kernel, right?
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:15.640]  Because the kernel is programmed in objects.
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:21.640]  So when you think about one of the obstacles to this situation, it is programming the philosophy of people like Plato,
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:26.640]  people like Pythagoras into objects that the computer can then process.
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:28.640]  Right now, people get afraid of this.
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:30.640]  There's really no reason to be afraid.
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:36.640]  The truth of the matter is, is that if you have studied in your life and you understand what deception is,
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:42.640]  when people try to use the predictive programs for propaganda, you can identify that as a deception right away.
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.640]  So really what we're talking about is what do we do to free the minds of our countrymen?
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:47.640]  Right?
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:48.640]  Which is no small task.
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:56.640]  So what I am suggesting to you is that we need to get people like Mr. Stallman working on who wrote the predictive programs,
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:01.640]  who wrote the kernel for the larger mainframes that they are using for the artificial intelligence,
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.640]  because there's only so many brilliant people out there and they get recruited from university.
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:11.640]  So if you see someone who you knew in your class, who then disappeared into government work, you know who's working on it.
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:14.640]  So there's plenty of info warriors to research this sort of thing.
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:17.640]  We just need to get on top of the ball.
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:21.640]  Well, I hear you and it was well said and I agree with you.
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:26.640]  But we need to get people to actually worry about real things that threaten our society.
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:27.640]  God bless you.
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:28.640]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:35.640]  Thank you.
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:24.640]  Thank you.
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:29.640]  We've also got the report of gay spying case.
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:35.640]  Well, jury convict for hate and the guy as a prank had a video camera taping people having sex in the dorm.
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:37.640]  Hey, I say you should go to jail.
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:39.640]  What about the government spying without warrants?
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:42.640]  What about them?
[02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:46.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.640 --> 02:58:51.640]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:58.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:03.640]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:08.640]  It's true. Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:13.640]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:20.640]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:28.640]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:31.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:31.640 --> 02:59:38.640]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:42.640]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:47.640]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.640 --> 02:59:50.640]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:31.640]  Okay, we're in a little bit of overdrive here. Let's move quick to your calls. Chuck, in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:35.640]  Thanks for holding while I had a breakdown watching Trendy's. Go ahead.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:44.640]  Yeah, buddy. I was going to ask you, what do you think of Brad? I know you're friends with Brad.
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:50.640]  I'm not friends with Brad Pitt. I know people that know a lot about him and I'll just leave it at that.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:53.640]  That's all I ever said. People turned it all off into this big thing.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:01:01.640]  I'm attacking Angelina Jolie because she's a warmongering pig who is pushing for all these invasions that have now begun on the back of a phantom menace.
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:06.640]  And the UN is a murdering group and I'm sick of them getting away with this. I'm calling them out.
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:14.640]  And I couldn't agree more and I was curious. I mean, I think Brad feels about this because from what I heard, he's kind of one of the good guys.
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:19.640]  I hear he watches your show and he's got into the opposite, it seems like.
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:26.640]  I talked to Aaron Russo before he died and he did meet with him and he did know him and they liked his film and said they'd watch my stuff.
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:34.640]  And then I separately, through some other people, it's like I've met a bunch of these people at parties and events.
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:38.640]  And I mean, you know, talked to them, you know, it's like I've met Sean Penn twice.
[03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:43.640]  And then the third time I met him, he didn't even know who I was and later goes, oh, I like your show.
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:48.640]  Oh, and then once I talked to him on the phone, you know, Charlie Sheen put him on the phone and he knew who I was then.
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:50.640]  And then another time didn't know who I was.
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.640]  So I don't know that they seem smart part of the time and they seem really dumb the other part.
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:02.640]  But I don't care. I'm going after Angelina Jolie and exposing her and he should be ashamed of her.
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:06.640]  And you know what? If Brad Pitt doesn't like it, he can come, you know, tell me to my face.
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:08.640]  Don't stomp his ass into the ground.
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:11.640]  His wife is a war criminal and I don't care.
[03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:13.640]  And I'm exposing her.
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:20.640]  Yeah. Yeah, but he, uh, he was, he was, uh, was, uh, Jennifer Hanson read about that.
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:23.640]  Well, I tell you, she is really beautiful and horrible bosses.
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:25.640]  All right, that's enough.
[03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:27.640]  I think Aunt Jennifer Hanson is beautiful.
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:33.640]  I think, uh, you know, an inside issue. I shouldn't be talking about beating people up.
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:36.640]  I just, people are sending me emails when Brad Pitt will kick your butt. Well, good.
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:38.640]  Listen, you know, I'm going up against the new world order here.
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:40.640]  You think I'm worried about some woman's husband?
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:43.640]  I don't care if he sends a hit team to kill me. I don't care. I'm committed.
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:47.640]  I'm not shutting up. I'm not backing off. I'm unleashed. I'm unchained.
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:52.640]  I'm sick of it. I'm calling out a bunch of mass murders for what they are.
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:57.640]  Chuck in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:01.640]  Ah, okay. I'm sorry. Rob in California. Go ahead.
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:02.640]  Hello, are you there?
[03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:03.640]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:08.640]  Oh, I'm calling from Orange, uh, Oath Keepers, Orange County, California chapter.
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:12.640]  Uh, we are promoting a fundraiser for the County Sheriff's Project.
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:17.640]  It's called the County California Sheriff's Posse Call and Fundraiser.
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:20.640]  Uh, Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be our guest.
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:23.640]  Very exciting. We're going to have to get him back here in studio for that.
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:26.640]  I appreciate your call, sir, but if I let people aren't doing endless plugs,
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:29.640]  it'll never end. Yeah, I'm supporting that whole Sheriff's Initiative.
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:32.640]  I'm supporting the general initiative because I've looked at it and supported
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:34.640]  and believe in it. You sound like a great guy.
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:36.640]  I just don't know you from Adam doing a fundraiser thing on air.
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:39.640]  Uh, let's talk to Brock in Alabama who'll have to be tailgunner.
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:41.640]  Sorry to Colin. Uh, go ahead.
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:45.640]  Or Colin's up next, then Brock. Colin, go ahead.
[03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:46.640]  Come on ahead.
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:50.640]  Looking at this Coney video and analyzing it up close and then, you know,
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:54.640]  I pulled back to quantify the bigger picture, kind of like a chess match.
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:58.640]  And it came to mind that what if, you know, they're keeping Coney hidden
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:00.640]  till the right time, sort of like bin Laden?
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:03.640]  Oh yeah. No, no, I thought that he's probably dead.
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:05.640]  Most people think he's been dead for six years.
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:08.640]  And then they're going to roll him out exactly and call the African invasion
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:13.640]  a victory. We invaded nine countries and we got some guy hadn't been seen in forever.
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:15.640]  It's good.
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:19.640]  Yeah, exactly. They use him, you know, Obama uses him as a reelection tool.
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:22.640]  And then the campaign itself, you know, it says Coney 2012,
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:24.640]  meaning that it's supposed to end this year.
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:27.640]  So all the trendies, you know, they'll be on the bandwagon like,
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:29.640]  oh, we had a successful mission.
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:31.640]  No, that exactly. The minute I saw it, it's a total sigh up.
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:33.640]  And I'm sorry I hadn't made that point.
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:36.640]  I 100% agree with you.
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:38.640]  And then I just one more point.
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:41.640]  I know they feel like they have all this fake momentum and,
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:44.640]  and like, hey, we got him. Let's go for the next guy.
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:48.640]  So I went and look, and you'll never believe it on the ICT wanted list.
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:53.640]  The next two guys on their list after Coney is a guy in Sudan and then a guy in Congo.
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:58.640]  No, no, no, exactly, sir. It's a bad guy hunt to invade all of Africa.
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:15.640]  It's been announced. Absolutely. That's it.
