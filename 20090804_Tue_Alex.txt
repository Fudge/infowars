[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.900]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.900 --> 00:30.360]  Texas Alex Jones we have an extremely important radio broadcast lined up for
[00:30.360 --> 00:44.000]  you today here it is Tuesday August 4th 2009 very important radio
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.860]  transmission lined up today coming up in t-minus 30 minutes I am going to
[00:51.860 --> 00:58.800]  reveal to the nation what really happened at the Randall's grocery store in
[00:58.800 --> 01:06.400]  South Austin over the weekend I am going to reveal what happened Saturday
[01:06.400 --> 01:15.460]  because I happen to have a neighbor that was there and I've also talked to other
[01:15.460 --> 01:21.460]  people that were there and I even heard a local radio report on local news
[01:21.460 --> 01:29.500]  radio 590 that confirmed what I already knew but this is very important this
[01:29.500 --> 01:33.040]  isn't just a case of Congressman Lloyd dogged the anti-second amendment
[01:33.040 --> 01:38.500]  anti-national sovereignty pro-New World Order pro-socialized healthcare one of
[01:38.500 --> 01:47.880]  the worst congressmen we have it's not just an issue of him being shouted down
[01:47.880 --> 01:55.520]  and chanted down and basically chased from the building by a crowd of several
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.080]  hundred people the issue is the media is spinning this and saying it was all
[02:02.080 --> 02:09.400]  manufactured and I happen to know because I have talked to the individual
[02:09.400 --> 02:14.920]  that shot the video of Congressman Castle when he got chanted down over the
[02:14.920 --> 02:22.440]  birther issue I happen to know that was purely spontaneous and I also happen to
[02:22.440 --> 02:29.960]  have confirmed from someone at the event of what really happened as the
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.800]  crowd exploded when Ireland specter urges them to accept the socialized
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.680]  government takeover of healthcare fast and a crowd of his constituents
[02:42.680 --> 02:48.360]  exploded on him ladies and gentlemen I'm going to reveal to you in 30 minutes
[02:48.360 --> 02:55.920]  whether this is spontaneous or not because I happen to have sources in all
[02:55.920 --> 03:03.480]  three cases that is how big this radio show is in fact I should have thought as
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.160]  far I went live I gave you the number for William the videotape the
[03:09.160 --> 03:12.520]  congressman castle info I gave that number to Aaron who was up to two in
[03:12.520 --> 03:15.800]  the morning he's not in yet call him ask where that number to William is he
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.200]  probably put in the computer because maybe we can line William up to be on
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.640]  the show as an eyewitness he shot the video of Castle being shouted down I
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.720]  know people personally and I'm trying to twist their arm to come on what most
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.480]  people don't want to be on the radio who were at the dogged event I know two
[03:33.480 --> 03:40.400]  separate people talk to him this morning and I also have a contact at the other
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.520]  event and I can tell you exactly what happened of course watching the video
[03:44.520 --> 03:51.440]  you can tell what really happened but I'm gonna break down and I want Paul
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.160]  Joseph Watson to just do a blurb on what I'm gonna cover in 30 minutes but
[03:56.160 --> 04:00.800]  it's important because this has become a national issue on whether these are
[04:00.800 --> 04:07.880]  spontaneous or not here's Politico's headline today dims break looking like
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.720]  a bad trip angry protesters shouted out Democrats at public events from Texas to
[04:12.720 --> 04:17.080]  Pennsylvania over the weekend leaving the party only one real hope for getting
[04:17.080 --> 04:24.360]  its message out over recess a backlash in Austin representative Lloyd dogged
[04:24.360 --> 04:27.840]  was drowned out by a group of noisy sign-waving demonstrators who shouted
[04:27.840 --> 04:32.400]  just say no as he tried to talk about health care reform and then it goes on
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.840]  from there now then they go on to say is it real is it stage well we have the

[07:59.960 --> 08:22.560]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we have
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.400]  incredibly important news and big developments on the forced vaccine
[08:27.400 --> 08:32.600]  quarantine North com US Army Marine Corps enforced lockdown of the United
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.600]  States they're publicly announcing they're gonna launch in the fall that
[08:36.600 --> 08:40.440]  doesn't mean it's gonna happen they always act like we will be assimilated
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.960]  by the Borg we will give up all of our liberties and freedoms and that it's a
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.120]  foregone conclusion hoping that many people just don't even show up for a
[08:48.120 --> 08:53.040]  fight that many people don't even speak out politically and say no but we have
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.360]  huge developments on that front giant developments reportedly with Geithner
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.360]  cussing out Bernacke and others over the fact that the public's turning against
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.000]  them they're beginning to panic I believe this is nothing more than a ruse
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.800]  we're gonna get into a bunch of other economic news and incredible 9-11
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.160]  inside job information government-sponsored terrorism false flag news it is
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.320]  all coming up today and we have Mike Rivera what really happened for his once
[09:22.320 --> 09:26.240]  a month visit popping in next hour we'll get his take on the whole birther issue
[09:26.240 --> 09:30.360]  blowing up bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger always respect his
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.360]  opinion on that he thinks it's much to do about nothing and a distraction from
[09:34.360 --> 09:41.640]  all the real dirt on Barack Obama so I want to be clear I am not a birther I am
[09:41.640 --> 09:47.520]  looking at this story because governments normally lie in fact lying is
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.560]  what they're normally doing I mean Obama will tell the truth George W. Bush will
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.680]  tell the truth about the color of their time or where they went on vacation or
[09:55.680 --> 10:02.040]  what type of breed of dog the family likes to have George W. Bush will tell
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.600]  the truth about the size of a fish he caught he's constantly babbling about
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.600]  that or what his golf score is how many under par he is or what his favorite
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.160]  football team is to watch on sports center but they lie about real issues
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.840]  and so yes we're looking at this we're investigating this because we don't just
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.600]  take government's word for something we don't take media's word for something
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.800]  we don't don't take our own word on things you know we make mistakes
[10:30.800 --> 10:34.480]  sometimes we investigate we try to tell the truth we have a very good track
[10:34.480 --> 10:41.120]  record of about 95% accuracy but nobody's perfect and with his shady past and
[10:41.120 --> 10:49.440]  using the fake name Barry Sotaro Sotaro and false names on college entrance
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.240]  exams and all sorts of shady behavior it needs to be looked at but that does not
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.920]  mean I'm saying that he was born in Kenya I think the evidence is starting to
[10:58.920 --> 11:04.320]  lean that way when I come out and say 9-11's an inside job that's because the
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.800]  evidence a hundred percent proves that just like ten years ago I'd get on air
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.320]  and say the Gulf of Tonkin was staged and get attacked by newspapers I've been
[11:13.320 --> 11:16.880]  attacked by newspapers several times we're saying the Gulf of Tonkin to get
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.080]  us into Vietnam was staged then three years ago it was declassified by the
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.240]  CIA and NSA that it was completely totally staged to get us into Vietnam
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.720]  and the LBJ tapes with him and McNamara on the phone LBJ at his ranch in
[11:31.720 --> 11:39.800]  Johnsonville before it was called Johnsonville Johnson City and McNamara
[11:39.800 --> 11:45.920]  at the Pentagon at 3 a.m. by the way these guys work around the clock doing
[11:45.920 --> 11:52.880]  their evil so if I come out and say something's documented it's documented
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.720]  so we're gonna be covering that but but why is this so important this issue of
[11:57.720 --> 12:04.920]  the mainstream media the last three days on local radio I heard it on the
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.920]  Sunday news shows I heard it and yesterday on CNN while on the treadmill I
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.480]  saw it yesterday morning this morning I heard it again on local radio saying
[12:14.480 --> 12:21.080]  that it was staged saying that dogged being shouted down and now specter being
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.360]  shouted down and congressman Castle being shouted down that it's staged by
[12:26.360 --> 12:32.280]  the Republican Party then driving home yesterday I heard Rock Howard on news
[12:32.280 --> 12:38.880]  radio 590 k lbj friend of mine had the Libertarian Party in Travis County I
[12:39.480 --> 12:43.040]  heard him saying the Libertarian Party didn't even know about this Lloyd
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.640]  dogged event and no we had nothing to do with this as local news and national
[12:47.640 --> 12:54.840]  news were accusing them of and then I made some phone calls and I happened to
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.840]  talk to a neighbor and they said no I was there I was there grocery shopping
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.240]  because I live over near this area of South Austin this Randall's off Brody
[13:04.240 --> 13:10.600]  and so my neighbors do as well and I talked to my neighbor I talked to one
[13:10.600 --> 13:16.600]  of my dad's employees so I've talked to two people separately who were there one
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.760]  shopping and one went to the event and they and they explained what happened I
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.680]  have the eyewitness reports now I tried to get my neighbor on obviously most
[13:26.680 --> 13:32.880]  people are shy and don't want to be on radio much less the Alex Jones show my
[13:32.880 --> 13:38.120]  neighbors are almost scared even talk to me and maybe rightfully so but the
[13:38.120 --> 13:45.720]  point is but and I talked to one of my dad's employees so that's two separate
[13:45.720 --> 13:52.240]  people and we're trying to get William on who posted the footage and is giving
[13:52.240 --> 13:58.200]  us the footage from my new Obama film on the birther issue with the castle
[13:58.200 --> 14:05.480]  situation congressman castle being shouted down so I've confirmed there and
[14:05.480 --> 14:11.920]  I've confirmed on the dogged situation and on the specter situation that's how
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.840]  big our audience is I've confirmed what really happened at all three events so
[14:16.840 --> 14:19.960]  I'm going to tell you what happened at all three events coming up at the bottom
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.240]  of the hour 33 after about 17 minutes that is coming up I will break that
[14:26.240 --> 14:31.920]  down or 18 minutes from now I will break that down and why is this so
[14:31.920 --> 14:38.480]  important because the media is in a concerted effort saying a it's bad to
[14:38.480 --> 14:43.800]  shout people down I'll give you my take on that and be this is fake well I
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.440]  happen to know whether it's real or not and I'm going to tell you from the eyewitnesses
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.120]  I'm here in Austin Texas I live in South Austin on the border of West Austin
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.400]  and South Austin and I know what happened from my witnesses I will tell you
[14:59.400 --> 15:07.920]  and local this is backed up by local 590 a.m. they've now well the 590 wasn't
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.040]  saying it was staged they were quoting dogged saying it was staged 590 now is
[15:13.040 --> 15:16.800]  saying something else because they're hearing from Austinites who were there
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.280]  that'll give me an idea what's coming up another media hoax exposed in t-minus
[15:22.280 --> 15:29.600]  18 minutes then Mike Rivera is coming on with his monthly visit with us and then
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.280]  we have Webster Tarple add Webster on last week but I want to get him on
[15:33.280 --> 15:39.320]  specifically on eugenics we flew another team to DC to talk to Webster last
[15:39.320 --> 15:45.720]  week last Friday because we were unable to get an actual copy of eco science I
[15:45.720 --> 15:51.360]  ordered copy after copy and then we'd be told days later it had sold out so I had
[15:51.360 --> 15:57.520]  bought the university online scan version which is good but not good enough
[15:57.520 --> 16:03.040]  finally Friday it came in the mail so Webster was able to go to the local DC
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.080]  library he was able to get a copy of it we flew a team there because he's an
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.160]  expert on eugenics as well one of the leading experts out there I would say
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.240]  myself one of the other leading ones as well but Webster being a scholar he went
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.440]  Wednesday got the book we flew up interviewing Friday he has now read he's
[16:21.440 --> 16:26.920]  a speed reader much of the 1100 devil is pages so he'll be on the last hour
[16:26.920 --> 16:32.800]  today to actually go over the copy he has in his hands of the plan to drug the
[16:32.800 --> 16:37.720]  water supply forcibly sterilize the population to raise all children in
[16:37.720 --> 16:41.720]  government dormitories take all children from all parents that's the Chinese
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.520]  model they tried it the society completely collapsed in the mid 60s 60 to 80
[16:46.520 --> 16:51.520]  million the Chinese say 80 million died in Cyclopedia Britannica says 64 mil
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.440]  under it now this is the plan the White House science chief wants so that is
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.720]  coming up with one of our resident experts Webster Tarpley on the eugenics
[17:02.720 --> 17:09.960]  front coming up in the last hour a key report today you do not want to miss
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.960]  that and yesterday we only an hour and 15 minutes of prison planet dot TV my
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.600]  promises to average at least two hours a day so today we're doing three hours and

[30:16.880 --> 30:20.840]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.840 --> 30:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:24.760 --> 30:28.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[30:28.360 --> 30:31.720]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[30:31.720 --> 30:35.640]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar

[33:15.960 --> 33:21.160]  radio show today at prisonplanet.tv want to thank all the prisonplanet.tv
[33:21.160 --> 33:25.600]  members out there for their support that helped turn this radio show into a
[33:25.600 --> 33:31.000]  radio slash TV show that's so important because I can show the video clips I can
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  show the documents I can actually hold up the New York Times I can actually hold
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.280]  up the White House Science czar's own book eco science where he calls for
[33:43.280 --> 33:47.720]  putting sterilants in the water taking all children at birth to raise them in
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.000]  government dormitories eradicating the family sterilizing forced drugging the
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.200]  population I can actually hold this up and put the put the pages and quotes on
[33:58.200 --> 34:04.680]  screen and that is having a devastating effect because everybody then grabs the
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.560]  videos that they get to watch live at prisonplanet.tv as members and that are
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.400]  also archived along with my book Paul Watson's book all of my films special
[34:14.400 --> 34:17.720]  expanded extras from all my films many other films and books we've been
[34:17.720 --> 34:23.320]  authorized to post at prisonplanet.tv then they rip it to hundreds of file
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.880]  sharing networks and YouTube and Google and we have one of the biggest if not the
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.240]  biggest political YouTube channel it's bigger than the president's channel has
[34:32.240 --> 34:36.240]  more members and more hits very very exciting just what we're doing on
[34:36.240 --> 34:40.880]  YouTube so I want to commend and thank everybody out there for the fine work
[34:40.880 --> 34:44.160]  they're doing by the way later this afternoon we're gonna post at the Alex
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.040]  Jones channel a little YouTube video I shot yesterday thanking you for spreading
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.640]  the word about the Obama deception whether you buy it on DVD and in the
[34:54.640 --> 34:58.200]  high quality at infowars.com and make copies and give it out to people or
[34:58.200 --> 35:03.120]  have viewing parties or whether you spread the free online versions of it
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.680]  around this film is only getting bigger and bigger exponentially at the current
[35:08.680 --> 35:14.480]  rate it appears to have eclipsed all my films together previously in just five
[35:14.480 --> 35:20.480]  months of being out and it certainly is going to eclipse them over time just
[35:20.480 --> 35:23.760]  amazing and my other films you know some of them are the most viral out there
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.200]  ever there is no doubt that at its current rate the Obama deception will
[35:28.200 --> 35:33.120]  dwarf loose change and will become the most downloaded most viewed film in
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.920]  history and I know the Wall Street Journal and other media are looking at
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.440]  those numbers that's supposedly going to be in the Wall Street Journal coming up
[35:40.440 --> 35:47.560]  later this week Thursday or Friday we'll finally see this big report but again I
[35:47.560 --> 35:52.360]  don't care about winning a NASCAR trophy or a boxing trophy or a trophy for you
[35:52.360 --> 35:57.560]  know winning the best painting you know it's some local event I don't care
[35:57.560 --> 36:00.920]  about I don't have trophies on my wall even though I want some swimming and
[36:00.920 --> 36:04.600]  you know football and stuff like that in soccer and I'm not saying trophies are
[36:04.600 --> 36:07.640]  bad I'm just saying I'm not into things like that I'm not into being padded on
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.960]  the head but the trophy I do want is to have the most downloaded most viewed
[36:11.960 --> 36:16.240]  film in history because it's about changing minds I believe in people's
[36:16.240 --> 36:21.520]  minds and intellects and I want to unlock minds that is what gives me passion
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.720]  that's what fuels me is beating these bullies bringing the globalist to justice
[36:25.720 --> 36:31.200]  and empowering the human dynamic spirit that's what drives me that makes the
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.120]  hair on the back of my neck stand up right now that gives me chills right now
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.600]  I'm not after women I'm not after power I'm not after glory I'm not after big
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.800]  houses I'm not after any of that I'm after humanity and communing with my
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.640]  fellow man with our minds with our intellects with our intellectual debate
[36:51.640 --> 36:57.680]  and reaching out towards the future to future progeny as an example for them
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.000]  to stand up against tyranny them to stand up against challenges and threats to
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.800]  the species and dehumanization I have a love affair with humanity and a love
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.040]  affair with the incredible art and creativity and the love and the innocence
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.200]  and the goodness and the strength and the courage and the honor and to know
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.280]  that we are just one more little example of a small group of individuals
[37:20.280 --> 37:24.880]  together exerting ourselves against overwhelming odds in the corrupt
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.680]  government and the scientific dictatorship and engaging them at their
[37:28.680 --> 37:33.600]  level I love the underdog especially when the underdog is in the right and
[37:33.600 --> 37:38.200]  make no mistake that is happening today so I commend all of you for what you've
[37:38.200 --> 37:43.880]  done please get the Obama deception on DVD get it out to everybody go insane I
[37:43.880 --> 37:49.760]  talked to the folks at the University of Arizona they're in Phoenix and they've
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.200]  given out over 30,000 copies in the last five months of the Obama deception
[37:54.200 --> 38:00.120]  just a group of students first four or five of them then 10 or 15 then they
[38:00.120 --> 38:04.480]  10 or 15 or so they said 12 or 15 handed out 15,000 when Obama came to town
[38:04.480 --> 38:08.440]  and then since then other students picked it up and they they know more than
[38:08.440 --> 38:11.800]  15,000 additional been handed out so when I say this has been a local
[38:11.800 --> 38:15.560]  newspaper when I say 30,000 that's conservative that's when I talked to
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.240]  him a few weeks ago see it's exponential other universities thousands of
[38:19.240 --> 38:29.080]  copies I mean it's it's incalculable what you've done I salute you so we're
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.120]  gonna post in this new video we're posting today and links on info wards
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.800]  and prison planet tomorrow to the best free online version there's hundreds the
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.320]  best encode we've seen he knows how to do it better than we do the fellows has
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.120]  judged a channel called change the channel popular site in its own right
[38:48.120 --> 38:55.240]  we've had him on Burma's a show three million views three million views right
[38:55.240 --> 39:00.920]  now at time of this show right at three million and we should crest that by this
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.880]  evening it's right below that it's 2,900 something thousand and there's
[39:05.880 --> 39:09.240]  hundreds of versions on YouTube and Google alone but the point is we want
[39:09.240 --> 39:13.280]  to send that to 10 million in the next few months forget it just grow into three
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.560]  or four or five million how about 10 million on just that one two-hour film
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.240]  there's nothing else there's no other films on YouTube now people people watch
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.600]  one minute videos with their attention span they get three million views it's
[39:26.600 --> 39:30.680]  already one of the biggest videos I wanted to have 10 20 30 million I want
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.480]  everybody to see it I mean you talk about a solution there's a solution right
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.360]  there just the Obama deception Republicans will watch it because they
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.240]  hate Obama then they find out that it's really about exposing George Bush as a
[39:44.240 --> 39:48.040]  new order puppet and shattering the left-right paradigm and showing Obama as
[39:48.040 --> 39:55.080]  a puppet it's deprogramming people praise God this is exciting I mean no
[39:55.080 --> 39:58.360]  wonder I got the Secret Service and FBI show it up here and I got the Pentagon
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.240]  following me around and what's been declassified mainstream news but people
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.600]  inside the army sent me the secret document that's how it ended up being
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.080]  mainstream news because the people in the army are patriots and don't like
[40:09.080 --> 40:13.280]  having to follow me around all day follow me to the grocery store and follow
[40:13.280 --> 40:19.960]  me home and all this crap I mean we're having an effect we're engaging the
[40:19.960 --> 40:25.160]  new world order this is incredible success to have them on my butt have them
[40:25.160 --> 40:32.120]  on my six when they're on your tail man that means when you got bogies that
[40:32.120 --> 40:38.320]  means you're doing a good job and you know they kill JFK they kill Martin
[40:38.320 --> 40:41.520]  Luther King and kill a lot of the people the good news is I'm nothing near that
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.400]  level but I've always tried to make it about the activist about the listener
[40:45.400 --> 40:49.120]  about you the info warriors in the lone wolves and in wolf packs against the
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.680]  enemy because they can't stop us if it's an idea I've always said that an idea is
[40:54.680 --> 40:58.680]  eternal ideas can't be stopped when they're based on the truth and of course
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.880]  that's an eternal truth many philosophers have said that I don't want to
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.680]  say the Wachowski brothers who I know are reportedly fans of the show I don't
[41:05.680 --> 41:08.120]  agree with all their philosophy but I've talked folks not only what they are fans
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.480]  of the show clearly you know I I'm not saying I invented that idea because that
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.200]  idea is thousands of years old that ideas are you can kill the messenger but
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.600]  you can't kill the message and so people send me emails saying are you ripping
[41:21.600 --> 41:28.880]  off ideas or bulletproof no and they're not ripping me off either because I got
[41:28.880 --> 41:35.800]  that idea from other philosophers but ideas are bulletproof and that's what
[41:35.800 --> 41:43.160]  so successful and so exciting and so good and so wholesome about this now I
[41:43.160 --> 41:49.680]  told everybody to tune in because I am now going to end this controversy with
[41:49.680 --> 41:59.240]  facts and proof and evidence ABC News Fox News CNN I have heard and seen them all
[41:59.240 --> 42:04.360]  and Paul Hartman one of my producers has seen the local news Rob do one of our
[42:04.360 --> 42:10.680]  great producers has seen the local newscast I'm sure you've all seen it as
[42:10.680 --> 42:15.240]  well but I'm in Austin, Texas where this story finally got national attention
[42:15.240 --> 42:23.920]  and I I say this story congressman Castle in the east got shouted down and
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.720]  booed over the birther issue when he said he believes Obama was not born he
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.400]  when he said he believes Obama was born here and that his birth certificate
[42:34.400 --> 42:41.440]  receipt is real he spontaneously got booed and shouted down now whether you
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.080]  believe in the birther issue or not I'm not a birther I'm just looking at the
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.240]  issue I think it should be investigated because government lies so much and he
[42:50.240 --> 42:54.040]  does have some questionable past and background and fake aliases and Barry
[42:54.040 --> 42:59.000]  Sataro and other things he needs to be looked at I mean his dad was a Muslim
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.280]  communist and his mother was this big foundation minion of Geithner's dad so
[43:03.280 --> 43:09.640]  very spooky group very very sneaky but the point is he probably was born in
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.960]  Hawaii I mean I don't know the point is we're looking at that but regardless of
[43:12.960 --> 43:20.520]  what you think of that story I talked to William he doesn't want his full name on
[43:20.520 --> 43:27.000]  there who shot the video turned out William who shot the video that we're
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.600]  about to play he was there it was spontaneous he's sending us the raw
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.160]  video it went on and on with them chanting and booing and yelling and
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.160]  following him outside so William sending me the raw video right now we're very
[43:39.160 --> 43:47.160]  very appreciative of that then Saturday it's on local news I'm driving in the
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.160]  car at five o'clock I spent part of the day with my family I'm driving back in
[43:52.160 --> 43:55.720]  the office to work on the new Obama film I'll soon reveal the name got to get on
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.680]  it so busy making the film I haven't got the website up yet or you know the
[44:00.680 --> 44:05.520]  promotional material which is a problem but but side issue here's the bottom
[44:05.520 --> 44:14.120]  line the national media has been saying that senator specter getting shouted
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.600]  down over the weekend is fake and was Republican operatives they're saying
[44:18.600 --> 44:23.680]  it's fake with congressman dogged being shouted down and that that's staged
[44:23.680 --> 44:30.320]  that the people were sent by Republicans they are saying that the
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.040]  congressman castle thing was staged by the birthers and that happened weeks
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.920]  ago oh really was it stage in fact pull this up I forgot to tell you when
[44:38.920 --> 44:44.480]  senator Cornyn at a Republican supposed tea party got booed off the stage and all
[44:44.480 --> 44:50.800]  Republicans got booed off no they're booing Republicans and Democrats off
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.920]  but notice the mainstream media wants to make this partisan because as long as
[44:54.920 --> 44:58.280]  they keep you in the left right paradigm as long as they make it about
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.200]  Republicans versus Democrats or Democrats versus Republicans their whole
[45:02.200 --> 45:05.560]  system the two parties that prop each other up the two parties are owned by
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.360]  the same interest but as long as they alternate power and keep fooling us we
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.560]  wake up to Bush put Obama in we wake up to Obama put a Republican in we wake
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.920]  up to that Republican you know in 2016 put a Democrat in as long as that cycle
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.120]  that stage cycle I mean there may have been two different parties in the past
[45:25.120 --> 45:29.720]  there were certainly an Andrew Jackson's time but there are not now you may have a
[45:29.720 --> 45:32.440]  few good members like Dennis Kucinich the Democrats and Ron Paul the
[45:32.440 --> 45:37.520]  Republicans but the parties themselves it's a total show same thing with Tory
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.720]  and Labor in England and the people in the polls show are finally realizing it's
[45:42.720 --> 45:46.200]  the Bank of England it's the private fellow reserve they're getting past the
[45:46.200 --> 45:52.360]  puppets to the actual controllers this is huge and so this story is so important
[45:52.360 --> 45:57.120]  today because it's multifaceted on a whole bunch of different levels that's
[45:57.120 --> 46:00.560]  why Paul Watson's gonna write a report on the facts I'm laying out here right
[46:00.560 --> 46:06.280]  now with these video clips that prove this so here's the answer I have eyewitnesses
[46:06.280 --> 46:12.040]  my neighbor and one of my dad's employees I live in South Austin I'm I shop
[46:12.040 --> 46:16.520]  sometimes at the Randalls that they're talking about off Brody I used to live a
[46:16.520 --> 46:21.320]  mile from there or less now a little bit further point is my neighbor talked to
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.520]  him this morning wouldn't come on the show and obviously you know people want
[46:24.520 --> 46:32.320]  to be public but he was there I also talked to one of my dad's employees the
[46:32.320 --> 46:36.000]  neighbor was shopping there was not even part of it but stopped and stayed
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.320]  about 30 minutes and saw it happen then I heard multiple callers to Rod
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.160]  Balin on news radio 590 today and news radio 590 has been reporting only what
[46:48.160 --> 46:51.400]  dogged said that basically it was staged by Republicans dogged with no proof but
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.840]  the callers were calling and going no no I'm a Democrat I was sent a mailing I
[46:55.840 --> 47:00.640]  went to it he wouldn't listen to me he wouldn't you know he kept telling us
[47:00.640 --> 47:03.400]  whether we liked it or not they were gonna give us this health care he kept
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.160]  saying it didn't socialize things there was a lady there who had a thousand page
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.880]  bill on a binder we had copies of it and so that's what's happening is people
[47:11.880 --> 47:15.720]  have now read over the pages and the subsections we were just doing that
[47:15.720 --> 47:19.480]  yesterday on the show we were doing that last Friday on the show and so I've
[47:19.480 --> 47:22.240]  now found out from emails we're gonna get some of these people on the show in
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.040]  the next few days I've now discovered that a lot of our listeners were there
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.040]  who've been registered Democrats in the past South Austin only registered
[47:30.040 --> 47:34.720]  Democrats were mailed a mailer by dogged these were Democrats that were
[47:34.720 --> 47:41.040]  there and he was talking down at them and so there's 30 minutes of footage
[47:41.040 --> 47:44.400]  before this and we're getting the raw footage right now we've contacted the
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.160]  fellow that shot it the video that has like 400,000 views right now so I'm
[47:48.160 --> 47:53.840]  mega viral that we're about to play and the issue is I've talked to the fellow
[47:53.840 --> 48:00.560]  with Congressman Castle in the east who was there all spontaneous these were his
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.240]  supporters booing him and yelling at him when he because they believe nothing
[48:05.240 --> 48:08.880]  the government says I've talked to somebody who was there at the big
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.360]  specter event and they said it was totally spontaneous and I've talked to
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.560]  people who were at this event and it was totally spontaneous and I've heard the
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.320]  callers to local news radio going no this was spontaneous of course it's
[48:22.320 --> 48:26.800]  spontaneous the media is acting like it's only Democrats getting booed no no
[48:26.800 --> 48:32.160]  no I've seen tea party video from San Antonio from Austin from Dallas from
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.480]  South Carolina I mean I see these videos every day where Republicans are
[48:36.480 --> 48:42.080]  being booed off the stage you see these are libertarians Democrats and
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.280]  Republicans at these events these tea parties the media says they're only
[48:45.280 --> 48:51.120]  Republican Republican congressmen and senators are being booed off the stage
[48:51.120 --> 48:56.440]  it's all of them so it isn't just the media is lying and we've seen Fox News
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.080]  CNN nationally locally we even have local CNN News 8 they're lying and
[49:02.080 --> 49:08.440]  saying it's all staged it is not staged none of it is staged the people are on
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.200]  the verge of total revolt and let the establishment lie to themselves and say
[49:13.200 --> 49:18.040]  this is all staged this is not staged I live here I go to some of these events
[49:18.040 --> 49:23.040]  I have friends that shot video that you see posted of Cornyn everywhere
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.880]  Republicans and Democrats show up Rick Perry got booed off the stage in another
[49:27.880 --> 49:34.160]  event they're all Rick Perry senator Cornyn everybody Republicans Democrats
[49:34.160 --> 49:41.480]  Lloyd dogged it doesn't matter in fact let's bring in first come on in studio
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.000]  let's go ahead and bring you in first Rob do Rob come on in here we don't have
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.080]  much time your wife is a Democrat so she got mailed the mailer for dogged you
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.840]  were laughing saying you filled it out in the Fed and things like that but but
[49:55.840 --> 50:01.800]  just confirming with you your wife's a Democrat she got sent the flyer inviting
[50:01.800 --> 50:07.120]  her to it right yeah I opened it up and I was reading it and it had a list of you
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.680]  know things that you think are important and you know multiple choice and I wrote
[50:11.680 --> 50:15.040]  in audit the Fed on everyone and mailed it back to him but it also said he was
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.920]  gonna be at Randall's on I think from 10 to 11 30 was the time I was actually
[50:20.920 --> 50:24.840]  gonna go to it but we ended up going to Ohio that day but I was gonna go to it
[50:24.840 --> 50:28.520]  and just you know I was planning on wait a minute yelling at him a week ago when
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.600]  that we could have when that came in I remember you mentioning in meetings hey
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.160]  dogged it's coming should we go to that yeah man but I sent you we're already
[50:36.160 --> 50:39.400]  we're scheduled to leave already yeah but you did grab we sent what we sent you
[50:39.400 --> 50:42.040]  to interview ten penny yeah that's what we got to get some more camera guys yeah
[50:42.040 --> 50:45.560]  well you did a great job I mean the bottom line though was this was
[50:45.560 --> 50:49.840]  spontaneous yeah I had I mean it was not going up to Republicans I didn't see
[50:49.840 --> 50:53.960]  anywhere else advertised except you know through those channels of direct
[50:53.960 --> 50:57.800]  mailing and he's direct mailing just his his voters so it definitely wasn't
[50:57.800 --> 51:02.720]  staged well I don't know about that but I say there silver is mankind's oldest
[51:02.720 --> 51:07.040]  natural antibiotic this very special mineral has been used for centuries by
[51:07.040 --> 51:10.960]  most cultures throughout the world utopia Texas is home to a small but
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.320]  mighty supplement company called utopia silver who offers colloidal products
[51:15.320 --> 51:19.120]  produced in distilled water without use of animal protein night rates or
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.920]  saline solutions because our colloidal silver is made up of nano sized

[54:12.120 --> 54:15.200]  can't guarantee there wasn't a republican there but you made the
[54:15.200 --> 54:19.000]  excellent point off air that he's all over news saying this was staged by
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.920]  republicans and the libertarians and that it was a minority you watch the
[54:23.920 --> 54:27.680]  video it is the majority oh yeah exactly he was on the news he did a news
[54:27.680 --> 54:33.680]  report that night of it saying oh well you know this is a a a a vibe what he
[54:33.680 --> 54:37.840]  says small group that was going in and creating this disturbance and I mean you
[54:37.840 --> 54:41.840]  can clearly see everybody shouting him down because they don't want this and
[54:41.840 --> 54:47.640]  then the media spin it also say it's wrong to yell it's it's unamerica no
[54:47.640 --> 54:51.360]  that's what the founding fathers did is the sons of liberty for 15 years before
[54:51.360 --> 54:56.320]  they had to get more serious it's totally american because now we find out
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.480]  he'd been there talking them down telling them they were stupid saying in
[55:00.480 --> 55:03.920]  fact on record and I heard a lady on kelby jay this morning one of the
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.400]  witnesses being interviewed she said no I'm a democrat but it was when he's we
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.800]  said even if we're against this you're gonna vote for it and he said yes and
[55:11.800 --> 55:16.960]  tries to push past well you can see that you can't hear everything is being said
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.200]  but you can see him trying to get out yeah when that begins and it's as he's
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.200]  leaving they start voicing and chanting that this was happening but my issue is
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.240]  I heard rock Howard friend of mine we're calling him right now I heard rock
[55:29.240 --> 55:33.480]  Howard head of the travis county libertarian party on 590 a.m. saying
[55:33.480 --> 55:38.320]  we didn't even know about this this was some internal mail out that went which
[55:38.320 --> 55:41.760]  you confirmed it only went through your wife saying we wish we would have known
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.480]  about it we would have sent people and the republicans have said the same thing
[55:45.480 --> 55:50.640]  right so again they're acting like it's bad to say we don't want this we don't
[55:50.640 --> 55:55.200]  want this to chant just say no as he's leaving it's wrong to speak now it's
[55:55.200 --> 55:58.280]  un-American they're actually saying this all over the news that it's evil and
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.080]  aggressive and kind of terroristic kind of scary I heard local talk show how
[56:02.080 --> 56:08.920]  saying that today and then they go further and they're trying to say that
[56:08.920 --> 56:12.600]  this was all staged by republicans and democrats the libertarians are on record
[56:12.600 --> 56:16.760]  so the republicans saying no but we have the proof because it's not
[56:16.760 --> 56:22.160]  democrats or libertarians staging people booing Perry and senator Cornyn at
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.720]  these tea parties they're being booed everywhere but the media is desperate to
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.160]  make this partisan because if the people find out that everybody hates the
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.320]  government and that it's universal their little parties over bubba exactly and
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.320]  it's a redress of grievances and it's our right to do that and if they can't
[56:38.320 --> 56:42.040]  take it get out of office you don't like it you can't stand the heat get out of
[56:42.040 --> 56:45.880]  the kitchen if you read about the first two hundred years of this country it's
[56:45.880 --> 56:50.400]  total Americana to chant at these bastards but oh no now you're not supposed
[56:50.400 --> 56:55.640]  to do that in fact you know you've asked senator Perry a question senator
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.280]  Kerry a question you get taser don't taze me bro he wasn't even resisting but
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.760]  they taste him as punishment I guess this is a new syndrome that people are
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.880]  developing spontaneous anti-government response syndrome exactly well we don't
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.840]  give my days the American Psychological Association has made over 20 in the last
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.040]  decade new psychological designations if you believe in a new world order
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.720]  this even though Al Gore is announcing world government it doesn't exist here
[57:21.720 --> 57:26.080]  you're mentally ill so I guess now if you believe people are spontaneously
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.840]  booing socialized health care booing open borders booing cap and trade it if if
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.800]  you don't believe their conspiracy theory that it's stage with no proof they
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.200]  just make this up this is a national news story that this was staged here in
[57:41.200 --> 57:46.080]  Austin and it was not staged I mean my neighbor was there shopping and saw it

[58:03.240 --> 58:08.240]  happening to everybody that I mean this is revolt that's happening right but no
[58:08.240 --> 58:11.800]  they want to say it's some stage political activity the citizens aren't
[58:11.800 --> 58:18.120]  out protesting see they're the conspiracy theorist Rob I agree I mean it's
[58:18.120 --> 58:20.840]  it's ridiculous they just can't they can't take it when they're wrong and

[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:11.200]  for stations that just joined us major national controversy ABC NBC Fox CNN CNBC
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.600]  Politico Wall Street Journal this is one of the biggest stories in the
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:19.960]  country right now the videos had millions of views the original versions had
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:28.800]  over 400,000 views and growing dims break for August recess looking like a bad
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:36.120]  trip and it's saying angry protesters everywhere are besieging the Democrats but
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:41.360]  then the Democrats spin machine goes into overdrive and says it's all staged when
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:46.800]  congressman Castle gets booed and heckled over Obama support he says it's
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:50.360]  staged by the whole crowd booming and yelling we happen to have a we are
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:57.440]  changer now it's an oathkeeper who's a fan William who shot the video and we
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:01.880]  sending us now the raw footage of that viral video that drudge and others link
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:06.320]  two weeks ago and the Democrats said that was stage Republicans though the
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:09.200]  congressman later had to admit that was actually his constituents locally and
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:15.000]  they sent a letter out then with this situation with congressman Lloyd
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.520]  dogged he's got an hour and a half meeting only sent the Democrats Rob do's
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.400]  wife a Democrat was sent the letter Rob was going to go but we forgot about it
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.360]  because he had to go to another shoot with Dr. Sherry 10 penny I mean this
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:33.800]  happened a few miles from my office I'm in South Austin with this Lloyd dogged
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:37.200]  situation you know I know Lloyd dogged I've been to Lloyd dogged's house when
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.920]  I was a senior in high school with his nephew I mean the point is I live here
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:45.680]  my neighbor was at the grocery store and saw this and said it was spontaneous
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:49.640]  this is where this happened at a Randall's grocery store one of my dad's
[1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:53.960]  employees I talked to was there at the event here in South Austin said it was
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.520]  totally spontaneous local news that was first only reporting what Lloyd dogged
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:02.760]  said news radio 590 has now had guests and witnesses that are registered
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:07.560]  Democrats on air who were there with the bill saying this does socialize this
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:12.960]  does penalize people this is a really you'll stop lying and dogged told them
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:15.880]  they were idiots and said I don't care if you're against it I'm still gonna pass
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:19.320]  it which is one of his favorite statements in fact we have this on video
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:22.680]  because we were taping it live at the time during the cap and trade debates
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:27.320]  that last day a few weeks ago he said I don't care my constituents against this
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:31.520]  this is good and I'm gonna vote for it so that's one of his arrogant statements
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:35.640]  is I don't care if I'm getting a bunch of calls against this I'm doing it well
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:40.160]  he said that started trying to leave and they stopped him and you could see it on
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:46.680]  the video that's why we're we've sent a message to the local guy who shopped the
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:49.960]  video who has the YouTube channel asking him to come in studio play the raw
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:56.360]  footage so the media is saying this is staged when it's not and they're saying
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:00.160]  it's only Democrats getting heckled we're gonna play you the video coming up in
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:04.800]  the sour of senator Cornyn being booed and heckled governor Rick Perry being
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:09.920]  booed and heckled at tea party events they organized that they tried to hijack
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:14.600]  see they had some last year and earlier this year got really popular the tea
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:19.520]  party started in Austin with Iran Paul and 9-11 truth and we are change that
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:25.360]  that's on record the first tea party was in Austin going after the banks the
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:30.320]  first before that was in Boston by we are changed 9-11 truth four years ago
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:35.200]  throwing the 9-11 Commission report in the harbor so then that the the next
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:40.320]  generation started here so understand they're booing Republicans they're
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:44.320]  booing Democrats but the media wants to make it a partisan issue to keep us in
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:48.440]  the left-right paradigm instead of the people all waking up and taking these
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:53.400]  guys to justice because both parties are bought and paid for by foreign
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:57.040]  special interest the public's looking past the puppets now for the first time

[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:28.120]  gentlemen I am 110% committed to feeding the social engineers the
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:33.720]  collectivists the big international banks that are financing governments take
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:37.360]  over their populations and domesticate them and enslave them for the planned
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.080]  economy both parties Republican and Democrat are bought and paid for Tory
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.840]  labor in England same thing in Europe now there have been multiple parties in
[1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:51.520]  the past but now there is only one party it has two heads or it's like an eagle
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:58.840]  that has two wings or a vulture now I know through a twist of fate one of our
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:06.760]  listeners shot the video of Congressman Castle on the Berther issue now
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:11.640]  whether you believe that or not the point is they his constituents so
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:16.600]  mistrust Obama and the government as a manifestation of their distrust that
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.600]  they booed him off the stage and would have shut up mainly a bunch of retired
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.200]  people then congressman Lloyd dogged it in a mailer to only his constituents
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:31.760]  because one of my employees wives is Democrat he got one it only came to
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:36.360]  Democrats totally spontaneous my neighbor was there shopping and stopped
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:40.000]  and saw it one of my dad's employees I talked to was there actually at the
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.720]  event because they've been a Democrat in the past and they got the message okay
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:49.000]  and now all these eyewitnesses are calling it a talk radio and TV and
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.640]  Austin Fox News and others saying how dare you in News 8 Austin the local
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:59.120]  time Warner we have local CNN here I think only six cities have it and saying
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:04.000]  stop saying it was staged we're all Democrats and the people I've talked to
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.960]  are all Democrats that went there and were angry my neighbor is a political as
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:14.680]  best I know and they were just there shopping but the issue is dogged it was
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:18.400]  trying to leave and told them I don't care if you're against it I'm voting for
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.680]  it he does that on the floor all the time hearing cap and trade I saw him the
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:26.280]  reason I'm so excited is the whole left-right paradigm is collapsing the
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.240]  11% approval rating of Congress is showing the 9% for Cheney Obama's gone
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:37.200]  from 84 when he got elected to by the time he got in office it was 68 and then
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:43.720]  now it's below 50 depending on the poll 44 to 49 and plunging he's lost five
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:50.400]  points of his core constituency he had 51% depending on the poll more than five
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:55.520]  points but we've got to make sure it isn't all about Obama and just blaming
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:01.560]  him now and dumping all the sins on him we had to politically expose Obama and
[1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:04.960]  wreck him so we couldn't bring in the cap and trade the open borders the
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:10.120]  anti-gun bills new wars the socialized health care but now that he is
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:13.560]  politically grinding to a halt we got to go wait a minute you're part of it too
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:17.800]  and here's the key we're gonna show you these video clips everywhere across the
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:21.680]  country Republicans get booed off stage by their people Democrats are getting
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:26.880]  booed off stage by their people it's their own constituents doing it a tea
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:33.360]  party is mainly libertarian Republican it is they're booing them off here in
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:38.080]  Tennessee and Arizona in New York and Florida I see these videos every day we
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:43.720]  play them here all the time so the media is desperate to say it's staged in fake
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:52.360]  Republicans and libertarian operatives and be there then saying that it's only
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:55.800]  partisan they'll be with us for 20 minutes in the next hour he joins us
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:12:01.560]  via video connection from Hawaii he's Genesis talk show host Mike Rivera what
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.760]  really happened dot com we linked his stories routinely at info wars dot com
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.560]  Mike this is what you talk about every day it's what I talk about the
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:14.240]  establishment is setting up North com the police state the flu is a cover if
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:18.560]  they need it to lock down the establishment realizes that they have
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:25.080]  lost all credibility now this cover-up of the fact that this is spontaneous
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:29.800]  booing everywhere that cover-up is imploding Mike what do you say to all
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:34.040]  this well you know this reminds me of way back when the Clintons when we're in
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.360]  office and they responded to all of their criticism by blaming it on the vast
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:43.800]  right-wing conspiracy and this was a way of dismissing the protests without
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:47.680]  having to actually deal with the criticisms themselves it was all part of
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:51.320]  a vast right-wing conspiracy and we're seeing so much of the Obama
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:56.240]  administration replay the tactics and propaganda and spin from the Clinton
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:13:00.120]  administration for example the reliance on the Dow Jones as the public
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:04.160]  indicator of the state of the economy when we all know that the Dow is really
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.880]  very disconnected from Main Street America right now but all of this
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:11.160]  spontaneous booing that we're seeing all across the country it's not just
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.960]  Democrats there are Republicans up there and Republican politicians are
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.000]  starting to feel the same thing and this all ties in with this little program
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.760]  that we're trying to put together over here and we haven't worked out all the
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:25.160]  details but in a nutshell what we're planning on doing is we're going to pay
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:29.040]  every American forty five hundred dollars to scrap their clunker federal
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:34.360]  government and replace it with something up-to-date and more cost-efficient
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:39.040]  Mike maybe I'm ignorant but I mean obviously you're exposing their stupid
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:44.120]  stupid program and tying it into them you know absolutely we should we should
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:50.160]  scrap the bad government and trade it in so cash for bad governments or cash
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:53.840]  for tyrants what do you call it well cash for clunker government is the is
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:57.440]  what we're working on right now it took me a minute to get it because I was too
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:02.240]  busy literally getting excited is the hair on the back of your neck standing
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:08.120]  up though to realize that go ahead yeah absolutely I'm not trying to look like
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:11.920]  Don King deliberately here this is just sort of happening as time goes on and
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:18.240]  it does I just on a more serious note I do get a strong sense of panic coming
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:24.280]  out of various personal agendas private agendas certainly right now looking at
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:30.240]  what's been going on in the media from for example this whole situation getting
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:37.000]  into the birth certificate what's her name orly tapes going ballistic on MSNBC
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:42.280]  yesterday and the new video that just surfaced in reaction to this corruption
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.080]  scandal going on in New Jersey where people are just screaming at the
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:49.800]  reporters to get away and you know it just feels like the facade is slipping
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:53.720]  the cracks are showing and everybody in positions of power knows it and
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  understands it they're not sure what to do about it let me go one further I'm
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:02.440]  sure you saw the CNBC story we'll put that up on screen for folks watching in
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:06.920]  prison planet dot TV as we sound we'll cast the radio here today that Geithner
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:11.640]  is blowing up and screaming and cussing in meetings with the Federal Reserve
[1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:16.320]  Chairman and others and flipping out panicking over the audit the Fed see
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:22.520]  they've lost their facade Toto pulled the curtain back and there's no putting
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:26.240]  the Humpty Dumpty back together again even if they block this audit or the
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:31.080]  next though the momentum has shifted and once the facade of the left right
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:35.760]  paradigm even has a little hole in it it's all over I mean they're gonna stage
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:39.200]  nuke attacks they're gonna launch wars they're gonna release bio weapons but in
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:43.440]  the end everybody's gonna know they did that too I can tell you fundamentally in
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:47.800]  my gut in my intellect in my spirit micro arrow we're gonna defeat the new
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:51.600]  world order the only problem we face is the fake churches telling folks it's
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:55.400]  the end of the world it's a foregone conclusion you got to go along with it
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:59.920]  evil can't be beaten you're supposed to basically you know suck its toes or
[1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:05.640]  something if we get past that we're gonna win this thing with God's help well I
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.760]  think absolutely you know we used to have this saying around here that the
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:12.080]  fastest way to bring down a dictatorship is to force them to act like one
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.440]  where everybody can see it and this whole issue of attempting to block an
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.080]  audit of the Federal Reserve even if they succeed the political and public
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:25.880]  damage from simply having done that is going to be very devastating to the
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:29.840]  people because remember government very much is like a church it relies on the
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:33.640]  faith and trust and belief of the masses to continue when you have a
[1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.760]  population which openly distrust the government as they do on the economy on
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:42.240]  the swine flu vaccine on all of this this is a government that has lost the
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:46.600]  ability to function effectively and it's just marking time looking for a place to
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:50.120]  collapse into well reading this article from the Wall Street Journal there's
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:54.800]  another one from CNBC of the headline today's outrage Geithner goes ballistic
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.480]  he's in a meeting with the private Fed chiefs and the Fed chairman Bernanke
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.640]  which is just of course the holding company for stealing the 23.7 trillion
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:08.120]  the last 10 months and they're losing control all their member banks are just
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:14.440]  stealing the money they're not having any composure most of these elites I'm
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:18.880]  tracking them are leaving the country right now they realize they have gang
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:23.560]  raped us so bad and screwed us over so bad that it's all gonna collapse that's
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:26.640]  why they're now kind of going okay everything's fine the economy's fine
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:30.240]  before they were saying it was in trouble to scare us to go along with their
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:34.200]  theft now because the Chinese stopped buying T bills last week they're now
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:40.000]  in panic mode my god I smell blood I smell panic I mean Mike I mean they're
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:43.480]  going crazy Geithner screaming and yelling he never does that they're
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:47.560]  frothing fighting with each other it's coming out in the news they're losing
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:52.640]  control well you know there's an axiom about both show business and politics
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:57.320]  which is never let the public see you sweat when they get to that spot where
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:18:01.680]  they're losing it in public you know things are really really bad I personally
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:05.400]  feel we're at the loot the nation stage in this country's history they know they
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:08.840]  can't save it they know they can't fix it they're not even trying it's basically
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:12.160]  grabbing the money shoving it in their pocket and ski daddling for the border
[1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:15.800]  and this is why we're seeing all these arrests and all these reckless tax
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.720]  evasion things and using the names of prisoners and all the rest of this stuff
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.520]  going on everybody knows it's coming to an end they're grabbing the silverware
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:28.000]  and heading for the fire exits absolutely which which I'm saying this is
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.320]  positive it's better than them getting their system through but when it
[1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:37.160]  collapses we want to ensure they don't build something worse on top the ashes
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:41.640]  that's absolutely correct what we the American people need to be doing right
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:46.640]  now very seriously is deciding what kind of a nation we're going to want in the
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:50.360]  next chapter of the history of the North American continent they're going to be
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:54.120]  all kinds of carpet bangers walking around here saying I've got a ready made
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:57.520]  solution a brand new government just plug it in and everything will be fine and
[1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:00.960]  you know that they'll be plugging in something that will serve their interest
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:04.360]  and not that of the people and you just know there's gonna be people walking
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:07.440]  around say well you know you are all honor bound to honor the deaths of the
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:12.040]  previous government no we're not it's all an onerous debt anyway the whole point
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:15.280]  of having one government collapse and starting a new one is everybody gets a
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:19.320]  clean start it's like the ancient Roman Jubilee all debts are wiped out
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:23.280]  everybody gets to start the crazy thing Mike is they set up north common the
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:28.280]  police state and Thomas Barnett and others at the Pentagon admit that this
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:32.440]  whole thing is to extract the money from us money we don't owe to these banks they
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:37.680]  just made all these derivatives up I mean you know there I don't think north
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.480]  comms gonna carry it out no matter how many flues they stage how many terror
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:46.720]  attacks they stage I don't see this working we got rock Howard the chairman
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:50.880]  of the Travis County Libertarian Party coming up Mike stay there we're gonna
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:55.360]  talk to him briefly about this staged event the media is saying it stage which
[1:19:55.360 --> 1:20:00.760]  it wasn't staged they tried to blame the libertarians for it stay with us if
[1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:04.200]  you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new

[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:28.320]  I can play clip after clip of Republicans being booed at tea parties
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:32.840]  because the people know they support open borders socialized health care all
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.440]  this control so the media is lying and saying these booing events are staged
[1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:44.960]  A then B they're lying and saying that it's partisan it's across the board now
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:49.080]  Austin Campaign for Liberty local Ron Paul group they did send a few people
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:52.560]  out there but you watch the crowd of hundreds and my neighbor was there almost
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.720]  all of them are chanting and booing and chasing him out when he told the crowd
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.720]  this is confirmed on local news I don't care what you want I'm gonna pass the
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:06.800]  health care and so Mike Rivera writing shotgun with us with a video connection
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:11.200]  on the radio at prisonplanet.tv rock hour joining us for this segment and a
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:15.160]  little bit of the next in those video clips are coming up rock Howard the
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:21.680]  chairman of the Travis libertarian party it's great to have you on with us good I
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.040]  heard Saturday night you were being blamed by Lloyd dogged the libertarians
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:30.280]  of staging this I heard you on news radio 590 a.m. on of our local affiliates
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:36.320]  last night saying nobody called us we didn't put an email out so they're
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:41.760]  desperate to say that citizens don't spontaneously boo and this has
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:47.800]  become a national story rock Howard did the libertarian party stage this Alex
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:52.480]  we did not we did not discuss this event or urge our people to go of course we
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:56.960]  always urge our members to be active politically at the voice of their
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:02.000]  opinion but no this was not coordinated by us but anyway well isn't that the
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.320]  other big issue the media I don't know if you've seen the same reports I've
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.880]  seen nationally and locally they keep acting like it's dirty to shout and
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:15.160]  chant just say no as dogged's leaving I thought that's as American as baseball
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.760]  and apple pie well I could agree I mean if dogged doesn't want to be a
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:26.240]  representative and listen to all the voices then he can certainly reside well
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:30.280]  that's what it means to be a representative is to listen to all
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:35.280]  your constituents and it sounds like he's having a tough time doing that well
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.840]  he only mailed this out to constituents because Rob do my producer his wife is a
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:44.280]  Democrat right as a Democrat and they filled it out and said we disagree with
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:48.200]  everything you're doing in the Fed we don't want socialist health care and
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.160]  mailed it into him I almost sent cameras but didn't have the crews because my two
[1:26:53.160 --> 1:26:56.040]  crews were in different parts of the country filming for a movie we're
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:27:01.800]  making a film we're making but rock Howard to you what is this signify in
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.200]  America that congressman castles boot off the stage senators specters boot off
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:11.560]  the stage I mean republicans and democrats I mean have you seen the
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:15.560]  video of Cornyn being booed off the stage at the tea party I mean this is
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:19.120]  bipartisan they want to make it a partisan issue why are they trying to
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:24.600]  prop up the political facade well I can't speak to that but I can't say that
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:30.680]  yes I've seen the event with Cornyn I had close friends and members of our
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:35.800]  party we're at both the Cornyn event and the latest event with dogged and we
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:40.920]  don't see it as as a partisan thing we see it as the citizens trying to take
[1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:45.320]  action and I think what I'm hoping that might be behind this and people might
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:49.200]  give you idea is you know maybe it's time in America we did like George
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:54.080]  Washington suggested it just get away from political party because it's not
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:58.120]  proving to be helpful for anything we need to accomplish yeah we need to get
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:03.160]  away from parties and get into issues and until you know the first few
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:06.800]  presidents it wasn't a party issue and then it becomes this coke versus Pepsi
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:11.720]  Chevy versus Ford instead of going hey the same guy owns both factories or
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:15.600]  this it's like Don King boxing with these two parties we need to get rid of
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.760]  Don King stop talking about Republican versus Democrat and talk about the
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.520]  manager of the fight and of course that of course is the exact reason that we
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:28.640]  released our statement is the libertarian party is just simply not
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:34.600]  interested in getting into those coke coke versus Pepsi style arguments that
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:38.600]  have no substance and are all about labels the other thing that you see the
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:42.680]  undercurrent in the media that's very distressing is it's undercurrent that
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:50.080]  somehow all of these events are are racist in nature and that people are
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:54.760]  really upset because the bomb happens to be black oh I think that's very
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:59.200]  disparaging and and I see that undercurrent the media all over the
[1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:04.000]  place that seems to be the the Democratic response to a lot of these
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:10.080]  events you know that is such a big issue and so obvious that I psychologically
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:13.680]  have kind of ignored it because it's so asinine I don't want to live under
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:17.480]  socialism I don't want open borders I don't want to turn my guns in I don't
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:21.560]  want to cap and trade only on the US that'll admittedly double our energy
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:28.000]  prices on on electricity alone and I've been on Democratic radio stations and
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.280]  they go are you a racist and I'm going what is this about I don't want these
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:35.520]  policies Rock Howard do a few more minutes with us I want Mike Rivera to pop
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:39.920]  in and comment on that I don't think this is gonna work though shouting people
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.640]  down as racist if they don't want to turn their guns in we'll be right back

[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:27.960]  collapse of the establishment both parties dropping each other up trying
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:33.640]  to divert the population with this cowboys versus redskins steelers versus
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:41.800]  the Giants distraction and that's all that's happening here rock Howard you
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:47.360]  were bringing up this race issue and you're right I go on air America type
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:53.920]  stations in LA and Dallas in New York and I'll be on talking about the cap and
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:57.600]  trade and how bad it is for industry and they say caller after caller says why
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:02.240]  do you hate black people why are you a racist and I always say well I'm not on
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:08.080]  about that it's I mean this is like some type of cult or something I've never
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:12.640]  heard it this this crazy is the libertarian party getting accused of
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:17.920]  this I haven't seen that particular accusation but we've been lumped in with
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:21.520]  a lot of other people they want to attack like conservatives and so forth
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:24.920]  and the presumption just seems to be they seem to have a talking point right
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:30.240]  now that anybody who disagrees with us is the racist and I've seen that that's
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:33.600]  a pretty difficult thing to overcome but you know it's pretty standard political
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:40.200]  practice but I also see it backfiring I mean anybody with half a brain is gonna
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:44.320]  get sick of that and by overusing the term racist I think in a lot of ways
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:48.440]  it's actually legitimizing a lot of real racist because this people are just
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:53.880]  sick of it I mean I think they're really crying wolf on this I've got one more
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:57.160]  question for in a moment rockin I want to fire the libertarian party Travis
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:01.320]  County site the national site as well but I wanted to go back to Mike Rivera
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:06.480]  we've got the head libertarian party here in Austin on dealing with this do
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.080]  you have any questions for a micro vera well I don't have a question but I do
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:13.600]  have a comment and you're absolutely right this thing about screaming racism
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:18.080]  when any comment or criticism is directed at Obama's policies is going to
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:23.840]  backfire mostly because to use another example Israel has for decades
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:27.800]  anytime you comment or critic criticize their actions in Palestine or Lebanon
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:31.640]  they come back and they say oh you just hate the Jewish people your anti-Semite
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:36.200]  blah blah blah and they've so burned it out that it's not effective anymore and
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:40.880]  people are recognizing that it was just another way of dodging the argument and
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:45.840]  trying to demonize critics and because of that prior experience I think the
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:49.840]  lifespan of using this tactic of screaming racism to critics of Barack
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:53.080]  Obama's administration I think the lifespan can be clocked with an egg
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:56.880]  timer I think it's already starting to come apart people are seeing past that
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:01.320]  tactic and say okay they don't want to deal with the issues what are they
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:05.080]  hiding all right thank you Mike we're gonna go back to you in a moment we let
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:12.120]  rock Howard go here in just a second rock overall summing this up do you think
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:17.080]  it's gonna backfire on the establishment when they a try to say these the
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:23.520]  spontaneous show you know the public showing their disapproval and B do you
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:26.440]  think it's gonna backfire when they keep trying to make it a partisan issue I
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:31.240]  mean as the people get more and more unhappy with this system isn't the
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:36.480]  establishment gonna have to be forced to admit that no actually the American
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:40.640]  people are against this whole big government agenda because the polls show
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:49.520]  the American people are against all of this well there's a big step there that
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:55.400]  undefined you know are we actually gonna have the people rise up and and get
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:01.080]  changed or not and I in my heart of hearts I want to believe it but you know
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:05.160]  will it actually happen I can't predict well let me ask it this way rock
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:08.560]  Howard chairman of the Travis County Libertarian Party are you seeing
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:13.960]  increased interest in the party are you seeing more activism because I know all
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:19.720]  I see is exploding approval for my show once seen is extremely radical I know
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:24.560]  all I'm seeing is massive increases in visits to my websites and people getting
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.680]  my videos and books and every other activist I talked to says that it's
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:32.720]  like we're riding a rocket or something I mean what are you seeing well we're
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:37.560]  seeing a more interest in people wanting to run for office of Libertarian and
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:43.080]  that is that kind of makes sense in this particular battle there's gonna be a
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:47.760]  certain number of people who want to try to to make a change using the political
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:52.600]  mechanism as currently defined it's a difficult road to go but we that's the
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:56.760]  road we're trying to push there are a lot of people who are just so set up with
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:00.800]  politics they don't really want to be involved with any party or was running
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:07.360]  for office and so forth well there's just a certain type of mentality where they
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:12.480]  do want to do that and we are pleased that more and more people do want to get
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:15.680]  involved in that particular way and we're able to make you know we're able
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:21.080]  to get them on the ballot and able to say what needs to be said well we've got
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:25.120]  the Travis County Libertarian Party website up on screen it's Austin liberty
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:30.320]  dot org is that the right site to have a liberty dot org awesome liberty dot com
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:35.880]  and and certainly we are encouraged people who are interested in our local
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:40.680]  activities which are numerous to sign up for our little email list we send out
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:45.000]  every Sunday well rock in closing I want your take on this and we're gonna let
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:51.480]  you go I know you're at work it's this a lot of people have a long view of
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:55.200]  history the establishment does that's why they've won I believe we should work
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:59.120]  on the long view of history getting involved in parties running for political
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:02.800]  office get involved in the medium view of history kind of what you guys are
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:08.440]  doing but also get involved in the on the streets activism just saying no just
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:12.920]  shattering the facade that the public believes in what's happening or the
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:18.480]  public is passive and is going to put up with this because if we don't back the
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.880]  establishment off I do see serious bloody revolution in this country and I
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:27.200]  want to avert that because I believe the establishment will use that to their own
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:32.880]  names your view on bloody revolution well we're trying to do a political
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:38.280]  change without you know requiring a bloody revolution but of course we've
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.480]  been the born by Jefferson on down that you know sometimes you have to take
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:46.320]  things into your hands so people should be prepared for all of
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:50.200]  introvalities all right what's the best national site for the libertarian party
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:55.640]  well you can start with LP dot org to get a hold of our national information
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:40:02.680]  here in Texas there's LP Texas org those are good places to start and if you
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.560]  want to get involved and run for office that's mainly what we do is is get
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:12.040]  people set up to run for office just let us know and you guys are winning more
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:16.880]  and more but just to be clear you've talked to the hierarchy locally the
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.440]  libertarian party it's big a big party here in Austin and no one you know was
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.840]  involved in this or even knew of it but you kind of wish you guys would have
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:30.960]  known because it's not dirty to want to go to an open house at a grocery store
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:35.120]  with a congressman no no we urge our people to go to these type of events
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:40.480]  all the time but this particular event the note the notion that we particularly
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:45.720]  organized or even discussed this particular event with it the in to
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:50.840]  create what doger refers to as a mob I mean we had no such plan that was just
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:54.560]  that's just a big but he doesn't understand what's going on he doesn't
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:59.960]  understand the power of these ideas that are starting to grip people and you
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:04.040]  know maybe this is his first wake up call we'll see all right rock Howard you're
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:07.280]  doing a great job the local party keep it up we appreciate you coming on thank
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:11.960]  Alex always a pleasure you bet now now now folks I just remembered sitting here
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  that I confronted Lloyd dogged and it's viral on the internet I I think I've
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:23.160]  seen on the web Google Alex Jones confronts Lloyd dogged at HEB in North
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:26.280]  Austin you're gonna get to see Alex Jones with the guns though this is the
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:34.920]  Alex Jones of like 12 years ago so we're gonna play that later but I the
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:38.200]  reason I'm spending so much time on this with the flu pandemic coming down on
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:42.600]  us and the talk of martial law and FEMA cams openly being built and hiring
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:46.080]  military for it we're gonna talk about that coming up in a few minutes the
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:49.760]  reason I'm spending so much time on this today is this is the cracks in the
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:53.880]  facade more and more of it breaking more and more light coming in everything
[1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:58.560]  Mike's been talking about Mike I believe the incredible success of Obama was
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.520]  people's desperation for change now that we know he's a fraud that looks like
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:07.880]  it's gonna accelerate the explosive anger you were an Obama supporter you've
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:12.960]  been waking up can you speak to that transformation well definitely I mean we
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:16.640]  came down once again to the lesser of two evils I mean I was a Ron Paul
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:20.600]  supporter until it was obvious he was not gonna be allowed to play and when it
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:24.960]  came down to a choice between McCain and Obama I sort of marginally said okay I
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:29.160]  think Obama because he was selling change and selling hope and that's really
[1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:32.280]  what we needed obviously since then he's been an incredible disappointment to
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:36.560]  everybody his poll numbers are plunging he's already down in bush country and I
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:42.000]  think it is accelerating and and I think when he won the election because he'd
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.520]  been so oversold a lot of people were saying that if he wasn't walking on
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.120]  water by the end of that first week he was gonna be in trouble and since then
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:52.840]  of course obviously he's completely failed his promise to end the wars he has
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:57.400]  just basically kept the US going on the same path it's been going before and of
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:01.800]  course this is tremendous disaffection with Obama and his policies and it's
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:05.920]  got nothing to do with his skin color but like I said it's just a convenient
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:10.360]  deflection device and there's still I think the ultimate reason that this
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:15.000]  government is on its way out they're still trying to play the game by the
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:20.320]  rules and methods that work back in the 1960s in the 1970s this whole swine flu
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.320]  scare is designed to make us forget all about the economy and the wars and
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:28.160]  everything and run to big daddy government saying please save me from
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:32.400]  imminent death it's just a game to make a psychologically dependent on the
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:36.440]  government because we have lost that psychological dependence we all used to
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:39.600]  be addicted to the government we've broken that addiction we've had an
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.280]  intervention thanks to radio shows and blogs like yours and mine and the
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:46.800]  American people are saying you know we really don't need this drug called the
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:51.120]  federal government anymore and it's time to you know go cold turkey on this
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:55.160]  situation and so the government is trying to find some way to re-addict us
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:59.680]  to them on the psychological basis and none of it's working and that's why
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:05.240]  they're in a panic well the main reason that we are becoming unaddicted and
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:08.680]  kicking the habit is just like with heroin or cocaine or alcohol or
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:13.080]  cigarettes it starts making you feel so bad it starts screwing your life up so
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:18.360]  bad they kept pushing and squeezing and more or more more and stealing and
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:23.280]  robbing and it got so incredibly obvious and staging terror attacks to make
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:29.640]  us love them you know it just goes on and on and on and now people are waking
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:35.520]  up but I'm concerned because this abusive creature this pimp is gonna get
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.800]  really aggressive to try to get us back on the plantation and I think that when
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:43.440]  he tries to break our jaw we've got to stand up to him and say look I'm not
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:46.680]  your whore anymore I mean I think it really just comes down to that I mean
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:50.960]  all these videos of cops framing people for no reason and laughing about it
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:55.440]  we're human beings with with I mean cops all the time beat people up and then
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:59.040]  charge you with assaulting them and then on squad car video talk about how
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:03.800]  they're gonna frame you I mean the whole system is beginning to collapse it's
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.360]  gonna happen that's exactly right here I mean the politicians like to talk
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:12.480]  about all these people are objecting to this or that policy no we're past
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:16.640]  caring about any of the fine details the American people are just tired of the
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:22.320]  system as a whole they see it as obsolete as a Cold War relic it really
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:26.480]  should have been allowed to fade away at the same time the USSR did it is time to
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:30.760]  move on to something new and better yeah that's it that's it the Cold War
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:36.240]  meat grinder wants to feed on us now that's what North com is is turning the
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:39.120]  military and it's not enough we give all our money to the military industrial
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:43.440]  complex in the banks now that we've got to be their actual slaves with troops
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:47.400]  marching and tanks driving around suddenly all over the country it's on the
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:51.400]  news oh the army's gonna be in the town now with tanks driving around I mean
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:57.160]  what it's it's ridiculous well look how hard they're trying to reignite war with
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:01.200]  Russia I mean we were all buddy buddy with the new Russian republics and now
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.160]  all of a sudden when they can't sell the war on terror and the war on global
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:08.160]  warming now they're trying to create a war with Russia this government cannot
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:12.480]  exist unless it's in the process of killing somebody and making us pay for it
[1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:16.040]  and that's really what's coming to an end at this point because the American
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:19.240]  people are tired of paying for it they're tired of bleeding for it they don't
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:23.560]  understand why it's our job to go around the world killing brown people excellent
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.320]  points Mike just excellent points let's start getting these video clips because I
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:31.640]  want to take some calls and also shotgun through some other news in Houston
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.440]  they're proposing cameras in citizens homes that's Houston Chronicle and local
[1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:41.040]  TV just out England says if parents are going to be allowed to have kids that all
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:45.520]  the homes will have a camera that child protective services watches 24 hours a

[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:06.640]  story reprint it for me and a link through to the mainstream news article
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:12.440]  they link to the mainstream media is with a straight face reporting that we
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:16.360]  have to have cameras in our houses now that's what this textbook says all
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:21.680]  children will be taken at birth and raised in government facilities most
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.800]  will be sterilized only a select few will be tested and allowed to have
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:29.880]  children I mean this is the scientific dictatorship the government is in
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:33.440]  competition with the family with everything these are control freaks

[1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:12.280]  hey a lot of people are talking about Governor Ventura's conspiracy TV show
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:16.200]  coming out it is gonna be airing on truth TV and I'm gonna be interviewed for
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:21.560]  some of the episodes some can't wait to be on TV with Jesse Ventura certainly
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:27.720]  fight the New World Order ladies and gentlemen and we got Mike Rivera with us
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:31.640]  for 30 minutes into the next hour we do have William that shot the footage you're
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:35.560]  seeing popping in for a couple minutes the next segment just another witness
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:38.880]  this is nonpartisan the people don't believe anything the government says
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:45.280]  here it is the rest of it where they're booing him
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:59.400]  you're referring to the president there he is a citizen of the United States
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:07.520]  and then it goes on from there the majority of the crowd booing now Mike
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:10.760]  after our guest leaves we'll talk about the birther issue because I know you've
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:14.280]  been critical haven't we posted your articles up on info wars.com the what
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:17.760]  really happened on com stories but regardless again this is illustrating
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:22.400]  what you said people aren't buying anything if government said the sky was
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:27.560]  blue and that water was wet and that cable or elves like cookies people
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:31.920]  wouldn't believe it now and you're absolutely right and the problem is the
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:35.960]  government has lied to the people so many times now that if there were a real
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:41.280]  genuine emergency the government cannot govern us because we're not going to go
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:45.520]  along we don't dare take the risk of being made fools of again and this is a
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.600]  government which is is no longer effective they've tried they've ruled us
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:53.640]  with deception and trickery so long we don't want to fall for it any longer if
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:58.000]  something really bad really did happen and the government tried to marshal the
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.960]  American people in a given direction even for their own good it's not going
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:05.760]  to work because they've lost the trust of the American people and this means
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:09.800]  even in the best of intentions this government cannot function any longer
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:13.240]  well Mike that's my next question I want your take on we open the phones up I
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:16.600]  want to understand this from the listeners from their perspective
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:22.400]  Mexico North Korea just because people lose faith doesn't mean that the elites
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:27.080]  get kicked out just the society collapses and the elite look like they
[1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:29.880]  know that's going to happen and they're just going to own the police state and
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:34.480]  be in power and their armored compounds but this is different our history is
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:38.800]  different we're armed we have this history of freedom this is going to be an
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:42.880]  explosive mix Mike I don't think we're gonna end up like Mexico I think it's
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:48.280]  gonna I think it's gonna end up being an absolute bloodbath well I tend to lean
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:51.360]  toward another direction I agree we're not gonna end up like Mexico or North
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:55.600]  Korea we could see a revolution hopefully as fast as the one in Romania
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:59.680]  but I really do think ultimately that we're going to see the US government
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:05.880]  basically collapse the way the USSR did with very little bloodshed and yeah and
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:10.720]  I really do hope that that is our final outcome but if there is going to be a
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:15.440]  bloody revolution I think it'll be over as quickly as the one in Romania was well
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:19.560]  you know the issue is the enemy has seen what they're doing they they're
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:23.760]  sociologists think they're psychologists and they're gearing up it seems wanting
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.200]  to have a fight and I mean I don't have some macho strain in me that wants to go
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:32.800]  out and go up against a bunch of tough guys who were into that because I know
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:36.520]  what's gonna happen to me and them I don't know if the tough guys realize
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:40.880]  this that fighting people in the right is not like chasing some bank robbers
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:44.800]  around or going out for some meth heads and when they start trying to break up
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:50.800]  families and send people to camps I would not want to be the FBI HRT I
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:56.280]  would not want to be the local military I mean history actually shows that and I
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:02.000]  highly armed guerrilla force will just smash them well I'd like to respond to
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.040]  that first of all if we let the government decide when a violent
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:08.720]  confrontation is going to take place we will lose it because the government is
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:11.360]  going to basically control the high ground and they're going to control the
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:15.480]  decision-making but in the end we the American people don't need to march into
[1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:19.080]  Washington DC to defeat the federal government because along with all of
[1:58:19.080 --> 1:58:22.360]  that incredible debt we've got all this foreign investment here in the United
[1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:26.000]  States that stays here only because the government has convinced investors it's
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.760]  safe here so all a revolution has to do to win they don't have a conquer they
[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:35.960]  just have to survive the way Castro did in Cuba I just want to get off our back
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:40.240]  I mean they've got his court and they've got his cornered attack
[1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:45.560]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:52.880]  decade we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons

[1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:04.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company

[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:12.960]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:59:12.960 --> 1:59:16.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high
[1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:19.640]  demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:23.160]  storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:27.320]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:31.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:25.680]  Alex Jones. Ron Paul was on with us last week he was on with us for 30 minutes

[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:43.640]  that's the specter video I told the guys to put the specter up but I'm wrong
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:49.120]  guys go ahead and put the castle video back up this is congressman Castle at a
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:56.040]  town hall meeting in Delaware this was a bipartisan crowd and the issue is
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:01.800]  Tea Party's Republicans Democrats get booed off the stage Governor Rick Perry
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:09.280]  Senator Cornyn we're gonna play those videos coming up to illustrate that this
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:14.680]  is bipartisan being booed off the stage and people are now trying to say this
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:21.760]  was staged with Castle so we've got the radio listener this show William on and
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:24.440]  William I would challenge you to just put more of the raw video up to show it's
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:27.640]  other people in the crowd booing on other issues why do you think the
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:31.560]  establishment is so desperate to make it look like the majority of Americans
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  aren't upset well that's the game they've been playing for the longest time
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:40.880]  now haven't they Alex I mean this they're they're stuck on the same game
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:48.400]  plan and you cannot stop the waking giant well I agree with you I mean I mean
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.000]  the giant has just now started having its morning cup of coffee and just a few
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:55.880]  minutes ago politically a few years ago in the timeframe he was getting out of
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:59.520]  bed and shaking his head and getting a cold drink of water I mean I don't think
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:04.480]  they can reverse this but but in a nutshell some people are saying this was
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:09.120]  staged as well where were you how many people in the crowd what percentage
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:16.560]  would you say were upset with him I would say 95% of the people in that crowd
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:21.960]  were upset with him before they even got there let's remember that this that
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:28.200]  town hall took place three days after his boat for cap and trade and three
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:33.720]  quarters of the people in the crowd were seniors I would say at least 50% were
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:38.200]  seniors and you know they were there on top of not only the cap and trade but
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:42.720]  also this was supposed to be on health care and there wasn't anybody
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:46.560]  representing the insurance company they had all these talking heads up there
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:51.400]  from all these different agencies but no one from the insurance and it's just
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:56.320]  you can hear throughout the video you can find it on my YouTube channel
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:02.800]  William Dawes and Delaware of them talking about every subject every
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:07.120]  subject that man gets booted down not only the birther thing that was just a
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:12.200]  video that took off he was down on cap and trade he was down on the health
[2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:16.720]  care they're questioning listen in another foot yeah go ahead well listen
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:23.000]  Mike I know I forgot we gave you the UPS number I don't sometimes UPS won't let
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:28.160]  people put numbers down like FedEx just mail me a dub of the tapes and because I
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:31.240]  want to put it in the Obama film I also want to just go ahead and put it out and
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:35.600]  show people what you told me is true that it was every issue because this is key
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.840]  it means the government's losing all confidence this is happening at every
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:43.360]  major event and the establishments corruption is really showing through
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:47.280]  here so let me pay a hundred bucks or whatever for your cost of dubbing and
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:51.840]  sending it Alex Alex I would never take a dime from you okay well I would not
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:56.960]  have it I will have it thank you just send it as fast you can I want to hold
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.520]  you over but I want to get a comment from Mike Rivera right now Mike you heard
[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:05.680]  him they're booing him on no matter what it is they hate his guts did what is
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:10.040]  happening Mike what is happening is the American people are just sick of the
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:13.320]  entire system it's no longer a question of whether you favor one side of the
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.560]  other or one policy or another people are just tired of the whole thing it's

[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:11.600]  clips showing that it was just everything he said they weren't buying
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:16.240]  they're all there they're they're all up there on the William Dawes and Delaware
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:21.280]  youtube channel and let me just say what what's happened since these this video
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:25.760]  has come out is my castle and 10 of their congressmen have gotten together and
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:30.160]  looked at this footage and seen the way the people have react reacted and now
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:35.200]  they are not doing any more town hall meetings now I am trying to find out
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:41.600]  where he's gonna be during this recess and if he doesn't have any public town
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:46.480]  hall meetings or is not willing to take questions then he can be looking for me
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:50.640]  when he goes back in this session because I will go down to Washington it is not
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:53.760]  that far oh no listen if they sequester themselves
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:58.400]  like true tyrants and stop talking to the people you go to his house in protest
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:01.920]  because these are our representatives they're selling us out to offshore
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:04.640]  foreign banks it is our right it is our duty to
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:08.160]  peaceably let them know our right to assemble
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:12.720]  and petition for redress of grievances uh yeah all over the country that's
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:17.280]  another issue they're canceling town halls or like cheney did and bush did
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:21.200]  by 2006 when they had you know totally dead approval ratings
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:25.200]  they would give you tickets and then arrest people that had anti bush
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:28.000]  stickers in the parking lot remember that
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.440]  micro vero my micro vero this is the last phase isn't it when they start
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:37.200]  bivvacking and and and hiding in their armored keeps
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:42.560]  far away from the people isn't this the last act of a tyrant
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:46.400]  the uh what what it is it's signs of a government that is deathly afraid of
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:49.360]  its own people and you contrast that with the videos
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:52.880]  that we saw of saddam hussein before the invasion where he was just walking in
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:56.080]  the streets without armor and protection and then you turn around you see
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:59.120]  dick cheney in his car with the two and a half inch thick
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:02.960]  lexan windows and yeah this government is terrified of the people they're
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:06.240]  trying to figure out some way they can keep control but they're scared
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:09.760]  they are scared of us right now well that's a great point you make about
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:13.280]  saddam hussein the cia protege i'm not saying he's a good guy
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.760]  but he would go everywhere with people with with machine guns dancing around
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:20.880]  him you don't see our little cowardly criminal
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:25.520]  guide nerves and people doing that no you don't you absolutely don't
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:29.840]  and uh it really is an indication that our government has really taken care of
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:31.920]  itself and they've abandoned the needs of the people
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:36.080]  and they know it they know we know it and and yes it's a symptom of the coming
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:39.760]  crash well william had to go he was at work i
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:43.680]  apologize uh to making him hold and not letting him finish but you know that's
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:46.560]  my trademark so william will have you back up as a
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:49.600]  guest we really appreciate you william is not his name that's
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.240]  name of his youtube channel and he's going to send us the raw video but i
[2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:55.040]  didn't know he had the other booing going on
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:15:58.800]  and and see if people don't get why i'm so excited
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:03.520]  every congressman and democrat you know and that we know we see these videos
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:06.960]  every day as being booed they could be talking about the price of a ham
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:11.600]  sandwich people are booing them and unless you're a ron paul or a dennis
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:14.640]  kacinich whether you love them or hate them they actually
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:17.520]  stand for what they stand for and will listen to you
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:21.520]  and do what they say they're going to do and so
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:24.800]  we're winning i mean this is really happening
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:28.320]  mike i mean i know i keep i don't usually get you on for over an hour
[2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:32.000]  and just talk about one subject but isn't this the one overarching
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.880]  big subject yeah i would agree i mean i'm seeing all the signs that the federal
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:39.440]  government cannot sustain itself much longer
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.040]  and i think the state governments now need to start making serious plans
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:46.560]  contingency plans on moving themselves and their economies
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:49.920]  forward in the event of a collapse of the federal government and they need to
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:53.680]  start looking at issuing their own currencies they need to make those plans
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:57.520]  now they can't wait until the collapse is upon them because then it's going to be
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:01.360]  panic and it's going to be chaos if anybody any state governors listening
[2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:04.640]  to this if you're smart you will very quietly start making your
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.000]  preparations now for the possibility that you may be
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:11.920]  in a country without a federal government in the very very near future
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:16.480]  yeah super analysis mike i want to blitz through some news and take some
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:19.600]  calls with you hell i'll keep you the whole rest of the hour if you can do it
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:23.040]  mike or do you have to get back to your to the tv show no i can stay for the
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:25.840]  till the top of the hour all right you're awesome because i got a host of
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:30.000]  issues i want to go through let's play now the clip
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.880]  of senator specter and one of his other minions
[2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:40.960]  being booed off the stage as well on other issues of health care
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  so he says let's do this fast we got to ram this through
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:49.760]  and his own constituents begin booing here's our own specter
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.160]  i mean the turnout today and across and and the interest that's being shown
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:57.840]  across the country demonstrates how personal and how important health care
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:01.840]  is to citizens across the country
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:05.280]  largely i think people's apprehension about this
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:08.880]  about what's pending in congress at this point is because they're unsure
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:12.640]  of what's going to wind up happening it's a matter of trust and whether or not
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:16.640]  they're being represented in congress the right way so my question to you
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:21.040]  is when congressman scoff at the notion of reading legislation because they
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:24.880]  aren't qualified or they aren't competent to understand it
[2:18:24.880 --> 2:18:28.640]  how's how can we be confident that those congressmen are competent to
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:36.320]  re-engineer the entire health care
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:44.320]  i am i am not a member of congress have never been
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:51.120]  that's just a fact i'm just i'm just telling you if
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.120]  my information is i have never seen members of congress work harder and it
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:01.760]  is unacceptable to me
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:06.320]  hours and hours and hours that's the health and human services secretary
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:07.120]  with specter
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:09.760]  read the legislation and tell them to go back and read it
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:12.880]  we do
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:17.680]  good pause here comes specter now what can they do they say no one's been allowed
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:20.560]  to read it she goes oh that sounds reasonable make them read it
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:24.880]  because the crowd's going oh they look scared now listen to what specter says
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:28.080]  and everybody goes wild we'll do that after the break it might take on it
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:31.280]  but see this is why i kept saying we are changed in 9-11 truth and all this is
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:36.320]  so big as soon as the public saw us myself going back all these years ago
[2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:40.640]  videotaping my own confrontations bringing up once the public learns how
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:45.840]  to do this it's over it's over so no wonder bush had people
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:49.920]  hide with wheelchairs in alleys to run out run wheelchairs into us and
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:53.200]  scream they've attacked my daughter because they were trying to demonize
[2:19:53.200 --> 2:19:56.800]  us but they've been caught now so this is so exciting
[2:19:56.800 --> 2:20:00.240]  we'll be right back after this quick break the people are awakening
[2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:04.880]  haha today jim newcomer from mitis resources august 4th 2009

[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:28.720]  embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit then cart the
[2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:32.240]  money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:36.640]  forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt is this capitalism or was jefferson
[2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:40.320]  correct when he said the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:43.360]  menace to the liberties of the people in a standing army

[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:28.560]  bingboot first let's get mike's take on this
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:32.800]  mike i mean this is actually starting to even freak me out i mean the public is
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:35.840]  just i guess once the facade
[2:25:35.840 --> 2:25:40.640]  drops it really drops where is all i don't i don't think all their north com
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:45.120]  bullying is going to work what do you say no it isn't you know admiral iseroku
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:48.800]  yama moto made an observation about americans just before the attack on pearl
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:53.680]  harbour said america's a sleeping giant they're very slow to anger but once you
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:57.680]  get them there watch out and i think we're there i think we're really there
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.440]  i'm listening to these crowds i have never heard anything like this in my
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:04.800]  entire lifetime i think this is definitely the start of the final
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:09.120]  stage of this government and again it's not one policy it's not one
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:12.160]  individual i know mr magic bullet is up there
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:14.560]  and people are they're fed up with his lies
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:18.240]  they're just disaffected with the system as a whole
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:21.760]  and they're looking at how badly the government has mismanaged everything i
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:24.480]  mean they've already run out of money on the cash for clunkers and they want to
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:28.800]  take over health care and the bottom line is what we wanted for health care
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:32.720]  was to stop spending money on war and spend that money on americans
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:36.160]  what obama's plan is we're still going to pay 50 percent of everything we make
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:40.320]  to support the war machine and pay more for health care that's the deal we have
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:43.440]  right now and the money to the bankers 23.7
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:47.360]  trill people now found out the fed paid banks not to loan to us
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:50.800]  to keep the economy depressed so they can consolidate
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:54.880]  i mean man this folks this is dangerous i mean this
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:58.640]  this is serious and the police are delusional and arrogant
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:02.560]  the government is and they think they've got us and i i i mean i tell you it is
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:07.200]  going to be one hell of a collision uh let's go ahead and
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:11.040]  play this clip of cornan see the media is making it only democrats getting
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:13.680]  booed because they want to make it look like the party in power
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:17.840]  no it's everybody getting booed this is cornan coming to a tea party
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:21.760]  he basically organized trying to hijack it now now again this is the
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:25.680]  libertarians liberals and conservatives saying no we don't like you cornan
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:32.960]  same thing happened to rick perry here it is
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:36.640]  as a senator was trying to speak many were calling him a traitor
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:40.320]  cornan was the only senator who did not vote on the stimulus plan
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:44.480]  he had previously announced that he will be taking a stand against what he
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:48.240]  thinks is wasteful spending and unprecedented government growth
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:51.680]  the senator even had a few words about governor sarah palin's recent
[2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:55.840]  resignation announcement it's a little hard to know what to make of it it
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:00.960]  could be a very shrewd move uh to allow okay stop it
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:04.240]  that was the media spending it they were booing him over the trans texas
[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:07.120]  corridor i think they try to imply because he
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:10.480]  didn't vote for the stimulus they were mad like all these libertarians we want
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:14.960]  more government i mean boy i tell you the media
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:19.440]  micro vero your take on this do you remember during the aborted attempt at
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:24.240]  a coup d'etat in iran where the corporate media took pictures of a pro
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:29.280]  amadine shod rally and they captioned them as anti amadine shod and we caught
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:32.000]  them on it and bbc was forced to apologize
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.280]  we're seeing the same thing all over again they're hearing all this screaming
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:39.200]  and they're trying to say okay what do we want to portray the american people
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:43.600]  are against and we'll put that label on there and they're completely misrepresenting
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:48.000]  what all of this anger is about because i had to replay that because i meant to
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.720]  play a patriot's raw footage and then we play a newscast
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:55.360]  but it's kind of good we did because it unless i miss that was the media acting
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:29:00.240]  like the tea party was mad because they wanted the stimulus
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:03.520]  something yeah something like that i mean it's almost a joke it's like they're
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:09.040]  trying to show the crowds raise our taxes raise our taxes
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:13.360]  hey i saw listen to this one time i've been burning you in flags

[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:23.360]  and they put it on the news with close shots that it was me burning the
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:26.720]  american flag when i was burning a u n flag i mean

[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:22.320]  but there's a popular tv show that airs in los angeles they air different
[2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:26.160]  films on the second biggest tv station broadcast station in the country
[2:33:26.160 --> 2:33:29.600]  we're talking to the guy that aired the obama deception i got some feedback i
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:32.320]  was actually in la when it was on
[2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:36.320]  working on some other exciting things but the point is is that
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:40.000]  they have banned it airing the part two right the so
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:43.440]  we the people tv they they get a hour time
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:48.560]  from the stations called kxla and abraham is the head of we the people
[2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:51.280]  tv anyway he called me up they wanted to air obama
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:55.280]  deceptions we sent it to him and he they he couldn't cut it down he wanted to
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:58.800]  try to get into one hour and he said he couldn't do it so they are part one
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:02.640]  and uh he said the response was huge people were calling him up a lot of
[2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:05.520]  people were thankful that he put it on some people didn't want to believe it
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:08.480]  and he said well just research information you know he watched and
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:14.000]  he said it's all spot on and um and then part two was supposed to air
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:18.560]  the next week and i think that so it would have been the 19th in the 26th
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:21.920]  it was supposed to air part two and they didn't air it and the owner of the
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:24.560]  station kept calling up abraham and sending him
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:28.400]  email saying hey when's what's your next program what's your next program he
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:31.360]  keeps telling him it's on your desk part two is what we're gonna air that's our
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:34.000]  next program and he they won't do it so he's

[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:48.480]  there uh but go ahead and roll here i am
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:52.640]  confronting loyde dogged at another grocery store
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:55.840]  here it is through piecemeal ever since william jefferson
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:59.920]  flinton and the hunting east has got in and the main question
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:03.920]  that i have to you is about the national i
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:07.040]  d card and the thumb scanners that are being put in
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:10.320]  in the state police departments to get driver's license across the state
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:15.040]  your state texas since 94 has been thumb scanning all to get a driver's license
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.920]  and now in the 1997
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:23.440]  record clinton has now entered it in that he wants
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:26.480]  urine and blood testing for 25% randomly selected
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:28.880]  now i know that's two questions can you firstly wait your stance is on the
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.720]  national i d car with privacy issues and then can you answer the urine and
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:36.000]  blood testing is now in the federal register well you've asked me about a
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:39.920]  series of things one of them is thumb printing by state police departments
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:43.200]  and my suggestion is that you take it up with george bush
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:46.320]  to the extent that there are decisions made by the texas department of public
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:49.200]  safety that are done here in the state of texas
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:53.040]  as a federal program they are uh... state administered here
[2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:58.080]  was mandated by president clinton uh... i suggest that you take up with the
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:01.760]  state of texas the way it's operating and if it doesn't want to do these
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.080]  programs for it to contact me and other people in the
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:10.480]  delegation and express that concern and they won't get its highway money
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:14.560]  uh... i welcome uh... you're forwarding your concern that's extortion sir that's
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:18.320]  extortion if you came out to do uh... radio program
[2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:21.040]  uh... you want to ask questions but if you want to have a show you're not

[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:11.120]  but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:14.480]  because then it costs nothing to be a patriot
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.320]  yeah let's get the end the end's good

[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:06.560]  left smiley face slave the conflagration is coming
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:10.400]  and mike it is coming now look at us 12 years later
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:14.560]  what's happening to lord dogged now well listen i gotta tell you one thing
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:17.680]  first comment i have for you alex you gotta stop sugarcoating this stuff and
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:22.800]  start telling these people how you really feel about it
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:26.560]  oh man but i mean look at the change from 12 years ago mike you were doing this
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:30.320]  12 years ago 15 years ago i was doing this 15 years ago and
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:34.560]  yes it is an amazing change here uh and just looking back over this
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:37.600]  i don't know i'm not ready to get into that nostalgia phase yet because we've
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:41.280]  still got a long way to go here and this is the crisis point but yes looking
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:44.400]  back it is it is such a shock of what it was like in those
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:46.800]  early days when there were just a few of us out there and
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:50.560]  we were getting death threats and attacks and hackers and now the government
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:54.560]  was wrecking my career in hollywood and just all that stuff and now it's
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:57.280]  it's reversed around now where the american people
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:00.880]  know we've been telling them the truth all along the government has been lying
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:04.320]  they're upset they're angry they're not going to put this genie back in the
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:08.080]  bottle and i i think really i i think it's an even money
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:12.240]  bet whether the federal government will even be here by the end of the year
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:15.600]  absolutely um well we can do whatever we want if we just
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:19.360]  believe in it and take action and have the truth on our side
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:22.480]  i do want to go to some phone calls here but
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:26.800]  before you leave us mike i want to get into
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:31.600]  just all the other incredible news u k government to install surveillance
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:37.360]  cameras in private homes the times of london uh the telegraph and others are
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:42.640]  reporting this like it's no big deal and they're saying oh
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:45.760]  parents whose kids get any type of trouble at school
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:49.440]  or toddlers that have you know if you're poor you're at risk
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.360]  we actually cover this in endgame where they say kids are put on probation at two
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:57.600]  is of quote bad gene pools that you will now have cameras in the home but let's
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:00.880]  just do this down then we'll go to calls and then cover the other news
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:04.400]  u k government to install surveillance cameras in private homes the government
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:07.360]  is about to spend 700 million dollars to install surveillance cameras inside
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.280]  private homes of citizens to ensure that children go to bed on time attend
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:14.560]  school and eat proper meals this is a boil down from
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:17.760]  paul joseph watson at prisonplanet.com he has the links
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:21.760]  to the mainstream news story in fact guys go to the original online and click
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:25.600]  on his links i want folks to see the mainline stories on this
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:29.040]  because they'll be in denial now the government is embarking on a scheme
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:32.400]  called family intervention projects which will literally create a nanny state on
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:34.960]  steroids with social services goons and private
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:38.080]  security guards given an authority to make regular home checks to ensure
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:40.320]  parents are raising their children correctly
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:43.280]  telescreens will be installed they already have these all over the streets
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:48.000]  i've been yelled at them in england as a face yelling orders at you
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:52.160]  so it's two-way cameras so government spies keep an eye on the parents
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:55.280]  are mistreating kids or whether the kids are fulfilling their obligations
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:43:00.080]  under pre-signed contracts with the schools in the beta test
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:03.200]  2 000 families have been targeted for the program
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.680]  so far the government wants to snare 20 000 more in the next two years
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:11.680]  and the taxpayer will pay for it now same thing in the u.s
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:15.360]  you get in trouble now for petty things and they say well take a bracelet and
[2:43:15.360 --> 2:43:19.520]  take a camera in your house and then soon it's just everybody has to do it
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:24.320]  i mean micro vero yesterday i played a news clip out of san antonio
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:29.200]  where the federal government is saying they may ship federal employees so see
[2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:33.920]  they always abuse their enforcers first so then the enforcers will say
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:39.920]  okay then it's reasonable for me to make citizens do it if i'm being abused
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:43.440]  micro vero yeah absolutely you know the the mentality
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:46.480]  as well if i went along with it you should as well
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:49.440]  uh... but the question is not whether or not you've got a chip it's whether
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:53.360]  you're going to be targeted using it i mean if everybody has a tv camera in
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:43:55.920]  their home that's one thing the question is
[2:43:55.920 --> 2:43:59.280]  who specifically is being watched and targeted
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:02.720]  there may be cameras in the homes of congressmen and federal employees
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:05.920]  but nobody's going to be watching them because they're the quote-unquote good
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:09.120]  guys the the thing is when a system goes in like this
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:12.800]  it doesn't abuse everybody it just abuses the targeted few
[2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:16.800]  that the government feels are a real threat
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:23.280]  well but i mean everybody's read 1984 at least knows what big brother is
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:27.440]  cameras in school bathrooms now cameras in our homes
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:32.480]  uh i'm sure you've seen the video of the police in florida framing the poor lady
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.480]  because they run into her and then i mean and just it's funny
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:41.760]  framing somebody ruining their life these guys have no conscience
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:45.360]  no they absolutely do not and there's no question this is a police state and it's
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:50.400]  1984 all over again and again it is a symptom of incredible
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:54.240]  fear and paranoia on the part of the government and the more they do stuff
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:57.200]  like this the more the the tv cameras go up the more the
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:00.400]  intrusiveness and the reading of the emails the more angry the american
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:02.560]  people are going to get because they recognize it
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:06.240]  for what it is the american people are smelling blood in the water
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:09.120]  they understand the government must be very weak
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:13.520]  to be taking these kind of draconian measures to protect itself
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:17.760]  well also there's a sigh up going on i thought federal statistics where the
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:22.480]  crime had dropped 25 percent and i was right i hadn't looked at federal
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.880]  crime statistics for murder since 2000 when i was working on a film
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:33.040]  and it was a 25 drop from 1982 the previous crime uh you know
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:36.400]  manslaughter murder statistic and an overall crime plunge
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:40.880]  from 82 at the peak of the you know drug war and all that
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:44.960]  all the way down until the last time i looked in 2000 it was a 25 percent
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:49.440]  it's 39 drop now in homicides i was looking at these federal
[2:45:49.440 --> 2:45:54.240]  statistics last night 39 drop but americans believe
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:59.600]  there are more homicides because the government and the media are lying
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:03.680]  yeah they're trying to keep up the level of fear government needs there to be
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:07.440]  crime in the streets in order to get us psychologically dependent
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:11.360]  on the police force but the police don't actually stop crime they're never
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:14.800]  present to prevent crime they always show up after the fact
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:18.480]  stand around in their nice impressive uniforms and promise justice which is a
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:21.120]  fancy name for revenge but you know they all saying when
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:23.680]  seconds count the police will be there in minutes
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:27.360]  more crimes are thwarted by citizens carrying their own firearms
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:31.520]  than by the police and that is an absolute fact of life in america
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:36.080]  and so as we start thinking about a world without a gigantic dictatorial
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:40.000]  federal government we have to realize we can take care of ourselves a lot better
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.400]  than the federal government can take care of us
[2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:45.920]  and exactly and i want to be clear we have a great history of good police and
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:48.480]  military in this country and there's a lot of great cops i see
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:51.680]  changing tires and helping at car wrecks and
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:55.200]  you know helping when somebody goes crazy and kills their wife and
[2:46:55.200 --> 2:46:58.320]  i run into a lot of austin cops that are great people
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:00.880]  and i even like the austin police chief even though he has a lot of
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:04.240]  unconstitutional stuff he really believes what he's doing
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:08.400]  you know the issue here is though there are videos surfacing every day of cops
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:13.200]  framing people and the cops are so ignorant and and so
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:16.480]  calm with and that's how normal criminals get caught
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:20.560]  is they commit the crime so many times they get uh lackadaisical they get
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:23.520]  overconfident and they'll their own squad car
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:26.240]  videos are busting them most the time we're citizens now
[2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:29.360]  more and more or neighbors are videotaping with a camera
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:32.960]  you know in the bushes or on their front porch and pick up the cops framing
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:36.080]  people and i don't even play these videos here
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:39.920]  nine times out of ten because it's depressing i'm not on some
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:44.000]  jihad or some crusade out to get the police
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:47.360]  i grew up watching the police where i live deal drugs
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:51.520]  in rockwall texas the sheriff while i was in high school went to prison for
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:55.600]  dealing drugs i knew i was at a few parties and i wasn't in the
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:00.000]  drug crowd uh where drugs were delivered by police and
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.960]  sheriff's deputies you know because the older brother'd be there with his
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:05.840]  girlfriend and oh look i got some ecstasy or marijuana
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:10.560]  from the uh you know from the cop and you'll be an off duty cop and so then
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:13.840]  i'd see the same cop involved in drug raids at the school
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:20.320]  and i went something's wrong here and you know they've had cases in new york
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:24.000]  city where they fired 70 plus percent of their detectives over drug dealing
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:27.600]  now they don't fire them remember the luke radowski footage i don't know if
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:31.440]  you've seen this it's in truth rising mic where
[2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:35.760]  they march up the police do and say we're gonna say your backpack's a bomb and
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:39.600]  arrest you if you don't stop protesting and they grab his camera and say this is
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:43.440]  a gun the police have reached a new level of
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:47.840]  corrupt when on camera they will frame you i mean they
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:52.000]  home and when you watch these cops framing this lady in in in florida
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:55.680]  it's funny she's done nothing and they're framing her
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:01.040]  and they're laughing uh i mean that is scary mic
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:05.120]  well what it seems like to me is because of all the uh veterans that are being
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:07.680]  hired into the police force it's not too surprising
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:10.960]  that the police are starting to treat american citizens the way our army's
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:15.120]  been treating the iraqi people and it's understandable i don't have to
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:18.240]  like it and i certainly don't but that's exactly what's going on
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:21.200]  they're going crazy with those taser guns because they've been assured they're
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:24.960]  non-lethal they're tasering pregnant women and grandmothers and
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:28.640]  dogs and it's just this big old joke of you know pull the trigger and watch the
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:31.840]  people scream and dance around you know isn't that a fun way to spend
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.000]  friday night yeah it's a crazy arrogantness because
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:40.080]  listen to these police videos they are getting off on it
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:44.160]  it's like they're crazy frat guys that have been given a lot of adrenaline
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:48.000]  and power and they're going wild meanwhile the citizens aren't
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:51.760]  the citizens are really starting like the hulk to
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:56.000]  i mean really start getting mad well that's what we're seeing in all these
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.120]  political rallies where people are screaming at the government because
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:02.000]  that's the visible face of the government people are very unhappy with
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.960]  life in the united states the government claimed to be controlling
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:07.680]  everything the government is going to take the blame the democrats are
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:11.040]  catching most of it because we the people handed them congress and the
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:14.320]  white house expecting change and we just got more of the same
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:17.680]  so like it or not the democrats are in control they're going to catch the
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:20.240]  blame for this the republicans are catching it too
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:24.240]  americans are realizing it isn't one party of the the other it's the system
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:28.960]  as a whole has gone completely out of control it's become fascist
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:33.120]  it has foreign corporate interest use the federal government as a giant nozzle
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:36.400]  to scoop up and suck up all our money and treasure and most importantly our
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:38.880]  freedoms what really happened dot com's the website

[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:16.080]  webster tartley's coming up to get into eugenics with us he's
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:20.080]  read the white house battle plan on how to take all your children at birth
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:26.400]  how to sterilize them by the way express daily express it says uh 20 000
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:31.360]  parents will have 24-hour cctv cameras watching every move they make
[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:34.960]  that they eat proper meals go to bed on time the children will be taken
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:38.640]  basically the first time they make a mistake by armed security guards
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:42.320]  everything is to be a prison and then united states is going to be the same
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:45.440]  way and when they're done all of your children will be taken
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:48.560]  and raised in dormitories and turned against you by the state
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:53.520]  they mean business they're so bold micro vero
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:56.880]  what is wrong with the brits i mean they're already proposing this in houston
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:00.320]  too i mean does their government think they'll put
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.000]  up with anything well i think all governments assume
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:07.360]  that their people will put up with everything until they cross that line
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:11.600]  and there's a backlash i mean if you look at the history of most nations
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:15.280]  that have had serious political upheavals it all starts with the
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:18.960]  government just taking that one step too far across the line
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:21.520]  it's like it says right in the declaration of independence
[2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:24.880]  people are disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:28.000]  but when you get over that line i mean that's the mistake that charles the
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.720]  first made it's the mistake chow chesky made
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:36.000]  louis the 16th musolini sooner or later every tyrant crosses that line where
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:39.360]  the people just say okay this is really more than we can stand
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:42.800]  and there's going to be a huge backlash i think we're very close to it here in
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:45.600]  the united states i don't know what's wrong with the british
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:48.400]  putting up with this kind of constant surveillance
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:51.360]  and uh... who knows maybe there's drugs in the water over there
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:54.400]  but all i can tell to our british listeners is remember i've been to that
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:57.920]  tower of london that big wood block still is there
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:56:02.160]  and are ready to be used when you finally reached that breaking point
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:06.240]  well there's no doubt that it's brainwashing todd in texas than john
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:09.360]  erin derrick ralph todd thanks for holding her on the air with mike revero
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:13.440]  go ahead hi good afternoon i'm not going to be a good segue from mike into a
[2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:15.680]  webster topley i want to discuss it's the public
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:19.120]  confrontation uh... we had a visit from the white house
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:22.560]  uh... council on environmental quality he's also the assistant director of
[2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:24.400]  international affairs on climate change
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:27.680]  his name is landed van dyke and he came to visit uh... and i'm here in corpus
[2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:32.080]  and um... he i got a chance to ask him about uh... john holdren
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:36.320]  and he said oh yeah john you know great guy and i read him a quote about
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:38.880]  the forced abortions of things like that in ecoscience
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:42.880]  and i read the quote and uh... it was it was a dramatic moment and uh...
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:46.160]  i ended it by saying if you do not believe me you know this ecoscience
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:49.920]  book is located here on this campus in the library to check out for yourself
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:52.800]  and he basically danced around it and said that um you know there are certain
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:56.080]  people who are in government he admitted that have certain programs we have to
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:58.640]  make sure that they don't get empowered to realize those programs and i said
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:02.560]  but one thing the problem here is that they're already in power
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  absolutely uh... wow do you have video of that i'd love to put a clip of that
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:09.600]  in the film okay uh... yes one of our one of our
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:14.000]  local group members of our uh... listen anything on eugenics the film's done in
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.880]  the next month i need footage like that
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:20.240]  our p o boxes on the site to send the tape and a letter that i can use it it'll
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:24.000]  be in the film god bless you sir great points glad you called tot
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:28.080]  yeah i haven't asked you about this what do you think of ecoscience and
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.080]  then wanting to terraform the planet and take everybody's children at birth and
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:34.800]  sterilize the population and drug the water
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:38.000]  uh... i have to tell you mike i've read most of the book now a lot of this has
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.320]  already been implemented covertly
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:45.120]  well that's uh... it's a continuation of the eugenics movement from the 1930s
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:48.000]  here in the united states and you know people justly criticized
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:51.360]  adolf hitler for a lot of the race hygiene policies they pursued in
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:55.520]  nazi germany but they don't remember that he got most of his
[2:57:55.520 --> 2:57:58.960]  inspiration from work that was being done here in the united states and there
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:01.760]  were forced abortions there was forced sterilization
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:06.400]  of so-called undesirable genes with undesirable simply being criminal
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:08.960]  activity or prostitution or anything like this
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:13.840]  and again it is a group of people or an individual who decides that they have
[2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:17.200]  the right to control other people's lives and reproductive behavior
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:20.160]  it's another excuse for tyranny and dictatorship

[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:46.080]  they can have calm hall meetings everywhere but they will be shut down
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:50.160]  when they when they were at reserve they got shut down when they had a press
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:53.120]  conference we protested in front of it
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:58.560]  these people will fall yeah we're we're seeing videos and calls from everywhere
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:00.400]  that everywhere government goes now they're being
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:04.640]  shouted down and confronted and people are uploading the video to youtube so it
[3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:08.720]  becomes real and cyberspace and other people realize everybody else is
[3:01:08.720 --> 3:01:12.480]  angry like them mike isn't that the final illusion to fall
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:15.680]  we all don't believe in the government the corrupt system but we feel like
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:19.280]  we're alone that final illusion that we're the minority
[3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:23.520]  is now dropping yeah absolutely you are correct i mean the government has held
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.000]  on to power by trying by selling this lie that anybody who doesn't believe in
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:32.160]  the government is mentally ill they're a loner they're a loser they smell bad
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:34.960]  enclosed rooms that you should stay away from them
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:38.400]  and now as we're seeing from these videos distrust of the government
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:42.320]  resentment of the government hate of the government is now the majority opinion
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:46.160]  in the united states of america will take the dhs report saying protesting the
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:49.440]  fat is terror that was an attempt at a chilling effect
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:53.200]  to scare us to shut up they can't get all of us
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:56.480]  well it didn't work because it just angered people even more
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:00.000]  like i said the fastest way to end a dictatorship is to get them to act like
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.560]  one where everybody could see it and that's what's happening
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.240]  right now absolutely great job john keep it up in
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:11.760]  Louisiana erin in california you're on the air right now go ahead
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:16.320]  hey alex is good to talk to you um to continue the eugenics talk here
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:19.520]  want to bring up the transhumanist movement
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:24.320]  and how that ties directly to julian hoxley uh the head of unesco started
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:27.040]  that in the 50s saying eugenics had been exposed
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:31.760]  they had to change the name to transhumanism and bioethics
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:36.320]  exactly and i actually made a film on this called the age of transitions which
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:40.240]  is google video now that if people want to watch it
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:44.240]  good yeah yeah i think i may have seen that was that
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:49.600]  out a few months ago that's been out for quite a few months now i made it in
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:53.440]  2008 it's not 2009 and i continue to cover this
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:59.040]  issue and i'm i'm more material too specifically about transhumanism and
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:01.680]  well you know i'm so proud of i'm gonna put you on hold later go back to you
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:07.440]  want to hold for tarpoli but mike it's that listeners and i'm not bragging
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:12.000]  this is what's actually scary exciting every time it seems
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:15.520]  some famous video comes out or somebody confronts a politician or
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:20.240]  some big activist news comes out we later find out probably 90 of the time
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  it's our audience my audience of millions isn't just millions
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:29.200]  they're all activist so is your audience i mean that has really got a scare of
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:33.840]  the system yes absolutely and uh people everywhere
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:37.040]  they're they're they're not willing to stay silent anymore they're not willing
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:40.560]  to go along anymore they're realizing that we've come down to the wire we're
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:43.760]  either going to do something about the future of our nation
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:47.920]  or it's going to be dictated to us people are very angry they understand
[3:03:47.920 --> 3:03:51.760]  i think in a way this last election was kind of the final straw
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:55.040]  because we all went we worked through the system we voted for the canada
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:59.040]  and we still got screwed and i think that's the reason americans are saying
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:03.040]  okay the system really is broken we cannot affect change
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:06.640]  going through the rules they say that we should follow and a couple weeks after
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:10.160]  obama was elected biden with a bunch of big wigg democrats
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:14.720]  on the west coast in oregon says look everybody's gonna hate us six months
[3:04:14.720 --> 3:04:18.480]  into office we gotta ram everything through we need you big wigs to stay
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:20.720]  with us don't worry you'll get all your campaign
[3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:26.560]  goodies so they cold bloodedly know all obama was was a
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:33.120]  stumbling block to block people while the elite stole some more goods
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:36.880]  that's absolutely true you're absolutely correct about that man i tell you it's

[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:27.600]  because it's clear as government collapses as confidence collapses in the
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:31.520]  offshore banks robbing us as people figure out both parties are controlled
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:37.120]  by offshore interest the the uh kleptocracy the offshore plutocrats
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:42.240]  the polycentric bankers uh as as webster tarpoli calls them the elite are
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:48.400]  going to try to stage some crises flu outbreak hysteria
[3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:53.440]  martial law announcements it's not going to work we're covering that tomorrow
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:57.760]  webster also has some breaking news on what's happening in saudi arabia
[3:08:57.760 --> 3:09:00.880]  and you know if you've ever seen the movie starship troopers
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:04.960]  webster tarpoli is kind of like our brain bug
[3:09:04.960 --> 3:09:09.520]  i'm just teasing tarpoli no i mean he's just such a smart guy has so many great
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:13.120]  so many great answers uh to so many things we're gonna be talking to webster
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:16.480]  here in just one moment but i want to go to
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:20.000]  uh ted anderson first for about two minutes quickly
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:23.760]  because gold is up another eight plus dollars
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:28.240]  today eight dollars in change ted is at the very end and when this is gone it's
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:32.960]  gone but he happened to buy when it dipped of gold at the nine ten nine
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:36.400]  eleven level he bought silver when it was over a dollar
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:40.160]  under what it is now and he's passing those savings on to you the brokers are
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:43.840]  there right now get out of gold i mean get out of the dollar
[3:09:43.840 --> 3:09:47.680]  get out of all these things get into gold get into silver ladies and gentlemen
[3:09:47.680 --> 3:09:52.160]  the chinese are starting to get out of the treasury notes
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:55.600]  i believe in getting into gold and into silver and
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.560]  getting out of these other paper currencies that is what i believe in
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:04.400]  and you cannot beat these deals that we're looking at and
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:08.240]  uh ted how important is it that we see the chinese last week and this week
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:11.280]  uh not buying us treasuries when they were dumped on the market
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:15.360]  well alex we all know that the long-term trend here is that the chinese and not
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:18.720]  everybody else in the world is going to get away from the us treasuries
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:21.920]  because the united states dollar is no longer going to be traded
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:26.240]  as the world reserve currency and since that's happening and since every
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:29.280]  nation in the world has pretty much looked at doing something
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:32.720]  different the us treasuries are going to get sold and the value of the dollar is
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:36.240]  going to go down that means that all this money that they're sitting on
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.000]  is coming back home here and competing with the money that we've earned
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:44.400]  and again another assault on the value of the us dollar that's all that it is
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:48.000]  and you're right gold is up eight bucks today i'm still holding the prices at
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:51.520]  the same level when gold was at nine eleven which that puts the british
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.440]  sovereign at two sixty six it puts the frank at two sixteen
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:58.880]  and for those of you who listened to the show yesterday or even last week
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:02.480]  you know that that's the price that it was back down there at that nine thirteen
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:06.640]  level i don't know how i can make it easy for easier for you to buy gold
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:09.760]  same thing with the silver now the Lakota's have gone up a bit
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:13.120]  and they're at nineteen seventy four but i'm still sitting here with these
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:17.600]  walking liberties at eight sixty nine that is exactly the same price when silver
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:21.600]  was down there at that eleven dollar and fifty eight cent or whatever it was
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:24.800]  back when it hit that bottom i just can't remember exactly where
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.880]  so obviously was over now on the fourteen dollar level closer to close to fifteen
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:32.480]  bucks an ounce fourteen seventy nine for a high today
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:36.160]  that's a wonderful buy-in i can't i can't urge you enough
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:38.960]  to take a look at gold and silver the long-term trend
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:42.000]  is that the dollar is going to be losing value
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.520]  and and things with uh... you know commodities of real value like gold and
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:49.680]  silver will go up
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:55.600]  uh... ted again about to go to webster tarply kind of our omnibudsman of research
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:12:00.400]  uh... but again this really is a smoking awesome deal if i had money right now
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:04.320]  i would be buying gold i am going to buy some silver of those walking liberties
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:07.600]  uh... how long till you run out of those well i've
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:11.120]  you know i'm looking at a supply of about fifty bags which is a thousand
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:16.240]  dollars face value per bag which comes to a but it comes to uh...
[3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:20.160]  a hundred thousand coins it really depends upon how many people are buying
[3:12:20.160 --> 3:12:22.480]  them the supply is depleting
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:26.080]  if it gets to be anything like it was back when silver hit twenty dollars
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:29.440]  ounce i won't even have them to sell to you at any price
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:33.360]  that's what happened just a couple years ago so obviously
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:36.720]  right now is a good time to be getting in well not a couple years ago that was
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:38.960]  last year you couldn't get gold or silver
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:42.080]  a lot of people are still really low and they rip people off you've got great
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:44.320]  deals here's the toll free number
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:48.080]  i believe in golden silver i believe that we need to
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:51.680]  get move away from the dollar away from paper away from derivatives
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:12:54.880]  it is so important the elite are pumping their tens of trillions
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:12:57.680]  they've stolen from us with the bailout back into the market
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:13:00.640]  that is institutional buyers that's big money buyers
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:04.160]  this is a suckers rally the real economy is imploding
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:08.400]  you need to get into golden silver one eight hundred six eight six two two
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:12.400]  three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:15.680]  the brokers are there right now you cannot beat this deal anywhere
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:19.680]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven thank you ted anderson
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:22.720]  yeah thanks for having me up alex you bet
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.640]  ted anderson is the brain bug of the gold bug industry
[3:13:26.640 --> 3:13:30.640]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:34.000]  now let me just before we get into saudi arabia and then eugenics because
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.240]  that's the main reason i have webster here in the limited time
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:41.840]  i want to ask webster separately we're hearing a lot of propaganda about the
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:45.440]  economy you're an economist author historian
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:48.720]  has really proven that you're a great political uh
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:51.760]  and economic mind out there i really respect you and i don't say that for
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:55.280]  many guests folks know i'm really signaling somebody out that i really
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:58.400]  have come to admire even more than a few years ago with his
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:02.720]  foresight and research but they're saying green shoots everything's
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:06.320]  wonderful the economy's great meanwhile jobless
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:11.680]  soaring home sales plunging uh every major indicator falling apart even
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:14.480]  they're cooked books the chinese and others aren't
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:17.840]  buying us treasuries they're slowing down their purchase
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:22.560]  the globalist are monetizing debt is this another suckers rally like two
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:25.920]  years ago telling us everything's wonderful
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.600]  and are they so panicked they're moving into saying everything's fine now
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:32.800]  because they've over fear mongered and they believe they've lost control
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:38.480]  or is everything really peachy king or are we getting a window into the truth
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:41.760]  with the wall street journal and cnbc reporting
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:46.080]  geithner screaming cussing fights panicking behind the scenes
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:52.080]  as he bull whips uh the fed chairman and others into following his policies
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:56.880]  what is really going on webster tarfley well uh it it fits right into what
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:00.640]  uh what ted anderson was saying the the main danger now is
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:05.200]  hyperinflation and we may be in the early phases of hyperinflation i'm not
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:09.280]  quite prepared to say that this is it but the straws in the wind
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:12.640]  are multiplying now hyperinflation would mean
[3:15:12.640 --> 3:15:19.920]  that you get up to the dow 15 000 and 20 000 and indeed dow 35 000 why not
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:25.760]  except those dollars are going to be uh converging on worthless um and if you
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:28.640]  look at the hyperinflation picture they've the basic
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:32.480]  underlying dynamic is you've got this huge dollar overhang
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:36.720]  four to five trillion dollars are out there as euro dollars
[3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:40.640]  chinese owned dollars or treasury securities this is
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:45.680]  basically the same thing same for japan russia european union saudi arabia
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:49.600]  that'll get to in a minute um all of these countries have huge amounts of
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:52.720]  dollars the situation is extremely unstable
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:57.600]  any kind of uh military event a military defeat for the u.s something
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:16:03.040]  shocking ununpredicted um it used to be back in there you know in the day that
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:06.080]  the president had a health problem that could also
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:09.520]  have a tremendous effect on on these markets and could again
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:14.240]  today if if it turns out that obama is obama's plunging
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:18.160]  approval rating making the stock market go up no i don't i think this is what
[3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:21.440]  this is this is uh this is separate in other words what what you've got is the
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:24.480]  the of what it what obama has done or presided over
[3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:29.040]  is the 24 trillion being pumped in now that's a credit line it doesn't mean
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:32.880]  it's all out there but it's all in in in danger of coming out
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:38.320]  so 24 trillion for wall street maybe 3300 billion for the average person for
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:41.840]  infrastructure so now we've got the bankers defeating the people under
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:46.480]  obama by 80 80 to one but at the same time
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:50.640]  real production is collapsing you look at u.s industrial production it continues
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:55.200]  to fall uh world trade is down 40 percent from where it was
[3:16:55.200 --> 3:16:58.800]  around the middle of last year so this means now that you've got fewer and
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:02.720]  fewer goods fewer and fewer commodities being chased by this huge
[3:17:02.720 --> 3:17:06.480]  tidal wave of money now that's gone into the stock market look the stock
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:10.560]  market has gone way up the s&p went over a thousand yesterday
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:14.320]  the nav deck is over 2000 but at the same time the
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:19.360]  the hyperinflation indicators look bad right the the dollar is now 144 against
[3:17:19.360 --> 3:17:22.240]  the euro the dollar has had some really bad days
[3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:26.560]  on the euro as ted was saying uh treasuries had a very bad day yesterday
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:29.440]  so it means the prices of falling on these
[3:17:29.440 --> 3:17:32.000]  treasuries meaning the interest rates are going up
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:35.520]  you got oil at 71 gold up eight as he says
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:38.320]  commodities generally beginning to pick up so
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:43.440]  this could very well be the early phase of a hyperinflationary bubble so
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:46.000]  okay well why are they fighting because
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:50.080]  geithner reportedly screaming at them cussing saying you've got to get behind
[3:17:50.080 --> 3:17:54.080]  me in the president's policies and then they're saying look out for inflation
[3:17:54.080 --> 3:17:57.200]  so is that what the internal fight is over or
[3:17:57.200 --> 3:18:01.120]  what's your intel on that well i think this is just it's just a quarrel among
[3:18:01.120 --> 3:18:04.720]  thieves in other words they're all kinds of frictions there there there is the
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:08.640]  question the regulatory role of the federal reserve believe it or not
[3:18:08.640 --> 3:18:13.440]  where Bernanke does not want to do certain things that geithner wants him
[3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:18.640]  to do uh the egos get involved i i don't think this is a huge
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:22.480]  matter but the the federal reserve has actually come under heavy attack for the
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:26.160]  strong alarming of bank of america on the um
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:29.600]  an absorption of merrill lynch and a few other issues so
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:33.840]  there's a lot of bad blood against the fed in in congress on
[3:18:33.840 --> 3:18:37.680]  these sort of secondary issues of course that can then be parvaded into the
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:41.920]  nationalization of the fed which is what i would i would recommend so you've
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:47.280]  also got to remember that geithner is is an unstable little fuck right he's uh
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:51.680]  he's a foul mouth character right he's the wall street journal the wall street
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:55.840]  journal and the street are reporting that was all these top regulators sec
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:00.560]  chairman ben Bernanke and that he was screaming and yelling almost like
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:04.720]  hitler just going completely wild frothing
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:08.560]  uh and it said that this uh you know seemed to
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:13.360]  shake up a bit uh a Bernanke the former boss of geithner
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:17.120]  so this this looks like all is not well in camelot
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:21.680]  as this air of invincibility this mount olympus godlikeness
[3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:25.840]  of these bankers uh evaporates i think they're feeling the heat
[3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:29.280]  with the in the fed movement or the or the audit the fed movement
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:32.480]  well i i think they've also got a they've got very severe international
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:35.360]  problems in other words geithner had to spend the first part of the week
[3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:39.920]  toutowing to the chinese who are his bosses so he had to lick the boots
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:43.200]  of the visiting uh the visiting delegation from beijing
[3:19:43.200 --> 3:19:47.120]  and assure them that he was responsible after all but let's get to saudi arabi
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:50.160]  because it may be saudi arabia that's getting him to do this
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:54.000]  all right well let's cover that in the next short segment in the last 30 minutes
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:58.400]  you've now gotten the book you've scanned over it uh the ugenesis
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:04.720]  master plans stay with us hi this is john swenson again at mitis resources
[3:20:04.720 --> 3:20:08.400]  and let me ask just one question what would you list as the things that the

[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:16.560]  doctor tarfly phd in history we should have him on
[3:24:16.560 --> 3:24:20.080]  in a few weeks for a whole hour or two hours just on venetian history
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:24.480]  how it came out of the eastern roman empire uh from the splitting of the
[3:24:24.480 --> 3:24:28.240]  empire the eastern empire because from my primitive understanding of it
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:33.200]  so much of the new world order management system comes out of that venetian
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:35.840]  school and i was asking dr tarfly during the break he said
[3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:39.200]  that was true in a general sense so we'll have him on about that because knowing
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:42.320]  history if you don't know history it's like you were born yesterday
[3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:45.440]  i was told howard zinn said that okay well i'm sure quickly in the short
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:48.480]  segment because you're here about eugenics today
[3:24:48.480 --> 3:24:51.680]  okay so that's the main reason you've gotten this book you've researched it
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:55.920]  eco science but but you've got big breaking news in saudi arabia tell us
[3:24:55.920 --> 3:24:59.760]  if you wanted a lot why would geithner freak out now here's the story
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:03.280]  yesterday there were straws in the wind there were reports from
[3:25:03.280 --> 3:25:07.920]  from uh... somewhat obscure publications in in uh... pakistan
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:11.840]  and in iran i was actually press tv so that was the iranian
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:14.880]  uh... government and then a uh... an arab
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:19.520]  uh... website which has the british connections and they're saying that
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:23.600]  prince bandar of saudi arabia people remember him that's
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.520]  bandar bush he was the u in the ambassador of saudi arabia to the
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:32.240]  united states for about ten years he had since gone back to saudi arabia and
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:34.880]  become the head of the national security council
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:38.560]  that he has he's allegedly under house arrest
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:42.240]  for having a coup d'etat for somehow attempting to interfere
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:45.920]  in the succession uh... bondar is the son
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:49.200]  of the crown prince in other words the person who should succeed
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:52.800]  to the throne of saudi arabia when the current king is no longer there
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:56.800]  would be bondar's father so that would put him in an important position now
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:25:59.680]  on the surface and this is what i originally thought
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:04.800]  you'd say well bondar bush right that's a cia mi6 asset so it looks like there
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:08.560]  was an attempted coup d'etat by the u s in the british
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:11.680]  in saudi arabia right you could you could expect something like that once
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:14.800]  they were trying to overthrow the government of iran
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:18.480]  but there's a whole other dimension to this which has been brought to my
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:22.560]  attention by a very good friend uh... which is
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:27.600]  that bondar may have gone pro-russian that bondar
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:31.520]  had been signing deals meeting with putin setting up
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:35.280]  military cooperation between saudi arabia
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:40.080]  and russia that he was uh... they had a joint treaty to suppress
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:44.080]  drug trafficking and if you look at the website of the jamestown foundation
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:46.960]  they speculate that there's some move afoot
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:50.880]  featuring bondar to essentially reverse the alliances
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:55.200]  that saudi arabia has had since well since since roosevelt went through
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:26:59.040]  there right after yalta right back in in 1945
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:03.200]  to break out of the anglo-american sphere and go with the russians now it
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:06.720]  would make a lot of sense the saudi arabian royal family
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:10.480]  are people who want to survive they know that their situation is bad
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:14.560]  they can see what obama means for them obama means color revolution
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:18.240]  the question of when are you going to get the color revolution and the coup
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:21.760]  and the velvet revolution inside saudi arabia is really only
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.680]  a question of time especially with with our tarpley tarpley
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:30.000]  i was unaware of this so give me a headline so i can pull it up
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:33.600]  and talk to me like i'm five years old i have sent uh... i have sent some of
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:36.880]  that stuff to uh... to aran's email there
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:40.000]  so maybe you can take a look at that it was one of the first person that i
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:43.040]  sent it to okay well what's the headline on it and then and then we'll pull it
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:47.360]  up uh... just to bondar saudi coup fails
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:53.040]  it's up on our saudi coup coup fails yeah what does this mean i mean in simple
[3:27:53.040 --> 3:27:56.240]  terms it means that the west trying to overthrow
[3:27:56.240 --> 3:28:00.240]  uh... the supposed ally of the kingdom of sod it makes a lot of sense in the
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:02.880]  woods if you're looking at the u.s. and the british the average
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:06.240]  the average observer of the of the caliber of somebody like ponder would
[3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:09.360]  say well these people have been my friends but
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:14.160]  they're doomed they're going down under obama we're going to have hyperinflation
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:17.600]  these dollars are going to be worth nothing and they may say
[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:21.280]  the the only way for the saudi royal family who are not a very pretty bunch
[3:28:21.280 --> 3:28:25.360]  of people of course we have the headline in kingdom saudi princess coup fails
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:28.960]  right thank you webster so so this would this would be
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:32.960]  uh... an attempt by the saudi royal family to save themselves
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:36.000]  from the general shipwreck of the u.s. and the british
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:39.440]  by going with with russia and i believe you can say this is a
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:43.360]  probably the the new researcher of our time is put in
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:46.240]  and if they put put in is actually doing this
[3:28:46.240 --> 3:28:49.840]  this could be a a master stroke is put in consider them look
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:53.600]  i can give you a better deal on the middle east and above all i'm not going
[3:28:53.600 --> 3:28:56.400]  to overthrow you the way the u.s. and the british
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:28:59.760]  uh... you know generally try to do my gosh if you're saying there's a major
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:03.520]  realignment with saudi arabia going with russia it's possible
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:06.960]  that completely reshuffles the deck and on a geopolitical
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:10.960]  scale that changes the entire makeup of the geopolitical web
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:14.720]  it would it would basically be the beginning of the end of the anglo-american
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:17.680]  empire and then just from the point of view of oil
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:22.560]  uh... from oil and then indeed the dot what the saudi's do that they were made
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:29.360]  they were forged uh... in in mordor you know there by the british i mean uh...
[3:29:29.360 --> 3:29:32.240]  well you know they go back to the british so they said well the british
[3:29:32.240 --> 3:29:36.080]  come through the americans come through and now maybe it's time for them to
[3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:38.480]  leave so i'm not a hundred percent sure but
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:42.080]  this is something to really watch because it's huge
[3:29:42.080 --> 3:29:46.000]  wow okay eugenics straight ahead with webster griffin tarbley

[3:33:20.960 --> 3:33:25.600]  ecoscience population resources environment i've now scanned through
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:28.960]  most 1100 pages you went to the library
[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:33.040]  you got a hard copy as well for the first two weeks i was researching and i was
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:36.800]  reading an online pdf there's even more in the actual book
[3:33:36.800 --> 3:33:40.320]  forced sterilization of the population cps taking
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:44.560]  all children at birth by the end of it raising them in dormitories
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:47.840]  kind of the eugenics view they implemented in china under
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:52.480]  treaties under state apartment random 200
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:56.400]  forced drugging of the population in the water sterilizing the majority of the
[3:33:56.400 --> 3:34:00.640]  population deciding who can breed
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:04.480]  total control through an environmental eugenical
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:09.200]  tyranny now i've read state department of randoms in the population commission
[3:34:09.200 --> 3:34:12.080]  from the british and i've read the in 1996
[3:34:12.080 --> 3:34:16.240]  united nations biological diversity assessment everything in this book
[3:34:16.240 --> 3:34:20.480]  is in all those documents and pieces club of room documents you know
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:27.040]  in game covers a lot of that but this is a compendium or a rosetta stone of evil
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:30.800]  you've had a chance to go over it now since last week i dispatched a crew there
[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:35.680]  to interview you again to integrate that into the new obama film
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:39.360]  you of course are the centerpiece of the obama deception one of the main voices
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:42.160]  you are also out of the 18 people we've interviewed
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:45.760]  one of them the main players are quarterback we can say i'm quarterbacking
[3:34:45.760 --> 3:34:46.960]  but you're kind of a
[3:34:46.960 --> 3:34:50.720]  oh what's another important person you give the ball to here the wing back
[3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:53.360]  i'm sure or or a running back or something the point is
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:57.440]  you're doing a great job you're doing a great job in the obama
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:35:01.360]  deception but but break this down because
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:05.680]  were you a shock by this blasphemous document as i was and
[3:35:05.680 --> 3:35:09.840]  what's your view because to me they've implemented much of what's in this book
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:13.680]  written by the white house science are how much time do we have on this alec
[3:35:13.680 --> 3:35:17.200]  we have t-minus 25 minutes okay wonderful
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:22.000]  well i first of all i wasn't shocked i had met some of these people
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:25.520]  at the united nations food conference in roam
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:33.120]  in november of 1974 so that means uh 35 years ago this year and for actually
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:37.120]  just arguing with these people and putting out a few leaflets
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:41.120]  i was officially thrown out of the united nations
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:44.320]  food conference for disrupting it even though the only thing i wanted to do
[3:35:44.320 --> 3:35:47.680]  was to point out that these people were charlatan so this is
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:53.920]  this is the world of paul erlich rene du mont barbara ward rachel carcin
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:59.280]  it's sort of the 70s to 80s generation of environmentalist fanatics
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:04.320]  absolute cooks uh and and genocidalist because that's what they are
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:08.880]  and they are as they call themselves neo-malthusian they go with parson
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:14.320]  malphos who made this idiotic claim that population grows faster than food
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:19.680]  that's not what you see and even before uh before malphos died he had to take it
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:22.800]  back that he was he had been completely wrong so
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:27.440]  this the book that i've got is about a it's almost 1,100 pages
[3:36:27.440 --> 3:36:32.320]  it's a compendium of all the lunacy that they had put together i've got the
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:36.320]  edition from 1977 which i believe is the third edition
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:40.960]  so it's written by paul erlich and erlich and john p holdren so yes that's the one
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:44.560]  i have we have it right here on tv for people right now
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:50.240]  okay so paul erlich stanford university his wife and and then john p
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:54.960]  holdren let's get the holdren in this because john p holdren is the powerful
[3:36:54.960 --> 3:36:58.400]  official white house science and technology advisor
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:02.640]  special assistant to the president he presides over a big office in the new
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:05.920]  executive office building a little bit separate from the white house
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:09.920]  compound but uh he's over there he's the head of the white house
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:14.080]  science and technology office and indeed chairs the white house council
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:17.040]  on science at technology it's a very important
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:21.920]  position and the fact that we have to face is that a proponent of genocide
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:26.160]  now occupies this post he is an absolute malphusian
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:31.600]  fanatic of course he's a pessimist and i think you can call him a totalitarian
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:36.960]  liberal uh this is usually applied to canes but it's i call him a
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:42.000]  piranha like control freak i mean no no i mean i mean a psychopath
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:46.240]  a psychopathic sadist obsessive compulsive anal retinet
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:52.080]  a retentive nut job uh with delusions of grandeur now acting upon them well
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:55.440]  yes i think i think he qualifies for all that now let me just just give you his
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:58.000]  worldview when we get to the some of the specific stuff
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:02.640]  he starts with his paul erlich now erlich had written the population bomb
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:06.800]  in 1968 saying the world is going to be destroyed because there were too many
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:10.480]  people now we know the oligarchy has been arguing that the
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.040]  world is overpopulated since about a thousand bc that we know of
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:18.960]  remember they say that the reason for the trojan war
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:23.040]  was that there were too many people too many humans pressing down on the breast
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:26.480]  of mother earth so therefore you had to have 10 years of war which
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:30.080]  which killed everybody off it is the eternal
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:34.160]  point of view of the oligarchy and especially of this finance oligarchy
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:38.320]  that we have today so uh it's also worth noting that erlich
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:42.160]  is a total crackpot and charlotte and he says there's a population bomb
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:44.960]  well what do you see today right 40 years later
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:49.760]  the the population in europe is falling the population in japan is falling
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:54.000]  population in russia is falling population in the us would be falling if it
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:57.760]  were for immigration and then you look at the other he said there'd be 12
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:00.400]  billion right now we'd all be starving to death
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:04.960]  instead it's 6.8 billion and the population is now
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:10.800]  planing uh it's level off and the west is dying the west is dying the west is
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:15.600]  is precisely dying dying of pessimism dying from cultural pessimism dying of
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:20.480]  these people running things a a a lack of the human spirit a lack of
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:24.640]  creativity a lack of life force these people
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:27.920]  to test everything good and wholesome that the species is
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:32.640]  yeah and they're nihilistic criminals go ahead in in this book
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:36.640]  this is expressed by holdren and and when i say holdren now i mean erlich
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:40.960]  erlich and holdren holdren says we don't like this moonshot
[3:39:40.960 --> 3:39:45.440]  mentality that the american seem to have the american moonshot mentality for
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:49.680]  these lunatics is everything evil in other words
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:53.280]  it's the argument this is well if you can go to the moon
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.120]  you can solve these other problems and i think this is this is the essence of
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:01.040]  the scientific optimism the technological optimism
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:06.000]  the the can do production spirit that is that is uh animated the united states
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:09.280]  which these finance oligarchs hate so much so
[3:40:09.280 --> 3:40:13.440]  they they target the the moonshot mentality they don't like
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:18.000]  uh growthsmanship they call it they call the idea that you can produce your
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:21.760]  way out of a crisis they call cornucopianism that you believe in an
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:26.320]  internal cornucopia but let's get down to it the main thesis is
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:30.320]  that population overpopulation is the source of everything
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:34.240]  pollution comes from people right people pollute that's the argument
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:38.000]  by erlich in the population that's why they list carbon dioxide
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:41.200]  that we put off two and a half pounds of a day is deadly poison
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:45.120]  even though plants breathe it to make us bad club of rome admit
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:48.960]  i'm sure you've seen the document and written in 92 that they picked that
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:53.120]  to make it about us being bad to make us internalize we're bad
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:57.520]  so the state can direct a war against humanity
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:00.960]  well yes but but it's being done of course in the name of this finance
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:05.040]  here oligarchy right it's it's that they've taken over the the state through
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:07.840]  through these different look at Henry Paulson he's one of them in his own
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:11.920]  writing absolutely he's an environmental environmentalist activist
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:15.280]  that's a very very good point that guy is green as they come
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:18.320]  so you see you see that the the finance here in the green
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:22.880]  go together now and erlich therefore it completely discredited
[3:41:22.880 --> 3:41:26.160]  so all the problems come from population now
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:30.400]  uh sometimes when you do biography you look at the women
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:34.880]  the women in somebody's life are often the key to what they really think we
[3:41:34.880 --> 3:41:38.880]  see this with obama but in the case of john p holdren
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:44.160]  his wife Cheryl holdren uh is a researcher in her own right
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:47.840]  and we i have another book by holdren edited by holdren and erlich which is
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:50.800]  called the kassandra conference it's from the uh
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:56.160]  the end of the reagan era about 1988 in the kassandra conference conference
[3:41:56.160 --> 3:42:00.240]  which is a it's like a symposium and they put together articles
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:05.040]  Cheryl holdren has an essay where she praises to the skies
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:09.360]  Rachel Carson all right Rachel Carson silent spring
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:15.600]  1962 this is the idea that dbt is going to kill all the animal life and plant
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:18.080]  life the birds and the insects of the world
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:22.160]  and therefore dbt has to be banned if you wanted to say
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:27.440]  the biggest genocidalist action of the past 30 to 40 years it's probably
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:31.840]  banning dbt because this has led to tens of millions and
[3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:36.720]  very likely hundreds of millions of deaths in sub-saharan africa and i've
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:40.000]  seen the reports webster but but i mean webster you're most up on this i don't
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:43.280]  have them in front of me is it true because i've seen some of the scientific
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:48.400]  reports that that was a hoax and dbt wasn't hurting the animals
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:51.760]  i think i think it's it's it's i don't i it's certainly
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:56.400]  a wild exaggeration of what these dangers might be and then again
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:01.520]  you also got it you know what's your value system and the advocacy of genocide
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:05.680]  is a nuremberg crime even if you say well this is being done in the name of the
[3:43:05.680 --> 3:43:09.200]  sparrows and the hummingbirds and the spotted owls and that's killed hundreds
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:13.040]  of millions because it's i mean they admit it kills 15 million a year
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:18.080]  from malaria because they've stopped using dbt and that's over now 30 30 to
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:21.760]  40 years i think it's actually the the heyday of this stuff was in the early
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:25.760]  70s so the other thing of course is that uh
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:30.480]  this character holdren believes that the world is overpopulated how much
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:34.720]  overpopulated now it's a textbook so he's citing different people but you can
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:38.960]  see pretty much what he agrees with he and the co-authors say
[3:43:38.960 --> 3:43:42.960]  the optimum population of the world is one billion
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:47.280]  well uh in 1977 the population of the world was
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:51.680]  four billion so that meant that there were already three billion
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:55.680]  excess useless eaters people that had to be called
[3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:00.240]  somehow at the time that holdren was writing so he wants a 75 percent reduction
[3:44:00.240 --> 3:44:04.240]  at that time now more recently we've had this this co-thinker somebody who's
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:07.760]  part of the same clique he he's mentioned in the textbook he
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:11.440]  he writes in these anthologies that are edited by holdren and they're like
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:16.640]  david pimentel i think of cornell has said that the optimum population might
[3:44:16.640 --> 3:44:20.480]  go as high as two billion well that means today we've still got
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:25.600]  four billion useless eaters now you put that together with cap and trade right
[3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:29.360]  cap and trade would at least double maybe triple quadruple
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:34.080]  the export price of u.s. grain to the developing and they brag and rub their
[3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:37.280]  hands together in publications saying this is going to wipe people out i mean
[3:44:37.280 --> 3:44:40.960]  these are you know somebody to not see uniform people would run from but as
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:43.840]  long as it's a liberal and berkin stocks going uh
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:48.640]  people like oh kill me it's so liberal and these people are actually operating
[3:44:48.640 --> 3:44:51.440]  on a smaller scale because you know hitler is a
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:55.360]  this is a genocide on a continental base whereas what what these people are
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:58.960]  contemplating is indeed a worldwide genocide with the numbers as we
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:03.360]  can see are are much larger um so four billion
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:05.760]  excessive and if you if you go to cap and trade
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:09.440]  you've got about one billion people who are living on the verge of starvation
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:13.200]  right now you could wipe out you know a large part of that billion or maybe
[3:45:13.200 --> 3:45:18.720]  even all of it uh holdren writes that when it comes to food aid
[3:45:18.720 --> 3:45:22.080]  you've got to use triage in other words you've got to separate
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:26.080]  the countries that will make it without food aid the countries that are doomed
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:29.440]  and should get nothing and then the ones in the middle that you might be able to
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:32.000]  help with the ones that you focus on sort of military
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:36.320]  or disaster triage and that's the rationale you just write off
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:40.080]  a third of the people and say we're going to kill them as if it's loving
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:43.200]  because it's the same argument of don't have two kids
[3:45:43.200 --> 3:45:48.160]  have one and give them twice the attention well yes although what they
[3:45:48.160 --> 3:45:51.760]  be what he wants to do is he uses that in here about only having one kid to go
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:56.400]  ahead yes he does absolutely wants to wants to limit family size with
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:02.720]  totalitarian rules he says bangladesh now bangladesh is at least 200 million
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:06.320]  uh or it's a it's a large population a hundred million perhaps
[3:46:06.320 --> 3:46:10.800]  bangladesh he says is a country that should be triaged in the words bangladesh
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:14.640]  go and die uh we've got to call this to the attention of the bangladesh
[3:46:14.640 --> 3:46:20.080]  ambassador he also says india india which is at that point seven or eight
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:23.120]  hundred million and now uh a billion and more
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:26.480]  that india may be a candidate for triage
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:33.200]  under this planetary system so who who enforces this he says it's time to create
[3:46:33.200 --> 3:46:37.840]  a planetary regime a planetary regime so
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:44.960]  a supernational world government run by ecological fanatics and malthusian
[3:46:44.960 --> 3:46:50.880]  genocidalist the planetary regime would take under its control the world
[3:46:50.880 --> 3:46:56.240]  ecosphere and in particular what he calls the global commons the global
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:46:59.760]  commons would mean the atmosphere the oceans
[3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:04.080]  and the soil so the planetary regime would
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:09.600]  override national sovereignty and impose the rules on the global commons
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:13.040]  and it would set an optimum world population
[3:47:13.040 --> 3:47:17.040]  so the optimum world population as we've heard is somewhere between one
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:20.160]  billion and two billion and that won't increase right that's
[3:47:20.160 --> 3:47:25.280]  that's unlikely to get very much higher so the the thrust of this entire thing
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:28.800]  is that world population growth must be stopped
[3:47:28.800 --> 3:47:33.200]  and in the middle of that we see the old imperialist program
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:38.640]  don't allow the industrial development and the technological advancement of the
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:42.240]  third world of the less developed countries the developing countries
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:46.160]  again sub-saharan africa south asia the poorer parts
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:49.840]  of latin america and webster this is in the 1949 royal commission by the
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:52.480]  british where they don't even say it's for the earth
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:55.760]  they say we're going to freeze development the third world that'll make
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:47:59.200]  their population explode but we'll just then exterminate those
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:03.360]  as they grow up if we really wanted to cut population growth we would develop
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:06.640]  them but we're not going to do that so even though they want to kill
[3:48:06.640 --> 3:48:11.200]  the brown people they still hate them so much they let that people bomb
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:14.400]  kind of keep them down at the level they're at instead of developing them
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:18.560]  and then they start dying like the west so it's it's almost a schizophrenic
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:21.680]  model with these people and you've got holdren
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:26.640]  and uh early george bush seniors buddy packaging this eugenics is loving and
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:29.840]  liberal these really are some sickening people
[3:48:29.840 --> 3:48:33.120]  again it's it's genocide these are high crimes against humanity
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:36.640]  nuremberg crimes uh one of the things that holding an
[3:48:36.640 --> 3:48:41.200]  alec are based on is the limits to growth another crackpot study totally
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:46.640]  discredited by meadows and forester 1972 i believe which says
[3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:50.560]  at the rate of depletion of natural resources world society will collapse
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:54.480]  in the early part of the current century more or less where we are now
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:57.760]  now it turns out that there are greater reserves
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:02.320]  of just about all forms of resource that they mentioned in sure sure so webster
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:05.120]  let me stop you up they finance the fake peak oil
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:09.200]  system believing my family's in petroleum as petroleum geologists and others
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:11.920]  it's all made up all lies but but the issue is
[3:49:11.920 --> 3:49:16.160]  they're actually manifesting their fraud with discovery channel history channel
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:19.520]  houston tv shows saying the oceans are going to melt
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:22.880]  we're all dead they say polar bears can't swim lying
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:26.880]  they show the ice caps getting smaller in the summer as they always do and say
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:30.560]  that that's new and they say that they're going to
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:34.960]  institute war famine and destruction as state department random 200 states
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:39.360]  they would and then tell us it's the global warming doing it
[3:49:39.360 --> 3:49:42.960]  and they say whenever there's a hurricane say it was this
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:46.160]  whenever there's a war say it was this so they're now
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:49.840]  even though they know it's a fraud they're lying and if somebody slips on a
[3:49:49.840 --> 3:49:53.840]  banana peel leaving their house they're saying global warming did it
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:58.400]  so so they're trying to push this delusional
[3:49:58.400 --> 3:50:02.160]  hallucination on the public cold-bloodily you know you say they're
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:06.480]  wrong webster they're not wrong they're murdering Nazi scammers
[3:50:06.480 --> 3:50:10.400]  that sell the pseudo science but i mean your argument is you think their
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:13.600]  science is wrong i know i think i think these are
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:17.840]  genocidalists who should be in the docket no but i'm well exactly but i'm
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:20.880]  saying i think we differ you're saying they're wrong
[3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:24.800]  that that their science is wrong and that they're also genocidalist i'm saying
[3:50:24.800 --> 3:50:28.880]  they're it's worse than that they're cold-blooded they know it's all crap
[3:50:28.880 --> 3:50:32.640]  webster they know carbon dioxide isn't bad
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:35.840]  yes certainly but i i think we i don't think there's any disagreement at all on
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:38.240]  this stuff good good well i mean i mean i respect
[3:50:38.240 --> 3:50:41.440]  well children should not be going to his job at the white house he should be

[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:23.360]  i noticed he hadn't gotten into some of the more disgusting areas you think
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:26.960]  world government exterminating us bad well it gets even worse
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:31.120]  children raised in hive communal areas just as mainstream british news is
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:34.240]  announcing cameras in 20 000 families homes
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:38.080]  cps taking their children this he'll be on next tuesday
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:42.000]  one o'clock central two p.m. tarpoli time in the east

[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:49.600]  this next tuesday all right webster you got four
[3:54:49.600 --> 3:54:54.000]  minutes ten seconds give us a preview of what's coming up in next week's
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:58.000]  descent into madness when we cover eco science i tell you what we'll do
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:01.920]  holdren has socioeconomic measures today this would be called
[3:55:01.920 --> 3:55:06.320]  behavioral economics to coerce you into having smaller families or better
[3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:09.120]  yet no family at all but let's get right to the
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:14.960]  involuntary the compulsory birth control measures proposed by holdren who is
[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:18.160]  now sitting in the obama whitehouse as the top
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:24.160]  science and technology advisor the most radical is compulsory abortion he says
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:28.560]  it's time to have a population law which imposes an upper limit on the
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:32.320]  population well what if what if your wife is pregnant well
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:36.720]  in that case compulsory abortion now you've got to think about what that
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:41.520]  means that requires a police state on the level of malice china
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:44.240]  well he says that he says a global police state
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:48.000]  just like peonka ut these these bastards are sick
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:53.520]  all right so compulsory abortion and then we have compulsory sterilization
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:56.720]  he praises programs that existed in india
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:02.560]  up until 1977 or so which made vasectomy in other words male
[3:56:02.560 --> 3:56:07.760]  sterilization was imposed if you were a government worker and you had more than
[3:56:07.760 --> 3:56:11.440]  two children you had a vasectomy or you were
[3:56:11.440 --> 3:56:14.960]  fired so compulsory vasectomy compulsory
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:18.640]  sterilization the other one is sterilization
[3:56:18.640 --> 3:56:23.280]  through adding substances chemicals to drinking water
[3:56:23.280 --> 3:56:28.160]  and to food so paul hogan says this is a very democratic and uh
[3:56:28.160 --> 3:56:31.840]  egalitarian way of doing it because everybody will be
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:35.520]  infected either if you buy mineral water maybe maybe not
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:39.600]  uh he also talks about uh implanting
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:45.200]  long-term sterilization devices sterilization capsules implants in
[3:56:45.200 --> 3:56:49.120]  women now this is this has actually been done in the past 20 years and they
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:52.320]  keep finding the ied's and the implants work longer
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:54.960]  they're supposed to are completely sterilize you
[3:56:54.960 --> 3:56:58.800]  and they can't be removed and and it's going to cost the poor that this is
[3:56:58.800 --> 3:57:01.520]  often done to to inner city populations black
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:04.160]  hispanic yeah white this is already being implemented
[3:57:04.160 --> 3:57:07.680]  so that's the that is but that was put into effect about 10 years after after
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:11.440]  holding wrote this book now he also wants to have baby licenses
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:15.760]  this is amazing a baby license is that every woman
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:20.080]  could be given a marketable tradable baby licensing
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:25.840]  you have the right to have 2.2 children and whatever part of this you don't use
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:29.760]  you can sell the problem with that is what happens if golden
[3:57:29.760 --> 3:57:34.080]  sacks comes in and decides to make a speculative bubble
[3:57:34.080 --> 3:57:37.760]  in the world of baby licenses because you know they do it you know
[3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:41.200]  yeah that's what they do it with cap and trade and they're going to do it with
[3:57:41.200 --> 3:57:45.600]  the baby license he's also got things he wants to impose
[3:57:45.600 --> 3:57:49.280]  very very high fees for marriage licenses
[3:57:49.280 --> 3:57:53.120]  meaning that's a regressive tax by the way that's the worst you can get that's
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:57.840]  like the poll tax under that show and remember the us funded china to do this
[3:57:57.840 --> 3:58:00.800]  a webster we're out of time next tuesday last one
[3:58:00.800 --> 3:58:06.560]  sees babies if it's a teenage unwet mother sees the baby forced adoption
