[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  It's the danger zone, and we're watching through the lies and disinformation.
[00:12.200 --> 00:18.120]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18.120 --> 00:19.620]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:19.620 --> 00:22.840]  All its business ties with Trump in the last hour, Brooke, and this is because there have
[00:22.840 --> 00:26.600]  been calls for days from Hispanic leaders saying, how can you be in business with this
[00:26.600 --> 00:30.320]  man if he is calling Mexican immigrants rapists and killers.
[00:30.320 --> 00:35.640]  Billionaire and presidential candidate Donald Trump has been lambasted by NBC and Univision
[00:35.640 --> 00:37.160]  for these comments.
[00:37.160 --> 00:45.560]  The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
[00:45.560 --> 00:49.960]  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
[00:49.960 --> 00:51.440]  They're not sending you.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.480]  They're not sending you.
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.560]  They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems
[00:58.560 --> 00:59.560]  with us.
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.800]  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume,
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.960]  are good people.
[01:06.960 --> 01:10.920]  But I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting.
[01:10.920 --> 01:13.100]  And it only makes common sense.
[01:13.100 --> 01:19.240]  It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably
[01:19.240 --> 01:21.240]  from the Middle East.
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.320]  But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence.
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.800]  We don't know what's happening, and it's got to stop, and it's got to stop fast.
[01:32.800 --> 01:40.400]  Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
[01:40.400 --> 01:43.000]  They become rich.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.640]  I'm in competition with them.
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.720]  They just built a hotel in Syria.
[01:47.720 --> 01:49.160]  Can you believe this?
[01:49.160 --> 01:51.340]  They built a hotel.
[01:51.340 --> 01:53.600]  When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.720]  They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that when we left Iraq, I said
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.600]  we should have taken.
[02:01.600 --> 02:04.680]  So now ISIS has the oil.
[02:04.680 --> 02:10.480]  Donald Trump is now second in the New Hampshire and Iowa polls among likely caucus goers,
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.800]  and is standing by his misrepresented comments on immigration, rape, and crime.
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.560]  And now with my statements on immigration, which happened to be correct, they are going
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.200]  to take a different stance, and that's okay.
[02:23.200 --> 02:26.400]  Misrepresented comments, which are unfortunately true.
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.200]  Thomas didn't find the man he was looking for, but something far worse.
[02:31.200 --> 02:38.040]  Thomas says he found 47-year-old Martin Vazquez in the act of raping a six-year-old girl.
[02:38.040 --> 02:43.240]  Officers say neighbors told them that several of the neighborhood children play in Vazquez's
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.240]  backyard.
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.320]  This woman for the Davidson County Sheriff's Office said, you said it was in this country
[02:48.320 --> 02:49.320]  illegally.
[02:49.320 --> 02:53.760]  Gourau Aguilar faces three counts of aggravated sexual battery of a person under the age of
[02:53.760 --> 02:54.760]  13.
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.000]  Jacobo Gourau faces one count of rape of a person under the age of 13.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.640]  Police believe 19-year-old Sergio Perez, an illegal immigrant, attacked the woman in her
[03:03.640 --> 03:04.880]  home Sunday.
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.680]  418 children were raped by illegals in the state of North Carolina in the month of August
[03:10.680 --> 03:12.620]  2014 alone.
[03:12.620 --> 03:17.280]  Another drug investigation led to a shootout that left a deputy wounded and a police informant
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.280]  dead.
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.400]  It all started with this big rig filled with marijuana.
[03:21.400 --> 03:22.880]  You mentioned the 18-wheeler.
[03:22.880 --> 03:28.800]  We had 300 pounds of marijuana or more, and obviously a homicide, all in front of an entrance
[03:28.800 --> 03:29.960]  to a quiet neighborhood.
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.920]  The Pinal County Sheriff asking President Obama to send troops.
[03:33.920 --> 03:38.840]  Sheriff Paul Babuse says Mexican drug cartels now control parts of Arizona all the way up
[03:38.840 --> 03:40.360]  to Metro Phoenix.
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.200]  Drug cartels control this area, and this is unacceptable, and the local law enforcement
[03:46.200 --> 03:49.840]  cannot handle and stop this on our own.
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.800]  This latest move details that not only does NBC reinstate known liars like Brian Williams,
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.520]  they are also in the big business of controlling the narrative, whether or not American lives
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.840]  are in grave danger.
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.040]  And it just goes to show how far Americans will be diverted from a hardcore reality in
[04:07.040 --> 04:13.000]  the name of supposed political correctness, and ensuciant generation will inherit a country
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.080]  on track to go down harder than Greece, where our immigration policies allow thousands of
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.000]  foreign felons to be released onto the streets of America, while an epidemic of child rape
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.400]  goes largely ignored in their own backyards.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.400]  You want answers?
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.400]  I think I'm entitled.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.400]  You want answers.
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.400]  I want the truth.
[04:31.400 --> 04:33.840]  You can't handle the truth.
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.000]  You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.120]  You want me on that wall.
[04:40.120 --> 04:42.520]  You need me on that wall.
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.080]  We use words like honor, code, loyalty.
[04:47.080 --> 04:50.880]  We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.560]  You use them as a punchline.
[04:52.560 --> 05:22.400]  John Bound for infowars.com.
[05:22.560 --> 05:28.720]  Don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at infowarslife.com.

[06:00.760 --> 06:20.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:20.960 --> 06:40.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[06:40.360 --> 06:50.240]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday, already the 5th day of July, 2015 global broadcast.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.640]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:51.640 --> 06:55.960]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central.
[06:55.960 --> 07:02.080]  We're back weekdays, of course, live, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central and reared many on many
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.200]  of these same stations.
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.840]  There are a lot of obviously important news items to go over today, but the first one
[07:10.840 --> 07:19.440]  is in projections and with most of the votes now counted and cast, Greece has voted not
[07:19.440 --> 07:27.200]  to go along with the fourth round of austerity measures that we've seen since 2008 with the
[07:27.200 --> 07:31.600]  island nation.
[07:31.600 --> 07:36.240]  The private central banks are announcing they're going to start basically just taking the money
[07:36.240 --> 07:39.640]  out of citizens bank accounts directly.
[07:39.640 --> 07:44.880]  So this is global government with private banks that control the European Union, not
[07:44.880 --> 07:50.640]  even needing the front of the rubber stamp government.
[07:50.640 --> 07:58.840]  But directly doing it themselves, Greeks are only allowed 20 euros or about $22 a day out
[07:58.840 --> 07:59.840]  of their bank accounts.
[07:59.840 --> 08:06.640]  It doesn't matter if you have a billion euros or 10,000 euros or 500 euros or 14 euros in
[08:06.640 --> 08:13.360]  your bank account, you're only allowed to get 22 out and they are basically threatening
[08:13.360 --> 08:20.360]  to shut down tourism to the country and engage in economic blockades.
[08:20.360 --> 08:24.020]  There's two different sides to this and both sides really get it wrong.
[08:24.020 --> 08:28.560]  Some say the Greeks are a bunch of lazy socialists who have too big a pension funds and only
[08:28.560 --> 08:35.080]  work three, four days a week and that they need austerity and they need to pay back their
[08:35.080 --> 08:37.720]  debts.
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.960]  And then others say no, it's all the big central banks, they're the bad guys, they're
[08:41.960 --> 08:50.400]  just looting the country and Greece deserves to default on this.
[08:50.400 --> 08:52.880]  The truth is in between that.
[08:52.880 --> 09:02.560]  The big private six global banks are predatory, do promote a culture of overspending, do finance
[09:02.560 --> 09:12.440]  all over the world from the U.S. to Greece the election, they finance the election of
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.600]  politicians that will put countries into debt.
[09:17.600 --> 09:26.800]  But it's true that the Greek people in the last 50 years have taken the bait and gotten
[09:26.800 --> 09:27.800]  into this.
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.520]  They're not as lazy in general as the media says, when you drill down on the actual numbers
[09:33.520 --> 09:42.600]  they work pretty darn hard, but at the same time some of their governmental pensions
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.880]  are too large.
[09:44.880 --> 09:51.000]  But what the big banks do is they hold countries hostage to the governing class and to them
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.880]  by saying you either go along with all the new taxes and regulations we want to put in
[09:55.880 --> 10:01.160]  place or everyone's going to lose your pension funds, you're going to lose your currency
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.520]  itself, your society's going to collapse.
[10:06.520 --> 10:13.080]  Now Greece's big problem is the globalist win either way until their entire paradigm
[10:13.080 --> 10:15.920]  is overthrown.
[10:15.920 --> 10:20.160]  You see we've watched the IMF and World Bank which are just global arms of the private
[10:20.160 --> 10:26.240]  Federal Reserve, we've watched them in countless African, Latin American, Asian and other European
[10:26.240 --> 10:35.400]  and Eastern European countries and Russia for that matter, we've watched them go in
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.520]  and leverage up taxes and regulations to an outrageous level that everybody knows will
[10:40.520 --> 10:49.160]  bankrupt the economy so people default then the international financial system that's
[10:49.160 --> 10:55.120]  predatory pulls out and the country completely collapses and then a few years later those
[10:55.120 --> 11:04.840]  same interests come in buying everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[11:04.840 --> 11:13.280]  All of Europe is bankrupt, the United States is bankrupt, it's not just Puerto Rico that
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.160]  is bankrupt here in the United States but California, Illinois, Michigan and this is
[11:18.160 --> 11:27.240]  not debated by the way, depending on how you look at the numbers, the average American
[11:27.240 --> 11:32.880]  when they're born owes between a million and two million dollars whether you're looking
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.960]  at unfunded mandates, actual debt or the derivatives we've been signed on to that aren't ours and
[11:39.960 --> 11:48.120]  that's really the biggest issue in this whole constellation, this whole table of factoids
[11:48.120 --> 11:55.360]  is that a little country called Iceland five years ago and I had members of their parliament
[11:55.360 --> 12:07.120]  on, 400,000 people live in the country, extremely first world, high education, high work ethic,
[12:07.120 --> 12:16.040]  bunch of Vikings produce a lot of the seafood that's on your table here in the United States
[12:16.040 --> 12:20.680]  and they went from being this incredibly prosperous country overnight to being told that all of
[12:20.680 --> 12:28.360]  them collectively owed a little over 400,000 pounds because they were pegged to the British,
[12:28.360 --> 12:37.160]  pegged to the UK, somewhat and we followed all this in great detail at the time and so
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.720]  they began to investigate and then they found out that most that debt wasn't theirs that
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.800]  they'd been signed on to derivatives that the UK had created and that their government
[12:47.800 --> 12:55.120]  had agreed to basically back and to basically bail out and when they arrested their finance
[12:55.120 --> 12:58.400]  minister and other people and actually got into the documents because it was all secret
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.040]  like the TPP and NAFTA and all the rest of it when they finally got into the documents
[13:03.040 --> 13:12.920]  93% you can pull those headlines up 93% of the debt wasn't even theirs and they said
[13:12.920 --> 13:19.760]  you know what we'll pay the 7% back so instead of 400,000 pounds to the math it was a lot
[13:19.760 --> 13:25.360]  less and they were even able to cut taxes and guess what more money came in to their
[13:25.360 --> 13:31.520]  coffers within a year because when you cut taxes massively it always in a large economy
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.880]  increases the actual money coming in because the economy speeds up but the globalist want
[13:36.880 --> 13:44.400]  a consolidated economy and so they rejected paying the five billion dollar debt that was
[13:44.400 --> 13:53.440]  not theirs and England and the UK had headlines Icelanders being listed as terrorists for
[13:53.440 --> 14:01.400]  nation not paying debt British Airways to not allow Icelanders to use their airline
[14:01.400 --> 14:04.840]  well they said fine go ahead and do that and they had to back off so similar things are
[14:04.840 --> 14:10.480]  now happening to the Greeks we don't know what percentage they actually owe most economists
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.800]  think it's upwards of 90% isn't their debt we know it's 91% in Ireland that numbers come
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.680]  out remember how Ireland 10 years ago was this big boom country and then they signed
[14:20.680 --> 14:28.640]  on to the Euro and a few years later were bankrupt this is done over and over again
[14:28.640 --> 14:33.720]  by the IMF World Bank they're African countries like Nigeria look it up that borrowed back
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.840]  in the 60s three billion dollars and on that three billion last time I checked they'd paid
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.840]  a hundred billion dollars in debt service to the IMF World Bank I mean if you buy a
[14:45.840 --> 14:53.560]  $300,000 house and you pay it off over 25 years you only pay 600,000 that's still probably
[14:53.560 --> 15:02.120]  a rip off but it is 25 years what about you borrow three billion and you pay back over
[15:02.120 --> 15:09.800]  a hundred billion and none of it fixes anything you see this this is an anti-free market economy
[15:09.800 --> 15:16.960]  it's a predatory vulture capitalist crony capitalist economy now I got stopped this
[15:16.960 --> 15:23.640]  weekend not by not one not two but three people saying what about Donald Trump and he's the
[15:23.640 --> 15:27.760]  big topic and we did a report on the nightly news four days ago and I covered a little
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.440]  bit this week but we'll get into Donald Trump not that he really matters but the story itself
[15:33.440 --> 15:40.240]  shows how the media operates because I don't trust Donald Trump but what he said about
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.160]  very clearly a five-year-old can understand it about Mexico's exporting its criminals
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.960]  here that's admitted and they're calling that racist kind of like not wanting Obamacare's
[15:49.960 --> 15:54.640]  racist or not wanting to be run over by trucks racist but first we're going to look more
[15:54.640 --> 16:02.480]  at the aftermath of Greece with Paul Watson from England introducing secret 12 the new

[22:12.520 --> 22:21.600]  down and most people are joining with sauron they're just making that decision and i mean
[22:21.600 --> 22:27.520]  he might have done something but it just in a dynasty susie just got out of prison for

[23:27.080 --> 23:30.800]  been appointing leaders in other countries the e you has an unelected bureaucracy that

[28:05.920 --> 28:13.040]  up well i think the key point here alex is it's a crushing defeat for global government
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.800]  as he said and you know i've been writing about this for the past couple of weeks again
[28:16.800 --> 28:24.160]  on info wars and not many americans are interested you know the articles get 200 comments maybe
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.720]  in comparison to the usual you know eight nine hundred a thousand that we get but as
[28:28.720 --> 28:34.800]  you said this is a major issue and we have to remember that this shut down the greek
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.040]  banks which occurred over the past week was not a decision by the greek government it
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.240]  was forced on them by the troika and we can get into the fallout you'll have the floor

[33:24.480 --> 33:34.960]  for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones the anatomy of a inverted
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.840]  reality in the next segment we're going to look at the whole controversy with Donald
[33:40.840 --> 33:47.600]  Trump saying that Mexico and the rest of the world are importing their criminals here Fidel
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.560]  Castro back in the early eighties publicly ordered the criminals dumped on boats and
[33:52.560 --> 34:02.760]  sent here it'd be like if you said that the sun came up in the morning and that's racist
[34:02.760 --> 34:10.000]  but this is the triumph of political correctness because a lot of weak minded people then go
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.240]  yeah that's outrageous I need to say it's great that they were just released another
[34:15.240 --> 34:23.160]  36,000 violent felon illegals for rape arson armed robbery assault with deadly weapons you
[34:23.160 --> 34:36.360]  name it in fact I meant to send it in yesterday it was even on CNN the headline man deported
[34:36.360 --> 34:50.960]  five times arrested for murder and he's a crazy killer for Mexico and he just went to
[34:50.960 --> 34:59.920]  the boardwalk in San Francisco and just shot a guy's daughter for fun and I couldn't believe
[34:59.920 --> 35:08.680]  it when CNN actually reported on it because I see this stuff every day in my stacks local
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.560]  news around the country yeah there it is man arrested connection with San Francisco killing
[35:13.560 --> 35:20.240]  had been deported several times officials say Fox News yeah it was five times we go
[35:20.240 --> 35:28.120]  back to the CNN oh look CNN's changed the headline since I saw yesterday morning imagine he'd
[35:28.120 --> 35:34.120]  been deported five times for robbery assault you name it there it is have been deported
[35:34.120 --> 35:44.960]  five times it's not illegal Mexican deported five times for violent crimes and he went
[35:44.960 --> 35:51.040]  out and killed her probably because she was white we've got a bunch of new knockout game
[35:51.040 --> 36:00.320]  of footage of veterans on on canes and crushes being attacked by racist black people because
[36:00.320 --> 36:07.320]  they're white and it's never in the national news because it doesn't fit with the narrative
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.920]  that whites are 25 times more likely and you can numbers vary as high as 40 I say 12 sometimes
[36:12.920 --> 36:17.040]  it's how you look at crime statistics but you're 25 times more likely if you're white
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.600]  to be attacked by a black male and I'm not attacking black people it's just a fact and
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.080]  I'm gonna hold Paul the next time to talk about this because I'm just digressing right
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.520]  now when I talk about the Donald Trump thing because this ties into it I mean it's the
[36:33.520 --> 36:41.680]  inversion of reality and it's the Democratic Party has successfully created vicious anti-white
[36:41.680 --> 36:47.900]  hatred when America is already majority minority in most areas where people actually think
[36:47.900 --> 36:52.320]  shooting or killing white people is cute and funny and when it happens it's not even
[36:52.320 --> 36:55.400]  hardly in the news but when it happens to black people you think it's the end of the
[36:55.400 --> 36:58.600]  world well you know what I think it's the end of the world when anybody gets killed
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.920]  in cold blood so that's all coming up but the fact that we can't talk about every criminal
[37:04.920 --> 37:13.240]  in the world that's running the best place is to come here just like if you commit murder
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.120]  the best place to run is to Mexico at least it used to be because they didn't have extradition
[37:17.120 --> 37:23.400]  I mean nobody ever debated that bank robbers and people I don't care what color they were
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.640]  predominantly white in the old days would run to Mexico I mean it's just no one that
[37:28.640 --> 37:37.120]  just denies you run to another country when you've committed a murder but it's racist
[37:37.120 --> 37:43.000]  to say that we have one of the biggest exoduses of criminals influxing into this country committing
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.520]  every heinous crime you could imagine and they're above the law and nobody even knows
[37:47.520 --> 37:54.960]  their name like that railway killer mainly killed Hispanics I said I cover the next segment
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.720]  I'm gonna get into the Donald Trump thing Paul I'm ranting I apologize thank you for coming
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.440]  on on Sunday evening I know you're looking at going to Greece you're one of our top
[38:05.440 --> 38:12.320]  reporters and I really think to have you there reporting on the front lines would be a great
[38:12.320 --> 38:18.960]  thing I personally am looking to going to Greece in the next few weeks if this continues
[38:18.960 --> 38:24.120]  to deteriorate it's just too big a story and imagine what's going to happen in the rest
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.080]  of the EU where it's still big news but not as big as it should be and here when the next
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.600]  big financial meltdown happens you know basically all the top experts we talked to say it's imminent
[38:34.600 --> 38:40.600]  Ron Paul was on a few days ago said the same thing I hope they're all wrong but all of
[38:40.600 --> 38:47.520]  the ingredients the atmosphere all of the indicators show that do you think that what
[38:47.520 --> 38:53.160]  do you expect to come out of this did the EU want Greece a default to get more power
[38:53.160 --> 38:59.640]  you usually have got your finger on the pulse Watson what exactly is going on there well
[38:59.640 --> 39:05.080]  it was obvious that they expected a yes though you go from the start this really to pick
[39:05.080 --> 39:09.240]  it up at the point where they close the banks I mean a lot of people think that the Greek
[39:09.240 --> 39:14.360]  government made the decision to close the banks and restrict everyone to you know 60 euros
[39:14.360 --> 39:21.920]  a day that wasn't the case the Troika engaged in financial terrorism according to the Greek
[39:21.920 --> 39:28.040]  finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who said quote why did they force us to close the banks
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.600]  to instill fear in people and spreading fear is called terror they were trying to and that
[39:33.600 --> 39:38.400]  we have that clip we can play it they were trying to instill fear very well said and
[39:38.400 --> 39:43.200]  they're trying to also create instability where investors pull out of Greece so they
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.640]  can come in and buy it up cheaper this is in the IMF World Bank documents they got leaked
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.640]  in 2002 they call it the IMF riot Paul and so explain to people what a Troika is it's
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.880]  ruled by three we're ruled by the nine ring race the Supreme Court and their master Obama
[39:58.880 --> 40:04.000]  the Soron but explain what a Troika is and that they're now announcing they're going
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.320]  to start just grabbing people's money out of their bank accounts this is why they want
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.760]  the world on a cashless society because then they'll rule everything exactly the troika
[40:14.760 --> 40:21.200]  is the IMF the ECB and the Eurogroup finance ministers and they ordered Greece to close
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.880]  the banks under threat of financial terrorism the exact same way remember back in 2008 and
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.480]  with the subsequent bailouts that they threatened you know there would be martial law on the
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.520]  streets of America if Congress and the Senate didn't pass that bill for the bailout so they
[40:36.520 --> 40:43.280]  use the exact same tactic and they expected this to accomplish a yes vote and you know
[40:43.280 --> 40:48.320]  that from what Goldman Sachs said before this vote took place Goldman Sachs came out with
[40:48.320 --> 40:55.400]  a advisory and said quote on balance we see a yes outcome as more likely remember this
[40:55.400 --> 41:01.000]  is what the media has been pushing for the last week the inevitability of a yes vote
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  was constantly pushed by the media because they thought the vote would be close and by
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.600]  trying to control this narrative they thought they could shift it over to yes very easily
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.720]  it didn't turn out to be the case so this is a failure because they're not invincible
[41:14.720 --> 41:19.080]  the euro was always meant to implode nation states to consolidate them but is this an
[41:19.080 --> 41:25.080]  uncontrolled implosion Paul yeah but just listen to what Goldman Sachs said before this
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.320]  vote quote the closure of the banks and resulting liquidity squeeze on the Greece private sector
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.120]  has served to concentrate voters minds on the gravity of the situation bringing the broader
[41:37.120 --> 41:41.760]  question of Greece's place in Europe to the fore and thus ultimately favoring a yes vote
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.760]  so they admittedly terrorize them yeah by destroying their their their markets and robbing their
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.200]  money and restricting what they could take out to quote focus their minds yeah you don't
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.000]  need to read between the lines very hard to know that that's basically them admitting
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.200]  that they forced them to close the banks to create the panic as he said before with this
[42:04.200 --> 42:11.160]  IMF riot in fact they expected more riots Barofakis the Greek finance minister gave
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.040]  an interview with Channel 4 where he made the point that it contradicted all the predictions
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.640]  that they would there would be civil unrest on the streets of Athens on the streets of
[42:21.640 --> 42:27.000]  Greece after they were forced to close the banks it didn't happen that's what the troika
[42:27.000 --> 42:33.360]  wanted because that would have made more people vote yes as it turns out it's 60 40 it's a
[42:33.360 --> 42:40.560]  landslide for the nose this is basically the threat of a good example now France Spain England
[42:40.560 --> 42:44.160]  all the other countries are going to look at getting out the euro and it's a major threat
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.920]  so the dictatorship is in trouble Watson finish up with us then I want to get into the knockout
[42:48.920 --> 42:55.400]  game which is basically attacking in some cases murdering white people being considered
[42:55.400 --> 43:01.080]  a new liberal sacrament that must be protected as cultural prize Alex Jones there to tell

[47:51.000 --> 47:58.360]  was on the break of collapsing all joseph watson is our guest we have a clip here
[47:59.720 --> 48:05.640]  that is greece's finance minister the bbc carried the piece breaking down the fact that
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.960]  either way whether it passed or it didn't pass the whole thing is a fraud i think it's a powerful
[48:11.960 --> 48:18.440]  one minute 38 second clip all that needs to happen is for the acp to get a green light
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.680]  from us politicians in europe in the eurogroup that an agreement has been reached and an agreement
[48:22.680 --> 48:29.080]  will be reached whether a yes or a no uh comes up through the ballot box if it's a yes it will be a
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.320]  bad agreement the banks will open with a bad agreement and you will be back here discussing
[48:33.320 --> 48:40.520]  with my my successor because it won't be me the terrible negotiations that will begin again under
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.720]  a very similar circumstance so if that thing will step down if a no wins we are going to have another
[48:45.720 --> 48:51.080]  agreement which will be viable along the lines of proposals made to us in the last few days this is
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.520]  a terrible thing about europe we have a very bad system of governance in europe this is not a way
[48:56.520 --> 49:01.480]  to run a monetary union this is a travesty it's a comedy of errors for five years now europe has
[49:01.480 --> 49:07.080]  been extending and pretending uh and we said no to this the program that they've imposed upon this
[49:07.080 --> 49:12.920]  country and which they want to continue imposing the same logic here um is who is going to go down
[49:12.920 --> 49:17.960]  in economic history as the greatest cock up ever what we're saying to the great people is this here's
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.600]  the proposal by institutions we consider this to be a bad proposal but it's up to you to decide
[49:22.600 --> 49:29.000]  whether we're accepted or not what does this mean it means that if they say yes we will go through
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.680]  with this proposal we will make sure that it passes through parliament house you will you and your
[49:34.680 --> 49:40.840]  government i but i said was we will make sure that the people's verdict is respected uh that
[49:40.840 --> 49:44.360]  does mean i'm going to be the minister of finance i'm not going to be the minister of finance because
[49:44.360 --> 49:51.880]  i cannot put my signature on an agreement which i consider to be non-viable and quite catastrophic
[49:51.880 --> 49:56.680]  both for greece and for the eurozone but see it's meant to be catastrophic for the eurozone and
[49:56.680 --> 50:02.280]  greece it was designed to suck countries dry and then out of the collapse of the three global
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.640]  unions this is the trial and error plan we've known this since they set it up in the 70s out of the
[50:07.640 --> 50:13.080]  collapse comes the world government and people always say this is horrible it doesn't work
[50:13.080 --> 50:20.120]  if you jack up taxes on tourism it'll kill what greece has left that's the plan and then no one
[50:20.120 --> 50:27.400]  ever discusses that most of the debt is global derivatives that the countries have been signed
[50:27.400 --> 50:35.240]  on to paul watson oh yeah and if you look at the the dates greece would have been on the hook for
[50:35.240 --> 50:43.880]  this for these austerity measures this vat high taxes until at least 2045 if not beyond so they
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.840]  would have just been kicking the can down the road over and over again with these huge debt
[50:48.840 --> 50:55.080]  payments their economy wouldn't have recovered but going back to the referendum verifakis also said
[50:55.960 --> 51:01.480]  basically outlined the fact that the eu the troika were horrified absolutely horrified
[51:01.480 --> 51:07.560]  that the greek people would even be given the vote in the first place he said quote the very idea
[51:07.560 --> 51:13.160]  that government would consult its people on a problematic proposal put to it by the institutions
[51:13.160 --> 51:21.560]  was treated with incomprehension and often disdain bordering on contempt by the troika so they
[51:21.560 --> 51:27.080]  were just flabbergasted that they would even dare to have this referendum in the in the first place
[51:27.080 --> 51:34.280]  god forbid the cradle of democracy would put this to a vote to the people so now they expected
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.080]  them all to vote yes because they engaged in financial terrorism and forced them to close all
[51:39.080 --> 51:45.720]  the banks now that it's a no landslide they're basically running around like headless chickens
[51:45.720 --> 51:51.640]  we've got j p morgan now saying that this is going to lead to greece's exit from the euro it's
[51:51.640 --> 51:56.440]  going to provide a good example for other countries if their economy recovers if they go back to the
[51:56.440 --> 52:03.640]  drachma and now we've got other quotes from euro group finance ministers who say they have no idea
[52:03.640 --> 52:11.160]  what to discuss after this stunning result so their hubris their arrogance clearly led them to believe
[52:11.160 --> 52:17.000]  that through media propaganda and financial terrorism they could influence this vote and
[52:17.000 --> 52:23.720]  martin armstrong the economist even suggested they may rig it to go yes and it's gone completely
[52:23.720 --> 52:29.320]  the opposite way they've completely been defeated and now they're running around like headless
[52:29.320 --> 52:37.720]  chickens not knowing what to do the biggest takeaway from this paul and i want to get your
[52:38.280 --> 52:44.200]  takeaway what you think is most important but the biggest takeaway is we know how they're coming
[52:44.200 --> 52:51.240]  at us in the 21st century and in the near future in the uk and the near future in canada the united
[52:51.240 --> 52:56.680]  states and other areas they're going to come after the savers they're going to come after private
[52:56.680 --> 53:02.840]  pensions they're going to grab all the cash we've gotten the bank they are going to embargo
[53:04.520 --> 53:13.560]  economic systems that are still viable to prop up an impossible to prop up 2.2 quadrillion global
[53:13.560 --> 53:20.440]  derivatives market when the most insolvent people in the world are the big six banks that are
[53:20.440 --> 53:25.240]  dominant because they created counterfeit instruments that make bernie madoff look like
[53:28.760 --> 53:37.240]  an angel at the pearly gates it is just so crazy that they're the ones running the planet
[53:38.040 --> 53:43.960]  they're the ones funding isis publicly the big banks are in mainstream news owning the
[53:43.960 --> 53:51.880]  aircraft that ship the drugs around i mean they are just so darn criminal they want a global system
[53:51.880 --> 53:57.640]  with no borders so they're above the law while all of us live in squalor i mean they are just the
[53:57.640 --> 54:04.120]  scum of the earth while they work around the clock to quote keep economies from overheating
[54:04.120 --> 54:10.440]  that means from creating new wealth and economies growing so fast they can't keep us in debt they
[54:10.440 --> 54:16.600]  are the plague what is your biggest takeaway from this and what do you expect to see now in europe
[54:16.600 --> 54:23.000]  because we've now seen iceland out the middle of the atlantic ocean and now we've seen greece
[54:23.880 --> 54:29.720]  say no the right wing media that's not right wing that's controlled opposition fascist
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.760]  just like the leftist fascist controlled opposition it's the same poison just different flavors of
[54:34.760 --> 54:40.920]  kool-aid i guess one's grape and one's cherry or one's coconut and one's uh you know apple i mean
[54:40.920 --> 54:47.400]  it's all poison and it's got the same cyanide in it and they're going these lazy commie greeks
[54:47.400 --> 54:55.800]  pay your debt it's not their debt in almost every case we've seen uh the excuses for grabbing
[54:55.800 --> 55:02.280]  money out of bank accounts in the bail in uh in a nearby island to greece uh you know just a few
[55:02.280 --> 55:09.400]  years ago uh so so we see this continuing over and over again uh paul of course i'm talking about
[55:09.400 --> 55:18.600]  cyprus yeah and remember in cyprus the um the so-called hair cut which is the biggest euphemism
[55:18.600 --> 55:25.880]  i've ever heard was on deposits over 100 000 euros they took 30 percent 37 percent on deposits over
[55:25.880 --> 55:32.040]  100 000 euros in greece they were talking about taking roughly the same amount on deposits over
[55:32.040 --> 55:39.720]  8 000 euros good god so that that wasn't even you know people who were you know moderately
[55:39.720 --> 55:45.080]  successful lower middle class that was anybody with basically any savings whatsoever and let's
[55:45.080 --> 55:51.880]  be clear the very same oligarchs technocrats and their own words run this country they will run the
[55:51.880 --> 55:57.640]  exact same plays on us and have got the government and the media up there acting like all this is
[55:57.640 --> 56:03.080]  legitimate getting us ready for the gang rape so i hate to use a gross analogy but they are
[56:03.800 --> 56:09.720]  trying in the media to get us ready for this and are trying to bring out the bottles of lubrication
[56:11.400 --> 56:17.400]  yeah and remember there were people prominent people within the eu saying how dare you canvas
[56:17.400 --> 56:23.000]  the greek people we're just going to install another technocratic government that's directly
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.440]  answerable to us that doesn't even represent the greek people they don't even vote for it
[56:28.440 --> 56:35.080]  and again that is the model not only for euro but for the for america as well for the north american
[56:35.080 --> 56:41.560]  union installed technocrats that we no longer even vote for no matter the fact that they're already
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.800]  corrupt and it's you know a revolving door between you know the corporate oligarchy and
[56:45.800 --> 56:50.760]  government but we don't even get a chance to vote for them anymore they're just directly installed
[56:50.760 --> 56:56.200]  by the troika by the global central banks that's their model for the world and that's what greece
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.240]  has been all about paul i know that you're on the continent of europe right now and it's about

[59:52.600 --> 59:55.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:55.240 --> 1:00:08.360]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:14.760]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network you know i've got two daughters
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:18.280]  and it makes me
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:24.760]  not even get angry or nauseous i mean i have those feelings it's just
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:31.880]  it makes me ask why is our government so evil why is it run by such incredible scum
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:37.880]  i'm reading a cnn article that i again have trouble believing they would actually tell the truth
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:44.680]  because i see these articles every few days around the country because just the psychos of the world
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.360]  are coming here to vacation you name it to just kill people
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:54.920]  that vacation killing is something the government tries to keep quiet but it's huge
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:02.040]  the stabbings the attacks in downtown austin the rapes the police are told cover that up
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:08.520]  keep that quiet i mean it it's just it's just amazing suspect and killing of san francisco
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:15.640]  woman had been deported five times people took photos after he shot her on the boardwalk at
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:21.880]  san francisco and was glowering enjoying it the young lady turned to her father and said dad i
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:27.800]  don't feel good before collapsing and dying she said dad i've been shot i don't feel good and
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:34.280]  collapsed and he just shot her according to witnesses for fun and why not he had five
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:41.720]  previous felonies for a whole range of criminal activities and the san francisco
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:48.680]  sheriff's department says in the article we are to release him we are not to deport him and we
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:54.040]  and and the uh and that they'd already asked him a month ago to be picked up
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:01:59.400]  i'm going to read over some of this article humanize this lady
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:05.560]  and that they said no we're releasing him and they're talking about him being released again
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:09.560]  i mean obviously they're going to probably be charging with murder
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:17.080]  but they're saying separate from that they're not going to give him to the feds
[1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:23.640]  and you got 800 plus sanctuary cities and they act like it's this cool quaintness because
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:29.400]  you know you don't want to be racist so my gosh i mean you can't even have donald trump say that
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:34.200]  we're the dumping ground for criminals which is totally true and admitted and all over the news
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:42.600]  so san francisco's got to let him go the hit and runs the drunk driving just the above the law
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:44.200]  craziness
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:51.640]  and san francisco's too busy celebrating gay marriage and my whole point is is
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:00.040]  we've just entered the twilight zone i mean it's whatever you think about gay marriage
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:03.960]  that's all we talk about i was at a party last night i'm going to watch it in the next segment
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:09.480]  i'm gonna get his take on the trump thing and they were all these liberals that i've known my whole
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:14.600]  life that are my parents friends they got conservative friends but they grew up in the 60s so about
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:18.920]  half their friends are super liberal and a bunch of them looked at me because they were over
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:25.000]  watching the fireworks and they said you know alex now i get everything you're talking about
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:32.360]  my god you think we're planet gay i mean all we hear about is gay marriage gay marriage gay marriage
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:39.720]  and and i mean clearly they're now going after people that aren't gay and there's no room for us
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:45.080]  and that's what it is i mean it's just a cult of craziness it has nothing to do with quote being
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:50.600]  gay it's just all about you have these rights to wear dresses if you're a man and you have
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:55.000]  rights to have your sex change paid for but by the way we're going to let serial killers kill
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.400]  your family and they won't get in trouble uh paul watts we're going to break but a minute take on
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:07.240]  that situation well with the trump thing i mean obama said something almost exactly the same
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:14.840]  he said he talked about dangerous people who are gangbangers or criminals coming over from
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:20.760]  mexico via illegal immigration there was absolutely no backlash whatsoever against obama
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:26.040]  trump comes out and basically says the same thing and it's you know everybody's up in arms about it
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:31.880]  so again it's it's about how they direct this outrage they create these outrage mobs on twitter
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:37.160]  on other social media that filters through into the mainstream media and they're adept at doing
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:42.600]  that at this point which is how a lot of this race baiting really divides the country and we
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:49.160]  can get more into that after the break i agree with you paul but it's beyond race baiting and
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:55.000]  the terms you and i use it's just total mental illness where there's this alternate reality
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:00.520]  where these people are experts on petty nittying nothingness and they all just fight with each
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:09.720]  other all day all are being screwed over it's just an alternate reality well that is exemplified by
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:16.200]  what a major university in wisconsin considers to be racist and we can get into that list that's
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:23.720]  right stay there we're going to go to break free shipping on molan laba in 1776 belt buckles
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:30.760]  which are also 25 off while supplies last free shipping on all of our info wars life dot com
[1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:37.800]  nutraceuticals if it's in the info wars store dot com warehouse it's shipping for free all during
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:44.520]  the month of july it's our way of saying thanks to the true heart and soul of this operation
[1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:52.840]  who stand beside us and support us as we wage an info war for liberty and freedom for all info
[1:05:52.840 --> 1:06:00.520]  war store dot com free shipping for the month of july
[1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:04.520]  lives
[1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:08.520]  will be smashed
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.760]  by those two good for you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the united
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:21.640]  states government leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:25.080]  you still think that jet fuel brought down a world trade center
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:32.680]  does anybody else see a problem here if the government has nothing to hide
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.360]  why are they so afraid to answer a few questions we're on a mission this story does not add up
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:46.840]  all right
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:54.440]  right at the very start of the broadcast we aired a four and a half minute
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:07:03.000]  news piece from info wars nightly news last thursday night dealing with the whole
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:08.680]  donald trump controversy and within that piece there's a clip of what trump originally said
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:12.760]  a week and a half ago and you would think this is the most important issue in the world
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:20.520]  obviously trump is a pr master obviously the guy gets into these elections
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:30.360]  to basically promote his tv shows and his casinos and his name i don't trust donald trump as far
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:38.200]  as i can throw an elephant a papa elephant that said i don't think donald trump hates america
[1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:43.480]  that hates our basic freedoms and i think pretty much everything donald trump says
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:51.960]  makes sense and is truthful i mean stuff he says is very accurate he's a smart guy
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.440]  i agree with probably 95 percent of what donald trump says the problem is
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:05.080]  the guy's tied in with a lot of really seedy people obviously
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:12.360]  i mean come on young's casinos he's in deep with the establishment and he's just funny
[1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:19.960]  as a three dollar bill if anybody is a ringer to take republican votes away and then to ensure
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:27.160]  that a second candidate doesn't get in there like rand paul against jeb and then jeb can
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:34.200]  be the ringer for hillary if anybody doesn't see that fixes in they're blind and they're
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:39.960]  smoking dope now that said i'm gonna talk about trump now but in the next segment i'm gonna
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:46.760]  actually read from seeing in about a story i mentioned earlier that is bone chilling
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:54.120]  suspect and killing of san francisco woman had been deported five times for aggravated felonies
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:09:00.200]  and they were going to deport him a month before he killed this man's daughter right in front of
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:06.440]  just shot her for fun and san francisco says they will still not give him to the feds to be deported
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:13.240]  i'd be surprised they'd get to do that now so you just get away we have an exchange program our
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:17.240]  criminals run down to mexico their criminals run up here that's just a truthful statement
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:23.640]  obama a few years ago famously came out remember and said mexican gang bangers are coming up here
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:29.960]  mexico has collapsed basically and has a failed state in most areas because of the criminality
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:38.760]  oh it's racist that we don't want to merge with mexico if they were like switzerland i'd want to
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:46.600]  let me tell you if if the swiss were brown skinned i wouldn't care they were black skinned as long as
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:53.560]  they were safe and free and wealthy like i wish mexico was some wonderful free country i'd probably
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:58.840]  leave the us the problem is there's nowhere to run to but this is the way they attack information
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:04.600]  with a dumbed down mindless public oh we're not going to deal with the libertarians against obama
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:11.720]  care that has death panels and wait list and federalization of health care and insurance company
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:16.600]  rate hikes written by them we're just going to call your racist if you're not for it and we're not
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:21.800]  going to sit there and actually debate the fact that guns make crime go down and all the statistics
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:26.200]  we're just going to say you're racist as well or sexist we're not going to debate that five
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:31.560]  year olds shouldn't be taught quote sex education that heather has two mommies or two daddies or a
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:36.600]  mommy and a daddy i mean what's going on here what's the sexualization we'll just call you sexist
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:43.960]  no i'm tired of you setting the whole agenda and lecturing to me so now donald trump
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:52.120]  is quoting all this trouble and this if they're able to damage him and damage anyone that
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:58.520]  criticizes the fact that mexico has turned into a crime sewer with a pipeline directly to the
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:03.960]  united states along with every other country then this country deserves what it gets i mean
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:08.840]  john bound is an excellent report nbc can't handle the truth it's on info wars dot com that
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:14.520]  shows all the statistics the news articles about the illegals pouring in i mean everybody knows
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:20.920]  about this though 36 000 aggravated felons in the last year have been released by the feds
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:29.880]  you count counties and cities it is incredible but boy they'll throw the book in a citizen of
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:34.200]  your blackwater ispanic because they know you're a chump schmuck that'll pay all the fines and
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:42.200]  all the fees let's go to this donald trump clip that is supposedly so evil the us has become a
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:50.760]  dumping ground for everybody else's problems when mexico sends its people they're not sending
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:57.560]  their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:02.840]  lots of problems that's right and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs
[1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:09.720]  drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some i assume are good people but i speak to
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:15.800]  border guards and they tell us what we're getting and it only makes common sense it's coming from
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:23.480]  all over south in latin america and it's coming probably probably from the middle east but we
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:28.520]  don't know there's no protection and we have no competence we don't know what's happening
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:34.920]  and it's got to stop that's right and it's got to stop fast that's good and they'll run around
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:40.040]  and have checkpoints at the mall or checkpoints at a football game but not at our border where
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:44.440]  you're supposed to have it all right watch and uh you've been a trooper riding with us here i'm
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:49.560]  going to get to a jeb bush clip in a minute about trump who i believe he's playing the ringer for
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:55.240]  and we've seen trump do this type of stuff before so a your take on donald trump b your take on this
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:13:00.760]  i had three people this weekend liberals come up to me on the street and say you don't like donald
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:05.400]  trump do you boy he's in a lot of trouble haha like they were having some fantasy victory and i
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:11.800]  didn't even argue with him i just said well i think donald trump's a a shell but at the same time i
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:18.680]  mean criminals do run here i mean is it racist to say two plus two equals four paul
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:29.240]  well in in the united states of insanity yes it is but i mean i've read stories repeatedly about how
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  the police just tell ranches down there at the border who own all this land to just shoot the
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:39.800]  illegals dead because they're coming across in such numbers that the police just don't have the time
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:45.560]  or the resources to patrol all this land and basically there's just an understanding between
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:50.440]  the police and the ranches if somebody violates your private property if they come on your land
[1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:55.000]  just shoot them dead and then we'll deal with the aftermath that's how bad it's got well that's
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:01.080]  because of all the arson and the attacks by the illegals yeah yeah violent crime is going down in
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:08.920]  america the only segment of it going up is these gangbangers as obama called them and the illegal
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:13.960]  immigrants that's one of the few areas where it's actually going up so he's basically pointing out
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  a problem that's existing everybody knows it's a major problem a lot of the polls show that
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:26.360]  huge opposition to illegal immigration is held by hispanics themselves who have legally entered
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:32.520]  the country middle class business owners and so forth so this idea that it's racist simply to
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:38.760]  draw attention to that problem is complete insanity at this point what do you think about
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:45.960]  trump i think as he said he's obviously probably a narcissist trying to draw attention to his own
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:53.160]  business interest taking away a lot of the vote from rand paul which the polls show that out of
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:59.560]  all the candidates he may not be the number one but he's the most likely to have a chance at defeating
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:05.080]  hillary clinton which of course we know the establishment fears so he's there as you said as
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:10.600]  a ringer to to take attention away take votes away from rand paul i don't believe is inherently
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:15.000]  corrupt or evil in that sense but you agree that jab is a ringer for hillary
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.920]  yeah i can't i can't believe for a second that it would be a clinton versus bush it it just seems
[1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:29.960]  to be on the pale um but definitely i think you know people saying scott walker is in with the
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:35.480]  best chance but again if you've matched them up against hillary they've got a 10 point deficit
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:41.640]  so at this point unless something radical happens it's going to be hillary a lot of real liberals
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:47.080]  would vote for rand paul he could win he could govern we need rand paul i mean and that's in
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:51.960]  the polls absolutely right paul great job at info wars dot com the person planet dot com thank you so

[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:50.760]  untenable but the media and the government says that when we raise our debt limit it doesn't raise
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:59.240]  the debt that see there's a war on reality now where they're normalizing that secret nsa spying
[1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:04.440]  while we have open borders is normal we have to take all your rights keep you safe from terrorist
[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:12.120]  that's why we fund the terrorist and leave the border open by the way we found the clip of obama
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:18.120]  last year trying to get his immigration reform bill passed that just gets rid of the borders
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:24.920]  entirely but selling it as a way to stop criminals coming in when the feds themselves release them
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:30.920]  36 000 violent felons in the last 12 months and the cities and counties and states are even worse
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:39.240]  i have met with prosecutors from travis county the folks that are prosecutors they've been to this
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:46.680]  office to talk to me is about two years ago about how the judges let illegal soft for drunk driving
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:55.560]  for ten dollars it cost the austinites black white hispanic your citizen on average over seven
[1:21:55.560 --> 1:22:03.480]  thousand dollars an illegal ten dollars to maybe a hundred and it's just an unwritten rule it's the
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:09.400]  same all over the country it's discriminatory but see under political correctness and i don't hate
[1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:16.680]  these people but my god the globalist want a suction to bring people here to create vulcanization
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:26.680]  to create a tower of babel so obama can say the truth but that's okay donald trump says it it's over
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:34.280]  and then they have bush romney and rubio come out and condemn trump now he's a paper tiger i don't
[1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:39.160]  trust trump what he says absolutely true though he's leaning in the polls now
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:48.360]  but meanwhile look at drudge dnc's number one target
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:23:00.920]  is rand paul that's from the hill newspaper number one target is rand paul
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:05.880]  paul isn't that just special
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:17.720]  you see because in the polls they know that he can win but the republican leadership which are
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:27.400]  just placeholders for the democrats and the establishment they've got trump out there put
[1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:34.280]  not rhetoric that they know would get them ahead telling the truth and so that way they can tear
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:39.480]  him up that's a faux candidate before he gets out of the race and i may be wrong trump may be really
[1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:46.280]  running but i've seen him pull this before but rand paul the hill newspaper reports
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:24:01.000]  is the leader democrats dis paul and then meanwhile bush disregard trump and santorum
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:11.480]  there you have it because rand paul has a history and policies anti patriot act anti nsa illegal
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:20.040]  spying anti foreign aid anti illegal wars that is so refreshing because he'll deliver when obama
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:25.160]  didn't there's some good things the democrats do like hey let's not have secret treaties
[1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:30.840]  giving corporations unlimited power making them government democrats helped vote down tpp
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:37.160]  obama went and twisted their arms threatened them and got it passed so see smart democrats
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:43.480]  will vote for rand paul they will not vote for a jeb bush until hell freezes over and we're going
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:50.360]  to get hillary clinton who is the worst she's even worse than jeb bush because jeb bush comes from an
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:57.720]  evil dynasty totally out of control can't trust him but with hillary man she really has an agenda
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:04.360]  socially to fry this country and i personally can't vote for either one of them i will not vote
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:10.200]  for less or two evils that's so bad uh so it's rand paul or bust folks for me ted cruz really
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:16.120]  like him did some bad stuff like supported tpp so and i've always said rand paul's the guy
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:22.520]  and they're gonna attack rand paul because of his relationship with me and i think he should
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:27.000]  just say i do a lot of interviews yeah guys libertarian he's a wacky guy but it makes a lot
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  of good points ha you know run to that be like trump be flamboyant tell the truth why do you
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:43.800]  think i'm so popular i'll tell the truth but i'm not a ringer like trump in my opinion but here's
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:51.080]  obama saying exactly what donald trump said except trump went further and was more accurate he just
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:55.720]  said they're not sitting there good people they're sending their criminals and people on welfare
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:03.400]  which is true obamas was more incendiary but was true here it is i mean i look i we should not be
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:11.000]  encouraging illegal immigration what we should be doing is setting up a smart legal immigration system
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:17.240]  that doesn't separate families but does focus on making sure that uh people who are dangerous
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:24.920]  you know people who uh are you know gangbangers or you know criminals that we're deporting them
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:30.760]  as quickly as possible that we're focusing our resources there wow so racist on a strong border
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:35.080]  a strong border we've made improvements on all those fronts but we could be doing even more
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:41.880]  if we had immigration by the way we knew a year ago that obama had dissolved the border and was
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:46.760]  letting illegals and children you name it they just focused on the kids to make people feel sad oh
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:56.120]  it's children the unaccompanied minors so again he's telling the truth they're only in limited
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:01.560]  way to say pass the bill knowing democrats and the majority of hispanics know we got to have a
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:06.680]  border and can't have unlimited illegals coming in so he's telling his constituents something
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:15.080]  that's true but he's lying saying the bill would do that we come back i have jeb bush's response but
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:20.600]  within this you can really just see the deception uh briefly ladies and gentlemen we are funded by

[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:25.240]  alex jones and the gcn radio network so the establishment has a balkanization
[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:30.680]  fight and conquer strategy when they have assault in fighting with each other while offshore
[1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:37.480]  corporations loot the nation's pension funds our resources our industries and just completely
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:47.800]  conquer us every day or two without looking i see articles out there of brutal attacks
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:53.480]  and they've got all the rock star hip hop sites and the rest of it where it's really popular
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:34:00.040]  and what it is is racial attacks on white people by blacks uh now something that was
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:06.920]  acceptable culturally in the 40s 50 60 70s 80s would be oh good guys don't rob regular folks
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:14.200]  they go outside a gay bar and they roll a quote queer to use the colloquial term i think it's
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:22.280]  terrible and rob them and you're an aggravated felon you're attacking somebody because of their
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:27.720]  quote sexual preference no you're a criminal that wants to feel good about the criminal activity
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:34.840]  you're involved in you've got something of a conscience so you target somebody you think
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:39.960]  subhuman and that's what's happening across the united states just the department's own numbers
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:46.040]  and again they vary state to state area to area but about three percent of the population
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:54.760]  and it's all broken down and john bowns report and paul watson's report of black males basically
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:35:03.000]  we're talking about 15 years of age up to about 40 and just a huge amount of the crime but but
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:12.120]  25 times higher black against white versus white on black and that's why the media the controlled
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:21.880]  media worshiped that horrible attack uh in the carolinas because at the church a few weeks ago
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:28.280]  because it allowed them to continue this myth that whites are this bloodthirsty horrible killer group
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:33.800]  because yes even though black males consist of one of the largest groups committing crime
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:40.680]  violent crime still it's a very small minority but that minority of a minority is extremely
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:46.120]  aggressive and if you go study the prison culture it's a belief and it's taught by the new black
[1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:51.160]  panthers and others we've played the clips that you go out and you mug and you attack white people
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:56.280]  and you do it to asians as well you've all heard about you know get rid of these asians with their
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:00.760]  grocery stores in our neighborhoods well i mean you burn down your own stores who's going to go in
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:10.600]  there so it's a cultural push just like there was a cultural push for hoods mainly white
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.360]  greaser hoods is what they were called the 50s to go out and beat up gay people
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:22.600]  that's how this operates it's the same thing but no one will talk about it because it's politically
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:29.880]  incorrect it doesn't fit into the narrative well there's new footage there's no audio
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:35.240]  it's from a surveillance camera it's on info wars.com from gateway pundit brutal footage of
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:42.200]  unsuspecting navy veteran knocked out by thug in knockout attack the navy veteran never saw it
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:47.960]  coming and the and the teenager comes up hits him from behind punches him more in the face stomps
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:58.120]  on him a lot of times old folks get knocked over and end up dying there's a lot of footage of folks
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:03.880]  you know hitting the ground and dying and it's just a fun thing for punk kids to do
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:07.880]  and it's they attack old folks but also in austin i've seen the footage
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:14.520]  they attack hippies because they know hippies won't fight back we've played the footage of just like
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:20.600]  thugs i mean like 16 year old thugs not even tough guys just beating the daylights out of like
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:29.160]  six foot five giant hippies and to into the hippies you know a gangbanger is a god i mean
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:32.840]  that's god attacking them and they don't know what to do and they'll actually start we've played
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:37.160]  the footage start begging and kneeling because you know they just can't understand what's happening
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:41.800]  you don't have the gangbangers going up to some you know good old boy in a truck
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:51.320]  uh and uh attacking them because well they know there's a gun and that's the socialist globalist
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:55.400]  dream is to make us like chicago new york or dc where regardless of what color you are you're
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:01.240]  disarmed so the thugs can just rule over you because they like to create hellish situations
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:05.800]  and now i'm going to segue into what i mentioned earlier i challenge you to go read the fox news
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:10.840]  and cnn report and then to read the san francisco chronicle trying to make excuses for this but
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:18.040]  but this illegal had been in jail five times for aggravated felons aggravated felonies he
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:25.160]  been released this year and they said that they they wouldn't turn him over to ice because they're
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:35.880]  sanctuary city so they let folks out of jail and then they go just shoot your daughter for fun
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:43.240]  and hey she's white she deserves it call it the shoot them up game that's already going on i mean
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:50.520]  why not suspect and killing of san francisco woman had been deported five times seeing in
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:58.840]  and see stuff like this is going to happen to the mainstream media's kids kate stinell was walking
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:04.680]  on a busy pier in san francisco with her father when there was a single popping sound in the
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:08.840]  air we don't call this son of sam murders and top story anymore because son of sam he was a white
[1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:18.200]  guy he was jewish no no no this is an illegal god and so she fell to the ground he's never called
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:22.440]  the illegal alien by the way you notice the headline she fell to the ground well i mean
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:28.760]  according to the she mean she's white i mean you know she's a military manufacturing center
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:35.000]  and every nine months when she lays down her back reinforcements roll out and you say khaled kill
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.920]  the babies yes kill the babies kill a little blue-eyed babies because one day i'm going to grow up
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:47.240]  to kill our babies what was that guy's name khaled mohammed look up the khaled mohammed
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:50.200]  clip you go around give that speech ever and i've heard that from the new black panther party
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:54.360]  today totally protected by the government running around teaching this i mean what do you think's
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:40:01.720]  going on same thing the man accused of firing the deadly shot 45 year old wan francisco lopez
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:07.240]  sanchez is an undocumented immigrant oh how about an undocumented migrant that's the new proper
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:14.280]  is an undocumented immigrant not an illegal alien a repeat felon who's been deported five times
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.680]  mexico according to immigration officials it would have been a six a federal law enforcement
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:24.760]  source told cnn except authorities in san francisco wanted him on drug related warrant
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:32.120]  and that's a spin article because you can read later when he was released by other cities they
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:38.280]  you know they say oh well we were a sanctuary city so u.s. customs and immigration enforcement
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:44.360]  which had lopez sanchez in its custody in march after his release for federal prison
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:49.240]  turned him over to san francisco deputies i said they requested immigration detainer asking
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:55.000]  that the agency be notified before lopez was released but he wasn't but san francisco is
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:00.040]  a city that doesn't honor just say sanctuary oh is that not a proper term either but san francisco
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:05.480]  is a city that doesn't honor such requests and the sheriff's department released him fray horn
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:10.680]  chief legal counsel of the san francisco county sheriff you mean the ford foundation told cnn
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:14.840]  that he was let go because there was no legal case to detain the suspect that's right it doesn't
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:19.960]  matter you're here illegally and a five-time felon for assaults and drug dealing everything else

[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:56.680]  to san francisco authorities on march 26 for an outstanding drug warrant but get this the agency
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:02.520]  requested an immigration detainer but horn that runs the agency for san francisco says
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:07.320]  san francisco officials believe that violates the fourth amendment rights against unreasonable
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:14.520]  searches and seizures he's a convicted seven-time felon deported five times they go here's his
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:19.880]  background you know charge him on your latest stuff give him back to us if you ever let him out
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:23.400]  and they go no it violates the fourth amendment when it doesn't
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:33.160]  it's your record you're a felon it can be transferred but san francisco has the nsa
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:38.040]  basically based in its spying on everyone illegally to make sure the crime continues
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:43.160]  the government drug dealing all of it this is an actively evil government do you understand that
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:50.600]  actively evil and i've talked to the austral police chief i don't think he's a bad person but
[1:49:51.160 --> 1:49:55.160]  he wouldn't be there he didn't play ball with him and he's like well we can't really throw the book
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:00.200]  at the illegals because then they won't call police and trust us to solve other crimes the
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:06.280]  illegals want people that commit rapes and robberies to go to jail they want them to be deported this
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:13.080]  hulk's idea the hispanics most of them who are americans and born here want a bunch of criminals
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:19.320]  running around his bull but again everyone's so afraid of the political correctness
[1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:27.000]  the department would have returned low-pass sanchez if there'd been a court order
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:32.920]  or charges were dropped but see the feds now have basically stopped all deportation as of a year ago
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:42.040]  that describes her here when she got shot she said dad i've been shot i don't feel well
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:48.360]  let's look at a photo of this young lady and the guy that killed her dead in the hammer
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:53.160]  and here's what's really scary and what lulac and all and and and and other mexican supremacist
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:59.560]  groups matcha loraza won't tell you most the crimes in fact more than 70 percent depending on the
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:04.840]  state committed by these criminals are against other hispanics they are wreaking havoc in these
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:13.480]  communities and just get away with it serial killing you name it and now it's coming out
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:19.960]  the serial killers from russia germany europe africa are tourism coming here to come here
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:24.840]  and kill people and then fly back to their countries that's something the government was
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:31.080]  to keep real quiet look into it murder tourism i mean we're just a wide open joke but they're
[1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:35.720]  spying on all of us and have troops at fourth of july oh they cancel fourth of july for military
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:40.920]  bases in england and other countries because isis might attack it no they just wanted to cancel it
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:52.360]  in the uk as a as a way to rub george washington's nose in it now i i talked about the new black
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:56.520]  panther party because the original black panthers actually had some good aims and tried to help
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:59.720]  people and got set up and destroyed and i've interviewed a lot of those folks that have survived
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:09.400]  but the old black panther party is not the new one and khalid muhammad was so radical he got
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:14.280]  thrown out of the nation of islam and i'm all about self-sufficiency shopping around community
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:18.280]  i think a lot of things as long as those are good and they sell these horrible things
[1:52:18.280 --> 1:52:22.520]  you know on the other side like you know get rid of these chinese people in our neighborhoods but
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:29.480]  see that plays to the racism the tribalism that's that's that's getting stronger under modern
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:36.040]  liberal multiculturalism i mean folks via com had a music awards thing i meant to cover it last week
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:43.080]  where the majority of the rappers that got up basically saying about killing police with with
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:47.400]  backgrounds of burning police cars and people like well aren't you sick out of control cops
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:52.360]  you don't have a civil war that's not going to fix it the globalists set the cops up this way and
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:56.680]  then now when i have a civil war to break the country down more i just don't want instability
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:01.560]  i don't want to give george soros what he wants and the average cop isn't bad doesn't deserve to be
[1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:08.600]  shot in their squad car i expect to be treated for what i'd behave like not shot and killed
[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:13.080]  because i'm white not shot and killed because you're black not shot and killed because you're
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:19.800]  gay or straight or whatever else that's real libertarian ideas not you'll pay for my sex
[1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:24.440]  change and you'll let me teach your five-year-old about it get the hell away from my five-year-old
[1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:29.960]  you creep what i'm a creep because i i think i'm a woman no because you want to get involved with
[1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:37.640]  kids we used to call that pedophilia see how they invert everything and then guilt nice americans
[1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:42.920]  of every race color and creed into going along with this now let's go since i this is his debate
[1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:49.720]  with anthony hilder but uh but he he gave the speech hundreds of times and this is what's taught
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:54.920]  if you wonder what the knockout game and all this is and then they politically correct cover it up
[1:53:54.920 --> 1:54:00.440]  knockout game goes on in austin texas the stabbing game everything let's go ahead and go to the clip
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:10.840]  i say if they don't get out of town we kill the men we kill the women we kill the children
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:18.280]  we kill the babies we kill the blind we kill the cripple we kill the crazy we kill the faggots
[1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:26.120]  we kill the lesbians i said god damn it we kill them all you said well why kill them all
[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:36.520]  why kill the women first why kill the babies they're just little innocent blue-eyed babies
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:41.240]  because god damn it they're gonna grow up one day to rule your babies kill them now
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:47.720]  why kill the women in south africa i said kill the women because the women are the military
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:54.600]  manufacturing center and every nine months they lay down on their backs and reinforce me rolls
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:55:00.840]  out from between their legs so shut down the military manufacturing center by killing the
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:07.320]  white woman why kill the elder crackers the old crepit crackers in south africa and the hell you
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:14.040]  think they got old they got old oppressing and killing black people i say kill a car
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:20.360]  kill a hell of a car god damn it that's enough and then it goes on and this is all of course in
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:25.080]  the united states to help promote the same view and they've got new black panther party members
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:31.240]  famously down in houston shane currently go out mug rob when the average white person is a totally
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:43.080]  obsessed ultra mind controlled self-guilt idiot and this is what's being promoted and there's
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:49.720]  the idea appease politically whoever's putting this type of rhetoric out by groveling you'll never
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:55.640]  hear out of khalid muhammad's mouth when he was given speeches about 52 percent of black people
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:56:01.320]  are 51 percent of black people being killed in the womb you'll never hear about plans to ship the
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:06.760]  narcotics into the communities or or or any of this coming from the big mega banks it's all no
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:11.800]  that white person over there driving down the road in their old beat-up car probably got less
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:18.280]  money than you do they hate you and they're the reason you're not doing good what a lie
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.480]  so i thought since i mentioned that i'd actually play the clip we play that maybe once a year
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:28.360]  because if i mentioned it just sounds too insane why not actually play it that's what's being taught
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:35.400]  you know what i don't care if they're a black baby a white baby or hispanic baby whatever baby
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:39.800]  they are i care about them as much because i care about human life and i have empathy we'd have
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:43.320]  empathy again in this nation and worldwide by the way the greeks are saying they're going to have
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:50.680]  their food cut off now and european parliament president uh needed to urgently discuss humanitarian
[1:56:50.680 --> 1:57:00.120]  aid to greece and it has been a landslide 62 percent have voted to not continue going deeper
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:04.680]  into the euro deeper into debt and to default at least mexico and other countries would default
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:10.040]  on their debts i mean obama says that we don't don't need to you ever have a problem just keep
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:17.720]  raising it our debt comparatively is as big as greeces oh but we're too big to fail no we're not
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.760]  and we're going into very serious waters this fall this winter and next year and we'll be here on the
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:29.320]  radio covering it raising the alarm to all humans across this planet we've got to work together for
