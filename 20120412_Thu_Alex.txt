[00:19.440 --> 00:39.000]  Alex Jones
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.400]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for joining us here on this
[00:44.400 --> 00:55.800]  Thursday edition the 12th day of April 2012 as you can hear my voice is a
[00:55.800 --> 01:01.240]  little bit raspy today but I think it'll like an old cars engine after it runs
[01:01.240 --> 01:08.600]  for a while it should stop sputtering and clanking and whiz banging we have
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.320]  reporters in fact as we pull me yesterday's news pull Watson's article
[01:13.320 --> 01:25.880]  on the death the suspicious death of the gentleman who had a small farm that the
[01:25.880 --> 01:29.960]  city designated as a green space and decided to take and so they kept
[01:29.960 --> 01:36.760]  bringing charges forward for a very long period of time against him he kept
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.760]  winning in court so the house just blew up and with him in it when the police
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.520]  outside and of course somebody also months before it poisoned his chickens
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.840]  and it made the city even matter because it was out in a rural area it's a
[01:52.840 --> 02:02.720]  suburb of Atlanta there in there in Georgia there in Roswell Georgia others
[02:02.720 --> 02:07.040]  were getting into having backyard chickens and you don't do that in
[02:07.040 --> 02:14.080]  America Pittsburgh is moving to ban garage sales and of course the feds
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.520]  have 15 million dollar fines now if you sell anything that was ever recalled
[02:19.520 --> 02:23.360]  even though you don't know that you're supposed to know that if you sell
[02:23.360 --> 02:30.000]  anything that was ever recalled 15 million dollar fine that's associated
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.760]  press if you think I'm joking just search that term I've got more attacks on
[02:34.760 --> 02:38.960]  Amish and more attacks on people selling produce on the side of the road you're
[02:38.960 --> 02:43.200]  not gonna do that pretty soon they won't even let a gentleman I guess at
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.560]  South Austin sell bonsai trees on the side of the road you don't do that in
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.920]  land of the free home of the brave you pay your money to a big box store with
[02:52.920 --> 02:57.640]  Chinese slave goods with factories that move to China because in tax incentives
[02:57.640 --> 03:05.560]  and if you don't like it you can go to jail in land of the free home of the
[03:05.560 --> 03:15.280]  brave I don't know why my voice is gone today but it's it's one thing when my
[03:15.280 --> 03:21.200]  voice is raspy but it's another thing entirely when it's hard to talk so
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.000]  hopefully my afterburners will kick in here and I don't feel bad it's just
[03:28.000 --> 03:39.920]  laborious to talk that's coming up I'm gonna have our reporters Darren McBreen
[03:39.920 --> 03:49.440]  and Marcos Morales reporting from Roswell Georgia home of Ted Turner and

[03:55.200 --> 04:05.160]  humanity they're gonna be joining us in the third hour which actually distracts
[04:05.160 --> 04:10.720]  them and away from their work they're investigating the suspicious death you
[04:10.720 --> 04:13.520]  know they announced it about five minutes they think he blew himself up in
[04:13.520 --> 04:19.120]  the house when they do that we have to automatically not believe known congenital
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.040]  liars that are government and you know that's my issue with the police a lot
[04:23.040 --> 04:26.800]  of police I know are patriotic smart men and women and are good people and got
[04:26.800 --> 04:31.520]  into it for the right reasons but they work for and serve a corrupt political
[04:31.520 --> 04:38.800]  elite and carry out unconstitutional stuff all the time and yes I will later
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.480]  in the hour break down Austin's own Carmageddon you're like why don't live in

[08:44.720 --> 08:51.400]  reporters Marcos Morales and Darren McBrain joining us from a suburb of
[08:51.400 --> 09:00.040]  Atlanta Roswell Georgia where a man locked in a what six-year battle with
[09:00.040 --> 09:03.520]  the city that was telling him he couldn't have his farm that they had
[09:03.520 --> 09:10.400]  annexed into the city ended up dying when the police began to raid his home
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.740]  and they're telling us that the gentleman blew himself up so we've got
[09:14.740 --> 09:20.360]  reporters there talking to locals and investigating and they'll be joining us
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.200]  coming up in the third hour of the broadcast today headline at info wars
[09:26.200 --> 09:32.160]  dot com state seizes property under green zoning laws they designated the
[09:32.160 --> 09:36.320]  land they said they were gonna get it and they said you can't have chickens
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.280]  and he went to court and beat them he got chickens for years and they didn't
[09:40.280 --> 09:45.880]  matter it didn't matter and of course they've got the property now another
[09:45.880 --> 09:53.000]  citizen conquered agenda 21 eco fascism bears its teeth and it's broken down in
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.480]  that article we'll cover that for about 30 minutes of the third hour today
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.680]  meanwhile there's more hysteria NBC New York reports suspicious package forces
[10:03.680 --> 10:12.920]  evacuation of world financial center tower the wicked flea when none pursue
[10:12.920 --> 10:18.800]  yesterday we were reporting that and so is Fox News and others that there was
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.600]  leaks coming out that no they weren't going to charge George Zimmerman the
[10:22.600 --> 10:29.680]  Trayvon Martin slaying and then before the show was even over they came out and
[10:29.680 --> 10:34.960]  so they were charging him with second-degree murder which is shocked
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.520]  prosecutors across the country they said bare minimum you might get a
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.440]  conviction with manslaughter which is basically accidental but second-degree
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.760]  murder is a big deal I guess all there is that for that is premeditated
[10:50.760 --> 10:56.280]  capital murder which is the death penalty now suddenly Trayvon Martin's
[10:56.280 --> 11:06.920]  mother has come out and said that she thinks that it was a accident and the
[11:06.920 --> 11:10.360]  leader of the new Black Panther Party we're gonna play this later has broken
[11:10.360 --> 11:16.440]  down crying and freaking out turns out she's got a long history of run-ins with
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.960]  the police she's now apologizing saying she never incited anyone to violence and
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.880]  then cries it's about the worst performance I've ever seen and I guess
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.160]  she's worried now about being arrested for racketeering because they call on
[11:32.160 --> 11:39.480]  people to organize to murder whites and to quote burn down Florida I mean that's
[11:39.480 --> 11:48.560]  organizing criminal attacks that that is the essence of organized crime and you
[11:48.560 --> 11:51.400]  notice she hadn't gotten in trouble but I think the way she's crying and freaking
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.000]  out now and then saying and by the way I never incited anybody I guess her
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  lawyer told her that that she's getting the word that she's gonna get some
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.120]  handcuffs slapped on her and she needs to I mean where is the grand jury where
[12:05.120 --> 12:13.880]  is the prosecutor calling for this Tampa Florida woman to be arrested I mean
[12:13.880 --> 12:19.200]  anybody else if this wasn't being run out of the White House and NBC hadn't been
[12:19.200 --> 12:28.080]  caught editing tapes so that they can get a race war going and the White House
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.440]  wasn't you know hyping this up and if the Attorney General wasn't meeting with
[12:31.440 --> 12:38.520]  Al Sharpton who was a clown like race agitator she would be arrested very very
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.280]  quickly and of course the feds also in Orlando on record Orlando Sentinel have
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.800]  white supremacist groups that are admittedly fed run not fed infiltrated
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.040]  fed run trying to stir up a thing as well and they've called for things not
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.080]  quite as extreme but but close they're not getting in any trouble but every time
[12:57.080 --> 13:02.880]  I have national media here every time they say aren't you calling for violence
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.760]  aren't you worried you're gonna cause violence when I'm calling for non violence
[13:06.760 --> 13:13.320]  and awakening to the fact that we're going into a tyranny doesn't matter who
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.200]  it is nightline the list goes on and on MSNBC all of them they always say what
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.400]  about violence meanwhile NBC is editing tapes together trying to get a race
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.320]  war going the idea is oh there's violence in America we got to shut down
[13:29.320 --> 13:33.440]  everybody's free speech but they want to stir it up first so they have the
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.920]  pretext to shut down the population speech and that's exactly what the
[13:38.920 --> 13:45.000]  system's doing there's new numbers I'll get to later if I have time but broadcast
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.640]  TV and cable viewing across the board is just plummeting primetime shows are
[13:49.640 --> 13:56.680]  plummeting people are just deserting the dinosaur media and so the system is
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.720]  going to respond with the new treaties and new laws and new cyber security
[14:00.720 --> 14:06.120]  legislation that in their own words ends privacy ends due process and allows them
[14:06.120 --> 14:14.040]  to shut down anybody anytime they want outside of law and that's the big issue
[14:14.040 --> 14:25.360]  here that has to be discussed the larger issue that we need to understand here is
[14:25.360 --> 14:33.800]  that when I get up here and criticize police for engaging in unconstitutional
[14:33.800 --> 14:41.520]  activity you are being twisted by the social engineers to slowly destroy the
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.440]  common law the common sense the bill of rights due process and the entire
[14:47.440 --> 14:54.160]  society is being criminalized and being inducted into the criminal justice
[14:54.160 --> 14:59.080]  system that today is a social engineering college for criminals that's how
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.000]  the system plans to fully erase our rights and liberties is just set up
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.200]  administrative law train bureaucrats and armed bureaucrats that they can do
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.400]  whatever they want administratively and then get everybody into the system and
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.480]  say you don't have rights no fly list IRS wants it where you can't have a job
[15:17.480 --> 15:23.240]  travel if you aren't in good stead with them and their collection agency for the
[15:23.240 --> 15:26.960]  private Federal Reserve and want to destroy the economy in their own policy
[15:26.960 --> 15:34.960]  reports they want to create a post industrial society that's what's going
[15:34.960 --> 15:42.080]  on here and so when they try to set it out there in front of the public like
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.600]  you're either for the police and do everything they say and do and everything
[15:46.600 --> 15:53.120]  the media promotes through them and everything that the government that
[15:53.120 --> 15:59.080]  commands them says or you a police and that's not the case but in every case
[15:59.080 --> 16:07.080]  in history in every culture tyranny comes to your door in a uniform the
[16:07.080 --> 16:14.120]  uniform is always the instrument of your enslavement and it's that case in in
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.920]  all histories in all cultures in all systems many cultures in fact the more
[16:19.920 --> 16:27.960]  free the less police many cultures outlawed police outlawed military in
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.680]  the country our system outlawed military inside the United States that's the
[16:32.680 --> 16:36.320]  American system because they knew it would be used against us by corrupt
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.520]  individuals that got control in Germany the military was pretty much outlawed
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.560]  from operating domestically but Hitler got rid of that you know before Julius
[16:48.560 --> 16:54.760]  Caesar came along you could not have the military inside of Italy what is Italy
[16:54.760 --> 17:02.480]  today Rome was a city-state in its main province and its genetic homeland was
[17:02.480 --> 17:10.640]  what is Italy today but the city on the hills there was the city-state of Rome
[17:10.640 --> 17:19.880]  and you did not bring the military in to central and southern Italy you could
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.280]  have them up in the north but but that was it to guard the border so see these
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.800]  are common sense things you say our police are being militarized they're
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.240]  violating our rights more and more we're being trained that we basically can't
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.480]  have any rights or freedoms and it's all in our own interest and then the
[17:36.480 --> 17:39.720]  government's caught engaged in all this corruption and all this abuse and all
[17:39.720 --> 17:43.160]  these dangerous things that are happening we need to reign government
[17:43.160 --> 17:49.520]  back in that's the American system and then we get rebuked by the dinosaur
[17:49.520 --> 17:55.400]  media and the police spokesman and others and now our local police are
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.280]  being federalized for all intents and purposes with Homeland Security money
[17:59.280 --> 18:04.840]  there is the manifest joke of the drug war where you've had scores of
[18:04.840 --> 18:10.480]  congressional hearings certifications by the CIA inspector general in 1997 that
[18:10.480 --> 18:16.240]  yes the agency for decades did bring in every drug you can imagine constantly
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.560]  government has caught shipping drugs in it doesn't get in trouble because it's
[18:19.560 --> 18:26.280]  sanctioned shipping guns to drug gangs over the border police officers get
[18:26.280 --> 18:30.640]  killed and there's not big parades and cities shut down the people are told
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.040]  there'll be a couple folks out there at the funeral shut up if you want their
[18:34.040 --> 18:36.240]  pension
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.040]  what is it at least three police officers and now three border patrol the
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.520]  numbers more like 19 according to our sources but they can't a hundred percent
[18:46.520 --> 18:50.920]  proof because because the Justice Department comes in and they'll debate
[18:50.920 --> 18:54.600]  well there was some guns from fast and furious with the people that killed the
[18:54.600 --> 18:59.400]  cop but we think it's this gun that they got somewhere else it's just it's so
[18:59.400 --> 19:04.240]  sick and then meanwhile they shut the entire city down for five hours yesterday
[19:04.240 --> 19:11.200]  at 35 71 it was a living nightmare busiest thoroughfare in the country is at
[19:11.200 --> 19:15.680]  35 in the in the swath from Austin to San Antonio I mean it's traffic at high
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.600]  noon there's traffic there in midnight a lot of times you know bumper to bumper

[24:34.600 --> 24:38.800]  in front of us and then I'm gonna give the number out in fact I'll do that
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.240]  right now and then I'm gonna come back and cover from a psychology and
[24:44.240 --> 24:50.520]  criminology perspective what happened in Austin Texas yesterday where I live and
[24:50.520 --> 24:56.760]  again this affects people all over the country this was a pure psi op on the
[24:56.760 --> 25:04.680]  back of a dead police officer and it shows how the system manipulates all
[25:04.680 --> 25:11.360]  these cops dead from fast and furious guns into the hands of criminals by the
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.520]  Justice Department there's not parades for them there's not shutting down
[25:16.520 --> 25:23.960]  cities for them I went and looked it up they kept it very quiet the system uses
[25:23.960 --> 25:28.880]  officers that are killed to make the government look like heroes just like
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.680]  they did with 9-11 first responders who they then attacked in the New York post
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.520]  as ambulance chasers wanting medical treatment they wouldn't even get medical
[25:39.520 --> 25:46.160]  treatment it took nine years and an act of Congress to get them basic medical
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.520]  treatment hey you're sick you're off the fire department and we're not gonna give
[25:50.520 --> 25:59.480]  you treatment oh yeah the police the fire men and women again I'm sick of this
[25:59.480 --> 26:05.240]  fake sentimentalism where the system manipulates us I mean what I saw here in
[26:05.240 --> 26:10.600]  Austin yesterday was like something out of North Korea and I'm not saying the
[26:10.600 --> 26:16.840]  people involved were bad it just shows how they were manipulated in fact I know
[26:16.840 --> 26:19.800]  the feds were involved in organizing some of it the guys look into how this
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.280]  was orchestrated next time our day Savetta comes in here I'm not challenging
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.960]  because I heard the radio yesterday they were saying that he had called in and
[26:28.960 --> 26:35.400]  made statements that if people don't like the traffic he doesn't care and again
[26:35.400 --> 26:41.400]  it just goes to disconnected from reality and and the way the public was
[26:41.400 --> 26:45.040]  in attack by the talk show host and the callers callers going all beat
[26:45.040 --> 26:50.120]  somebody up if I don't see them pull over folks the media was saying pull over
[26:50.120 --> 26:56.520]  when they shut I-35 completely down the busiest highway in the country and the
[26:56.520 --> 27:03.640]  busiest stretch so I'm already covering this it's just so amazing and I'm gonna
[27:03.640 --> 27:06.920]  try to in a focus way cover it all after the break it was we got a bunch of
[27:06.920 --> 27:12.760]  graphics and documents I want to go over they shut it down and then they
[27:12.760 --> 27:18.440]  told everyone the police department did the news media echoed it that to show
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.960]  respect you should stop on the other side of the road so the other side both
[27:24.960 --> 27:31.000]  lanes like there been a nuclear spill or something were shut down both north
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.400]  bound and southbound and it shut the entire city down because people all
[27:35.400 --> 27:40.920]  went off the other roads there were cars wrecking my wife saw cars crashing into
[27:40.920 --> 27:46.480]  each other people driving on the medians bedlam this is a big city with not
[27:46.480 --> 27:48.960]  enough roads because the environmentalists to block them we were under
[27:48.960 --> 27:55.480]  agenda 21 here completely and it was in sanity people couldn't get their
[27:55.480 --> 28:02.080]  children yeah look at that on the local news go back and show that and pause that
[28:02.080 --> 28:13.960]  real quick go back and show it where where it shows them let's just do it
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.040]  after the break just stop okay yeah look the other side of the highway shut
[28:18.040 --> 28:24.360]  down quote out of respect and this went on for five hours in Austin and then
[28:24.360 --> 28:35.280]  hours after hours but here's the big one here's the big one I was looking at I
[28:35.280 --> 28:43.760]  go San Angelo's north of Austin why did they go south and they did it to shut
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.080]  everything down on purpose to make a giant spectacle and according to that
[28:48.080 --> 28:53.720]  thought process get a parade permit announce we're gonna do it do it on a
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.800]  weekend so everybody who wants to come out and pay respects can and shut down
[28:57.800 --> 29:03.800]  Congress and give the guy a parade if you want okay fine gave his life whatever
[29:03.800 --> 29:09.440]  great I'm all for it do not in the middle of the day and into the daytime
[29:09.440 --> 29:19.880]  traffic shut everything down and I'm gonna show you the maps if you're watching
[29:19.880 --> 29:23.360]  on prisonplanet.tv and go all over and people are like hey man we got a
[29:23.360 --> 29:26.720]  North Korea about to launch a missile we got global depression we'll get to all
[29:26.720 --> 29:34.240]  that this though is about the mindset of government and as a scyop how the
[29:34.240 --> 29:39.000]  public responded when they're told to be sentimental and care they do when they
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.840]  shoot a kid up with the vaccines they down the spot nobody cares because the
[29:42.840 --> 29:47.800]  media is not told to care we'll be back

[31:57.520 --> 32:03.920]  others don't. A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[32:03.920 --> 32:07.480]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[32:07.480 --> 32:11.800]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[32:11.800 --> 32:15.240]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[32:15.240 --> 32:19.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.480]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[32:24.480 --> 32:29.280]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[33:24.120 --> 33:50.640]  we are back live you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get into the Karmageddon
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.040]  thing and the different psychological angles on it coming up at the start of
[33:55.040 --> 34:00.200]  the next hour for just one segment I'm gonna try to keep it condensed down to
[34:00.200 --> 34:05.400]  just one area and go over the fact that ambulances couldn't get places people
[34:05.400 --> 34:08.960]  couldn't pick their children up in some cases for two hours plus the major
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.160]  highway was completely shut down there were no police to be seen anywhere
[34:12.160 --> 34:16.680]  riding the customary tickets and revenue generating and I'm told that they
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.400]  couldn't really respond to a lot of calls and it's just like it doesn't matter
[34:20.400 --> 34:27.360]  we're going to shut down everything and we're going to route a vehicle
[34:27.360 --> 34:34.000]  completely out of the way and shut down both sides of the highways and turn the
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.560]  city into total gridlock and then if you complain about it and say why did you do
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.680]  this we're gonna say you're a traitor and hate police because you're just a
[34:42.680 --> 34:48.800]  scumbag citizen here to pay taxes and helicopters and the police chief crying
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.480]  I mean I've never seen this the last police officer was officer Jones who
[34:56.480 --> 35:04.680]  died back in 2000 when some scumbags shot him when he pulled him over and it
[35:04.680 --> 35:10.120]  is a tough thankless job my whole point is is that the system wants to lionize
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.800]  police to God level and and try to set up an idea that they are rock star
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.560]  superheroes so that you cannot ever criticize them so when the state gives
[35:22.560 --> 35:26.200]  them orders that are criminal and dangerous and try to use them for
[35:26.200 --> 35:37.000]  tyranny the psi op is you can't say no and so that is all coming up later in the
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.120]  transmission what I'm gonna do right now is just open the phones up on any
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.920]  subjects you want to discuss what's happening in the economy the threats of
[35:46.920 --> 35:50.560]  North Korea to go to war if anybody gets in the way of their missile being
[35:50.560 --> 35:54.720]  launched our corporate media criticizing North Korea and talking about how
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.680]  horrible the government is and how the people are starving well I mean you like
[35:58.680 --> 36:04.200]  total government our government does a lot of stuff like North Korea and of
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.120]  course I can compare that the public out crying you didn't even know the police
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.640]  officer and waving American flags they're desperate for America to come
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.680]  back they're desperate for something to believe in and when the media says have a
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.960]  race war over Trayvon Martin it starts people start getting killed when they
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.880]  say you will when you see this driving on the other side of the highway you'll
[36:26.880 --> 36:34.040]  pull over out of respect as they shut down the other side of the highway but
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.480]  then when a cop gets killed by the Justice Department's guns or when the
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.440]  Justice Department kills cop of the year in Oklahoma because he knew the feds
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.760]  were planting bombs in the building Terrence Yeke and and the head of the
[36:45.760 --> 36:49.640]  canine unit and others are witnesses to what the feds were doing they come to
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.440]  him and say we'll kill you and your family if you don't shut up and then the
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.160]  cop the police officers it's three of them separately go to the police chief
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.320]  the police chief says get out of my office better keep your mouth shut hey
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.700]  chief feds are threatened to kill me and my family if I talk about what I saw
[37:07.700 --> 37:11.600]  well you better keep your mouth shut then buddy see it's all fake it's a
[37:11.600 --> 37:19.200]  Psyop that's my point it's not about the police officer who was killed it's
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.520]  about the fact that it's a giant psychological operation and that it's
[37:25.520 --> 37:30.940]  getting more and more crazy when a police officer gets killed where they
[37:30.940 --> 37:37.520]  act like the earth stands still when they want to is the point the question
[37:37.520 --> 37:41.920]  is why did they want to route it through the middle of the city in rush hour and
[37:41.920 --> 37:46.920]  shut the entire city down in the total total gridlock in Bedlam I mean when
[37:46.920 --> 37:50.120]  Bill Clinton used to do that or George Bush people got mad and rightfully so
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.560]  what do you need a hundred cars why are you blocking highways you're not the
[37:54.560 --> 37:59.160]  emperor you're not Kim Jong-il this is North Korea stuff man they shut the
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.360]  highways down in dictatorships the people hated Chilchescu in Romania
[38:03.360 --> 38:06.240]  because he did stuff like that American presidents didn't used to do this
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.680]  unless the city decided to give the president a parade then there was a
[38:10.680 --> 38:18.080]  parade route not just as the president lands for fundraisers they shut down the
[38:18.080 --> 38:23.200]  highway it happens Obama's here four or five times a year and I usually don't go
[38:23.200 --> 38:26.120]  home till seven or eight or nine at night but sometimes we'll run out to get
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.440]  something to eat and we're right here by I-35 and 290 in the airport some of
[38:30.440 --> 38:33.920]  there and they'll just have police blocking the exits and things and
[38:33.920 --> 38:40.160]  entrances and we can't go anywhere and they'll block the road you know 20
[38:40.160 --> 38:43.880]  minutes before when his plane lands and sometimes you'll sit there for an hour
[38:43.880 --> 38:47.480]  they start blocking the road and you're just like all the roads block because the
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.000]  king is here that's what I'm sick of I really have a problem with that and so
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.520]  now the local bureaucrats let me tell you if they get away with using this dead
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.520]  cop to do this it's an exercise of power it's a showboating they're gonna start
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.320]  doing it they had a police dog killed a few years ago I'm already covering this
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.320]  they had a police dog killed in Houston and it on the news it said thousands of
[39:09.320 --> 39:14.400]  police on taxpayer money went there and they had shut down a part of the roads
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.280]  for the dog and called it an officer and charged the guy with a killing an
[39:19.280 --> 39:24.680]  officer under some weird twist of the law for shooting the dog and I'm not
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.600]  saying that's good but I'm a big dog lover I've got four dogs two French
[39:29.600 --> 39:35.640]  Bulldogs a black lab and a aged Chihuahua okay I got four dogs but let me tell
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.320]  you this is what happens in Rome in Rome they begin to elevate that the
[39:40.320 --> 39:47.120]  Emperor's dogs and the Emperor's bulls their champion bulls and their horses
[39:47.120 --> 39:55.040]  above the people it always is the same and this was all about worship police but
[39:55.040 --> 40:01.400]  not individually don't appreciate you know in the state where's the police as
[40:01.400 --> 40:22.880]  a cloak of infallibility just really weird most of the time when I run into
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.280]  police if you're nice to them then they start asking you questions and looking
[40:27.280 --> 40:33.400]  at you weird so I just like don't really talk to them I'm just like okay it was
[40:33.400 --> 40:37.480]  like they had two police came out cuz an alarm went off at my house I don't know
[40:37.480 --> 40:40.840]  why it's been going off the middle of the night and I go up there to talk to
[40:40.840 --> 40:48.520]  them and they both recognize who I am I tell them who I am tell them squirrels
[40:48.520 --> 40:52.400]  are eating the wires or something and the mail officer starts walking away and
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.280]  the woman says can I see your ID I could tell she was smiling at me was like an
[40:56.280 --> 41:00.720]  exercise of power I said yeah I pulled out my wallet out of my back pocket and
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.400]  she looked at it and smiled at me was just a little and it's like whatever man
[41:04.400 --> 41:10.560]  if that's what makes your ego feel good if that's what makes you feel good in
[41:10.560 --> 41:17.920]  life is to have somebody show you their ID while they're wearing jeans and no
[41:17.920 --> 41:25.720]  shirt standing in the dark you're shining a flashlight in their face I was
[41:25.720 --> 41:33.560]  just like whatever and my point is is I think she did that because I said thanks
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.400]  for coming out be safe you know and she turned back around said let me see your
[41:37.400 --> 41:43.440]  ID and it was like okay and I knew as soon as I said something nice to him
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.320]  that was the that was the trigger I just I just know so much about psychology now
[41:49.320 --> 41:55.960]  and how people work and I'm just sick of it man I'm so sick of it and the banks
[41:55.960 --> 42:05.480]  that have captured this country are forging a
[42:06.840 --> 42:14.360]  oppressive unconstitutional system I mean I I don't blame quote all police for
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.640]  the fact that every three or four days I see articles where they're taking people
[42:17.640 --> 42:21.760]  children at the hospital because they refuse vaccines there's no law it's not
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.640]  neglect and they're kidnapping children and they're following the orders of the
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.680]  pedophile services the child pedophile services CPS the pedophile
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.800]  delivery service and I know it's a crime and I know they're hurting people's
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.760]  children and it affects me and I know they have special units attached in many
[42:42.760 --> 42:48.960]  cases to CPS and hospitals that are pervs and are part of the team I was
[42:48.960 --> 42:55.960]  talking to a well-known musician and he talked about how they groped his 14-year
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.480]  old daughter the TSA now they single out his his wife because they're you know
[42:59.480 --> 43:04.480]  she's attractive and I mean you see people you see that you see 14-year-old
[43:04.480 --> 43:10.160]  girls with potbellied men and women grabbing their breast I mean this is the
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.660]  sacrament I guess you should wave an American flag and cry oh here's my
[43:14.660 --> 43:18.960]  five-year-old daughter groped them and then and then you wave an American flag
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.600]  and that make it it's like if you don't like it you know wave an American flag
[43:23.600 --> 43:30.760]  they can start coating cyanide pills with a little American flag cover you
[43:30.760 --> 43:33.360]  know on the pill and it's like take cyanide you're like I don't want to die
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.080]  they're like it has an American flag on it you see how it's just it's a gimmick
[43:38.080 --> 43:44.120]  it's just totally shallow and fake and being done because it's fake if you like
[43:44.120 --> 43:50.160]  if somebody brought you cookies when you moved in to a neighborhood and came up
[43:50.160 --> 43:55.600]  and was real nice and and gave you the cookies and told you how nice they were
[43:55.600 --> 43:58.800]  to bring you cookies you'd go oh this neighbor they're not bringing me cookies
[43:58.800 --> 44:04.400]  to be friendly they want something the next day hey mind if I leave my dog with
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.720]  you this weekend when I'm going out of town you're like sure and they get back
[44:08.720 --> 44:14.020]  hey mind if you pick me up from work you know it's the gimmick of it it's that
[44:14.020 --> 44:17.960]  it's a manipulation it's that the public is looked at by the social
[44:17.960 --> 44:22.120]  engineers and and the local ones all want to play that game it's all how to
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.560]  package info how to manipulate how to punch people's buttons it's like a
[44:26.560 --> 44:33.520]  month or so ago Santorum said something you know about women in birth control and
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.800]  limb bomb came out and you know talked about a woman who wanted thousands of
[44:37.800 --> 44:43.480]  dollars of contraceptive a year and he's like man you know you want us to pay for
[44:43.480 --> 44:49.760]  what you know for your sexual activity I mean what is that when you pay someone
[44:49.760 --> 44:56.400]  so they can have sexual activity what is that called and they made a huge deal
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.880]  and Obama went up like 10 plus points or more in some polls with women total
[45:01.880 --> 45:05.680]  con artists reading off a teleprompter lied about everything but you know what
[45:05.680 --> 45:10.280]  he's skinny and handsome and acts friendly and like a sitcom star so it's
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.800]  like hey you know what go ahead and rape me real bad you know what it's a gimmick
[45:14.800 --> 45:18.960]  and I'm sick of gimmicks there's nobody putting makeup on me there's nobody
[45:18.960 --> 45:22.840]  telling me what to say this is real and sure I wear a sports jacket to respect
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.160]  the information someone's talking about a dead police officer today I put a
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.520]  sports jacket on you know there's little things like that we try to make it you
[45:29.520 --> 45:33.960]  know an interesting show but the point is is that that's not what's up front
[45:33.960 --> 45:39.480]  that's not what our foundation is and this is a culture that is a thousand
[45:39.480 --> 45:46.840]  miles wide and one Adam deep ever heard the saying all hat and no cattle most
[45:46.840 --> 45:50.760]  people wearing cowboy hats and cowboy boots and strutting around talking like
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.160]  John Wayne are like John Wayne they're not from Texas they're from Ohio nothing
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.480]  wrong with being from Ohio of course John Wayne did embrace the Western culture
[45:59.480 --> 46:04.760]  and get all into it the point is I don't blame him is that is that it's all hat
[46:04.760 --> 46:15.560]  and no cattle you understand the difference between that all hat and no
[46:15.560 --> 46:26.400]  cattle my wide-inch deep they're not real people revel in the fakeness and
[46:26.400 --> 46:30.000]  it's like you're an open this is so important I'm gonna say right now it's
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.280]  like you're an open programmable computer that just receives what you're
[46:35.280 --> 46:39.240]  told so the media and a Psyop test this is what this was this is never I've
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.480]  never seen anything like this anywhere with a police officer a president
[46:42.480 --> 46:51.120]  anything I mean this was crazy and it was a Psyop our day surveyed is slick the
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.760]  awesome police chief this was a Psyop for a few days before to say you will
[46:55.760 --> 46:59.080]  stop when you see it come by on the other side of the road and we're gonna
[46:59.080 --> 47:04.720]  shut down at 35 and we're gonna shut down to 90 we're gonna shut down 71 and
[47:04.720 --> 47:07.720]  we're gonna we're gonna go the opposite direction of the town northwest of
[47:07.720 --> 47:11.960]  Austin and we're gonna drive through the middle of Austin from north Austin and
[47:11.960 --> 47:15.960]  they were right there on the big toll road that goes right out to a big highway
[47:15.960 --> 47:26.480]  straight shot directly to the town you know 55 60 miles away st. Angela and they
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.520]  went all the way down into south Austin and all the way down around south I
[47:32.520 --> 47:38.120]  mean the map quest and the Google Maps wouldn't program in that route normally
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.880]  new alternate routes it will not take the programmed route that's the route
[47:41.880 --> 47:48.080]  they took I have it on screen and that's just in Austin it when you back out you
[47:48.080 --> 47:51.360]  can see the map there and of course the the statesman doesn't show the road
[47:51.360 --> 47:58.480]  that's right up there in north Austin and goes right out to st. Angela and they
[47:58.480 --> 48:02.080]  did this to shut everything down because it's a Psyop they sat there
[48:02.080 --> 48:09.000]  experts at traffic control DPS command as they're called highway command you know
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.520]  getting their homeland security armored mobile pillboxes for us because we're
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.560]  the enemy with our tax money and gunboats with the you know giant in a
[48:16.560 --> 48:19.440]  machine gun arrays and they're out to fight drug smugglers when the
[48:19.440 --> 48:22.720]  government ship and the drugs in the fight smugglers didn't didn't wander
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.120]  their money with them they shut everything down as an exercise of power
[48:26.120 --> 48:33.320]  and see I know history so I know that kings in China and Japan and in in in
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.960]  Mayan cultures and in British culture and an ancient French culture and Roman
[48:37.960 --> 48:43.360]  culture they would shut roads the Romans would to mark the death of an
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.880]  emperor just everything stops you're gonna learn that we have the power when
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.440]  I was in London last time taking a tour so I was just using one of the open back
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.800]  buses to shoot some videos so I got the tour and when I got back I looked it up
[48:54.800 --> 49:01.240]  it was true they every week every day the queen shuts down different parts of
[49:01.240 --> 49:06.080]  the city and they say today these streets are closed she's exercising her
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.080]  divine right and and she owns the streets of London and is shutting down
[49:11.080 --> 49:16.160]  these major roads today and she shuts down the river Thames sometimes to
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.000]  exercise the power to show it's yours that you don't have right away that's
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.240]  an ancient common law and they let us know they said listen you're gonna pay
[49:27.240 --> 49:30.120]  respects and you know what they did kids everywhere because you hear there's
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.120]  gonna be a parade for an officer in the background you're like oh well that's
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.640]  nice and then you're like why is the whole city shut down I've got to pick
[49:37.640 --> 49:45.560]  my child up at this sporting thing he's at at four and instead it's six and your
[49:45.560 --> 49:51.840]  child is there in a field and no one can get to them and ambulances can't get
[49:51.840 --> 49:56.720]  there and people can't get to police calls and and people driving on I-35 of
[49:56.720 --> 50:00.560]  no idea what's going on and both sides are shut down it's just like the
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.440]  attitude of the police even everybody was like literally I heard this on the
[50:03.440 --> 50:11.280]  radio I heard them talking about it and it was it was like get used to it get

[54:06.560 --> 54:13.880]  hour then I'll hit Carmageddon in Austin Texas and the poor police chief had to
[54:13.880 --> 54:17.920]  cry every time the cameras got turned on all yesterday so I know that was rough
[54:17.920 --> 54:22.680]  on him we got some of this footage it's unbelievable I mean all I know is if I
[54:22.680 --> 54:27.400]  go buy a pair of cowboy boots you know I want the real alligator I don't want
[54:27.400 --> 54:32.360]  plastic ones and that's what this is it's plastic folks it's like it's like
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.240]  wax food you ever seen in a restaurant I'll have examples of their food at diners
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.120]  it's like man that piece of key lime pie looks really good or that chicken
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.000]  fried stick and that gravy looks real it isn't real and that's what's
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.000]  Kilmenis is this millimeter deep mile wide garbage all had no cattle because
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.200]  it's like war the worlds or something where it's this giant Psyop and I'm
[54:57.200 --> 55:01.520]  just fascinated by it because within this story it's just examples of
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.280]  everything else and that's what Edward Bernays the father of modern propaganda
[55:06.280 --> 55:09.800]  talked about he said you just launch a bunch of pageantry and you connect to
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.600]  that pageantry whatever message you want and then I I mean I'll guarantee you
[55:14.600 --> 55:17.560]  this this slain police officer everybody I know says was a really nice
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.320]  person I'll guarantee you if he could have seen what they did he would have
[55:22.320 --> 55:29.080]  been embarrassed and said do not do that oh we've got the North Korea footage
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.920]  yeah that's the fake crying in North Korea and basically the media told her
[55:33.920 --> 55:37.960]  by to come out and cry and that's what happened tens of thousands I think it
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.840]  was like hundreds at every overpass we're crying and waving American flags
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.160]  or waving Mexican flags and it's just like it's like my wife said it's very
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.520]  fascist it's like this isn't normal it's not normal in North Korea it's not
[55:50.520 --> 55:55.120]  normal here to take a route that shuts the whole city down and then yell at
[55:55.120 --> 55:59.160]  people that they're like man why are you doing this and then act like we're
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.400]  weird because it's like everybody's waving American flags listen we know
[56:02.400 --> 56:06.160]  we're in America you understand that what the flag symbolizes has basically
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.080]  been killed you're like oh that's extreme you want to actually follow what
[56:10.080 --> 56:13.240]  the country's founded on and why and why we're supposed to honor the flag as the
[56:13.240 --> 56:20.240]  symbol what the flag symbolizes is being killed and and and you get all these
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.560]  stores order their employees out like North Korea to put their hands over their
[56:24.560 --> 56:28.480]  heart just a big spectacle
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.600]  it's government worship I mean I mean they did they took okay I just can't
[56:36.600 --> 56:42.960]  handle it anymore oh my god and and and just I mean they were so desperate to
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.600]  have a martyr they now have big parades for dead dogs and again if you want to
[56:48.600 --> 56:52.200]  go to the parade go to the parade but no they said we're gonna make you sit in
[56:52.200 --> 56:55.440]  traffic for hours and not get your children and then we're gonna scream at
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.200]  you on the radio and everyone like it's North Korea is gonna say how dare you
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.080]  even question you don't do that in America you don't have Amish in America
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.160]  you don't refuse vaccines will take your kids with no law that's what I mean
[57:08.160 --> 57:12.600]  folks that they've now announced they're spying on everyone without warrants
[57:12.600 --> 57:16.400]  totally illegal and they just want you to know they're spying on you without
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.040]  warrants and I mean they didn't have police parades like this before that's
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.160]  what I mean people are like well you ought to think this is a good thing
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.400]  really why is it new what why do they do this now presidents didn't used to have
[57:29.400 --> 57:34.280]  a hundred car motorcades and block off huge areas of cities every time they
[57:34.280 --> 57:37.920]  flew into town police didn't used to wear black mask we didn't used to have
[57:37.920 --> 57:41.080]  checkpoints on our highways we didn't used to have a government shipping guns
[57:41.080 --> 57:43.880]  in the next cut of line the 2nd Amendment we didn't used to have 10,000
[57:43.880 --> 57:47.800]  plus percentage increase in pediatric cancers we didn't used to every public
[57:47.800 --> 57:52.040]  place I go to there's mentally retarded and autistic and children being
[57:52.040 --> 57:58.280]  damaged by vaccines all around me everywhere I go diabetes 3,000
[57:58.280 --> 58:03.600]  percentage increase we're a cursed nation and the veneer of it is go out and
[58:03.600 --> 58:09.160]  cry when a cop drives by you don't even know but when your neighbor's kid gets
[58:09.160 --> 58:12.760]  taken by the CPS for no reason your neighbor comes free for help you're
[58:12.760 --> 58:20.880]  like I'm sorry I just can't help you mile-wide millimeter D all had no cattle
[58:20.880 --> 58:25.560]  man and I'm tired of it it's disgusting and all cultures that are
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.800]  tyrannies are hallmarked by this North Korea type stuff in North Korea I was
[58:30.800 --> 58:34.520]  looking it up if they get somebody killed they do the same thing for police

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.120]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.640]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.200]  alex jones
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.720]  all right we're in hour number two I basically have pontificated about
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.760]  Carmageddon I haven't even gotten into it I have this focused info I want to go
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:45.880]  over in a focus presentation but it's just it's so it's so bad that we have a
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.760]  government that consciously sees us as programmable robots and that they try
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.560]  to manipulate us 24-7 and I more and more I realize the awakening and
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.840]  defeating tyranny is going to be about getting people to just recognize that
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.640]  they're being targeted they're being manipulated and that the people running
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.480]  things are predatory and do not have their best interests at heart does that
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.240]  mean everybody in the system is bad no but the major global corporate system is
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:19.920]  run by the most wicked of the most ruthless of the most degenerate and it
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.280]  just rolls downhill from that point on and we've got huge Trayvon Martinish
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.440]  and obviously a bunch of other stuff we got to go over and just tyranny popping
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:36.600]  up everywhere but and of course we launched the national movement to impeach
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  Obama that video has gone mega viral I should have been promoting that I'm just
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.920]  I'm devastated right now it's just it's so crazy Jim in Ohio Jim you're on the
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.680]  air welcome hey Alex good talk to you just want to let you know I'm a retired
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.840]  police officer and I couldn't agree with you more about what's going on with you
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:04.120]  every time a dignitary comes into town or law enforcement firemen dies
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:10.440]  whatever the case might be they just make a great big production out of it
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.480]  and I've been involved and on both sides of the police funeral thing both from
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:20.760]  being one of the cars in the funeral and being stuck sitting alongside the
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.120]  road waiting as a mile long procession goes by and by the way this was way
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.120]  over a mile this was like at one point they said like five six miles long I
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.400]  mean I'm telling you I've seen a lot of stuff it'd be one I mean and then it was
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.840]  the yelling at the public about it when people I mean most people didn't even
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.400]  know I mean it was just like everything was shut down can you imagine a town
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.240]  like Austin when they shut down the two biggest roads what what that I mean it
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.800]  was and you know how the public gets the reckless driving that starts I mean it
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.360]  was it was scary out there because I went out trying to get my son and couldn't
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.160]  get to him and it was people just driving like maniacs and there was no
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.360]  police to then even stop him I mean can you imagine what this looked like I can
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.200]  just imagine you know that kind of thing would take hours to recover from and
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.280]  who knows how many wrecks you know other incidents may have been caused
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.280]  because of it as people you know get frustrated and try and go other ways and
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.440]  get in a hurry and do things that they wouldn't normally do but you know just
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.240]  out of the sheer frustration of trying to get around something if they're in a
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:29.160]  hurry you get someplace who knows but yeah I I think it's a vast violation of
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  the people's rights to travel and it's just another case of the the people in
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.320]  the high high muckety mucks trying to say you know we're in charge and you're
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.360]  gonna honor us whether you want to or not well that's the thing is it was a
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.440]  giant stunt also not be able to get my son you know really just show and now
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.280]  they have these drills where they come take the kids to a federal center and
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.120]  won't tell the parents where they went I mean the government's really showing
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.160]  us hey we do what we want yeah I could see him stage and something like that
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.720]  and at the same time when when the parents get can't get there automatically
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.560]  having the CPS or somebody there to take all the kids and say well you didn't
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.400]  get them when you were supposed to so we took control yeah that's what I'm
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.400]  saying is that the people on top are predators and then and then the
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.720]  predators want to use the police the fire department everybody else that by
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.880]  large are servants and do a great job in many cases as a shield to make them
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.640]  look good and just to watch them use this dead officer like this I mean it's
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.360]  it's shameless it's it's and then I don't like having to come out and point
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.720]  this out and go against the hype but I mean it just was a frightening
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.440]  production I want to ask you as a retired police officer I think you said
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.640]  what your view is of the IRS when we come back stay there police sir I want to
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.920]  ask your view of them saying they're not gonna let you travel if you haven't
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.640]  paid your taxes I mean that folks is directly out of Stalinist Russia I mean
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.280]  it doesn't get any more bona fide than by the way that's now in the house it
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.560]  passed the Senate and we'll be back with Jim we've got a blue John Sean Glenn

[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.000]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:23.880]  look we've gotten totally distracted at least I have getting off into the fact
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.560]  that a police officer marine veteran well-liked fellow was killed by a crazy
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.520]  man on Xanax who had no criminal record in a Walmart and I talked about this
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.880]  last week there's no discussion in the media about the Xanax just like we know
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.720]  that the sergeant that killed all those people was in treatment and they've
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.920]  blocked releasing the records but the word is he was on psychotropic I mean
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.320]  most of the time when somebody just mindlessly kills somebody they're on
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.920]  mind-altering substances and it's hardly ever PCP which does cause that as well
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:03.040]  it's psychotropic in the same class so I'm just tired of the hollowness I'm
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.560]  tired of the fakeness now I'm gonna go back to your calls right now and then
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.480]  coming up obviously our courthouse source was wrong but the media had been
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.720]  saying that they weren't gonna charge him but I guess they chickened out and
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:20.360]  were worried about riots and so they have charged Zimmerman and now the mother of
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.000]  Trayvon Martin has come out and said she thinks it was an accident because now
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.520]  they're learning that he marched in black parades for for justice for people and
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.640]  stuff and was not who the new Black Panther Party that says they want to
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.680]  race war said Zimmerman was and they're gonna use it our source was right on
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.120]  that to go after the Second Amendment they thought it was gonna be some type of
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.880]  gun charge and they are now announcing will be part of the 2012 campaign to
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.080]  restrict the Second Amendment and the right of self-defense off this poor
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.720]  young man's death so that's coming up they're banning all over the country
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.200]  they're banning and restricting garage sales this is part of shutting down the
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.080]  economy what's left of it last week DHS raids home to seize deadly hair
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.040]  straighteners homeless security's just taking everything over that these
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.320]  threat fusion centers are illegal it's illegal to have the CIA involved
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.680]  domestically they don't care they just say yeah we're watching everything you
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.360]  do now CIA director yeah all the new appliances have devices that watch and
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.040]  listen to you I'd tell people that 10 years ago and get laughed at when I had
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.840]  the MIT reports just like they had a 1970s MIT report where they said they
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.360]  want to kill 90% of us now there's a new report out that finally got coverage I
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.880]  mean I know it sounds crazy okay I'm not the one that came up with all this I'm
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.160]  sorry it's made me I probably end praising in a way I mean I've gone
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.440]  crazy knowing this information it's all I think about I have no life all right
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.120]  sorry I'm going back to your calls it's just here's the new article because I
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.720]  wanted to cover that old article green police DHS launches environmental
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:11:00.120]  justice units and its homeland security federal
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.080]  environmental cops and by the way they're not gonna be out at you know BP
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.640]  when they're dumping stuff in the ocean or or docks and you having dumped by
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:15.600]  Monsanto no it's gonna be residential of course it is it's the same model in
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.200]  every country we know exactly what's coming because it's exactly what the
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.000]  globalists have done in England and Australia and Germany California is
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.800]  moving to ban single occupancy homes from being constructed this isn't a game
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.520]  first it's your toilets and your light bulbs and and your weather stripping all
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.880]  sounds reasonable next it's how many kids you can have okay this isn't a game I
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.800]  don't know how else I'm supposed to explain this to you and it's more divide
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.760]  and conquer this Trayvon Martin thing the police thing let me give a little
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.960]  message to the police out there the people running this government could
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.800]  care less about you in fact they don't like you they don't like enforcers
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.360]  trained to use force who live in the real world they want apathetic jellyfish
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.160]  TV heads that's why the new order hates with a capital H police and military I
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.880]  knew this before they released the documents that good police gave me
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.200]  federal and state have given me the documents that have been national news
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.640]  over and over again where they say returning veterans gun owners
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:25.080]  conservatives libertarians rural groups anybody who's self-sufficient so they
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.160]  hate farmers because they're self-sufficient they're natural humans to a
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.120]  certain extent they're afraid of wild humans folks that's how the globalists
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.440]  see us they they say they want us domesticated G cops you're part of a
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.320]  macho culture most of you didn't join to be bullies you joined it for excitement
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.000]  and you want to go after bad guys I get it or you're in the military you've got
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.120]  an adrenaline fix you know you want some excitement it's a macho culture I get it
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.760]  but the point you like guns great you think they like you know they don't like
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:03.320]  you the eugenicist pinhead control freak scientists hate your motorcycle they
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:08.520]  hate your Marine Corps tattoo they hate your granddaddy who was a farmer they
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.640]  hate you okay so when they have these big spectacles about how important you
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.640]  are and I see the videos the police all kind of looking you know right man this
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:22.920]  is a big deal they're doing here it's it's about using you in a Psyop for them
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:28.400]  this is not about the Carmageddon in Austin this is about propaganda I'm
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.560]  ranting let me ask you this question Jim you were making the point as a police
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.280]  officer some stations don't carry that first five minutes segment said to me
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.600]  interrupting make your points and then I want to ask you about the article that
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.160]  was in the LA Times Reuters you name it two days ago in fact guys we have time
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.080]  pull it up IRS Bill would would would would would ban out-of-country travel or
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.800]  take revoke the passport that's that's right on Nazi Germany Soviet Russia
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.760]  doesn't get any more I told you currency controls are coming capital
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.240]  controls I've seen it in the airport where guys got six silver coins and they
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.600]  try to take them and act like it's illegal diamond rings they're now
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.040]  asking about I mean this is internal checkpoints that's what the TSA is now
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.400]  fanning out on the highways this is one of the hallmarks I mean if you have a
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.560]  crown jewel you know the biggest crown jewel it it's it's it's casual society
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.120]  you've got to be in good steds to travel shutting down swap meat shutting
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.520]  down people selling strawberries on the side of the road I mean you want to live
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:36.560]  in martial law this is it corporate martial law as they shut the economy
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.240]  down to bankrupt you so they can consolidate okay I'm ranting it's just
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.600]  it's so hardcore and and now the Green Police and and the feds rating people
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.360]  for hair straighteners I mean it's happening Department of Education
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.160]  rating people for stuff that isn't even a crime of unpaid tuition remember that
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.800]  and they just said we're gonna start doing it they're like but there's no
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.240]  jurisdiction or no code there's not a law you don't even have law enforcement
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:09.440]  power this isn't even a crime they go we don't care I'm sorry I'm ranting sir I
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.040]  apologize it just this is why it's I'm going crazy what's your take on that
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.200]  Jim well I'm first off I share your frustration and it doesn't really
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.520]  surprise me about the thing with the IRS and passports I had heard about this
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.560]  coming up in the past but just the other day got an email from I think was
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:35.480]  world that daily that was mentioning the the bill that was pending and it's it's
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.360]  just one more thing where government is legislating away our constitutionally
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.360]  protected rights you have a right to travel and no law that's passed by
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.120]  anyone can negate that right yet they're still doing it and it would not
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.760]  surprise me to see it pass just like in Ohio we have a thing where if if someone's
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.080]  behind on their child support they can't get a driver's license granted people
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.360]  are giving up their God-given rights in exchange for state granted privileges
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.760]  every day just with driving with concealed carry and all that kind of
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:19.040]  stuff and the big difference here is a passport being withheld there's you
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.920]  know that's still a right to have and to be able to travel is still a right but
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.760]  for them to sit here and take that right away without any due process whatsoever
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.200]  based on an illegal agency saying or alleging that you owe something that you
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.160]  don't owe it just it's just you know flies in the fate of everything faced
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.400]  that everything is right but at the same time it's exactly what I would have
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.960]  expected from from this government because they're you know I think they
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.000]  must have meetings every day what rights can we attack today no that's come out
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.480]  actually they want to overthrow our ancient hard-fought rights that the
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.600]  flag and everything symbolizes and and people think oh we'll just take my
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.400]  rights out of the behind they don't get it the system wants to literally eat out
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.720]  your substance as the Declaration of Independence says and it will destroy the
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.840]  prosperity tyrannies make us poor they're humiliating and the globalists
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.360]  say they want to make us poor they say they want to do this to our country this
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.360]  is horrible our country is going in a guillotine right now and we see all the
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.160]  propaganda all the pageantry associated with a third-world dictatorship
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.480]  being heaped on here what do you make and and other police officers you talk
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:46.400]  about I mean that you talked to what do you make and your friends think of the
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:53.480]  government ordering mobile bulletproof checkpoint systems for the highways or
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.200]  ordering all these weapons arming all these agencies I mean government is
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.320]  clearly digging in for war with the people what do they think is going to
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.640]  come out of this or what's your take on that well most the ones I talked to are
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:14.800]  retired I retired 1996 and I have very I've got a couple of guys that are still
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.920]  on the job to go to my church but we haven't discussed this particular
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.480]  instance but most of the people I talked to are just appalled and they can't
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.400]  believe that it's actually happening there's no need for it there's no
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.160]  justification for it there's no constitutional support for it it's just
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.360]  a out-of-control government doing whatever it wants and the only thing
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.400]  that I think is going to solve the problem I think is for the people to
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:45.600]  stand up and say no we're not going to allow this to happen and I don't have
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600]  much faith in the election process anymore based on what I've seen over the
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.720]  years and so it's when the ballot box is just a
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.940]  unusable there's only one other box to go to and we all know what that is and I
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:04.720]  hate to say it but that's you know my personal belief at this point people
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.280]  are just going to have to stand up and and fight force with thought with force
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.680]  well and that's what the system knows it's going to that that's why they're
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.400]  getting all ready for war and I would just tell police and military everybody
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.280]  else this is not a fight they want to show up to because because nobody's
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.720]  going to win except the globalist unless the police and military stand down and
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.920]  we have that chelchescu moment but it's not one guy we've got to arrest we've
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.320]  got to arrest and I risk my life saying this but it's true the big six bank heads
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.080]  they've all got to be arrested mean they have engaged in corporate espionage of
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.680]  this country they've taken us over we're an occupied country and now they're
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:46.200]  moving to shut down our free speech and you know what Kennedy said about that
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.160]  thank you so much very cogent call there I'm blue John Shawn Glenn I'll get to
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.440]  y'all and and then later I'll try to a presentation on the Karmageddon but I've
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.640]  already pretty much covered it we'll be right back stay with us
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.040]  that's what it sounds like on a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.320]  that looks like no one is home don't let your home be the next target make it

[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.080]  this ball rolling even faster I will say the video that accompanies it has gone
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:34.760]  particularly viral keep it up folks great job coming up after I take some
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.720]  more calls show folks this headline and I've saw this case a few weeks ago when
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.480]  it first broke and I've seen similar cases where they make the autistic kids
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:52.600]  now one in 50 something wear these taser belts and now they just taser them
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.560]  for any reason in fact we scroll back up I can read the headline to folks there
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.240]  it says tortured terrorized and abused shocking new video shows disabled boy
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.840]  strapped down and shocked 31 times at school by his own laughing teachers for
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.640]  seven hours well it's fun to shock and torture people that's what we're all
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:20.680]  being taught we're being taught ugliness and pain of innocence is fun we're like
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.560]  the Roman Empire ladies and gentlemen there's video of them in the restraint
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.680]  torturing him with enjoyment that the schools are death camp prisons where
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.920]  they administered the vaccines without parental consent all over the country they
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.240]  take your kids without even a writ without anything I mean it's all that's
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.560]  why I'm freaked out it's getting so lawless and when they lose the lawsuit
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.360]  they just pay with our own tax money all right I'm ranting I wish we could turn
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.440]  this country around we're only gonna do it by admitting how bad we've gotten
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.000]  myself included blue and Tennessee you're on the air go ahead thank you
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.800]  Alex well I do believe that we have one other vote besides the ballot and that is
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.000]  the vote with your dollar and when I say that it's an idea that I've prepared we
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.040]  need to occupy the media we need to inundate the media your local in your
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.920]  local community with your information earn it to a DVD send it to the station
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.240]  along with articles and then if they start reporting the truth have a march on
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:29.480]  your media choose ABC CBS NBC and talk by the way I agree solution wise national
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.440]  media gets a little attention especially if you shoot it yourself put it on
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.480]  YouTube so regardless it gets covered because that's the new dominant media I
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.480]  mean soon they're not gonna be dominant anymore in fact in many cases they're
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.040]  not but going to local media sending them articles sending them films bringing
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.640]  up topics you want covered on a weekly basis it'll start happening with talk
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.160]  radio and that's how you you lobby for freedom you lobby for real issues to be
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  covered and you have your voice heard but you also then if they don't listen to
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.400]  you get it or you don't care what's five of you go bullhorn the local media I
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.080]  mean let them know go ahead with the sign that just simply says we know where
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.880]  you work you live in our community we're no longer asking for you to tell us the
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:22.040]  truth we're demanding that you tell the truth and then you go and you start
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.720]  contact six contacting the local advertisers and telling them that you
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.760]  will not purchase from them as long as they continue to advertise on this
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:35.600]  station once the advertisers put the pressure on the TV station or the radio
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.640]  station that they're going to pull their ads because they're getting heat from
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:45.160]  the public that will put the pressure on the local media to use it I think I
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  agree with you but expanding on that take take CBS here in Austin we played
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:57.480]  the clip probably 200 times I won't play it today but you can search it on
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:03.320]  YouTube it's mercury good for children's brains and it'll come up but but this was
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.280]  a package produced at CBS broadcast center in Manhattan and then they send
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.840]  the video down the feed and then the local voices it most your news that's
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.800]  not local you know that you see is a local face but they didn't they didn't
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:22.520]  write it that's the teleprompter control and my point is this just didn't air in
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.440]  Austin it aired on every CBS affiliate in the country that decided to go with
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:33.120]  that package they were sent they don't have to go with it but they had sent to
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.760]  them so it aired on most of them and it said mercury is good for children's
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:42.120]  brains and helps them behave themselves and in a sick way that's true the
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.960]  globalists think your brain is good when there's rod holes in it your brain
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.320]  damaged so for them it said it's good for your brain well for them it's good
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.560]  you know for Charlie Manson cutting babies out of women is a good thing I
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.920]  mean it doesn't mean it's good for normal people but for Charlie Manson that's
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:02.040]  that's a good day so so see it's all from there it's all little sick games but
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.600]  but my issue is that local news director should have gone mercury is good for
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.760]  kids brains now we're not running this they've also got some contracts with
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.760]  stations where it's must-air especially what's owned by CBS but most are in the
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.680]  point is it's all the major channels anything else ma'am yes I never seen
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.800]  that and their local communities need to do I did this myself personally I saw
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:36.120]  some anomalies in the voting here in Tennessee and so I actually made an
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.240]  appointment I went to the election commission to look at all 92 polling
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.240]  tapes from the night I only heard the rest of this by the way I forgot to tell

[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:04.240]  word a lot the magnitude the the magnitude of how much trial just got
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.480]  shells folks we're in a lot of trouble do you know where this road leaves these
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.560]  are really bad people they don't want to just rob and be boss hogs and in charge
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:18.640]  they want total control over your reproductive system over your land over
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.320]  your family you know take this new thing in fact you can show a photo of Mitt
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.880]  Romney's family if you want Mitt Romney's got five sons what is it 30 something
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.200]  grandkills I mean I forget it's some giant number 16 grandkids I forget and
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.200]  they have this Democratic consultant top consultant saying that she never worked
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:47.320]  a day in her life you can just search the photo the you know the entire family
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.640]  and I'm not this is even about Mitt Romney the globalist you know the big
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:38:05.560]  banker the point is that here's a woman with five sons and she said I chose to
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.600]  stay home with my family I that you know that was my job and the media and
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.040]  Miss magazine that was run by the CIA back in the 60s said women you're scum
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:25.320]  if you're at home so go out and get a job so your kids can be at school full
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:29.760]  time so the state can be the mommy and the daddy and now our families have
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.880]  broken up society is degenerated in every metric people are not anywhere as
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.800]  happy as they were in the 50s and 60s people work longer hours women are
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:46.920]  treated like absolute trash but they implied women didn't have value if they
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.040]  raise their children well you know what most women didn't raise their children
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.440]  because they wrecked the society once you get most the women wanting to work
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.720]  now everybody's got to pay taxes the prices change it killed the old economy
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:07.320]  we had and so now yeah that's an earlier photo there's a new one I saw all over
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:12.240]  the news today just it's just everywhere just just just type in Romney family
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.440]  they're all wearing blue striped shirts it doesn't matter you know the TV part
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.040]  of this show is such a small part and and then it ends up dominating everything
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.160]  because I'm always over there looking at it wanting to document everything for
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.680]  people that are watching on prison planet TV you know the nightly news it's all
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.920]  about TV and TV only and we sit her on the fly but you know showing people the
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.840]  information you know and and sometimes it causes hiccups here but you know my
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.360]  point is that it's good though because even though the TV audience is a fraction
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.040]  of the millions of radio listeners it creates a documented record of
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:56.160]  everything I'm talking about so so that's a good aspect or dimension to what
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:08.200]  we do here on air now getting back to this Mitt Romney situation America's
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.040]  woken up to a great extent America over and all is becoming more libertarian
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.480]  more constitutional more mistrustful of government that it's been in its entire
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.160]  history since our founding all the studies and polls show that 9% approval
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:23.720]  rating for Congress abortion is now overwhelmingly unpopular
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.440]  the numbers are basically flipped depending on which study you look at
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.320]  it's it's roughly 67% were for abortion when they did Roe v. Wade being told it
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.560]  was just a blob and when wasn't human and the media was able to sell that with
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.160]  a trust they still had now it's 65 to 70% against abortion and with young
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:48.080]  people I've seen numbers over 90% so the globalists are desperate to get all
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.520]  this through right now because they're control freaks and they hate humanity
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.000]  they hate life and they hate you openly and they hate our industrial society so
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.800]  they poison us while posing as the savers all day that's the look at who's
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.840]  staying there the hero folks in the system and then look at actually what
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.480]  they're doing investigate that's all I'm saying is investigate investigate me
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.400]  investigate false claims against us you really investigate so you find out 99%
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.920]  of stuff is not true about me investigate others though and investigate
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:28.960]  yourself it's so important and just don't be so trusting and get your common
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:35.360]  sense back or if you never had it go read what the founding fathers wrote go
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.960]  discover common sense because because common sense is is is is reemerging
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.560]  right now and the system doesn't like it but because you know 30 years ago when
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:51.240]  when the CIA on record this is now declassified hired Gloria Steinem to
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.920]  have Ms. magazine they put her on all the shows telling women your husband's a
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.280]  pig he's a piece of garbage he hates you he's suppressing you he's dominating
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  you you know you you're gonna be happy when you're wearing the pants you know
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.600]  make your son sit on the toilet women should be in frontline combat you know
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:14.080]  men or trash and women are you happy now do you like what you got it's cold
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.300]  social engineering to literally destroy the family and California is set to pass
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:23.080]  a law banning new construction of single family homes just like Germany has now
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.800]  done you're like well that's crazy that's tyranny yeah it moves real quick
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:36.000]  it takes a while to grow it's kind of like a 14 year old people made jokes for
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.960]  four four or five years ago when the New York Times came out and said you know
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.240]  they're training Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled vets and kill them and
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.200]  showed photos of it I'd already told you that was going on people didn't believe
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.440]  it but there it was oh it's wonderful Scouts trained to fight terror and more
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.560]  main mission killing veterans that won't turn their guns in first paragraph of
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:01.640]  the article people made jokes I'd kill those 14-year-olds oh really you would
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:14.640]  think so those 14-year-olds are now 18 the best soldiers are 18 to 20 years old
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:23.160]  because they're mean they're young and they think they're bulletproof like a
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.120]  lot of militaries would send 12-year-olds into the particularly deadly
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:33.920]  missions because they have fun doing it I mean I remember when I was 13 I was
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:41.400]  vicious vicious vicious because I was coming in to my manhood and all the
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:46.400]  synapses were firing and I was put in positions to be able to explore that and
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:54.200]  I loved it the exhilaration it's the same thing with tyranny people like oh that
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:59.960]  little thing that's not now it's big it's big now and folks it's growing fast
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:05.600]  it is shedding its skin into the final phase all right I got to go to your
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.840]  calls it's just that they come out now and they say how pathetic she never
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.720]  worked a day in her life can't believe she's a stay-at-home mom what a piece of
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:20.840]  deal basically that doesn't work anymore does it you know all these women do who
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.800]  want to be executives all of them that I've seen they go out they're 40 years
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.880]  old they got the power they got boy toys everything they want a man they want
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.240]  kids and then they want to dominate the man still but then they're not happy in
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:39.160]  that and and it's not just women I'm not bashing women women and men make the
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:44.560]  species we're literally joined just like the egg of a sperm join and make the
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.520]  zygote and then all those calculations that's magic ladies and gentlemen we're
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.480]  the dominant species on this gorgeous planet together we are humanity there
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.040]  is no man or woman and the system wages war against that are there things that
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:05.600]  men do yeah men dominate each other and kill each other but the point is is that
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.360]  we look at this attack this is an attack on women this wasn't done to empower
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.400]  women it's like ever-branage put ads in newspapers and paid all the top
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:18.320]  feminists to smoke cigarettes and newsreels and in radio interviews and
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:24.080]  prints and to call it liberty liberty smokes I knew it caused lung cancer to
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.800]  march with the cigarettes lit and all the women ran out and got their cigarettes
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.800]  how sexy was it when your grandma was all hooked up to those tubes as they were
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.840]  cutting organs out of her from the cigarettes a few years ago how sexy is
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.040]  Edward Bernays now and Gloria Steinem
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:45.560]  Gloria Steinem what she's got a bunch of kids and a man she likes she likes she
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:49.440]  likes putting her arm in her husband's arm and walking a step behind him women
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.640]  like that on average women that are happy and it's it's it and it's I mean
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:59.160]  you ever seen deer a doe will walk a little bit off behind the buck whales do
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:05.240]  that it's what mammals do it's what we do women want the smart dynamic powerful
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.840]  man but the media says that they want some little boy toy who's who's who's
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:16.640]  metrosexual and does what he's told now that's not what women are looking for
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:21.760]  okay and so the media puts out this image to the young men I see the young
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:28.680]  men imitating it act metrosexual act weak act stupid act dumb act foolish act
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.880]  act like a sitcom character and you're gonna get all the babes and the guys
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.800]  don't get the babes it's a subconscious thing I don't even conscious most of them
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:43.160]  so they act stupider they act weaker they act dumber they act noncommittal they
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.080]  they watch more sports they they were more baseball caps they they act more
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:52.160]  arrested and man that's not what women are looking for you're a man on a mission
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.200]  who's got things going on you're thinking about things and you're not
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:01.040]  thinking about the skirts the skirts don't even have to know who you are
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.960]  they immediately be lined straight at you and I'm just trying to talk to the
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.640]  men out there and the feminist would say don't call women skirts well my
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:18.200]  goodness my goddess whatever it's a power game women want to look good and
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.920]  want to have that power but they don't want you to point it out it's all just
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:27.360]  games stop playing the games women and men be the humans you are be powerful
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.600]  build each other up so this attempts oh you threw the old oh it's pathetic she
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.360]  raised five boys and all these grandchildren and that's the most
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:41.520]  important job there is you notice it hadn't been getting done and it's not
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.440]  just by the women the men are more to blame in this country for buying into
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.640]  being absent buying into the gangster culture that it's cool to get women
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.880]  pregnant and sit back and laugh that old gangster culture came when the
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.440]  government said how do we kill these black people and how do we break them
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:59.680]  down they got their own businesses they're you know they're they got their
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.520]  own universities they're really getting strong they should pose as their friends
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.280]  give them a Trojan horse a gift tell the women you get money don't have a man
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.400]  in the house then create enmity with others who aren't on welfare pointing it
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.320]  out and watch these people and the family disappear and they've gone to
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.760]  almost was it 90 plus percent illegitimacy from 20 30 40 percent whites
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.040]  are now following the same line everybody else is they are turning us
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:35.160]  into mindless jellyfish who don't grow up seeing their dad work hard and and and
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:39.360]  be strong and do things that are right
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.040]  that's what they've done to us and where mama's not there the kids are you know
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.240]  get home at six mama goes makes dinner daddy makes dinner pizza comes whatever
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:56.200]  do some laundry mama's exhausted because it's an unnatural life it's stressful
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.960]  enough with three or four kids at home having to run everything and having to
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.480]  get everything in order and trying you know or to have a little business on the
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:14.240]  side that's what women have always traditionally done but that culture is
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:17.840]  all gone you know where daddy gives mama the paycheck and she handles the
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.280]  banking and runs the house and mama's the strength of the house and daddy goes
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:24.800]  out in the world it's all gone and what's left of it's being mopped up and
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.760]  people now as they see freedom and everything good going down the drain
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:32.040]  they're reaching back on oh maybe that isn't so bad oh see it's you don't know
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.640]  what you got so it's gone oh I sold everything out for glorious diamond the
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:43.240]  CIA wait wait no no no don't know and see you're gonna look back on the
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.560]  freedoms we had now and go no I want that back and it's gonna be ten times
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:52.640]  harder to get that's what said I just see like they were watching when he bleed
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.760]  to death I've seen somebody bleed to death when the ambulance was getting
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.200]  there from a car wreck they died by the time they got in the ambulance they're
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.920]  pretty much gone and the blood's coming out you know people trying to put
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.280]  something on it and you see them they're out there they're still alive they got
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.400]  the fire of humanity in their eyes and then you see them it's not just that
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.080]  they're passing out you know you see them and they're like and you see them
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:16.760]  fight you know the body knows it's in trouble and they're like and then the
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.120]  adrenaline hits they're okay for a while and then it's kind of and they're
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.040]  gone they're dead already and I'm just watching America the blood's like was

[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:08.920]  all right let's try to get back to your phone calls I am long-winded but it's
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:12.680]  important information by the way we do have our reporters Darren McBrain and
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:19.080]  Marcos Morales coming on they went to the city outside Atlanta where the man
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.760]  was killed because they were basically buying up the property in an area to
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.280]  make it a green space for a 1021 and his little piece of property was the last
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.360]  piece so they harassed him to not have chickens anymore you know he'd been there
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:36.120]  for a long time and it was grandfathered it was on the edge of the town and his
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.440]  house blew up and he's dead after having his chickens killed and by somebody and
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.640]  they and the people just want us to say we shouldn't investigate and the police
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:47.280]  came in and said get out of the city hall and we said well we're just here
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.440]  filming and you know here to talk to people they said you have to have an
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.120]  appointment to come and city hall so that's the new America so that's coming
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:00.360]  up with our reporters on that subject here in just a moment real quick
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.400]  finishing up with blue and Tennessee then I got to go to John and KJ and
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:14.080]  and Sean his home the longest Glenn I will be after blue and then John blue
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.480]  go ahead and finish your story you said you went and tried to document some
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:22.600]  election fraud in Tennessee and what happened to you well I actually made
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.480]  an appointment at the election commission to look at all 90 review all
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:32.000]  92 poll tapes from the night of the election and upon arrival they printed
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.280]  out a thousand page document for me to review they would not allow me to look
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.480]  at the poll tapes and they tried to incinerate me putting me in a room with
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.800]  three very large men well that's standard procedure that's the freedom of
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:48.480]  America because because again if people knew the criminality in government it
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:51.960]  would make their head spin it's a big business and they're robbing us and
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:54.880]  they're not gonna stop and they're gonna raise the property taxes and they're
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:59.280]  gonna take our property and then move into it and exempt themselves that's a
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.040]  new thing they're doing and they're not gonna let us travel and we're their
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.840]  slaves I appreciate your call until we decide we don't want to be we're back
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:11.840]  where our forebears were in 1776 John in Wyoming you're on the air thanks for
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.800]  holding yeah Alex a couple of quick items first of all they showed on I'm
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:22.240]  in Sheridan Wyoming and we get cable not a Rapid City South Dakota as well as
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.160]  Casper Wyoming and one of the Rapid City stations showed their SWAT team and
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:32.440]  hostage rescue team conducting exercises you know getting prepared for
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.000]  something and then the Casper station showed the Cheyenne Wyoming police
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.720]  department doing the same thing so something is I think brewing here also
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.880]  let's discuss briefly if you don't mind what you and I talked about on George
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:53.040]  Norrie's program back on the morning of March 20th that a year ago the NRA in
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:58.240]  the American Rifleman published a notice that home man security had contracted
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:03.640]  with Winchester to purchase 200 million rounds of 40 Smith and Wesson ammo and
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:12.080]  now they just bought 450 more million now now another 450 million from ATK which
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:16.200]  is the parent company of federal carpet cartridge corporation of Minnesota and
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:23.640]  Spear CCI of Lewiston Idaho so 650 million rounds of 40 Smith and Wesson
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:30.120]  which is what all the federal agencies carry US Marshals FBI CIA customs
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.080]  border patrol all of them and I'm wondering that's more than two rounds
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.520]  for every man woman and child in the United States gee I wonder what they're
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:43.640]  planning to do with all of that ammunition well all I can tell them is
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:50.640]  good luck because just because they can you know tell the public to all stand
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.200]  out for a dead police officer which I think is fine and then the public shows
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:58.840]  up because they're good people the system gets much more tyrannical and
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.800]  starts physical fights I would not want to be one of the minions of the system
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:11.120]  I mean this is this is the Hutzpah filled bravada filled New World Order that
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:14.600]  makes 40 to 1 bats at MF global other people's bank accounts I mean the
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:18.200]  bankers set offshore and they're incredibly arrogant and they've bitten
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:22.000]  off more than they can chew what do you think's going on yeah well they're
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.280]  getting ready to do to do something because the reason why I think the
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:31.080]  national media is trying to precipitate a race war here with this Dravon
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.760]  Martin case is so Obama can declare martial law and then start picking up
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:40.280]  the fire oh bingo there they're looking at doing it

[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:51.160]  reporters coming up here in about 10 minutes or so from Roswell Georgia where
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.440]  they went to investigate the mysterious death of a man had been
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:59.720]  harassed because they wanted his property as part of a green space zone
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:08.160]  part of a Jenna 21 over by over by Rob Dews house here in Austin they FEMA made
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.040]  people tear down all their nice houses turning into a green zone that no one's
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.200]  allowed on to it's just a raw exercise power that's what the government does

[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:33.320]  the last caller was bringing up all the hundreds of thousands of weapons the
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.520]  government's bought and the hundreds of millions of rounds they're buying to
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.880]  use against the American people and all the other things they're doing the
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:48.320]  government's buying bulletproof checkpoints that are mobile I mean this
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.960]  is this is a full-on armament system like when Germany was arming before
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.960]  World War two or other systems it's a huge arms build up trainings build up
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:05.040]  for the American people with spies and tattletale squads and mobile prisons and
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.920]  checkpoints and they're always going it's for al Qaeda it's for al Qaeda and
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:14.400]  you look it's not it's for us the government was taken over by foreign
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.320]  banks I don't know how else I can explain it and it's not like the police and
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.840]  military they're gonna be asked to carry the sound are gonna be winners in it
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.280]  you're gonna be carrying out the wrecking of America so it can be
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.520]  consolidated into the North American Union you're going to be it's equivalent
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.080]  of a cop you know being on board a bass boat with you and it's their bass boat
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.440]  and your bass boat you co-own it and the cop shoots it shoots it with a
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:41.840]  shotgun and blows a hole in the bottom and sinking and he says I'm sinking your
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:49.320]  boat ha ha ha and you're like Bob it's your boat too man what's the you see
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.520]  that
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.520]  Glen and Marilyn thanks for holding her on the air hi Alex first time call a
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.240]  long-time listener how are you I'm alright it's just things are getting
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.960]  crazy it's all getting really crazy listen I just want to make a few quick
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:13.520]  comments on this police parade yesterday it wasn't only a power grab but it also
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.760]  sets the precedent for it to happen in other states if it had happened in a
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.200]  city like Dallas or something I would say who is the movies that they don't
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:27.040]  rob the Federal Reserve and then they had happened during the police parade the
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:32.760]  second issue I wanted to bring up was when this Trayvon shooting occurred the
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:37.160]  first thing I said they're going to use this for gun control grab and then try
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.680]  to turn it into a race war and sure enough two days later they try to turn
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.480]  it into a race war and the gun grabs my last point was I was doing some
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.960]  investigative journalism last year concerning some of the government
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:55.280]  black ops projects and how they led up to where we were where we are today well
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:59.280]  nine o'clock at night I get a phone call and they ask for a gentleman I said
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.520]  no nobody he lives here by that name they say is this our MK ultra and
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.200]  associates I said no this is a private home says well do they have a name they
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.200]  ran off another couple of names it wasn't until I hung up the phone that I
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:18.000]  realized what this phone call was all about I did a star 69 the call could not
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.920]  be recalled called back and it led to my suspicions that I was onto something and
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:28.920]  they were attempting to intimidate me by using keywords that they knew I would
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:34.080]  catch on no exactly that's it that that is exactly what feds or private contractors
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.320]  will do they don't like we must have gotten close to something big stay there
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.640]  I want to come back and finish up your story I mean I've been sitting there in
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:50.280]  front of my crew and a number doesn't even show up my cell phone rings and they
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.520]  say things to me or they do it to my wife and that's the exact type of stuff
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:05:02.880]  they do right there we'll be right back right now the average family spends one

[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:05.200]  of it anymore okay we were just talking to a gentleman Glen in Maryland and he
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:08.800]  was raising his points about the Trayvon Martin thing saying day one he thought
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.600]  it was going to be used to create racial division racial paranoia on all
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.520]  different sides so the referee of the government can divide and conquer and
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.160]  play the part of the savior and then he was getting into being an investigative
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:26.040]  journalist he's the other callers he was doing some investigation and got this
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:30.840]  phone call saying yes this MK ultra yes this that's exactly the kind of stuff
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.480]  the feds or contractors do I've gotten those calls yeah I was in fact I think
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.960]  I've even gotten one of those calls yeah I was calling about the MK ultra new
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:44.120]  world order yeah of course this is an unlisted number at the time the times
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:48.280]  it's happened and then by the way that little white dog in your backyard that's
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:53.440]  real nice oh yeah running back and forth from the sliding last door this
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.960]  actually happened to my wife one time similar things happen to me it's like I'm
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.080]  gonna get you and cut your head off you know because they'll try to throw or the
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:07.600]  favorite one is women calling your wife and say hi is Alex there no he's not

[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.920]  times and the point is the number won't even show up on caller ID and then
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.040]  they'll say I hope your mother dies or hope your dad is in the hospital dies you
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:51.000]  I mean so they're listening on the phone because multiple times I've had it
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.520]  happen my wife's had it happen imagine I'm there protesting Builderburg
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.920]  Builderburg's ended it's full of NSA all the spy gear I've walked into the gift
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:01.920]  shop right before they shut the hotel down the day they were arriving that
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:07.760]  morning and the door opened he's a Star Wars analogy I was like C-3PO in Cloud

[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:26.040]  now you got to get that other dignitary on there oh wait wait the ambassador yeah
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:29.520]  we got it hatch it into upstairs then they had like every conceivable area
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  would just spy gear everywhere they had the conference rooms being loaded with
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:37.240]  it they're all these military guys and playing clothes everywhere and I'm
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.200]  sitting there for like 10 minutes getting my Gatorade because they get because they're
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:45.360]  like the you know the cooler was right there okay my guys are on Skype I got
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.560]  to go to them I'm out of control the point is I've just seen so much crazy
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.360]  stuff and they're arguing with each other about no you know no no no you got
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:00.680]  to break into his cell phone with this satellite and I'm listening to it what's

[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:09.320]  this system you got to use this satellite and I'm just listening to them
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:14.080]  spying on people illegally right there and after a while they figured it out
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:19.560]  and got up and slammed the door but but I mean they're just so used to the
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:23.240]  zombie but but that's a side issue the reason I got off into that story is you
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.400]  know it all broken up we're at the steakhouse Aaron Dykes was there and my
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.280]  wife's like oh my my dad or was it her mom no it was her dad at the time they

[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.240]  she was pregnant or they also call it and say I've given women diseases that's
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:15.000]  another one that's an angry woman calls them about the disease and it's just all
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.400]  to mess with your family it's like right out of the film JFK those are true
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.120]  stories what happened to Garrison and they get your kid on the phone to they
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:25.920]  get your kid to answer the phone they'll try to creep them out because these are
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:32.800]  cowardly un-American anti-human scum who sold out to the bankers and I think it's
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:37.240]  funny to call up make fun of somebody's dad who's in the hospital okay enough for

[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.200]  the story but he told the story about how he was doing some investigative work
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.560]  and they would call them do that and yes that's how it works and if it
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.280]  intimidates you next they're gonna beat you up in your parking lot but if you

[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:12.560]  it state ceases property under green zoning laws terrorizes man to death we
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.600]  didn't hear the story until he died and we've got our crew there on the ground
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:19.560]  with a live video feed of the burnout little farmhouse they'd already been
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.760]  grabbing the land up to it for a UN biological diversity zone which they
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:27.440]  of course later would build on undoubtedly that's how it works they'd
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:31.800]  harassed him since oh wait he kept winning over and over and over again
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.360]  that he was allowed to have chickens because it was on the edge of the town
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:39.480]  and grandfathered and they weren't gonna put up with that so they came to take
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:46.680]  the property and it blew up and you see blast holes in the top of the house and
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.440]  the government wants us to just out of the gates within five minutes no foul
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:54.600]  play he killed himself that's the way it is so somebody comes to my house and
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:00.040]  blows it up I want an investigation okay I'm not blowing my house up if somebody
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.240]  says I slip and fall you know break my head open I want an investigation if I'm
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:08.160]  found dead in the hotel room with a hooker with a heroin elamar don't use

[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:16.760]  either but but they won they've they've you know they've they've got their green
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:19.800]  zone now of course now they're just saying they may just sell it in the
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.080]  city may do something with it now oh not gonna be a green zone now I guess
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:27.640]  that's the latest Darren McBreen and Marcos Morales reporting from the ground
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:32.400]  there in Roswell Georgia where the tyrants have landed they're not little
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.920]  green men they're little little bureaucrats with armed police defending
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:41.320]  them so they can carry out their operations another victory on the
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  homeland front against a wicked man for many many years raising a few chickens
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:50.200]  in his backyard and but he's been dealt with Darren McBreen that you're there
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:54.800]  at the site of the evil evil a chicken man as the police calling thank you for
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.920]  joining us yeah actually Alex the entire community calls him the chicken man but

[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.480]  for raising chickens well he's dead now so please continue so they've had a
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.280]  victory tell us what happened well you know as you know he tragically died
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:18.760]  on March 26th following an explosion that took place right here at his home
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:24.200]  and this was during when you know the county marshals were here to forcibly
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.280]  evict him from his property and this was to enforce the new green zoning laws
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.600]  and he did not comply but you know that the whole history of this thing goes

[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:37.440]  operates but what they want it turned out a bunch of people were keeping
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.120]  chickens it was very popular it's a semi rural area what changed with the
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:46.800]  chicken man and the person that's now dead and tell us what you've learned
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:51.400]  about his death I mean isn't leaning towards a suicide that they drove into
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.920]  his death or is there foul play tell us what the police did Darren when you were
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:59.720]  there well we haven't seen any you know signs have heard anything about you know
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.960]  foul play you know it is very suspicious though there has been a police
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.240]  presence here since we got here when we showed up at the property this morning
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:14.000]  you know a police car drove by slowed down took a look at us we didn't think
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:19.100]  too much about it until we went to City Hall and we simply just attempted to
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:24.040]  walk in there you know Marcos first went inside to see you know if we're at
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.920]  the right place and if we could talk to someone from the city council well the
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:33.080]  the media spokesperson pretty much told him that he wasn't allowed in Marcos
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:36.960]  came out told me that and I said well you know what let's grab the camera let's
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:42.320]  go in there by the time we grab the camera cop pulls it up immediately says
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:46.840]  you know you are not not allowed to enter turn your cameras off at which we
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.280]  refuse to do so and the next thing you know we're surrounded by two other
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:53.720]  police officers on the street in America you don't have a camera you better
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.520]  watch it in places like Illinois life in prison for filming police there's no law
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:02.240]  but they got juries that will send a ham sandwich to the gas chamber so first
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.800]  they said you don't have your you don't have cameras in America okay well yeah
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:10.960]  we naturally schooled the police officers on our you know our on our
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.640]  rights you know that we refuse to turn the cameras off said look you're a
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.400]  public servant you know we're gonna videotape if we want to and by the way
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.360]  you have your dash camera running so we're gonna keep our cameras rolling
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:26.320]  what do you think of that so we had this exchange for a while they demanded that
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:30.560]  they see our credentials what what and that's ridiculous you know because yeah
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:34.640]  like like like like you've got to be with ABC or CBS but it doesn't matter
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:39.200]  they always act like credentials or your that's what the state police called our
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:43.480]  local am affiliate 590 and and kept calling random people trying to get
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:49.040]  somebody to say I didn't work there and that I was dishonest one time when they
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:53.400]  said where are you on the radio we said well locally 590 so that they could then
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:57.840]  put in a file we've now learned that that we masquerade we're not we're not
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:02.200]  media and we're not on 590 in the state police file because I've talked to
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:06.480]  folks internally that's what that was because they say so their file says
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.040]  we're not on the radio Darren well you know and I explained to them that City
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.520]  Hall in Austin Texas where we are from that we're you know we're able to walk
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:19.960]  up the steps with a camera so is the average citizen and but they flat out
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.700]  refused to let us in they did give us a phone number of someone we could call you
[02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:27.840]  know basically gave us a run around did you ask him what the law was that that
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:33.040]  that media or random citizens traveling through cannot enter obviously a public
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.360]  building was it marked that it's not public no absolutely not listen listen
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.920]  this is pure color of law they're acting very suspicious you got a dead guy and
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:46.560]  they don't want to talk to you and the police are trying to violate your first
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.600]  amendment and you're right for redress of grievances to go in a public building
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:56.160]  this yeah it just sounds pretty bad Darren well in interestingly enough when
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:01.000]  the police officers left it wasn't but a few minutes later that and we got this
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  on video a family showed up they walked up the steps and began taking pictures
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.120]  and no one came out and told them they couldn't do otherwise and the cop with
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  there's a cop car sitting right there watching them do it so right after we
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.120]  weren't allowed to go in a family shows up and gets their pictures taken in
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:26.080]  front of City Hall well I'm not telling you to go in there but they tried to
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.800]  arrest you for disorderly conduct or whatever you'd have a major lawsuit and
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:33.200]  we are suing Pittsburgh right now over dues arrest I'm not telling you guys to
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:36.840]  go get arrested but I think if I was there I probably would have just gone in
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:43.200]  hmm I mean those guys are just just out of their jurisdiction that I mean they
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:48.520]  are violating your rights they basically barricaded us with three cop cars to
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:52.680]  block our entrance and we were quite a few what do you say Marcos football
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:57.240]  filled away from from the stairs you know they stopped us man I mean as soon
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:01.240]  as we started and making the move to go towards those steps they pulled up one
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:06.120]  cop first and then the next two were you know quickly quickly followed and
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:10.880]  they weren't they were not gonna have it yeah that's called Terry does Marcos
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:14.920]  want to say anything Marcos you want to add to it Marcos is really good by the
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:19.000]  way he he would not turn that camera off and he knows his right now you guys did
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.960]  a great job I just can't believe what tyrants these guys are and I was very
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:26.240]  surprised the Federal Reserve was a half mile away from their own building we're

[02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:08.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:13.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:17.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:25.680]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:29.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:33.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:41.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:04.480]  you
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:54.560]  Well Andrew Wardis is dead.
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:59.200]  Couple days ago the police came to take him out of his house, said he was taking it and
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:07.600]  it blew up and they're currently Marcos, Marcos Morales joining us and also Darren
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:12.160]  McBreen there in Roswell, Georgia where you're not allowed to get near the city council building
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.160]  and not allowed to enter.
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:18.400]  There's no law but they got guns, it's called tyranny, hell like where the police chief
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.560]  fired the mayor and everybody out in courtside declared himself supreme ruler.
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:24.200]  I mean and he's still there.
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:28.440]  The state government said, you bet.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:32.920]  I'm telling you this country is turning into a nightmare and I just want to try to reverse
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:38.080]  all this and recognize it's only going to get worse, it's not going to get better.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.120]  These people are out of control.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:41.120]  So it looks bad.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:48.280]  I was hoping that when you guys went that they would be forthcoming and open, at least
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.440]  wouldn't try to bully you even if they refused an interview.
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:55.160]  But it looks bad and I know you guys are staying in the town.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:59.920]  I want to tell you guys to not stay there tonight and to just get out of that town as
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:03.880]  soon as you're done with your interviews because heaven knows what they'll do to you.
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:09.120]  The signs we've already seen, it doesn't look good and I don't want to get you guys
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:12.080]  with drugs planted on you or something so you probably need to get out of there.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:14.600]  That's a boss hog town.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.120]  Do they seem emboldened Marcos?
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:22.720]  Are they going to start putting, kind of like fighter pilots put out how many planes they've
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.800]  shot down?
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:29.200]  I remember seeing a tank with how many citizens they'd killed that the feds had on a tank
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.080]  for here in America.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:34.240]  So I mean, what's your overall view on what's happening there?
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.400]  What else is unfolded?
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:41.600]  Well, whenever I noticed that I mentioned to the media relations person in the city hall,
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.240]  I first walked in just to make sure we were in the right place because there was two buildings
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.400]  adjacent to each other.
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:51.200]  So I walk in the first one and I see the city council member's names on the wall.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.880]  So I start asking around if there's any elected officials in the building that would be willing
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:58.080]  to talk to the media.
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.000]  And I got ushered immediately to the media relations lady.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.480]  And the first thing she asked me is who was I with?
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:09.680]  And I said we were traveling reporters from Austin.
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:15.480]  We report with KLBJ, which is our go to affiliate.
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:22.560]  And the second I told them that we were talking about green conservation areas, the lady started
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:26.880]  ushering me towards the door the moment I dropped the subject matter because she pushed
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:28.920]  me about three times before I answered her.
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:33.360]  And the second I said that started pushing me towards the door, didn't touch me, but
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:38.840]  ushering me, walking me, and just opened the door and quit talking to me essentially and
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:44.560]  told me that I should check the website for events and times when officials would be in
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:45.560]  the building.
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:50.800]  So I walked out, walked out the door and brought the information to Darren and said nobody's
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:51.800]  here.
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:52.800]  Nobody wants to talk to us.
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:53.800]  But you know, there's-
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.640]  Notice she's an official, not a servant.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:57.280]  She's a queenie.
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:00.880]  And a queenie can have the police tell you that you're not allowed in the city council
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.760]  building, the public building, where you might want to go in there and conduct public business
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:08.720]  that with all the different little mystery and agencies.
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:14.480]  But no, no, you're the evil press and she showed you, continue.
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:15.480]  Yeah, okay.
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:17.720]  So the official showed me out.
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.880]  I go and get Darren and tell him there's good B roll in there.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:21.880]  We should go in there and get it.
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.400]  And Darren said, yes, let's get in there.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:24.720]  Let's get some footage.
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.920]  Maybe we can talk to that lady when we get in there.
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:32.960]  So we turn around, grabbed the camera and the second we left the car, the cops pulled
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.720]  up, he was rolling by about five miles an hour, saw that we pulled the camera out of
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:43.160]  the car and zoomed up, probably sped up to about 25, 30 miles an hour, hit the brakes
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.040]  hard and started chastising us.
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:47.040]  What are you guys doing here?
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:48.040]  Who are you?
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:53.840]  And walked right out of the car and he started telling us to shut down the camera.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:56.040]  And I reminded him that he was a public servant.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:01.040]  I told him, I said, you are a public servant on public property.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:03.680]  We have every right to be here and film.
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:09.160]  And he repeatedly tried to shut the camera down and Darren kept yelling at me, make sure
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:10.160]  that camera's rolling.
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:11.160]  Make sure it's rolling.
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:13.400]  Right in front of the camera, right in front of the cops.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.160]  So we got shut down immediately.
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.840]  I figured the media relations person would be the one willing to talk to us and wanted
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  to talk to us.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:22.840]  Here's what you should do.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:25.720]  I would go back and make the whole issue of the tyranny.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:29.520]  And when the police come back up, of course, they're going to follow you.
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:34.640]  And when they're following you, I'd pull over and stop and ask them what's going on.
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:36.680]  And then you basically record it.
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.080]  And then I would start walking up towards it when they come say, well, that's not a
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:41.080]  public building.
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:42.360]  It's a law officer.
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.520]  So you're involved in color of law.
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.000]  You're involved in obstructing the press, obstructing the First Amendment.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.040]  That's a civil rights violation and punishable by jail time.
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:54.080]  Are you aware, sir, of that?
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:00.280]  I mean, I think you should tell them that just upfront because, wow, that is just incredible
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:05.000]  that they got in your face and treated you like this before you ever even let them know
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.040]  you were there about the death of the chicken man.
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:15.080]  Yeah, and whenever we, the cops approached us and we told them the same story that we
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.480]  were there, talk about the green conservation efforts in different states because we have
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.800]  similar ones going on in Austin, one of the cops, one of the nicer ones looked at Darren
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:28.360]  and goes, oh, you guys were at the chicken man's house, weren't you?
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.920]  So he knew right off the bat.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:32.520]  And he knew we were here.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:33.680]  So they knew we're here.
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:34.680]  They knew we're here.
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:35.680]  They knew what we're doing here.
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:37.440]  And it doesn't seem like anybody wants to talk to us.
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  They did.
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.000]  However, give us the number directly to the media relations lady that we told, that we
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:53.280]  told the cops, hold on your plan on calling her later and seeing if she will be willing
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.680]  to talk to us after we make an official appointment.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.640]  The cops are here now, actually, the cops are just walking up as you're sitting here
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:07.640]  doing this report and the camera at him, turning and turning show.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:09.640]  Hi, man.
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:15.240]  Property owner to be on the property here, we don't care if you film, but you need permission
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:19.640]  from the property owner to actually get from the front.
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:24.640]  Okay, they're talking to the police here and we'll we'll boost the audio up a little bit
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:25.640]  over there.
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:30.080]  They're asking us to move off the property because we don't have a rights from the property
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:36.600]  owner to be here, although the property owner has just died and it is understandable, reasonable,
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:37.600]  reasonable.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:42.960]  At first, you were out front, but now they've, of course, the police have already violated
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:45.600]  your first amendment, which is a pretty big crime.
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:47.520]  That's that's all we have.
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.920]  But we know we're being escorted back out to the front, but very, uh,
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.880]  Hey, ask, ask the police officer if she knows or heard about you guys not being allowed
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.200]  to go on the city council.
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:06.560]  Ask her if that's a new law there that the public can't go on the city council building.
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:07.560]  Ask her that.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:13.760]  Have you guys had to kick people off the city council steps before for coming to film
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:14.760]  or?
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:18.280]  I got for three o'clock, so I don't do anything in the city council.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:24.560]  Ask her if there's a law.
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:30.920]  Is there a law that media can't be on the city council steps for any particular reason?
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.040]  I don't have anything to do with that.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.280]  That was between you guys and the officer from city hall.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:35.280]  Okay.
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:38.120]  Obviously, but you are a municipal police officer.
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:43.720]  Have you ever heard of any laws relating to government buildings, public buildings
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:45.480]  and media not being allowed?
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:46.480]  I have not.
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:49.880]  But there again, I'll refer you back to the city hall for that since this there's okay.
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:51.640]  Media relations and city hall.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.800]  We will definitely give her a call later on, wait, wait, wait, wait, God, ask her if she's
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.800]  going to try to stop you.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:03.240]  If you try to go to city hall, are you are we going to be stopped again if we go up to
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.840]  city hall without calling media relations?
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:08.840]  Not me.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:11.320]  She gets off in 12 minutes.
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:12.320]  We are.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.320]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.760]  Thank you for your politeness.
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.760]  So we've just been thrown off.
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.120]  But in America, you shouldn't even have to thank a police officer for being polite.
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:25.720]  Listen, expanding on this.
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:26.720]  Here's the deal.
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:33.680]  They try to trump stuff up media all the time goes on private property when the gates open,
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:35.680]  the things open your media.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:37.680]  It's a murder scene probably.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:40.240]  And so we're there to get data and get information.
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:41.240]  Okay.
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:42.560]  Let's just get that straight right there.
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.560]  Guys, what do you want to do from here?
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:49.320]  Because tell us what what locals think really happened there and what locals think about
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:53.840]  the death of the gentleman for having chickens.
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:59.840]  We did speak to one, one neighbor who spoke, spoke about him in a positive light and said
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:01.760]  that he was a great, great neighbor.
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:05.000]  He was good to all of his friends, all the people in the neighborhood.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:11.560]  But one interesting bit of note was the neighbor directly next door just bought his house.
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:17.760]  He said the incident on Monday happened and then Friday, he closed on his house and spoke
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:22.520]  to whoever he didn't clarify who told him this, but that he was told the city didn't
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:26.840]  have the money to push forward on the green conservation area.
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:30.320]  So it's not, it's actually not going to be pushed through.
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.680]  This guy just brought a bot property next door, just, you know, he's, he's got his moving
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.760]  stuff in the driveway.
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:39.760]  He's going in right now.
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:41.760]  That bus run you over.
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:44.040]  Sorry, I can't hear you.
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:45.200]  There's a bus driving by.
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:47.760]  Man, I tell you, this Skype is incredible.
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:50.640]  There you are in Roswell, Georgia.
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:54.800]  And they got the police following you around and watching you.
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:58.480]  And the other police have told you you can't go on the steps or go anywhere near it.
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:05.060]  You know, I personally think, uh, Marcos, uh, what you ought to do, uh, whatever you
[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:08.560]  guys are comfortable doing, but I personally would go back and when they could run up to
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:10.640]  you again, say, where's the law?
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.640]  So there is no law.
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:13.040]  You're just color of law.
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:14.040]  That's so illegal.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:18.820]  You know, you, you heard the police officer say, well, that was up to that police officer.
[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:23.160]  So now is it up to police officer if I can go to the city council?
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.280]  I mean, this is, this is what tyranny is.
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.240]  This is a big deal.
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:29.640]  I mean, just doing her job.
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.960]  That's what that's what her, her, her answer, I'm just doing my job.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:36.840]  I get off the three.
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:40.760]  Any other tidbits, Marcos, do you think people should know that was her response?
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:41.760]  Yeah.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:47.240]  Any other tidbits people should know Marcos, uh, we're still pushing forward for more information.
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:51.920]  We definitely have a few calls to make and trying to get some calls returned, but we'll
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:57.320]  have a better produced package by the time we get back and all of our information will
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.520]  be condensed by then.
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:03.120]  We don't plan on leaving until we've the schedule time for us to leave.
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.800]  We're here until we get everything we can.
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:08.800]  Well, good job, Marcos Morales reporting for info wars.com.
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:12.640]  Why don't you exchange back to McBreen there with the, uh, Mike and we'll talk to him for
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:13.640]  a moment.
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:14.640]  And thank you so much.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.760]  Uh, you, but I do want you guys to get out of dodge tonight because that lady was nice,
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:24.880]  but the, uh, she just was, wants to get off work and go do whatever she does when she's
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.880]  off work.
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:29.280]  Uh, the other guys show them that pretty bad news, so you need to be careful.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.400]  Anybody that'll do stuff like that.
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.880]  And I mean, you may get a police chief there.
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:35.880]  It sounds like he'll declare himself emperor like happened in courtside.
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:37.620]  The mayor and city council is fired.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:39.120]  I now rule.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:42.560]  Everyone's like, oh, yes, great king.
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.960]  I mean, that's what this country's turned into.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:45.960]  It's so sick.
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:50.960]  Oh, I can't imagine that.
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:51.960]  I can't imagine.
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:54.400]  I mean, it'd be one thing if you were at a city council meeting yelling and screaming
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:59.480]  and the mayor says, throw him out, you know, for that day, but it's another thing entirely
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:01.200]  where people just politely show up.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:02.760]  No, you can't go in there.
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  No.
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:08.520]  And the guys did a great job, you know, hindsight, 20, 20, I would just say, what's the law?
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:10.840]  So you're going to arrest me about going to city council.
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:16.720]  I mean, they don't want that image of you coming up saying, you know, why did he die?
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:17.720]  Was he killed?
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:18.720]  They don't want that.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:19.720]  They're scared.
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:22.600]  And it's, it's, it's incredible.
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:25.640]  They're enclosing thoughts and comments on this.
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:28.200]  It's just a tragic story.
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:31.920]  I've just keep thinking, you know, I know the bigger picture, you know, could be agenda
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:35.840]  21, the green space land grab.
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:41.560]  But you know, this was a man who was a property owner that was bullied.
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:46.640]  And I think that's, that's what I keep thinking about was, was the man himself.
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.920]  And it's just a sad story.
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:51.000]  And I'm sad to have to report about it.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.720]  And we're trying to investigate his death.
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:57.240]  Now they're saying they think he might have blown himself up, but I guess we're just supposed
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:02.280]  to believe a police department that had been involved persecuting this guy for years, that
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:04.440]  he'd been winning in court.
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:08.760]  And we're just supposed to just believe them a group that, that, that illegally blocks
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:13.040]  the media from the city council building that's open to the public.
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:19.560]  Well, and earlier I was talking about how he borrowed a bobcat tractor from the mayor.
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:23.680]  Jeff to understand the reason why he had to do that is to do the city's job for them.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:30.320]  They refused, they're supposed to maintain the storm drains and the sewage drainage system.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:31.760]  They refused to do it.
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:33.640]  And it put him at tremendous risk.
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:38.400]  What ended up happening is he was, his house got flooded several times.
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:43.600]  So he borrowed the tractor from the mayor so he could grade the property to help protect
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:45.320]  his land.
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:51.040]  And he got cited for that, along with having once in too many chickens and too many cars
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:52.040]  on his own property.
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:56.480]  Well, I've met some of these code enforcers and they get off on harassing people.
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:58.160]  They'll tell you that.
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.600]  And it's just the most hollow, mindless control freaks.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.800]  And the thing is they annex countryside and all the time, well, I mean, that's how it
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:11.880]  started with the gentleman in Illinois who's facing life in prison still and the states
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:13.520]  come down and said, yeah, we want life in prison.
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:17.600]  They agree with the county for filming and taping police in public because he lives in
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:18.600]  the country.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:21.960]  And it turns out what the police chief's brother, I think he was saying, owns the wrecking company
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:23.960]  and the guy restores all cars.
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:28.600]  They come out to his shop, the guy has no criminal record, known the community, fixes
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:29.600]  cars.
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:30.600]  He's a mechanic.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:35.000]  And they hauled off a bunch of valuable, you know, 57 Chevy's and stuff.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.240]  This is what America is.
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:40.680]  And then he tapes it and goes to court and stuff.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:45.400]  And then he's facing life in prison and they'll sleep good at night, putting him in jail
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:46.400]  for life.
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.520]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:51.800]  And I can't wait to see the footage of the cops saying you can't go in the city council
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.960]  building, the city hall, the people's hall, an open public building.
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:01.600]  Oh, yeah, we've got, we've definitely got it on tape, you know,
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:06.960]  Darren, what about going back over there and and waiting till the police get there and
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.640]  then walking towards and having him and say, you know, we just need this for complaints
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:16.880]  with the state and also civil rights complaint, you know, because you're violating our First
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.280]  Amendment here, freedom of the press.
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.640]  And I was just telling them, matter of fact, Lee, saying we can't go in a public building.
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:26.360]  This is like having to have the army get little black kids into the public school.
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:30.720]  I mean, you understand this is an issue of you blocking us from a public building and
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:32.960]  a public service.
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:34.120]  It's got to be confronted.
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:35.120]  So I'm game.
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:40.520]  I'm now, listen, I don't want you to obviously we'll sue them like we're doing with do our
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.800]  lawyer, Stuart Rhodes and a great job on that and they're already trying to settle with
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:45.800]  Pittsburgh.
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:47.160]  I mean, we're going to sue them.
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:51.400]  Just just keep the cameras rolling, obviously, don't resist, whatever.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:55.840]  But if you want to accept this mission, I want you to go over there and I would say,
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:57.680]  don't try to actually go in.
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:00.600]  Let them just commit the crime in front of everybody, okay?
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:01.600]  Sure.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:02.600]  Sure.
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:03.600]  All right, good.
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:04.600]  All right.
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  Should be interesting.
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:07.760]  Yeah, because I mean, this shows this this city council is out of control.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:12.560]  They think because they use taxpayer money to pay these cops that they're ordering police
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:13.560]  to do illegal things.
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:23.280]  The thing I wanted to point out that I go ahead, Darren, we've lost Darren Skype for
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:24.280]  a moment.
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.280]  We'll see if that comes back.
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:27.000]  I still haven't told the Carmageddon story.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.440]  I may have to just shoot a special report in here for the nightly news tonight where
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:32.080]  I cogently tell it all.
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:34.120]  This is so insane.
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:37.200]  Yeah, I just want my Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.960]  We'll try to jam a few calls in a hit a few final news stories here in this hour.
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:46.480]  We have Darren's video ever comes back up and we ought to just keep recording from the road

[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:24.440]  opposite reaction.

[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:11.200]  So the Democratic Party has come out and attacked Mitt Romney's wife, their top strategist saying
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.760]  it's evil that she stayed at home with her children because they hate the family.
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:18.120]  We have a photo of the Romneys whether you love them or hate them.
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:25.840]  The point is is that I am certainly envious of five sons and what's 16 grandchildren.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:28.960]  Anybody out there with their head halfway screwed on straight looks at that and says
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:32.040]  that's good right there.
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:36.560]  That makes you feel good inside.
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:43.160]  By the way my children are homeschooled but they go to a thing twice a week that's a school
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.840]  so it's like a quasi and it's accredited and they were sent home with big packets about
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:49.920]  how great Michelle Obama is.
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:56.760]  Any accredited school you're taught how wonderful even the Christian schools Michelle Obama
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:57.760]  is in this country.
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:00.440]  I mean everything is run by this scum.
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:05.920]  Government is running everything and police and others are so confident in this country
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:11.160]  in tyranny that they would tell our reporters they can't go in a city council building.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:15.840]  No law, listen that's illegal just because you got a badge and a gun you're not God that's
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.080]  what I'm talking about.
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:22.600]  Hey they take people's kids for not taking vaccines so see they're saying the Romneys
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:26.040]  are bad for their you know their kids it's evil it's evil to take care of your kids you
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:27.440]  got to give them to the state.
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:33.400]  There's an article California Wages War on single family homes they've introduced legislation
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:37.840]  to ban the construction of them because of global warming so you got to live in a big
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:42.200]  high-rise control by the bankers you've got to rent basically.

[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:07.640]  under green fascism wow I could do something like that and also to get up on the slope
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:12.040]  now I remember about a year and a half ago maybe you did a report about how you had to
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:18.840]  get vetted by the TSA to get work you know it started with the unions well it's now hitting
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.720]  like everybody now it's called the twit card the transportation workers identification
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:31.000]  card it costs $129 and you have to go through all the TSA crap no it's a license to have
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:35.720]  a job and you'll have to get their approval to travel and to leave your house or to have
[03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:40.320]  a job and you will be arrested with 15 million dollar fines for selling eggs on the side
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:45.600]  of the street or tomatoes or having a garage sale I mean it's just it's and the police
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:52.360]  say don't go in city council it's the Soviet Union definitely the Soviet Union so and let
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:56.040]  me guess the guy teaching you this he kind of enjoyed the power that he was letting
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:02.080]  you know how things well he was actually not so much for it really oh he's a terrorist
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:06.280]  yeah pretty much no I remember the name of the card I'm always trying to explain it to
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:11.080]  the crew and they don't remember about it but yeah it's the new transportation car
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:16.400]  but it's going to be national parks highways jobs everywhere anything that's infrastructure
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  protection what's the name of it again it's called quick TW IC you can go on the main
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:26.880]  TSA website and it's on there yeah no I know about it I just I'm always meaning to cover
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:30.920]  that again and I forget the name of it another little side note I'll mention is my brother
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:35.560]  in law he's a contractor on Fort Richardson and he mentioned to me a little while ago
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:42.960]  that they're actually forming a mortuary battalion on there say that again they're forming a mortuary
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:50.400]  battalion yeah I saw that and I they're training them all for riot control and they're preparing
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:57.880]  all the cities for large portions of the cities to be dead it's pretty crazy I'm from around
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:04.120]  Sarah Palin's neighborhood and I remember one time I was listening to you and and talk
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:09.000]  to my wife about what you were talking about she listens to you too and you know you were
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:14.080]  talking about the TSA and I came out of my little rural driveway and lo and behold there's
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:22.000]  a TSA truck passing by me so they're just our little federal friends that teach the
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:26.120]  children that the men in uniforms grab their genitals it's freedom and the Supreme Court
[03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:30.280]  says the police are going to start the genital grope now for no reason it's freedom I mean
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:36.480]  the new symbol of America I guess on the flag could be like you know your legs spread and
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:41.520]  the police grabbing it I mean that's that's freedom here in Alaska a lot of Alaskans
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:46.840]  don't don't really believe it's happening but you'd be amazed you know when you walk
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:51.920]  around up here and talk to people and they really have no clue and yet you know just
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:56.400]  driving around say the city of Palmer I was at the little to sorrow station there and
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.720]  a and who who who rides in why it's a TSA agent you know the vehicle out there they
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:06.720]  come in I'm like looking at it like like who the hell is that you know and and yeah it
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:12.600]  was a TSA homeland security you know well yeah you heard them you're gonna lose your livelihood
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:18.000]  if somebody sees you spit then they'll come to somebody and say we know about his politics
