[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:10.000 --> 00:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live. Thank you for joining us. It's the 28th day of January, 2018. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday.
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  4-6 p.m. Central. Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to host the last two segments of the broadcast today because I want to give him the floor.
[00:48.000 --> 01:11.000]  I have plenty to add about the phenomenon of QAnon that millions of people read on the H&N message boards and much of what QAnon has put out has turned out to be very accurate information. Some of it has not transpired exactly how QAnon said, but things are fluid and no one knows the future exactly.
[01:11.000 --> 01:33.000]  I know that we have some really high level military and intelligence agency sources that have been extremely accurate, in fact more accurate even, and they're stunning not just predictions, but exposing huge stories like Zach, who we should get back on here very, very soon, who's laid out the secrets of the storm.
[01:33.000 --> 01:58.000]  There is a storm worldwide of nationalism against globalism, a storm of populism taking place, and the globalists, the insiders, the monopoly men, are in a full panic to stop it and to brand it as racist or evil or all the rest of it because they are the people using race.
[01:58.000 --> 02:12.000]  They are the people using region. They are the people dumbing down the population and playing people off against each other. And so court seat will be on in the last two segments of today's transmission.
[02:12.000 --> 02:41.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to basically parallel World War II and some of the factors and some of the factions that the United States, Russia, and England faced versus the factions that you'll find the very same alliances face yet again because history does repeat, but it's been said it also rhymes.
[02:41.000 --> 02:54.000]  So that's coming up and what spurred me to think about this was I was invited to speak a few years ago at the Oxford Union, and then I was invited to speak at Cambridge as well.
[02:54.000 --> 03:21.000]  But I refused. I was in the middle of a contentious divorce with my first wife and a custody bottle at the time, so I didn't do that. But Roger Stone is going to speak there. And we were talking last night about what he was going to talk about and just the parallels of what he was going to talk about versus what we talk about here and what I was going to talk about are basically the same because we're looking at the same thing.
[03:21.000 --> 03:32.000]  But it really struck me how really black and white the issues are here and really how authoritarian and truly evil.
[03:32.000 --> 03:53.000]  It's globalist are but we'll have cameras there covering that because the Oxford Union and speaking to the faculty, you know, that's where Gandhi and Martin Luther King and Kennedy and everybody else has spoken. It's one of the most prestigious places to speak. And I didn't refuse it to snub them. I was just a hunkered down here, but I'm glad that Roger's going over there to do that.
[03:53.000 --> 04:16.000]  The invitation's open. I'll probably go do that sometime as well. But why not just give you kind of a little foretaste of what I intend when I speak someplace like Oxford to say here on air because it has an anglophilic vein through it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:28.000]  That's a particular speech I would give in England. But then I was thinking about that speech that I would give in England that I never gave because I didn't go. And I was thinking about, well, why not just give that speech here today.
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  So I never wrote the speech that's in my head, but you're going to get that speech coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[04:35.000 --> 04:46.000]  I'm even thinking about putting a lectern in an area here in one of our studios where I can go give speeches. It's something about being an lectern and maybe even have a studio audience then sometimes.
[04:46.000 --> 05:00.000]  And I do that because as folks know, I haven't given a lot of speeches in years, but I did previously and folks said that's particularly where I shine is to a large group of audience. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[05:10.000 --> 05:18.000]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2% per year.
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[05:31.000 --> 05:44.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma, longifolia originally from Malaysia,
[05:44.000 --> 06:01.000]  makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India. Reach your alpha male potential with alpha power. Get alpha power now at 50% off and secure your bottle today.
[06:15.000 --> 06:26.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[06:26.000 --> 06:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones. We're going to be here for the next two hours. Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  This is the live Sunday transmission. I've been doing this for 10 years.
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.000]  10 years here in the Sunday slot, 4 to 6 p.m. Then of course the weekday transmission, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[06:45.000 --> 06:54.000]  I've been doing that for 20 years. I've been on air for 23 years. It'll be 23 years coming up in April.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Wow. Where to start?
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  When you're embedded in the news and you really pay attention to what's going on and you actually know the facts
[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  versus what the mainstream corporate media is saying and you see their talking points, it's really frustrating.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  And I know most Americans have caught the lies, the propaganda, the twisting for themselves.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  But so much of the real brainwashing goes on inside entertainment.
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  And have you ever asked why the so-called left, really the modern authoritarians, posing as liberals,
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.000]  are so willing to censor the Internet now and so willing to try to shut down everybody's free speech with their own?
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  It's because it's what the modern left has done the last 100 years all over the world.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  They always shut down free speech. Look at Venezuela and its collapse right now.
[07:42.000 --> 07:51.000]  Look at so many other leftist countries. They always end in barbarous cutthroat, free-booting, road warrior-like collapse.
[07:51.000 --> 08:02.000]  But particularly, we've seen the bullying in Hollywood, the bullying in mainline newspapers, the bullying in mainline TV,
[08:02.000 --> 08:13.000]  where anybody who is even mildly nationalistic, mildly free-market, gets attacked, gets demonized, doesn't get booked on shows, doesn't get written about.
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  They try to publish their books and the publishers dump them like Milo.
[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  They learn that Neil Strauss, one of the top writers, wants to publish a big book with me.
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  And they found out about the secret shopping of the book and CNN came out and said,
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  we've absolutely got to shut this down, not let Alex Jones publish this book. They're incredible.
[08:42.000 --> 08:54.000]  And so you see Jay-Z worth hundreds of millions of dollars coming out complaining about Trump saying he's a racist with no evidence of it when it's Jay-Z being the racist.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  And Trump responds back, hey, we've got the lowest black unemployment ever.
[08:59.000 --> 09:12.000]  I'm directly meeting with black leaders across the rust belt to get massive investment targeted into those neighborhoods with incentives for high-paying training and jobs.
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.000]  I mean, we're talking about starting $50,000 a year, 60, 70, 80, $100,000 a year with chances into management,
[09:20.000 --> 09:31.000]  which isn't like affirmative action. Pay somebody to sit at home and watch TV and have kids that then get involved in drugs and crime and create a cycle of prisons and poverty, which they admit is going on.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  This is the real deal. This is direct investment.
[09:36.000 --> 09:44.000]  And you see the so-called black leaders, which are a bunch of hip-hop stars and people like that, out there race-baiting.
[09:44.000 --> 09:52.000]  It's truly sickening. And then Michael Moore lays in, and it's crazy to see how upset they are that all of this is happening.
[09:52.000 --> 09:59.000]  Here it is, unhinged Michael Moore, a sales trump, unfit, narcissist, sociopath, threat to humanity.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  That's just the latest stuff right there.
[10:02.000 --> 10:14.000]  And the censorship comes in with a big top star. In fact, I guess they say she's the top star, period, out there.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  And of course, everybody knows what I'm talking about. She won't get into all of this.
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  She won't join in to all of the endless hating and the rest of it. Taylor Swift.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  So I was reading what the mainstream news and people say about her. She's aggressively white.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  She needs to apologize for the fact that she's even white.
[10:41.000 --> 10:52.000]  And because she won't attack the president, they're now trying to boycott her and shut down her shows when she's the highest grossing beyond the Beatles, beyond George Strait.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  George Strait broke the Beatles record and now it's Taylor Swift. And she's number one.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  She's apolitical for people that want escapism.
[11:03.000 --> 11:13.000]  And because of that, there's a big move to try to shut her down because she's white. That is incredible racism on its face.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  And that story is up on infowars.com. So that's who these bullies are.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  And it shows how anyone who wants entrance, even if they're very talented, into the system has to fly their flag as a leftist.
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  That's called being an occult. That's authoritarianism. And then if you become successful just being apolitical, they're like, hey, you better join us politically or we're going to call you aggressively white.
[11:36.000 --> 11:45.000]  And it's white people that are driving this. It's incredible. They're looking at demographics. They're racist white people who use race to control.
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  A true racist isn't even believing it. They're just using it for balkanization and control issues.
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  They then know that classical Americans are good people and aren't racist. They can bully us and they say, you will do what we say.
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  You will pick up our political views or we will attack you even if you don't say anything political. You are our slave.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  Taylor Swift has no fear of bullies on the left.
[12:15.000 --> 12:25.000]  It's out of the Herald Sun. The bullying of Taylor Swift for the egregious crime of not publicly supporting Hillary Clinton or denouncing Donald Trump has entered its third year.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  Despite unrelenting pressure, Swift refuses to become an overtly political feminist pet who obediently regurgitates lefty talking points.
[12:33.000 --> 12:48.000]  For this sin, the singer-songwriter has paid a heavy price. She's been labeled aggressively white, linked to neo-nazis, and accused of being a messenger, these are quotes, for a disturbing new era.
[12:48.000 --> 13:00.000]  Last week, she was criticized by BuzzFeed. That's the PPGate people, the fake news kings, for not taking part in a second annual women's march, a.k.a. the world's longest post-election tantrum.
[13:00.000 --> 13:11.000]  Another BuzzFeed hitpiece blamed Swift for having white supremacist fans and claimed that she is intrinsically likened to whiteness and privilege.
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  And I'm going to stop there as they move forward with trying to shut her down. But don't worry, Katy Perry and Beyonce and Lady Gaga, they'll all play along.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  Miley Cyrus, while they degrade women and everybody else and cover up for Hollywood's incredible crimes.
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.000]  Watch these women's marches that love Hillary when she's the poster child of covering up men abusing women, raping women.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  And Sharon Stone is in the news saying, Harvey Weinstein, you know, you don't give somebody the death penalty for a parking ticket, that's a quote.
[13:39.000 --> 13:54.000]  We've got dozens of witnesses, people that are credible, like his chauffeur, like his butlers, saying he would jump on top women, small women, what he likes, like 100 pounds, and rape them, with them begging and pleading with their legs back behind their ears.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  That's what rape is when you're a big man and you force yourself on a woman. That's rape, rape, rape.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I got three daughters. You rape one of my daughters? You're not going to have to wait for the police to come.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's better if you know that it's better to be tried by nine than to be carried by six.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  And that's what's going to happen to you. You're going to be getting carried by six. You touch my daughters.
[14:16.000 --> 14:28.000]  The point is, is these people signal, signal, signal, signal, signal, while Oprah is bringing people in to basically be thrown at Weinstein.
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.000]  They say it's like, I thought it'd be safe because Oprah is there and all of a sudden she turns me over to Weinstein.
[14:36.000 --> 14:45.000]  We're going to talk more about this when we come back for break, but Vanity Fair has photoshopped a male actor out because a girlfriend said once he forced her head down to forcefully.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  In consensual sex, I'm not defending who knows. It's Hollywood. The thing's a cesspool. It's a latrine.
[14:52.000 --> 15:01.000]  But oh, they left Oprah in the photo shop. You see, we'll show you that when we come back.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  But that's exactly what it's like in the old Soviet Union when people weren't liked anymore.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  They would just get photoshopped out of the photos, but not Oprah Winfrey and not Bill Clinton and not Hillary.
[15:13.000 --> 15:22.000]  And there's a new bizarre video we'll play when we get back of Hillary Clinton running around saying, oh, yeah, we're the bitches.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  We're the nasty women. Yeah, let's go, bitches. And that's what the women say in these marches.
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  We hate men. We're nasty. We're into being gross. We're into being selfish.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  We don't want to be appealing. We want to be ugly. And that's why studies show liberals are seen.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  Five to one is more ugly than conservatives across the board in every culture.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  And we've got those documents coming up as well. But the big news is also coming up.
[15:50.000 --> 15:58.000]  Trump ignores DOJ warning once FISA memo released. Stay with us in the state of the unions coming up as well in FullWars.com.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country,
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours on the files I have here,
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  But immune wall is incredible. And folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  It's a great deal at $39.
[16:27.000 --> 16:35.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more. It is concentrated. You need to go read what is in here.
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.000]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  A citrus peel blend. I mean, this is the next level.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall. I think it's beyond seasonal.
[16:48.000 --> 16:57.000]  Beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more. Immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple 82533139.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  Introducing FloorLife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfowarsLife.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  FloorLife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[17:26.000 --> 17:33.000]  FloorLife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.

[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.

[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[18:38.000 --> 18:48.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[20:17.000 --> 20:37.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:37.000 --> 20:47.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. I want to get into the big news dealing with the secret FISA memo that could be released as early as tomorrow.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  The State of the Union is huge news on that front, breaking exclusive intel on the secrets of QAnon.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  One of these intelligence sources has been proven to be frighteningly accurate.
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  We'll have Dr. Corsi coming up at the end of the broadcast for two segments, breaking that down here. It's all coming up.
[21:04.000 --> 21:14.000]  But just getting back in to the hypocrisy of Hollywood, I know all of us listening, most of us, are aware that Hollywood's a cesspool, that they're hypocrites, that they're out of control.
[21:14.000 --> 21:26.000]  But again, Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein for decades, reportedly raping scores of women, not just abusing him, and covered it up.
[21:26.000 --> 21:38.000]  And the person that was known for enabling it, many actresses have come out. It's been in the news. We've covered it and said that she would like basically pimp women to Weinstein, that she was working with him.
[21:38.000 --> 21:45.000]  And there's photos of her all over him and sticking her tongue in his ear. That's Harvey Weinstein. There it is, British actress.
[21:45.000 --> 22:00.000]  And as Weinstein used Oprah as bait for sex, actress say Oprah duped her into thinking Weinstein would help her career. So it's well known that she was a prostitute, Oprah, that Oprah hires prostitutes, that Oprah is a lesbian, which again, I'm attacking her for that.
[22:00.000 --> 22:08.000]  I'm just, that's the facts. And that she's at the very core of the elite of Hollywood. What's that tell you?
[22:08.000 --> 22:23.000]  Well, but did Vanity Fair, let's put it on screen for TV viewers, did Vanity Fair Photoshop her out of the latest issue coming out with all of these other Hollywood cromudges?
[22:23.000 --> 22:34.000]  I mean, all of these Trump haters who just go out and virtue signal and try to stop the economy coming back. Tom Hanks and of course other losers like Robert De Niro that said Trump would never be president.
[22:34.000 --> 22:45.000]  I mean, John Duncan wants to beat him up. Harris and Ford. I mean, who could go see any movies these these losers are in. And right there there's Oprah with women sexually all over her.
[22:45.000 --> 22:55.000]  One woman's between her legs. Other woman's got her breast shoved in her face. I'm there letting you know who the goddess is right there with all the little goddesses attached to her like harpies.
[22:55.000 --> 23:03.000]  So they're telling you everything you need to know right there. And then Franco, James Franco, he's edited out.
[23:03.000 --> 23:13.000]  He's saying he comes and says, okay, his girlfriend says, well, 18 years ago or something, he shoved my face down in his crotch, you know, in the car when he was my boyfriend.
[23:13.000 --> 23:23.000]  Okay. Another girl. Yeah. You know, once he got me really drunk and we had sex and he was rude to me. Okay. I mean, the guy does come off kind of like as a, you know, partying moron.
[23:23.000 --> 23:37.000]  Put him in jail. It is something wrong. But what about Oprah? See, you don't Photoshop her. It's the total and complete hypocrisy. And then meanwhile, there's other hypocrisy here.
[23:37.000 --> 23:51.000]  You've got this family. Arrested after 12 children ages two to 29 found shackled in California home. Now they released photos of a Texas home that was foreclosed on a few years ago that was just absolutely nightmarish.
[23:51.000 --> 23:59.000]  And they say because they were Christians, Christians, Christians and homeschoolers as if homeschoolers do this. It's all over the news saying that.
[23:59.000 --> 24:09.000]  But when CNN or others do report on tens of thousands of men, women and children being sold into slavery, nowhere is there anything about Islam.
[24:09.000 --> 24:22.000]  CNN this week, people for sale were lives or auction for $400 men, women and children. But never do they tell you in the whole article, it's legal under Islamic law.
[24:22.000 --> 24:30.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, never, never people for sale. Since Hillary came and helped bring down Libya and blow up its infrastructure.
[24:30.000 --> 24:46.000]  Now, Saharan, Sub-Saharan Africans come in, mainly animist, some of them Christian, out of southern Sudan. And they say in the article, oh, they were kidnapped in southern Sudan by Muslims.
[24:46.000 --> 24:55.000]  It's all over the foreign press. It's all over the African press. The ongoing civil war for 30 years is the Muslims have invaded into Sudan and taken 90% of it.
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  But that's why it's so frustrating. I mean, I turn on television, I walk into a restaurant. It's the family with the 12 kids and how bad Christians are.
[25:03.000 --> 25:11.000]  Christians, Christians, Christians, homeschoolers, homeschoolers. But then I see on the news, oh, look, poor Sudanese, they're being sold into slavery.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  Oh, since Libya is a failed state. No discussion of Anderson Cooper, CNN, everyone's cheerleading.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  Gaddafi, who'd been working with the U.S. for a decade, he'd invested all his money with us. He'd stopped being a terrorist. He built all this infrastructure.
[25:25.000 --> 25:34.000]  He was helping Africa. Obama double-crossed him, let him take over. Hillary went in and said, I came. I saw he died. They ruined the country.
[25:34.000 --> 25:47.000]  And you've got people from all over southern Sudan, central Sudan, Niger, Algeria going up into Libya, being promised they can get to Europe and instead they get sold into slavery.
[25:47.000 --> 26:00.000]  By Muslims, then they use the pain of the public seeing these poor people and they go, oh, they're migrants. We've got to let more in or they'll be put into slavery.
[26:00.000 --> 26:14.000]  They're coming up out of central Africa and out of eastern Africa because they got kidnapped in Islamic slave trade of Boko Haram that's gone all the way to the west into Nigeria and is threatening to take the entire country.
[26:14.000 --> 26:24.000]  There's a giant Islamic invasion that Obama and his cousin Odinga run out of Kenya. This is all on record. Muslim Brotherhood, all of it, out of Egypt.
[26:24.000 --> 26:33.000]  We say we the U.S. under Obama over through our allies in Egypt and they blew up hundreds of churches and killed tens of thousands.
[26:33.000 --> 26:45.000]  Oh, but James Franco wants his girlfriend movie star said he once aggressively shoved her head down in a car because she wasn't giving him good enough fallatio.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  Okay, he's a punk. Punch him in the nose. Call your daddy or brother and have him kick his ass. That's what you're supposed to do.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  The point is, oh, but so you don't have a daddy and I suppose to have a family. You've got the state, don't you?
[26:55.000 --> 27:11.000]  But the very state that does all this helps the Islamist run these massive operations and go in and kidnap black people from all over Africa as far south and west as Nigeria.
[27:11.000 --> 27:21.000]  And CNN has maps showing all of this and but does it tell you they're Muslims, they're Muslims, they're Muslims, they're Muslims.
[27:21.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's Muslims doing it. Libya, slave footage, sparks, outrage, BBC. And if you dig deep enough, you'll finally find ISIS, but remember, Obama told us ISIS is not Islam.
[27:33.000 --> 27:45.000]  Power is waning, but its child slave trade is booming. A Yazidi captive tale sold by ISIS as a sex slave. Some little girls as young as five.
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  ISIS captures 7,000 women and kids to sell them on social media as sex slaves.
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.000]  Meanwhile, here's what the children in the California torture house did to cope with the abuse. Okay, great. It's terrible.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  Mentally ill, crazy people that were doing this. Were they organized? Were they invading half of Africa? No.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  And fine, tell us they were Christians. Okay, you got some bad so-called mentally ill people that call them those Christians.
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  They're not organized, taken over half the Middle East and other areas and backed by our government. That's the problem.
[28:21.000 --> 28:35.000]  And Trump comes in and ends that practice to a great extent. The CIA and others are still kind of halfway doing it. And they act like he is Adolf Hitler returned in the flesh.
[28:35.000 --> 28:43.000]  Adolf Hitler was the one working with the Muslims, by the way. Look it up. And if you try to talk about it on German social media, they ban you even if you're a professor or a journalist.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  You can't show pictures of Hitler going and meeting with all the top Muslims that universally pledged their allegiance to him.
[28:48.000 --> 28:57.000]  We'll be back with my huge breakdown, a key analysis. You don't want to miss. This is critical. Please spread the live links and tell folks about your local affiliates you're listening to.
[29:18.000 --> 29:27.000]  Minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely needs. In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  Super Metal Vitality and so many others, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[29:35.000 --> 29:48.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure. And Res Secured, you're funding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.

[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[30:04.000 --> 30:14.000]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[30:14.000 --> 30:26.000]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars. It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[30:26.000 --> 30:37.000]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[30:37.000 --> 30:44.000]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[30:44.000 --> 30:54.000]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning t-shirt. Trigger Warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  That is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[31:24.000 --> 31:49.000]  This is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at InfoWars.com on the right arm.

[31:58.000 --> 32:20.000]  This is InfoWars.com.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[32:36.000 --> 32:43.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[32:47.000 --> 32:57.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[32:57.000 --> 33:03.000]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[33:03.000 --> 33:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.000 --> 33:37.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:37.000 --> 33:44.000]  I was asked to speak three years ago at the Oxford Union.
[33:44.000 --> 33:53.000]  It's one of the most historical and interesting places to give a speech, and it's been well known for having controversial speakers for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[33:53.000 --> 34:02.000]  I was unable to do it because I was in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle with my ex-wife at the time.
[34:02.000 --> 34:22.000]  So it wasn't a snub to the Oxford Union, but then it reminded me the reason I tell the story is that when I was talking to Roger Stone last night about the fact that he's going to be traveling to the UK starting tomorrow to address the Oxford Union.
[34:22.000 --> 34:41.000]  I told Roger what I was intending to say even three years ago at the Oxford Union and how in the modern times so much more has happened along that line, that visionary line, and that I thought he should speak on some of those topics.
[34:41.000 --> 34:53.000]  He said that's amazing, Alex, because here's my notes. They just asked me to speak last week. This is what I'm intending to talk about. In fact, I want to join you Monday before I fly out in the evening.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  That's how a lot of those flights are. You fly out in the evening and get there when it's the morning over there.
[34:58.000 --> 35:18.000]  He said, so I will come on Monday and kind of give you the speech that I'm going to give to the Oxford Union. We're going to send a crew as well that will be meeting up with him so that is going to be something we'll maybe even carry live once we get in place over there.
[35:18.000 --> 35:36.000]  But that's all the side issue. It just reminded me of the speech I wanted to give that was more of a Anglo-centric, Anglophile perspective. It doesn't mean I'm an Anglophile.
[35:36.000 --> 35:55.000]  It doesn't mean that I'm obsessed with the UK, even though my surname is Welsh. I think it's a fine culture, beautiful country, great people. It's just that three years ago, that would have been a speech that I would have given them there.
[35:55.000 --> 36:10.000]  But now that speech is a speech you can give to the entire planet. And about five years ago, I spoke outside Bilderberg, north of London, in the rolling grass hills above an elite meeting house where the Bilderberg group was meeting.
[36:10.000 --> 36:29.000]  We had over 3,000 people in attendance. And I had the folks from the UK chanting the answer to 1984 to 1776 with more gusto than they do here in the US because I had just given the prototype of the speech that I would give a year and a half later at Oxford if I had gone.
[36:29.000 --> 36:45.000]  And then now the complete speech I would give today. And now that I'm up to the point of giving the speech, when you're sitting there thinking about a speech, it's so much more easy than just giving it.
[36:45.000 --> 37:04.000]  And by that I can talk endlessly. It's just that it's such a big idea. It's so true that I don't want to just sit here and say these things and have it just be something that's mixed into the background of everything else we talk about because it's all super important.
[37:04.000 --> 37:13.000]  In fact, things are so crazy. Going about our business once you know this stuff is obscene.
[37:13.000 --> 37:37.000]  And so now I don't even know if I can give that speech. It's not that my tongue is even tied. It's just so real, so important that I don't feel worthy.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  I've done the research. I know who the global star. I know what their plan is.
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.000]  You notice everything I told you 15 years ago is word for word coming out of Elon Musk's mouth right now.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  And it's not because he plagiarized what I was saying. Finally there's a break with the elite.
[37:58.000 --> 38:14.000]  And a bunch of people in the establishment don't want this plan to continue. And so people like Elon Musk have backing from people in NASA, in the Pentagon, in the Trump administration.
[38:14.000 --> 38:26.000]  How many times did I say they're going to create a one world government where you worship an AI computer that can give you advanced technology or quote eternal life, but you really won't get eternal life.
[38:26.000 --> 38:36.000]  You'll be told that you're going to get rid of this body and enter this silicon system and that you won't hurt the earth anymore.
[38:36.000 --> 38:48.000]  And so there's going to be pressure for everybody to do this. And they're going to be able to tap into the pleasure centers. They're going to be able to basically make it whatever you want while you're still conscious and alive plugged into it.
[38:48.000 --> 39:00.000]  And it's going to be the greatest con of cons, a king of cons, that you'll believe your loved ones and things are inside the big computer system.
[39:00.000 --> 39:12.000]  And they'll have avatars and robot bodies that are in. They'll even have biological bodies in the future that are completely artificial but are biological.
[39:12.000 --> 39:24.000]  And you will think it's your family member. It'll have the sayings. It'll have the mannerisms. It'll have it all because in the future they'll be able to track everything you say, everything you do for years and have an algorithm.
[39:24.000 --> 39:36.000]  Just like Amazon can already, five years ago, tell you what you're going to order with 99% accuracy and already have your package preloaded days before you order it and ready to ship to you.
[39:36.000 --> 39:46.000]  People are going to believe they're talking to their loved ones inside of these avatars, inside of these AI systems, and it's not.
[39:46.000 --> 39:57.000]  And that's the big line. And that's going to be the great abomination that's going to come. And the dehumanization and the genetic engineering and all of it.
[39:57.000 --> 40:13.000]  The speech has to be linear though with the development of humanity, the city states, the nation states, the elites, the eugenics, the robber barons, the mind wars, the 20th century, the war for the future, which we're now in.
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  The decision humans are obsolete, the decision to go to this silicon based system that the globalist believes is going to be eternal life.
[40:20.000 --> 40:30.000]  Ray Kurzweil is the top futurist technologist at Google and he's completely insane. Okay, invented scan printers 40 years ago, 50 years ago, whatever, big deal.
[40:30.000 --> 40:39.000]  Ray Kurzweil says off my father's papers and notes and things like telecomputer, it's going to recreate him. And I don't believe in God yet, I'm going to be God.
[40:39.000 --> 40:54.000]  Well, he may be crazy enough down the road to believe it's his dad off notebooks, but imagine computers and face scanners and all these ubiquitous systems in our houses that record everything we do in 3D dimension.
[40:54.000 --> 41:07.000]  You will be able to take that data and put it in a humanoid in a robot, whatever you want, and your mama won't be able to tell it's not you, but it's not you.
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.000]  We can't let this body live forever. But don't worry, you upload yourself into this computer and into this system.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  It's going to be we we're all going to be together, but you'll still have your individualism and everything that's in you everything you are we're going to control.
[41:25.000 --> 41:37.000]  Because when you realize you read 2001 Space Odyssey, you read childhood Zen, that was in my six OSS before that prayer, the telecommunications satellite, Odyssey Clark.
[41:37.000 --> 41:48.000]  He later gave speeches and things where he basically admitted, I'm a Luciferian, I believe all this, we're going to have to transcend our bodies to become the new superhuman.
[41:48.000 --> 42:00.000]  His thinking is the thinking of the insiders. And you know what, they'll argue, hey, we really are going to be gods. Look, we did all this and we envisioned it and we used builders.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  We use people.
[42:04.000 --> 42:24.000]  We use people to then have the idea, put it out there and enough money, enough taxpayer money, enough $700 toilet seats, the money siphoned off to actually build these Manhattan project type systems of AI, supercomputers, quantum engines, all of it to then be able to build the
[42:24.000 --> 42:38.000]  breakaway mass civilization that the establishment thinks it's going to get in. It believes the Earth's going to fail, fall, all the rest of this is consigned like an egg being fertilized.
[42:38.000 --> 42:50.000]  The Earth is simply the engine and the material to build the metamorphosis of what they're going to become. And so we're just the fuel for their operation.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  Well, guess what? We're going to have a discussion about this, but I haven't gotten to the next level.
[42:55.000 --> 43:21.000]  When we return, stay with us.
[43:26.000 --> 43:34.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.000 --> 43:47.000]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:24.000]  We're all living in America, America. It's wonderful. We're all living in America, America.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  Welcome back. I am your host Alex Jones.
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  Why am I so pro-Trump? Because the globalist hating, he's trying to build a future pro-family, pro-God, pro-human.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  You can say, well, I don't like the corruption of the big churches and I don't like all the... I get it.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  But what are the people coming and rebelling against that? What are they replacing it with?
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Well, if you don't believe in the world beast system, that's fine.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  The globalists definitely are taking it as a model and building it.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  And humans are able, when we have enough technological base and cultural base,
[48:00.000 --> 48:08.000]  to basically build and construct and create anything we want to. We are incredible creatures.
[48:08.000 --> 48:16.000]  And so, the basis of the speech that I would give, so something like the Oxford Union,
[48:16.000 --> 48:25.000]  would be political first and just a snapshot historically to parallel,
[48:25.000 --> 48:32.000]  to focus in on the power of the individual, the power of people. And this is where I would begin.
[48:32.000 --> 48:40.000]  Hitler was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation on record.
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  Have a PowerPoint. Put the articles up, New York Times articles, you name it,
[48:45.000 --> 48:52.000]  showing Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Adolf Hitler, Margaret Sanger, IBM, the Holocaust, all of it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.000]  And so, I would first point out, there's a struggle,
[48:58.000 --> 49:06.000]  where you've got the United States and our robber barons funding the Nazi Party, starting in the late 20s.
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  And simultaneously, and again, this is a small snapshot of history, but so frustrating.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  It's not going on any little snapshot and then build out and connect it to everything.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Because it's all there. We know exactly what happened.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  This is just the one little piece of the timeline we're jumping in on, you understand?
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  The giant timeline, we're jumping in on one little piece of it.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  And just my limited knowledge of it, which is still way more expansive than most people out there,
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  except globalists, who use this knowledge to control people.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  Trump and myself and others are trying to decentralize this knowledge.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's the only way to save humanity.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  Now, I'm going to get to that in a moment. They believe centralizing it is the way to save humanity.
[49:44.000 --> 49:51.000]  By ending humanity, by unifying it into one huge system so that, oh, we're all too powerful as individuals.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  We could all destroy the earth at any time. We're all like gods.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  So we all have to be one now to watch each other.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  That's total insanity. The answer is into space.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  That's the answer.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  And to have a moral system based on that and have a giant launch,
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  because we are so dangerous to get as far away from each other as possible to then set up competing systems.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  And out of that new United States of the galaxy.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  And I'm serious.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  In the future, it'll create new states.
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.000]  And then you can decide what human groups or whatever humans become deal with each other.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  And that's really the real quantum leap in this thinking.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  The decision has been made to wallop the future, give you football, give you iPhones, give you entertainment,
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  have men strutting around acting tough and women all freaked out and feeling alone and wondering what happened to them.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Well, our species has been terminated.
[50:42.000 --> 50:50.000]  And then just everybody would be a bunch of selfish idiots that buy into the AI and give up with their consciousness and get phased out.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Because the globalists think they're going to get the real upgrade where they're going to become gods.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Of course they aren't.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  But believe me, what you get is not going to be that.
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  So the media will take this out of context and say, I'm insane. I made this up.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  But they don't really do that anymore.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  They do it 10 years ago because it's exactly what they're really saying.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  In fact, they're going public with it now.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  But I digress. Where was I?
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  Oh, back on the timeline.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  So Hitler is funded by Western eugenicists.
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.000]  The most popular place for eugenics in the world isn't even Germany or England or the U.S.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  It's Mexico, but that's another side issue.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  Incredible racism there by the quote upper classes.
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.000]  So I would begin saying there's a battle in all of our nations, good people and bad people, your own Edward VIII,
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  your own King, swore allegiance to Hitler.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  And I'll show photos and news articles about that.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  Queen Elizabeth, how Hitler herself as a young girl,
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  that he was going to be the new King of Europe and the European Union.
[51:49.000 --> 51:55.000]  I would then show London Guardian articles admitting that even though we broke it decades before they did.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  So I'd say so.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  I'm not saying England's bad.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  No, no, no, you're good.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  Because when it came, push came to shove, you had a secret treaty with Hitler.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  You were supposed to act like you were not really going to fight him, but stand down.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  But after Dunkirk and the rest of it, you decided to stand back up.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  And I'd go through the whole history of at least five hours, which they probably couldn't even give me.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  So it's a film we ought to make. It's a book auto, right?
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Oh, and Neil Strauss, oh, but they don't want that book released.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  They're working very hard to stop that, but they will fail.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  And again, there's just too much knowledge just to lay it all out.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  But just to give you a broad stroke here, back to the timeline.
[52:36.000 --> 52:43.000]  First, I would sit there and address them as a anglophile crowd that's a shame of their culture
[52:43.000 --> 52:48.000]  and a very diverse crowd of people from all over the world who aren't ashamed of it.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  They're coming there to take part in it.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  The birthplace of real open society, the birthplace of real open discussion.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  You know, here you are at Oxford.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  The true modern liberalism going back 800 years. I mean, here you are.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  600, even talk about technically, but 200 before that Magna Carta.
[53:04.000 --> 53:12.000]  So you pull back and you've got the British King who's really a German is really a Transylvanian sworn to Hitler.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  He's got an EU that all fails, falls apart.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  The Brits decide to not capitulate like their double Asian has set it up.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  They're the rebel Chamberlain and things are off to the races.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  And we defeat Hitler.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  But the idea and Yonker, they had the unelected EU, let that sink in unelected.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  They come back. They're still in power and they bring in the same system.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  And just like they were allied with Islam in World War Two 70 years ago,
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  they're allied with it again, the most oppressive forms of it.
[53:46.000 --> 53:56.000]  But it's a giant population to the south and to the east ready to control the critical crossroads of the Middle East into Asia,
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  into Russia, into Eurasia, into Eastern Europe, into Western Europe, into the Mediterranean.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  It's risk being played globally.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  And so that's just a very small part of it.
[54:07.000 --> 54:14.000]  And then you point out the censorship, the control, the attack on the family, all of it to debilitate you, all of it to make you weak,
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  all of it to control you, then you show the quotes with the globalists admitting how they got this plan,
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  how they are trying to end Europe, how they are trying to end Christendom, how they are trying to end the family.
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  You show the Jesuit Pope up there pushing the whole thing, trying to bring that down as well while he lives behind his walls.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  You explain.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  We are fighting the 21st century version of Hitler.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  We're literally fighting the Nazi air.
[54:40.000 --> 54:49.000]  But just as England refused Edward VIII, who was in Germany when World War II started and had to get out via Spain and move to the U.S.,
[54:49.000 --> 54:58.000]  just as you refused your Nazism then, you must do it now, but you must understand the Nazis were only a prototype test,
[54:58.000 --> 55:07.000]  and that Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley and the UN and all of them admitted and wrote books about the master plan to develop the computers,
[55:07.000 --> 55:13.000]  to merge with them, to exterminate the population, to transcend our humanity and to become a new species,
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  and the decision was made on chalkboards more than a hundred years ago,
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  and that we're now living the aftershocks of that today, and that it's not the technology's evil.
[55:25.000 --> 55:36.000]  It's that in all of it is the handiwork and the fingerprints and the Trojan horses and the spirit of the people that created Hitler as a side project.
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.000]  And then you begin to understand, and it's all oversimplified here,
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  but when you talk about the darkest hour and you talk about Winston Churchill and you talk about America,
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  America and England created Hitler.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  We wrongfully launched World War I, all of it.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  Hitler was horrible, but out of that we finally said no and turned against it.
[55:58.000 --> 56:10.000]  And who were we allied with? Russia, England, the United States against the Axis powers in World War II, and we won.
[56:10.000 --> 56:18.000]  And again, we're against an EU global power that was literally set up by Adolf Hitler and Junker's grandfather
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  with a plan to put Edward VIII on the throne of the EU that would expand.
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  They were going to put poison in the water, fluoride to lower your fertility.
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  They were going to put force vaccines with added pathogens to dumb the population down.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  They called it soft kill. That's a Nazi term.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  This was all the Rockefellers having a big powerful industrial country they could use as an experiment.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  But today Russia isn't Stalinist run.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's becoming Christian and wants to be allied with us against radical Islam.
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  So we're facing the very same EU allied with the Muslims, allied with the technocracy that created it.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  The EU calls itself a technocracy and we are in that fight.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  So we tolerate the left. We think they're mentally ill. Those are their minions. Those are their fodder.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  Those are their victims. Those are their servants. Those are their minions.
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  Those are the sad people that were weak and programmed with high tech psychology.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  But we have history. We have science. We have facts.
[57:15.000 --> 57:23.000]  And we know we're facing a eugenics breakaway civilization plan that's actually gotten off the ground to a great extent.
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.000]  And we're all facing imminent doom within 25 to 30 years if we don't stop it.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  And Elon Musk is now telling you exactly what I'm telling you.
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  Because there's patriots of the Pentagon working with him and others to try to warn people and get them to awaken to this
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  and build a new human future that Trump and other nationalists are pushing.
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  We sent out the emergency transmission. The people listened and now we're beginning to turn the tide.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  But we need you.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[57:52.000 --> 57:59.000]  So, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[58:04.000 --> 58:11.000]  And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  I use the Biotruce Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars Life products.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.000]  Absolutely.
[58:31.000 --> 58:39.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on
[58:39.000 --> 58:51.000]  and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation,
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  I'm going to speak for hours, just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[59:10.000 --> 59:16.000]  But immune wall is incredible. And folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  It's a great deal at $39.
[59:18.000 --> 59:26.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more. It is concentrated. You need to go read what is in here.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.000]  A citrus peel blend. I mean, this is the next level. It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  I think it's beyond seasonal. Beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[59:41.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  Immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com, or triple-A, 2533139.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by Globalist Propaganda.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show, tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  You know, the last segment, and I'm going to combine this segment with that last segment when we posted on YouTube and Facebook and other places.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  I got into the science fiction dreams of the British and U.S. elite that sold eugenics.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Japan, Mexico, they all bought into it, and it was an idea of how to make your people better, how to make your IQs higher, how to make people be smarter, and live long.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  That's kind of the outside of what Eugenics is, but really it was a study of what humans are going to turn into transhumanism beyond breeding, but through merging with scientific systems.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  And that's because royalty and other elites had seen the problems of their own inbreeding, taking their genetic strengths and it becoming weak.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  And they saw the native wild intelligence that would sprout up, the idiot geniuses they would call it, in the general public from time to time, and they feared that, but at the same time wanted to capture it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  So they wanted to go in with mass culling operations and numbing down operations, but also have testing very early on to target the chivalts and the other wizards that they wanted to then recruit into their systems,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  but they don't want them to ever challenge their duchy or challenge their fiefdom.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  They don't even want viceroys that rule in their steds or romantic legates that speak of the name of Caesar. They don't want that.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  They don't believe in honor based systems. They believe in pure hate, pure cutting, pure overthrow, just pure savage evil that never sleeps.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  And so they have built this total system of surveillance and they say, oh, we need world government to stop the atomic weapons we deployed and built.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Oh, we need a world government to stop the genetic engineering as they wildly go forward with the cross human animal species and all this other dangerous stuff.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And then as these disasters, both real and manufactured unfold, be they nuclear wars, mass plagues, you name it, the argument is going to then be in that whole systematic system that we must all upload ourselves into a giant hive mind,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  consciousness and we can have our personal selves and even our bodies and avatars. But the avatars will finally again not have a carbon footprint.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  That's why this is all moving and Bill Gates has admitted this and so that you will be pressured into an avatar and promised all these incredible things and promised all these great cultural
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  enrichments that you're going to get that you're going to be part of if you will simply go along with their larger world view that is to dump people down, keep them in the dark, only give them backdoor technology with Trojan horses,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  poison them and get rid of them. You're saving the earth from this horrible scourge.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  And so that's the plan and I've had globalist people say, why don't you tape them? Why don't you, why don't you release the info?
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  They say it all in books and videos and articles and public statements now. And if something's off record and somebody says, Alex, I'll tell you how stuff really works.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  Mr. Smart Guy, you're never going to save the general public. They're never going to wake up. They don't want to. That's why they're the way they are.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  The fact that you're interested in this and the fact that you know means you need to get on a plane and come up here to New York City or come to London and we're ready to hire you right now.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And then it gets down to money and they're like, you know, I'm the deputy head of this organization and I'm not making $5 million a year, Mr. Jones.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And I think this is really a good deal for you. And it's not just about the money, you know, you could do a lot more on the inside. I mean, look, 1 million a year, 3 million a year, 5 million a year, they know potential.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  That's why they're in charge. And I'm not like I'm some great dude. I'm mentally ill like Trump, they say, because I don't want to screw everybody over.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  I want to keep having grandmas and grandpas and little babies and everything else. And if people want to become cyborgs or chop their genitals off and say they're a woman, you can do that.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Here's the deal. You're not going to brainwash all the kids and everybody else to make the world so ugly. We then accept this when really it's a giant Trojan horse to get us all to kill ourselves, basically.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  And we think we're all joining some big robot systems. We can be part of the elite and, you know, be at the real country club up in the cloud. Uh-uh, baby.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Frank in North Carolina. Thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging. It just gets old, man.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  You know what, Alex?
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Hey, I put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help. As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Burning with the truth, burning with a desire to warn you, burning with victory.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  Earlier I laid out a gestalt of the admitted stated plans of almost every tech billionaire and the globalists that fund them.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  And it is a plan to bring in world government, to poison you, to dumb you down, to distract you and to make this world, the real world, so ugly that you accept being euthanized with the belief that your body is going to be uploaded into this wondrous cloud.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  And that is their actual plan, a digital hell they're creating, just as Lucifer got one-third of the angels to go with him, and then all it created was a nightmare system.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Now, whether you believe the devil exists or not, they're building a system right out of the mind of the old serpent himself.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Everything you see Elon Musk talking about today, I've been talking about for 20 years, because it's all in the source documents.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  This is your final warning, my friends. The globalists think you're dumb and think you're stupid and told me to my face many times that I'm a fool and that you are profane and don't even deserve to know this.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  I'll tell you this, I tweeted a picture Hillary Clinton yesterday, one of her reported pervert buddies, and I said, this is your elitism, this is your power, this is your grace, this is your beauty, this is your purity.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  I don't want to be within a trillion miles of you. So, if you go to my Twitter account, realelixjones, I tweeted out yesterday morning, and it just shows the evil in her eyes, and it just shows you the evil in her actions and who these people are and what they stand for.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Now, before I go any further, the Twitter's realelixjones, before I go any further, I didn't get to all this, but I will coming up, and out of Jerome Corsi's coming in with the secrets of QAnon, I'm going to have him host for two segments.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  But before I go any further here, look at all these other headlines.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Trump ignores DOJ warning once FISA memo will release. Oh, the terrorists will get us. Oh, don't release it, please. First, it was nothing, then it was made up, then it wasn't important, and then blah, blah, blah. It's the total proof of the collusion of Obama, Hillary, the Democratic Party, all of them.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Another one, amid turmoil, Trump seeks to reset the state of the Union. They don't want to reset. They want to kill our prosperity and control the economy.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Senators, Press Podesta, and other Democrats about dossier, Hillary and Podesta, the articles on infowars.com, have been told you have two weeks to turn those documents over.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  Continuing, Trump amnesty offer intended to expose Democrat cynicism. Yeah, when he said, okay, I'll go ahead and legalize all these people, they went, no, we want totally open borders.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Anybody can come here and you're a white supremacist if they want the end of the borders, folks. That's what this is. You see, they took that as weakness.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  Oh, look at this, migrants in Italy will be taught they shouldn't beat women when they say no. Isn't that just cute? Liberal California councilmen and teachers tell students military are dumb bleeps and the lowest of our low.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Bernie Sanders acknowledges Democrats forced government shutdown. It was the right thing to do to do to do because he wants to like a Nazi hurt 1.8 million people and 800,000 children in DACA.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  He wants to do even though he just said legalize them. He's just shut it down because he was going to legalize them and I mean, we can't people know that.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  And then they go, oh, he's breaking his promise. Never broke his promise. He said, if you can really prove you're here and legal and been here a long time and work it, but they've been deported a bunch of times and are criminal and can't prove it.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  You're gone. Wow. Common sense, man. So that's just some of the news. Trump tells Piers Morgan, I wouldn't say I'm a feminist, but rather for everyone. Yeah, you're pro human.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  But meanwhile, unhinged Michael Morris sales. Trump is unfit. Narcissus sociopath threat to humanity. Now, I'm going to go to this special report by Paul Watson.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  We're coming back with an detailed one that we haven't aired yet. An interview I did Friday that hasn't aired yet with Milo major studies out why are conservatives on average so much better looking than liberals and why do they also give more to charity and steal less.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  And the answer is, they're not liberals. They flipped everything. Classical liberals set up our country. They're pro gun. They're for low taxes. They're for do what you want. Long don't hurt somebody. The left or control freaks that want to run every aspect of your life. Here's that report.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Political activists and journalists yet not noted for their visual appeal. But now science has confirmed what we knew all along. Conservatives are way hotter than liberals. A new study published by Cambridge University Press finds that conservative men and women tend to be physically more attractive than their political opponents.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  We find that attractive individuals are more likely to identify with the Republican Party and more likely to be conservative. The researchers concluded. So they used huge data sets and all the participants were ranked by other people on their hotness and conservatives clearly came out on top.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  This confirms a previous UCLA study which found more feminine, less manly looking women were more likely to be conservatives. Even archfeminist Lindy West admits that conservative women are prettier.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  Remember that scene in The Shining where he kisses the hot naked chick who then turns into some kind of zombie witch? Well, scientists have now confirmed that communism has the exact same effect on women. Turns out being a resentful, snarling loser manifests itself physically.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Why do you think fat social justice warriors are constantly trying to ban offensive Halloween outfits? Sexy slender women in tight fitting costumes everywhere. Yeah, it's not rocket science.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  I'm triggered. Why do you think they tried to ban beach body ads? Same reason. The Alberta youth communists leave.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Now I'm not saying these people are ugly, but when they try to take selfies their phones spontaneously combust. Look at these anti-milo protesters at UCLA.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  If they put as much effort into grooming as they do, silencing free speech, maybe they wouldn't look like Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow's bastard love child. Just saying.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Look at the girl on the right. Get it? On the right?
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  She's got less armpit hair than Vern Troyer's got head hair. That's for the girl on the left. Not even a soy boy is going to want to touch that spaghett.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Somebody touch my spaghett. How do you know what that means? No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. No, it's nice.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  Shut up, Hillary girl versus Lena Donut. Let's just say I'm with her. How to be anti-feminist woman on YouTube, hot, hate of the women, nearly a teenager, unhealthy pathological need for male approval.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  How to be a feminist woman on YouTube, ugly, hate hot women, hate young hot women, unhealthy need for hair dye.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  Kill Donald Trump and then it says kill Mike Pence and then it says it's guillotine time, bitches.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  But Paul, I can give you a million examples of liberals who are ugly.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Yeah, they're celebrities. If they weren't liberals, they wouldn't have a career. I'm talking about activists and journalists. Like this woman.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Now, I know they say stand up for your rights, but in this case, probably not a good idea.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  Why do you think the vast majority of the journalists exposed as sex pervs have been lefties?
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Because they're ugly, they hate themselves and are therefore very unsuccessful at attracting women in the normal way.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  I mean, the elephant man gets more right swipes on Tinder than Sam Chris.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  But Paul, stop being such a bigot. People are beautiful at any size.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Unless you disagree with their politics, in which case they're an obese tyrant or an emaciated skank.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Unless you digitally remove their makeup and then you all have a meltdown.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Now we cross life to CNN for a special report by me.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Is radical feminism a refuge for fat, ugly women who can't attract high value men?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  The stereotype generally holds true because they look like swamp donkeys.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Kind of sad, honestly.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Speaking of CNN, everyone's mad at them for promoting cuckoldry.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  But a study in France found that leftists were more likely to be into it.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  So CNN's only appealing to its core audience who in many cases are quite literally cucks.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  So there you have it. It's not my opinion that conservatives are hotter than leftists. It's science.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  It works. It is.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Alright, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  I'm going to come back and play Milo's report that I shot in here Friday that we haven't aired yet.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  But just briefly, the crew's reminding me, this is a big operation.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  I haven't plugged one time. I get so obsessed with news.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  We have great products at M4Store.com with the ultimate turmeric product.

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  These are all parasites.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Living Defense, M4WarsLive.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
