[00:00.000 --> 00:29.040]  We should be treated as a bunch of thugs, insurrectionists, white supremacists, anti-Semites,
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.440]  Sikhs, and is not enough, I mean, come on, you know, these shirts they're wearing, these
[00:33.440 --> 00:39.040]  are a bunch of thugs, thugs, and they're terrorist, domestic terrorists.
[00:39.040 --> 00:46.200]  In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.840]  motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of
[00:51.840 --> 00:52.840]  the white race.
[00:52.840 --> 00:57.520]  The thing they want to do is to better share and coordinate all the vast trove of data
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.120]  they already collect on Americans, because let's not forget, DHS includes the Transportation
[01:02.120 --> 01:07.040]  Security Administration, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, so every time people travel they
[01:07.040 --> 01:10.920]  encounter DHS, and there's a lot of travel information, another information that they
[01:10.920 --> 01:16.040]  already have, they want to do a better job of analyzing it to hunt for domestic terrorists.
[01:16.040 --> 01:24.040]  We can declare al-Qaeda or ISIS foreign terror groups and, you know, take investigative action
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.480]  against them, because they have no First Amendment rights, they're not in the U.S., but we can't
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.040]  do that with the 3%ers or the Proud Boys or the Boogaloo Boys, and that's the challenge
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.040]  for the governor.
[01:35.040 --> 01:41.400]  Now, let's go ahead and put on screen for everybody something that came from an NBC
[01:41.400 --> 01:44.520]  news program on NBC National.
[01:44.520 --> 01:50.000]  People were pretty shocked because it is an extremely authoritarian statement.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.960]  Real terror threats, opposition to COVID measures, claims of election fraud, belief Trump can
[01:57.960 --> 02:03.520]  be reinstated, 9-11 anniversary and religious holidays.
[02:03.520 --> 02:08.080]  Now, where is there evidence that people that want to reinstate Trump or question the election
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.760]  are going to blow stuff up?
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.480]  And where is there evidence that people protesting masks that don't work and experimental vaccines
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.560]  that don't work and make people sick?
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.840]  Where is there evidence that we're terrorists, much less that we're the number one terror
[02:23.840 --> 02:25.080]  threat?
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.280]  I learned about it two months ago when they issued the new official policy of the Biden
[02:31.280 --> 02:37.440]  administration, the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, but that's really
[02:37.440 --> 02:41.960]  what they're doing is conducting terrorism against us with the Chinese bio-weapon that
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.400]  their controllers released to take control of the United States.
[02:45.400 --> 02:51.000]  So let's see, the average person online thinks it's voodoo to know anything.
[02:51.000 --> 03:00.040]  So they thought I must have magically just thought this up on my own or I'm in the CIA
[03:00.040 --> 03:02.400]  as if people in the CIA know anything.
[03:02.400 --> 03:05.000]  That's a low-level criminal organization.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.160]  So here it is.
[03:07.160 --> 03:14.200]  Opposition to COVID measures is terrorism, claims of election fraud is terrorism, belief
[03:14.200 --> 03:16.320]  that Trump can be reinstated is terrorism.
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.480]  As soon as Biden got his way in through fraud in January of this year, now six and a half
[03:22.480 --> 03:29.200]  months ago, the first press conferences they had with General Milley and with Jen Psaki
[03:29.200 --> 03:36.200]  and with all these people and the Justice Department was protesting the election is
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.200]  terror.
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.560]  And then on page 10 of the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism came out
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.120]  two months ago, they made an official policy.
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.960]  They said any narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.920]  the violent breach of the U.S. Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and conspiracy
[03:56.920 --> 04:04.000]  theories promoting violence will almost certainly spur some one to try to engage in violence.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  So who tried to engage in violence last year and this year?
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.120]  They claim things only got serious when the informants planted by the FBI got involved.
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.720]  The defense also portrayed online posts involving violent rhetoric about the governor as satire
[04:18.720 --> 04:23.520]  and their activities only escalating once an FBI confidential informant got involved.
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.000]  He told his group he wants Governor Whitmer's head on a platter.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Okay.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.320]  And that could be satire as well?
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.120]  I guess I don't think that's funny.
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.760]  I mean, either way, I feel like I haven't you heard similar things about President Trump
[04:41.760 --> 04:44.720]  on late night TV.
[04:44.720 --> 04:51.720]  There's one plot to kidnap a governor because of the lockdown and that was the FBI creating
[04:51.720 --> 04:52.720]  the whole thing.
[04:52.720 --> 04:57.160]  And so just remember that's who they're hiring, that's who they're preparing the total war
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.840]  with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:59.840 --> 05:07.160]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.880]  I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[05:12.880 --> 05:13.880]  in the arena.
[05:13.880 --> 05:17.560]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[05:17.560 --> 05:21.480]  But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear.
[05:21.480 --> 05:26.920]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.720]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[05:29.720 --> 05:35.920]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off
[05:35.920 --> 05:37.480]  on all the amazing products.

[05:40.720 --> 05:44.720]  And then you fund info wars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the
[05:44.720 --> 05:45.720]  globalist.
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.880]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[05:49.880 --> 05:54.400]  And if you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation, and it stands
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.960]  up against the globalist bullies.
[05:55.960 --> 06:22.360]  Mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[06:22.360 --> 06:34.080]  They really got us, they got us in the jaws of a scientific takeover, a medical tyranny
[06:34.080 --> 06:38.480]  where the hospitals and clinics are turned into prisons and where all of us are evil
[06:38.480 --> 06:42.000]  suspects that must be hunted down by the contact tracers.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.880]  This isn't some dystopic science fiction book written 50 years ago.
[06:45.880 --> 06:48.360]  This is the reality of where we are today.
[06:48.360 --> 06:54.120]  I know everybody's marveling at Afghanistan and people holding onto jet aircraft and falling
[06:54.120 --> 06:58.720]  from thousands of feet to their deaths and just the incredible carnage and the Taliban
[06:58.720 --> 07:02.880]  confiscating the guns, which is what tyrants always do.
[07:02.880 --> 07:06.760]  And Biden's incredibly horrible 15 minute speech where he looked like he was actually
[07:06.760 --> 07:13.760]  falling asleep from moment to moment and becoming psychologically incontinent.
[07:13.760 --> 07:16.400]  This just all spells doom and disaster, doesn't it?
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.920]  And that's what happens when you turn away from God.
[07:18.920 --> 07:25.000]  I wasn't looking at Russian news this morning, but it popped up in a feed on YouTube and
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.960]  it was Vladimir Putin, I guess a few weeks ago, pointing out that America is no longer
[07:30.960 --> 07:36.680]  a Christian nation and that Europe and Russia need to become Christian again and get back
[07:36.680 --> 07:40.560]  to their Christian values or they will fall like we're falling.
[07:40.560 --> 07:47.160]  And Putin genuinely does not want the United States to fall because it's an ideological
[07:47.160 --> 07:48.160]  issue.
[07:48.160 --> 07:54.320]  They've gone through 87 years of the very same Bolshevik Communist that run Hollywood
[07:54.320 --> 08:00.240]  running them and they understand it's fulfilling to become Christian and free market and family
[08:00.240 --> 08:05.680]  again after the horrible boot of the left was on their throat for 87 years.
[08:05.680 --> 08:12.880]  But the Russians never got one tent as pedophilic and as satanic as we've gotten.
[08:12.880 --> 08:15.040]  I mean, we have really gone to sea.
[08:15.040 --> 08:18.360]  They were under communism, but men were men, women were women.
[08:18.360 --> 08:22.400]  And if you tried to screw a kid, you'd get killed.
[08:22.400 --> 08:27.680]  Now it's all happening out in the open and we are a giant virtue signaling clown show
[08:27.680 --> 08:33.560]  of shallow people that don't have any true grit or any actual mooring or directive in
[08:33.560 --> 08:37.240]  them and that's how we've been programmed by the television, by the smartphones, by
[08:37.240 --> 08:42.680]  the culture and that's in the medical and scientific and psychological and psychiatric
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.920]  reports that the average American particularly, but also Canadians, also Australians were
[08:47.920 --> 08:55.800]  all from the same type culture have become mesmerized and are in a trance and are walking
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.240]  headlong over the edge of a cliff.
[08:59.240 --> 09:01.640]  Whether you're in Germany or whether you're in New Zealand or whether you're in Australia
[09:01.640 --> 09:04.920]  or whether you're in the United States, whether you're in the UK, it's the exact same global
[09:04.920 --> 09:10.440]  government, the exact same projects, the exact same programs with the QR codes and getting
[09:10.440 --> 09:12.200]  rid of the menus a year and a half ago.
[09:12.200 --> 09:15.200]  And then, oh, now you got to have a QR code to come in the restaurant to prove that you've
[09:15.200 --> 09:19.080]  been quote vaccinated, but it's not even a vaccine.
[09:19.080 --> 09:24.840]  And now really the big news, explosive amounts of people being sick.
[09:24.840 --> 09:26.880]  Last year it was fake numbers.
[09:26.880 --> 09:31.520]  People with cancer, it was people with pneumonia, it was people with all sorts of other diseases
[09:31.520 --> 09:33.040]  and issues being called COVID.
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.160]  And that all came out, the PCR test was fake and we were proven right.
[09:37.160 --> 09:44.560]  All the scientists we had on and the hundreds that we covered were proven correct.
[09:44.560 --> 09:55.600]  And now we have all the literature on record and scientists warning that this live virus
[09:55.600 --> 10:01.760]  vaccine, all four of the approved in the West vaccines are not vaccines, two of them are
[10:01.760 --> 10:04.760]  live virus vector systems that use live virus to deliver it.
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.280]  And the mRNA basically sends the same type of RNA message like a virus would do to the
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.200]  surface of the cell, then takes it in and changes its programming.
[10:15.200 --> 10:21.200]  And then orders the cell to recognize that and to produce that, which is a toxic substance,
[10:21.200 --> 10:23.200]  the spike protein.
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.880]  The spike protein of the lab made, COVID-19 is the HIV spike protein delivery system that
[10:29.880 --> 10:36.280]  is a incontrovertible fact, now totally confirmed by multiple Nobel Prize winners and the different
[10:36.280 --> 10:38.480]  scanning systems they have.
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.240]  So it's not a virus in the classical sense, it is the shell of the virus.
[10:44.240 --> 10:48.320]  That's why they only find the shell of the virus because that's actually what they've
[10:48.320 --> 10:52.040]  produced and what they've deployed against us.
[10:52.040 --> 10:57.040]  And they did countless tests to develop this plan directed by Fauci and by Bill Gates and
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.840]  it is sickening and very painful.
[10:59.840 --> 11:07.000]  When you read all the UT studies and the John Hopkins studies and the Baylor Medical School
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.120]  studies and all of them, the New England Medical Journal studies, the congressional hearings
[11:14.120 --> 11:22.000]  where they say, you can never create a vaccine for a cold virus because they're too common
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.520]  and you'll cause an autoimmune response or a group of responses in the body that will
[11:26.520 --> 11:27.520]  kill you.
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.120]  So again, I've got hundreds of articles, hundreds of clips, incredible guests coming
[11:31.120 --> 11:32.120]  up.
[11:32.120 --> 11:34.040]  I've got so much news, I can talk for hours.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.560]  You're like, Alex, we know this.
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.680]  Well, you already are awake and you've warned people.
[11:37.680 --> 11:40.960]  We've got to warn other people and we have a new list of shooting in every minute.
[11:40.960 --> 11:48.200]  So the central issue is that this is a program that makes us sicker, not better, not healthier.
[11:48.200 --> 11:53.120]  This is a program that, like a wood chipper, sucks you into it and the more you give into
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.280]  it, the worse it gets.
[11:56.280 --> 12:06.160]  And all of this was formulaically developed by MI6 psychological warfare brigade and Princeton
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.200]  and Harvard psychology departments and it's in the news that in the last decade they developed
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.800]  this plan under Operation Lockstep and are now crafting the messages worldwide through
[12:15.800 --> 12:24.200]  the UN and then through big tech that centers anybody challenging their bull so that they
[12:24.200 --> 12:30.640]  can block real treatments, save people died of COVID that didn't kill whoever they want,
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.720]  not let you in to see your family turning the hospitals into prisons where if a medical
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.000]  doctor politely argues with them who's in the hospital, they put them in four-point
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.200]  restraints.
[12:44.200 --> 12:49.600]  This is a tyrannical revolution of low IQ people being put in positions of power by
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.240]  the globalists to rule over the rest of us.
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.720]  It's a very dangerous situation.
[12:53.720 --> 12:57.440]  I've seen this tweet all over the place, not even looking for it.
[12:57.440 --> 12:58.440]  You people can listen.
[12:58.440 --> 13:02.120]  Alex Jones, he's an idiot, I listen to the scientists.
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.720]  All the scientists say the vaccine's 100% approved and affected and works great and
[13:07.720 --> 13:09.200]  none of that's true.
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.120]  Almost all the scientists and doctors are saying what I'm saying, almost all of them.
[13:14.120 --> 13:16.640]  But they're all gaslit and shut down and censored.
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.640]  I mean, it is just absolutely incredible.
[13:20.640 --> 13:24.280]  To the point of even if you have a doctor's note saying I can't take these shots, I've
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.240]  had an autoimmune response or I've got a disease where I can't, they say we don't care, you're
[13:29.240 --> 13:30.240]  still fired.
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.360]  It's all about doing what we say and letting us hurt you.
[13:34.360 --> 13:39.800]  And so yes, there are people sick all over the place with a variety of respiratory diseases.
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.560]  They're reporting the highest level of other respiratory diseases in children.
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.480]  Bacterial viral pneumonia, these other viruses all beginning into today.
[13:49.480 --> 13:52.080]  And that's really what's hurting and killing the kids.
[13:52.080 --> 13:53.080]  And why is that?
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.580]  Because the masks grow all of that in them on record.
[13:56.580 --> 13:57.580]  Even Bill Marno's that.
[13:57.580 --> 14:02.400]  He talked about the study on the show, you know, how these things are just little germ
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.400]  factories.
[14:03.400 --> 14:04.400]  But see, these people don't care.
[14:04.400 --> 14:06.680]  They're wearing a diaper over their face.
[14:06.680 --> 14:11.520]  If you were designed to have a diaper over your face, you would have evolved, if you
[14:11.520 --> 14:14.760]  believe in that, with that system where God would have put one on you.
[14:14.760 --> 14:17.760]  So we're literally mugged.
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.760]  We're literally kidnapped.
[14:19.760 --> 14:22.600]  We're literally being gaslit at a level never before seen.
[14:22.600 --> 14:25.920]  But I want the crew to pull something up for the next segment.
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.520]  Just type in the man who cannot be named.
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.520]  And it's an image from three years ago in a big, wired magazine article, how great it
[14:34.520 --> 14:37.840]  is that Alex Jones is being silenced and now they need to silence everybody else.
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.520]  And it shows a black hand over my mouth, pulling me into the darkness.
[14:42.520 --> 14:45.600]  But look how much that hand looks like a mask.
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.280]  That's what that is.
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.760]  You're literally being muzzled.
[14:48.760 --> 14:51.160]  You're, you're being told you're dirty.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.160]  You're a suspect.
[14:52.160 --> 14:53.160]  You're a patient.
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.160]  You're bad now.
[14:54.160 --> 15:00.840]  When we come back all over the world from the UK, we have the footage and from Australia
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.560]  and from the United States, they're building COVID emergency centers with the military.
[15:05.560 --> 15:07.720]  They've announced this in Oregon and other states.
[15:07.720 --> 15:11.960]  We've got clips of that and they're announcing they will come to your house.
[15:11.960 --> 15:14.000]  If not this fall next year, they're going to be ready.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.480]  It's already happening around the world, but we're about a year behind and forcibly taking
[15:17.480 --> 15:18.480]  you away.
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.480]  That will then cause shootouts and they will then say, we're all terrorists, even though
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.560]  they're coming at us with an unapproved, deadly poison.
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.240]  This is Tuskegee experiment 2.0.
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.240]  This is Joseph Mingla.
[15:29.240 --> 15:31.040]  I mean, this is a classic takeover.
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.960]  We're going to look at all that, but the really big news is the fact that they are building
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.200]  this permanent martial law police state in and around COVID all over the world.
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.720]  And so what you see in Australia and Spain and England and Scotland and Ireland is coming
[15:44.720 --> 15:46.360]  here and it's already being set up.
[15:46.360 --> 15:50.800]  We have all that news and then we have the big enchilada that I'll cover first.
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.280]  Yes, they're getting ready to make the third injection mandatory.
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.200]  We'll tell you about that.
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.040]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.720]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.720 --> 16:08.720]  Here's why.
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.680]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.720]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.880]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and
[16:22.880 --> 16:26.800]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.960]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.480]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.480 --> 16:40.800]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:40.800 --> 16:41.800]  too.
[16:41.800 --> 16:45.440]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.440 --> 16:47.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[16:52.000 --> 16:55.880]  medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.000]  Here's free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.600]  Hey, everybody.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.520]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:04.520 --> 17:05.520]  news.
[17:05.520 --> 17:07.640]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.640 --> 17:08.640]  Here's the thing.
[17:08.640 --> 17:14.160]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.440]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.240]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.240 --> 17:27.680]  The best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher
[17:27.680 --> 17:32.760]  food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:32.760 --> 17:33.760]  Gets even better.
[17:33.760 --> 17:38.420]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:38.420 --> 17:43.680]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:43.680 --> 17:44.680]  world, period.
[17:44.680 --> 17:51.120]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:51.120 --> 18:00.560]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:00.560 --> 18:05.360]  So when I first started taking survival soup, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[18:05.360 --> 18:07.760]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[18:07.760 --> 18:12.280]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.880]  So the first one I got was the original survival soup, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[18:16.880 --> 18:19.720]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that soup, you had, you know, with a
[18:19.720 --> 18:22.800]  deep-burdened source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[18:22.800 --> 18:29.200]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.920]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.920]  the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all
[18:37.920 --> 18:38.920]  of your supplements.
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.920]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.360]  The one I like recently is knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[18:45.360 --> 18:46.360]  It's amazing.
[18:46.360 --> 18:47.360]  It works.
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.680]  The thing is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of the globalist system,
[18:51.680 --> 18:55.240]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.400]  Beautifully said, brother.
[18:56.400 --> 19:00.480]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.

[19:29.520 --> 19:31.840]  than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.760]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint, and so much more
[19:36.760 --> 19:41.400]  back at stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash with the activated charcoal and
[19:41.400 --> 19:42.400]  essential oils.

[19:43.400 --> 19:44.400]  These are great products.

[19:50.600 --> 19:52.920]  The cell runs for only one week.
[19:52.920 --> 19:57.840]  It is the Boost Your Bodies Natural Defenses Supercell, and another part of the cell ending
[19:57.840 --> 20:26.840]  is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[20:28.840 --> 20:36.360]  And Facebook said you can only speak of him badly, do not speak of him good.
[20:36.360 --> 20:40.200]  And I warned Trump, I said they're coming for you next, they're gonna ban you off Twitter,
[20:40.200 --> 20:43.600]  I told him that over the phone one time, he didn't like hearing it.
[20:43.600 --> 20:51.320]  Oh, we gotta do something about that Alex, oh, we're working on the situation.
[20:51.320 --> 20:57.280]  We're monitoring the situation, that's what Biden said yesterday in his 15 minute flop
[20:57.280 --> 21:00.600]  of a speech.
[21:00.600 --> 21:04.040]  So let me show you the big news here, and this is a window into everything.
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.440]  If you understand this, you understand everything, and hopefully you can talk to your friends
[21:07.440 --> 21:11.760]  and family and get them to not be emotional and actually know what's happening.
[21:11.760 --> 21:13.560]  Overhead shot please.
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.280]  This is the standard COVID-19 vaccination record card.
[21:17.280 --> 21:21.000]  They're like this in Japan, they're like this in France, they're like this in Canada,
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  they're like this everywhere.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.280]  They just have the National Health Service seal of the particular country.
[21:27.280 --> 21:36.320]  And if you notice, it's got a space here for four shots over every year.
[21:36.320 --> 21:41.040]  Now these cards started coming out eight months ago here in the US about 10 months ago in
[21:41.040 --> 21:44.240]  the UK, remember?
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.960]  And remember I pointed out then, I said, hey, do you notice that they have a shot every
[21:48.960 --> 21:55.000]  year because if you read the Pfizer plan and you read the Moderna plan and what the perspectives
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.840]  they put out, and that's what we covered last year was the patents on all this.
[22:01.840 --> 22:07.160]  They talk about vaccines for the new variants of COVID every year because they knew it would
[22:07.160 --> 22:08.800]  create all these new variants.
[22:08.800 --> 22:12.480]  And of course, the shot they make will never have any effect on that new variant just like
[22:12.480 --> 22:19.360]  the flu shot never works because they never picked the right mutation of the flu.
[22:19.360 --> 22:20.360]  So then why do they do it?
[22:20.360 --> 22:23.600]  Because they want the precedent to track and trace and control you and put in your body
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.080]  what they want and to quarantine and disappear people because then there's no due process
[22:28.080 --> 22:34.800]  and they've moved all the way down the field and scored a major touchdown for tyranny.
[22:34.800 --> 22:35.800]  So again, it was all premeditated.
[22:35.800 --> 22:38.120]  Do you want me to play Bill Gates over a year ago?
[22:38.120 --> 22:41.520]  Do you want me to play 14, 15 months ago, 16 months ago?
[22:41.520 --> 22:42.840]  Gosh, March of last year.
[22:42.840 --> 22:43.840]  How long ago was that?
[22:43.840 --> 22:44.840]  16 months ago.
[22:44.840 --> 22:52.080]  Would you like me to play him saying, oh, you'll need yearly boosters?
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.760]  Because they had this all tested on rats and they know the booster doesn't work either.
[22:56.760 --> 23:01.440]  It makes you sicker and I can play you the head scientist of the main UK laboratory that's
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.040]  the most powerful in the world that sets all the precedents, Dr. Bauer.
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.720]  I played the clip probably 10 times in the last month and he says, it's really quite
[23:09.720 --> 23:10.720]  remarkable.
[23:10.720 --> 23:14.120]  Yes, you'll need shots every year from now on.
[23:14.120 --> 23:18.120]  It's really a therapeutic gene therapy.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.440]  It's not a vaccine.
[23:21.440 --> 23:28.720]  Real vaccines like for tetanus or polio work for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
[23:28.720 --> 23:35.960]  If you survive the side effects or if it's not contaminated with SV 40 cancer virus,
[23:35.960 --> 23:39.760]  like over 100 million doses were and even the federal government estimates that more
[23:39.760 --> 23:44.480]  than 20 million people died, I'm going to say that again, 20 million cancers are tracked
[23:44.480 --> 23:52.560]  that cause death directly to Simeon virus 40.
[23:52.560 --> 24:03.040]  But by the way, they never even denied any of that.
[24:03.040 --> 24:11.040]  My dear sweet grandmother, my last one to go, 92 makes my heart actually beat.
[24:11.040 --> 24:14.040]  I think about it was a beautiful smart woman.
[24:14.040 --> 24:16.040]  It was crippled from the time my mother was four years old.
[24:16.040 --> 24:22.920]  Her brother was nine refused to be in a wheelchair so can barely walk on crutches, ate most of
[24:22.920 --> 24:23.920]  the nerves in her body.
[24:23.920 --> 24:29.880]  She was in excruciating pain her whole life after that happened.
[24:29.880 --> 24:39.520]  The doctor told her, Benny, Benny Grace, hammer, Benny, yeah, it was the, it was, it was, it
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.240]  was the polio vaccine gave it to you.
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.280]  And I have AP saying the main cause of polio is the vaccine and that it's a live virus.
[24:45.280 --> 24:46.920]  I'm going to explain this again.
[24:46.920 --> 24:51.000]  These are all live virus vaccines.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.760]  If you want to call them a vaccine, the Moderna, the J and J, the AstraZeneca, they're all
[24:58.760 --> 24:59.760]  virus vectors.
[24:59.760 --> 25:02.640]  They do the same damn thing the MRA ones do.
[25:02.640 --> 25:05.840]  They use a virus actually shoot it into the cell.
[25:05.840 --> 25:10.640]  Whereas the MRA comes up and programs the cell to do it itself.
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.000]  As far as we know, they're probably even worse.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.840]  But the point is, is that they know that.
[25:18.840 --> 25:20.080]  They know it doesn't protect you.
[25:20.080 --> 25:22.800]  They know it screws you up.
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.480]  And my dear sweet grandmother had her life basically wrecked because of that.
[25:27.480 --> 25:30.840]  And I'm getting tired of this crap.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.720]  Sock was a horrible, uh, eugenesis to there's famous quotes of him in major newspapers.
[25:35.720 --> 25:37.600]  He was like, Oh, well, it's a big deal.
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.960]  We put cancer virus in the vaccine.
[25:38.960 --> 25:39.960]  There's too many people.
[25:39.960 --> 25:40.960]  Anyways.
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.600]  Oh, but if you went to socks office when he said that and shot him, which I'm not saying
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.240]  do, Oh, you go to prison.
[25:46.240 --> 25:48.040]  Oh, you can't shoot him.
[25:48.040 --> 25:52.600]  He's just going to kill you with cancer viruses and you're going to kiss his white lab coats
[25:52.600 --> 25:55.600]  ass.
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.440]  So you just put up with these monsters.
[25:59.440 --> 26:00.880]  They think there's too many of us.
[26:00.880 --> 26:02.840]  They're deceiving us to call us off.
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.800]  And now you think the stuff they did in the 50s and 60s and 70s was bad shooting black
[26:06.800 --> 26:07.800]  people up with syphilis.
[26:07.800 --> 26:08.800]  The list goes on and on.
[26:08.800 --> 26:10.760]  I just use that because people actually know about the skinny.
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.960]  You know, there's thousands of declassified studies done to every group you can imagine.
[26:14.960 --> 26:15.960]  Always poor.
[26:15.960 --> 26:22.040]  Always couldn't stand up for themselves where they would take little kids and radiate them
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.840]  to death and of course have sex with them because if you can get scientists to radiate
[26:27.840 --> 26:31.920]  kids to death or inject black people syphilis, what do you think those scientists are doing
[26:31.920 --> 26:33.960]  on their off hours?
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.400]  They're screwing kids and stuff.
[26:36.400 --> 26:42.800]  They're psychotic megalomaniac lunatics that make the guy in American Psycho look like
[26:42.800 --> 26:45.120]  a choir boy.
[26:45.120 --> 26:51.360]  And until you figure that out, we don't have any hope.
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.440]  So they had this all preplanned.
[26:53.440 --> 26:55.920]  They admit they have it all preplanned.
[26:55.920 --> 27:01.480]  But you can't get the public to go read documents or pre-filings where a month before they announced
[27:01.480 --> 27:11.440]  COVID-19, Peter Dazek and all the Bill Gates' people under Fauci said, okay, here's the order.
[27:11.440 --> 27:16.880]  Make the vaccine for this sequence, for this virus, which they already had in the lab,
[27:16.880 --> 27:21.600]  which Dazek admits they created in an interview he did months before they even announced that.
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.720]  So, I mean, it's all there.
[27:23.720 --> 27:31.160]  Just the public's so ignorant and so scientifically illiterate that people don't understand.
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.040]  But here it all is, COVID-19 vaccine cards.
[27:34.040 --> 27:37.480]  And once you're done, we've got Trudeau up in Canada.
[27:37.480 --> 27:39.360]  I played to this clip a few weeks ago.
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.560]  He says, yeah, we've bought vaccines out through 2025.
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.200]  And he goes, in 2025, you get two.
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.480]  How the hell would he know that whatever they're planning, it's all prescripted that in 2025,
[27:50.480 --> 27:53.760]  you go back to getting two a year?
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.320]  He says, we partner with Pfizer.
[27:55.320 --> 27:56.640]  What is Israel just announced?
[27:56.640 --> 27:57.840]  The same thing.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.840]  What is Australia announcing?
[27:58.840 --> 27:59.840]  The same thing.
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.600]  Do you understand?
[28:04.600 --> 28:10.200]  And when Australia tried to make its own vaccine, which was a attenuated real vaccine, they went,
[28:10.200 --> 28:17.400]  oh, my God, it tests positive for HIV because it was an attenuated COVID.
[28:17.400 --> 28:18.880]  And what is the COVID virus?
[28:18.880 --> 28:25.840]  COVID-19 is a souped up cold virus with an HIV delivery system.
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.640]  Not the HIV RNA, the HIV delivery system.
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.480]  And I said back in March of last year, I said, I bet that regular attenuated vaccines come
[28:34.480 --> 28:39.640]  up false positive for HIV because you're not really false positive.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.640]  You have the protein of HIV in you.
[28:42.640 --> 28:43.640]  And that's all there.
[28:43.640 --> 28:44.640]  That's a fact.
[28:44.640 --> 28:48.280]  So what's sloughing on everybody from the vaccinated who are saying we're back as we
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.040]  don't take all these shots, they're walking around sloughing HIV protein on everybody.
[28:53.040 --> 28:55.920]  They're basically giving us all a form of HIV.
[28:55.920 --> 29:03.560]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:03.560 --> 29:04.560]  Me too.
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.720]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:08.720 --> 29:11.480]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.480 --> 29:15.840]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.560]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.560 --> 29:18.760]  I certainly do.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.760]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.120]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:24.120 --> 29:28.200]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.200 --> 29:34.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.520]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.520]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support
[29:40.520 --> 29:44.560]  product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[29:44.560 --> 29:48.480]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.480 --> 29:52.400]  supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.

[29:58.400 --> 30:03.320]  Let's go to one in Connecticut.
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.320]  You're on the air.
[30:04.320 --> 30:05.320]  Thanks for holding.
[30:05.320 --> 30:06.320]  I sure can, sir.
[30:06.320 --> 30:07.320]  Thank you.
[30:07.320 --> 30:08.320]  Hey, Alex.
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.320]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking
[30:12.320 --> 30:13.320]  right now here, man.
[30:13.320 --> 30:15.320]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[30:15.320 --> 30:18.320]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[30:18.320 --> 30:24.440]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers
[30:24.440 --> 30:25.440]  that drive.
[30:25.440 --> 30:26.440]  There's a couple of us.
[30:26.440 --> 30:28.440]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[30:28.440 --> 30:35.440]  We used to be on Monster, and Red Bull, and all that, and I have lost weight because
[30:35.440 --> 30:38.440]  I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[30:38.440 --> 30:43.200]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[30:43.200 --> 30:44.200]  there is.
[30:44.200 --> 30:46.440]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[30:46.440 --> 30:49.440]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[30:49.440 --> 30:52.840]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the
[30:52.840 --> 30:56.960]  best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your
[30:56.960 --> 30:58.560]  life better, so that means a lot to me.
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.560]  Thank you.
[30:59.560 --> 31:00.560]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[31:00.560 --> 31:04.320]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six
[31:04.320 --> 31:08.640]  plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and an off-wash.
[31:08.640 --> 31:12.080]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best-seller with it six months,
[31:12.080 --> 31:15.960]  and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't
[31:15.960 --> 31:16.960]  had it.
[31:16.960 --> 31:20.080]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[31:20.080 --> 31:21.080]  Believe me, I'm happy, too.
[31:21.080 --> 31:24.080]  It's a great toothpaste, and it funds the info war, so if you want to get it and stock
[31:24.080 --> 31:27.880]  up on it because you were already a fan, or if you haven't tried it, it's back in stock
[31:27.880 --> 31:33.080]  at infowarstore.com, discounted because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist
[31:33.080 --> 31:36.000]  siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.200]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock, and it's available
[31:40.200 --> 31:46.920]  in only two places, infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones Naturals.com.
[31:46.920 --> 31:51.280]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash, so get your activated charcoal
[31:51.280 --> 31:56.840]  toothpaste, activated charcoal, mouthwash with central oils and more at infowarstore.com
[31:56.840 --> 32:00.320]  and fund the info war, a true 360 win.
[32:00.320 --> 32:05.120]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[32:05.120 --> 32:07.840]  for beta testing to operational.
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.600]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[32:12.600 --> 32:16.600]  takeover, but the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others
[32:16.600 --> 32:20.600]  have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find
[32:20.600 --> 32:21.600]  it off.
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.800]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[32:25.800 --> 32:27.440]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[32:27.440 --> 32:29.920]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[32:29.920 --> 32:34.160]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[32:34.160 --> 32:35.920]  others is absolutely essential.
[32:35.920 --> 32:40.400]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[32:40.400 --> 32:44.080]  on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[32:44.080 --> 32:46.520]  also funding our operation.
[32:46.520 --> 32:51.560]  So get them today at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that
[32:51.560 --> 32:55.560]  have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats
[32:55.560 --> 33:03.640]  and others, so get them today at infowarstore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[33:03.640 --> 33:23.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.200 --> 33:27.400]  The Taliban is not the South, the North Vietnamese Army.
[33:27.400 --> 33:31.640]  They're not, they're not remotely comparable in terms of capability.
[33:31.640 --> 33:36.640]  There's gonna be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a
[33:36.640 --> 33:41.640]  embassy in the, of the United States from Afghanistan.
[33:41.640 --> 33:54.840]  All right, folks, welcome back to the Alex Jones show, and we can sit here all day long
[33:54.840 --> 34:01.920]  and we can make fun of Biden being a dementia patient, we can sit there and say, oh, look
[34:01.920 --> 34:05.560]  what an idiot he is, look at the withdrawal, how pathetic it is, it embarrasses America.
[34:05.560 --> 34:09.720]  You have to understand, this is all being done by design.
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.760]  And if you expand on that, and if you pull back from that, everything is about humiliating
[34:13.760 --> 34:14.760]  and bankrupting America.
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.600]  Everything is about us building the global empire at our expense.
[34:18.600 --> 34:21.080]  And now we're getting down to the point where the American empire is supposed to be phased
[34:21.080 --> 34:22.080]  out.
[34:22.080 --> 34:28.360]  We're gonna see how far the trilateral commission right about and say, oh, I missed it.
[34:28.360 --> 34:31.520]  That's what I'm gonna take a break.
[34:31.520 --> 34:38.320]  I'm gonna restart because this just, I gotta take a break now.
[34:38.320 --> 34:43.320]  I got so much important stuff to cover here, folks, got a lot of really, really earth shattering
[34:43.320 --> 34:44.320]  things here.
[34:44.320 --> 34:52.640]  And I've got a really, really, really, really, really big stack of news here for you.
[34:52.640 --> 34:57.120]  That is just really key to understanding what people have done and what they're planning
[34:57.120 --> 34:59.240]  to do.
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.760]  And a lot of people make the comment that, man, Alex Jones looks really old for 47 and
[35:03.760 --> 35:05.120]  you're damn right I do.
[35:05.120 --> 35:08.800]  Because I've taken the weight of the world on my shoulders, all I do is study what these
[35:08.800 --> 35:11.600]  evil people are doing so we can stop them.
[35:11.600 --> 35:16.720]  And I'm not like everybody else that's just all happy, go lucky, and everything's wonderful.
[35:16.720 --> 35:20.840]  I'm not a domesticated dodo bird that doesn't understand that I'm under attack.
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.040]  And people are gonna find out real quick how much danger you're in because things are
[35:24.040 --> 35:25.320]  gonna deteriorate very quickly.
[35:25.320 --> 35:32.920]  They are officially building FEMA camps and emergency camps all over the world.
[35:32.920 --> 35:33.920]  And admitting it.
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.800]  And then admitting they're gonna phase us into these.
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.680]  You're not gonna recognize the world in just a year or two.
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.000]  You already don't, right?
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.840]  So that's all coming up next segment.
[35:44.840 --> 35:46.560]  You know, I never aired this and I should.
[35:46.560 --> 35:52.840]  It's a really important Gregory's report and it deals with the nature of reality and it's
[35:52.840 --> 35:54.600]  only about three and a half minutes.
[35:54.600 --> 35:56.600]  And then I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna restart the show.
[35:56.600 --> 36:04.280]  I'm gonna restart the broadcast, 47 minutes in or 48 minutes in by the time I come back
[36:04.280 --> 36:12.020]  and then I will do my very, very, very best to cover this news and cover this information
[36:12.020 --> 36:13.020]  for you.
[36:13.020 --> 36:14.520]  Or maybe I'll just leave.
[36:14.520 --> 36:15.520]  I'm not threatening to leave.
[36:15.520 --> 36:16.520]  I just don't want to be here.
[36:16.520 --> 36:19.600]  If everybody just wants to die, just go ahead.
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.520]  I mean, you understand that they are implanting us with an injection that killed almost all
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.800]  the mice and other animals they gave this to.
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.360]  I mean, you understand, hell, they already gave 100 million plus people injections knowing
[36:32.360 --> 36:34.600]  that had cancer virus in it back in the fifties.
[36:34.600 --> 36:39.040]  I mean, they do this on purpose and they just are escalating what they're doing to us.
[36:39.040 --> 36:44.840]  We're just gonna sit here and take it, I guess.
[36:44.840 --> 36:45.840]  Here's the Gregory's report.
[36:45.840 --> 36:53.360]  Stay with us.
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.760]  The war against consciousness can be traced back to some of the oldest written texts we
[36:58.760 --> 37:00.480]  have.
[37:00.480 --> 37:06.560]  But the past century has been a whirlwind assault against the human spirit.
[37:06.560 --> 37:12.560]  In just a hundred years, we went from being practically media free to having a screen
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.040]  in front of our face, the majority of our waking lives.
[37:17.040 --> 37:23.560]  We are being herded into a virtual AI run illusion that is now influencing our perception
[37:23.560 --> 37:28.760]  of what is real, which then creates our perceived reality.
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.760]  We know this to be true.
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.920]  Our senses give us the false impression that we are living in a material world when we
[37:35.920 --> 37:37.320]  are not.
[37:37.320 --> 37:41.720]  99.9% of all matter is empty space.
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.440]  The only thing keeping us from walking through walls are the outer valence electrons electrostatically
[37:47.440 --> 37:50.560]  repelling against one another.
[37:50.560 --> 37:53.240]  Physical solidity is an illusion.
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.680]  What we are feeling with our touch is not solid matter.
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.920]  It is electrostatic repulsion.
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.680]  We do not see with our eyes, we see within our mind.
[38:05.680 --> 38:11.840]  The cones and rods in our eyes are exposed to a very limited band of information, which
[38:11.840 --> 38:18.680]  is then translated electronically to our brain's visual cortex, which then creates a visual
[38:18.680 --> 38:26.480]  map within our mind that allows us to see the world around us, just as we see the world
[38:26.480 --> 38:29.720]  around us as we sleep and dream.
[38:29.720 --> 38:32.880]  It's being perceived in our mind.
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.480]  This applies to all of our five senses.
[38:35.480 --> 38:41.040]  The world we inhabit is much more like a hologram than anything solid.
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.680]  And more importantly, so is our body and our brain.
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.160]  And if we are not of our bodies, then where are we?
[38:50.160 --> 38:52.120]  Who are we?
[38:52.120 --> 38:57.960]  These questions can lead us to liberation, which is why tyrants have toiled to keep us
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.120]  from ever asking them.
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.680]  For centuries they used religion to make us feel small and dictate reality.
[39:05.680 --> 39:10.320]  And today they use science and pop culture.
[39:10.320 --> 39:16.440]  Actual repeatable science has shown that our awareness has sway over the holographic
[39:16.440 --> 39:18.960]  reality that we inhabit.
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.800]  We can continue to fight each other, and some may win the battle.
[39:22.800 --> 39:29.040]  But the war against consciousness will forever continue until we unplug from the system.
[39:29.040 --> 39:34.960]  The deeper into tyranny we are herded, the more of us awaken to the truth.
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.840]  It's gonna force the people that can still think for themselves and have common sense
[39:41.840 --> 39:48.320]  and are able to take the median needle out of their veins, whether it's your baseball
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.240]  team or the football team, or the stats and the thing, and the Democrat, Republican, and
[39:52.240 --> 39:53.240]  left wing, right wing.
[39:53.240 --> 40:00.920]  There's been a black light in gender and LGBTQ2 and homophobia.
[40:00.920 --> 40:11.000]  If you can get that needle out of you and then eventually clear your mind and let the
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.880]  real soul start to live again.
[40:14.880 --> 40:21.440]  And once the soul of humanity begins to live again, the tyranny will end, and humanity
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.960]  will evolve.
[40:23.960 --> 40:28.120]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[40:28.120 --> 40:35.000]  And by the way, the globalists took over the churches in the last 200 years.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.200]  So if you use the term evolve, people then think you're saying you believe in evolution.
[40:41.200 --> 40:47.200]  No, like evolve, like the automobile has evolved, or communications has evolved, or medicine
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.280]  has evolved, it means humans changing, humans getting better.
[40:51.280 --> 40:53.240]  Because humans either get better or we get worse.
[40:53.240 --> 40:58.040]  We either get more enlightened, more informed, closer to God or further away from God.
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.160]  And that's what Vladimir Putin came out and said, just a few weeks ago, I'm gonna play
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.680]  the clip next hour, he said, America is no longer a Christian nation, and he said Europe
[41:07.680 --> 41:13.040]  isn't, and Russia to a great extent isn't, and we need to decide to have those values
[41:13.040 --> 41:16.240]  or we're doomed.
[41:16.240 --> 41:17.600]  And that is just a fact.
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.000]  If we don't have a culture, we're gonna have George Soros' culture.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.400]  We're gonna have the Southern Power We Lost culture, which is no culture at all.
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.480]  It's a bunch of stunted, weird, brainwashed, divided and conquered people.
[41:31.480 --> 41:38.600]  Now, I've done a lot of preparations for this show today, and I have temper problems.
[41:38.600 --> 41:41.120]  So I'm really working towards not blowing up on air.
[41:41.120 --> 41:45.640]  Because if I do blow up on air, it's entertaining, people like it, but then I get exhausted later
[41:45.640 --> 41:47.840]  in the afternoon and can't keep working for six, seven more hours.
[41:47.840 --> 41:55.440]  So that's why now I just go off the air and I'm about to blow up because it's not healthy.
[41:55.440 --> 41:57.800]  But this does piss me off.
[41:57.800 --> 42:02.920]  The news I'm gonna cover when we come back is so horrible that that's the paradox.
[42:02.920 --> 42:08.240]  Like, I want to focus on God and on my wonderful children and on the beautiful creation God
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.720]  gave us and on good things.
[42:09.720 --> 42:12.440]  But the globalists are coming for us and they never leave us alone.
[42:12.440 --> 42:14.720]  So I have to focus on them.
[42:14.720 --> 42:16.640]  And it makes me sick.
[42:16.640 --> 42:20.120]  And I understand you tune in to find out what they're doing because you care too, because
[42:20.120 --> 42:21.200]  you love your family.
[42:21.200 --> 42:24.960]  You don't tune in because you hate Hillary Clinton.
[42:24.960 --> 42:31.320]  But at the end of the day, these are power, mad control freaks who really are serving
[42:31.320 --> 42:32.720]  evil forces.
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.480]  And this is a spiritual battle and people just better get that straight and get that through
[42:37.480 --> 42:38.480]  their heads.
[42:38.480 --> 42:39.480]  That's a great report.
[42:39.480 --> 42:40.480]  Gregory's did.
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.120]  So the Gregory section at Bandot Video, the only way that article or video gets out is
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.080]  when you share it and you've been doing that.

[43:31.160 --> 43:36.200]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with natural peppermint and so much more back

[47:00.480 --> 47:21.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.680 --> 47:27.120]  Monday through Friday, I'm here from 11am, 3pm central and I was thinking about the
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.160]  listeners and viewers this morning, how much I appreciate you because you understand that
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.160]  I don't like getting up here and telling you they keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.520]  I don't want to get up here and tell you that probably half the Democrats are pedophiles,
[47:40.520 --> 47:44.400]  probably 10% of the Republicans at the top, it's a very conservative number.
[47:44.400 --> 47:47.160]  It's true and it's all coming out as you see.
[47:47.160 --> 47:50.000]  And only admitting how much trouble we're in, do we have any chance to turn this around.
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.200]  So that's why I bet my name, my fortune, my blood, my family on this.
[47:55.200 --> 47:57.000]  And I do care.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.400]  That's why it's such BS when the media run stories that I don't care and you don't care
[48:00.400 --> 48:02.640]  and we're haters and all the rest of it.
[48:02.640 --> 48:08.040]  And you know, I do dislike the globalist, but I do what I do because I love innocent
[48:08.040 --> 48:11.520]  people and I don't like bullies.
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.400]  And I don't like seeing the left bully everybody and get away with what they do and just how
[48:15.400 --> 48:18.680]  they support evil out of hand.
[48:18.680 --> 48:20.240]  And I believe in you and I believe we can beat them.
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.800]  Let me go back to what I started the show with, it's a really important point and hope
[48:24.800 --> 48:29.080]  God will just give me the simplicity and the clarity to say it simply and not spend 30
[48:29.080 --> 48:30.080]  minutes explaining it.
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.240]  But a smoking gun of COVID being made in the lab is the fact that it was made in the lab
[48:35.240 --> 48:38.440]  and we have all the documents and all the proof that they cooked it up with Fauci and
[48:38.440 --> 48:39.440]  the rest of it.
[48:39.440 --> 48:42.520]  So they would own this virus going forward and create a vaccine for the spike protein.
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.360]  And we have all the documents, all the admissions.
[48:44.360 --> 48:45.360]  It's just insane.
[48:45.360 --> 48:46.360]  It's open and shut.
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.080]  18 months ago it was open and shut.
[48:49.080 --> 48:54.320]  Hell, it was a big controversy in 2015.
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.360]  Little Hill, North Carolina and Fauci and Obama transferred the program that was illegal
[48:58.360 --> 49:00.560]  in the U.S. when they got caught to China.
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.600]  But the general public can't grasp that.
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.440]  But they can grasp this.
[49:07.440 --> 49:13.960]  And that's the COVID cards, which again, they plan by 2026 to have everybody by law
[49:13.960 --> 49:15.480]  with a digital passport.
[49:15.480 --> 49:17.240]  It's already going in Europe and other areas.
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.840]  But the training wheels for the rest of the country in the world are by 2025.
[49:21.840 --> 49:23.280]  And that's in the Pfizer documents.
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.400]  In the plan, they've laid out a whole blue parent and governments are ordering these
[49:27.400 --> 49:31.120]  so-called vaccines years out in advance now.
[49:31.120 --> 49:34.840]  But then when it's time to have the injections, they'll have all the latest reasons for you
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.600]  and all the PR and all the BS, complete with just fake numbers, whatever they want to put
[49:39.600 --> 49:40.600]  out.
[49:40.600 --> 49:41.600]  And they've been caught doing that.
[49:41.600 --> 49:42.680]  And so they didn't get in trouble.
[49:42.680 --> 49:43.680]  So now it's even worse.
[49:43.680 --> 49:51.160]  Remember, the whole basis of this was the PCR test, which is admittedly a total fraud.
[49:51.160 --> 49:52.160]  They've withdrawn it.
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.440]  But now they've moved on with new tests that are fraudulent.
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.560]  But I'll tell you right now, they are suppressing the real numbers of sick people.
[50:00.560 --> 50:01.960]  And it's not what you'd call COVID.
[50:01.960 --> 50:03.880]  It is the spike protein.
[50:03.880 --> 50:08.480]  And again, I saw them this morning saying, we'll have 200,000 people a day getting COVID
[50:08.480 --> 50:09.480]  by November.
[50:09.480 --> 50:12.160]  And we need to go ahead and just have another lockdown.
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.160]  Have another lockdown.
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.640]  This stuff's already spread everywhere.
[50:14.640 --> 50:15.640]  You're not getting away from this.
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.240]  I feel like there was a nuclear war.
[50:18.240 --> 50:23.120]  You're not escaping the fallout unless you've got a bunker underneath the mountain.
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.680]  Unless you go lock yourself in a bunker for five years, you're not getting away from this.
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.600]  And before it was just the souped up cold that they own and controlled.
[50:32.600 --> 50:35.320]  Now they've turned our bodies into factories.
[50:35.320 --> 50:36.560]  See, people hear this thing.
[50:36.560 --> 50:42.880]  Oh, that's Jones's opinion that this vaccine creates sloughing, creates shedding.
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.760]  So all live virus vaccines create mutants and spread them.
[50:48.760 --> 50:51.680]  I've played dozens of doctors explaining it for all of us.
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.080]  It's in the damn literature.
[50:53.080 --> 50:58.800]  They passed a law on the EU that Pfizer and Moderna are allowed to shed and spread to people.
[50:58.800 --> 51:01.880]  They have fricking liability protection.
[51:01.880 --> 51:06.600]  So do you understand that when these people get in your face, they have all these polls
[51:06.600 --> 51:12.080]  and then Stephen Colbert was talking about last night, why 56% of Americans are angry
[51:12.080 --> 51:14.560]  at those that aren't vaccinated and think they're criminals.
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.120]  They're the equivalent of murderers.
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.960]  And you've got these arrogant, dumbed down people that took a shot that didn't protect
[51:20.960 --> 51:21.960]  them.
[51:21.960 --> 51:25.560]  Now being told they got to have their third injection, rope adult, never admitting they
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.600]  got conned, never admitting they're wrong.
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.840]  And now 50 plus percent think we're criminals and want to put us in jail.
[51:31.840 --> 51:34.280]  We need to get in their faces.
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.640]  Not in a mean way, but say, listen, I'm not wearing your mask and getting bacterial pneumonia.
[51:39.640 --> 51:42.480]  The masks don't do anything except make you sick.
[51:42.480 --> 51:46.520]  And the damn thing came out of Wuhan and they made a vaccine for it that's meant to make
[51:46.520 --> 51:47.520]  you sick.
[51:47.520 --> 51:49.880]  And that's the fricking literature.
[51:49.880 --> 51:51.280]  You won't admit you've been conned.
[51:51.280 --> 51:54.680]  But remember when you're taking your fifth and sixth shot a few years from now and dying,
[51:54.680 --> 51:55.680]  you'll remember.
[51:55.680 --> 51:57.120]  And look, I like Roger Stone a lot.
[51:57.120 --> 51:58.120]  He's a great guy.
[51:58.120 --> 52:01.560]  He got pissed off at me yesterday and I don't apologize for it.
[52:01.560 --> 52:06.240]  I learned from people close to his family, in his family, that right after his wife took
[52:06.240 --> 52:10.880]  the second shot of the Pfizer, she had her lymph nodes swell up with what they said was
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.720]  stage four cancer within one damn month.
[52:13.720 --> 52:15.640]  That's in the literature.
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.200]  Now that's somebody we know.
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.080]  That's Roger Stone's wife got the damn cancer from the vaccine.
[52:22.080 --> 52:24.880]  And they're all over the news saying, well, you'll think it's cancer, but doctors don't
[52:24.880 --> 52:28.200]  operate for six months because we don't want to say it gives you cancer.
[52:28.200 --> 52:29.360]  How the hell do they spend that?
[52:29.360 --> 52:33.160]  Do you understand they're not just giving you a deadly spike protein that you then shed
[52:33.160 --> 52:36.440]  and share?
[52:36.440 --> 52:40.000]  No.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.800]  These things are giving people uterine cancer, lymphoma cancer, lung cancer, you name it,
[52:46.800 --> 52:47.800]  and it's all on record.
[52:47.800 --> 52:49.880]  And by the way, I apologize to Roger.
[52:49.880 --> 52:50.880]  I like Roger.
[52:50.880 --> 52:52.880]  I said, I apologize for breaking confidence.
[52:52.880 --> 52:56.360]  And then later I was thinking later, I never break confidence unless something's illegal
[52:56.360 --> 52:59.280]  and then I have to wear my journalistic hat.
[52:59.280 --> 53:01.520]  I was told by somebody else about his wife.
[53:01.520 --> 53:04.960]  So he never even told me, he just said, yeah, that's true, but I'm not going to talk about
[53:04.960 --> 53:05.960]  it on air.
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.480]  So there you go.
[53:07.480 --> 53:13.640]  And it's not criticizing his wife or anybody, but we've got to save lives here, okay?
[53:13.640 --> 53:16.920]  Because this is a serious issue.
[53:16.920 --> 53:19.520]  So that's why I did that.
[53:19.520 --> 53:20.720]  That's why I brought it up on air.
[53:20.720 --> 53:22.240]  He didn't really want it brought up.
[53:22.240 --> 53:25.720]  And I'm sorry that it hurt Roger's feelings and I guess they're super proud about medical
[53:25.720 --> 53:30.280]  stuff and everything, but that's just the way it is because this is killing a lot of
[53:30.280 --> 53:31.280]  people.
[53:31.280 --> 53:33.400]  They're going to sit here and sit on it.
[53:33.400 --> 53:38.560]  And I'm not mad at them wanting their privacy, but that's a big deal, folks.
[53:38.560 --> 53:41.760]  And then it's not like, oh, we just guessed that happened to her.
[53:41.760 --> 53:45.680]  It's in the damn literature and then they spin it and go, oh, if you get big lumps in
[53:45.680 --> 53:49.160]  your breast or your lymph nodes, especially under your arm, on the side, you take the
[53:49.160 --> 53:51.160]  shots where it's happening.
[53:51.160 --> 53:52.400]  Don't worry about that.
[53:52.400 --> 53:56.400]  That's ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, New York Times.
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.960]  Don't worry when you get a bunch of lumps in your breast.
[53:58.960 --> 54:03.040]  Don't wait six months because it's probably not really cancer.
[54:03.040 --> 54:04.360]  That's how you gaslight.
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.120]  They give you something that Wolfgang Wodarg, the top scientist, and Dr. Yedon, the top
[54:08.120 --> 54:14.200]  scientist, former head of Pfizer Science Division, the guy that runs things, said, this is going
[54:14.200 --> 54:16.200]  to grow cancers.
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.440]  I can't believe they are literally killing us and then everybody's always will pry like
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.440]  my grandmother.
[54:22.440 --> 54:27.880]  When I was, you know, a teenager, I said, so they told you that they gave you the polio,
[54:27.880 --> 54:30.760]  and she goes, yes, but I wasn't mad.
[54:30.760 --> 54:32.880]  They meant well and it was all right.
[54:32.880 --> 54:35.960]  Later when I got informed, when I was in college and stuff, I said, did you know Dr. Sock
[54:35.960 --> 54:36.960]  knew that?
[54:36.960 --> 54:37.960]  That was in there.
[54:37.960 --> 54:38.960]  She goes, that's not very Christian.
[54:38.960 --> 54:40.480]  I don't speak bad of Dr. Sock.
[54:40.480 --> 54:41.800]  He was a hero.
[54:41.800 --> 54:49.760]  They crippled my grandmother for 60, 70 fricking years, whatever, 1954 until she died a few
[54:49.760 --> 54:50.760]  years ago.
[54:50.760 --> 54:51.880]  They crippled her.
[54:51.880 --> 54:55.440]  They told her and then she's defending them.
[54:55.440 --> 55:03.720]  Stock, home, sin, drum, stock, home, sin, drum, awaken, say no.
[55:03.720 --> 55:10.800]  To me, bigger than the spike protein is the ERs are full of people with the blood clots
[55:10.800 --> 55:11.800]  and all the rest of it.
[55:11.800 --> 55:14.440]  What about the cancer?
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.520]  You go and you get diagnosed and that scene never went through trials.
[55:18.520 --> 55:21.880]  So they go, well, we don't know this cancer is from that, but they admit it's a side
[55:21.880 --> 55:27.720]  effect that it makes you grow cancers, the side effect is cancer.
[55:27.720 --> 55:34.400]  Stage four lymphoma cancer, ABC News.
[55:34.400 --> 55:40.680]  And people go in, that's cancer, swelling after COVID-19 shots may cause cancer, false
[55:40.680 --> 55:41.680]  alarms.
[55:41.680 --> 55:43.400]  We're going to go to break, then I'll play the Trinoclip.
[55:43.400 --> 55:45.280]  I'll just play the Trinoclip now.
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.600]  Here he is salivating over the plan that you're going to get boosters for the rest of your
[55:49.600 --> 55:50.600]  life.
[55:50.600 --> 55:51.600]  Here it is.
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.360]  While more and more Canadians are getting vaccinated right now, it's also important
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.800]  to plan ahead for the future.
[55:58.800 --> 56:05.280]  We've reached an agreement with Pfizer for 35 million booster doses for next year and
[56:05.280 --> 56:08.200]  30 million in the year after.
[56:08.200 --> 56:15.400]  This deal includes options to add 30 million doses in both 2022 and 2023, and an option
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.480]  for 60 million doses in 2024.
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.480]  Pfizer has been a solid partner for Canada in this fight against COVID-19.
[56:23.480 --> 56:24.480]  Okay, that's enough.
[56:24.480 --> 56:25.480]  I'm behind now.
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.400]  I'm going to show you the videos and all the news articles, all over the world.
[56:29.400 --> 56:33.720]  They now admit we're building emergency camps to keep you in, and we're going to keep people
[56:33.720 --> 56:37.280]  that are healthy in the camps.
[56:37.280 --> 56:38.280]  And it's all the you in.
[56:38.280 --> 56:40.480]  You wake up, the U.N. is in control separately.
[56:40.480 --> 56:43.080]  Today is the last day to get deep breath, crystal, iodine.
[56:43.080 --> 56:44.080]  So good for your immune system.
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.080]  So good for your body.
[56:45.080 --> 56:47.080]  So good for your libido, your skin.
[56:47.080 --> 56:53.760]  50% off, X2, this is the last day to get X2, survival sold X2, and experience true deep

[57:02.560 --> 57:03.720]  end as well.
[57:03.720 --> 57:08.480]  The privacy pouches, so the contact tracers don't track you, and the 11 bumper stickers
[57:08.480 --> 57:10.440]  that come with it for $14.95.
[57:10.440 --> 57:11.640]  That ends today.
[57:11.640 --> 57:16.080]  And the just, I mean, there's a whole list of things, but I've got it right here.
[57:16.080 --> 57:17.240]  I should have had the list for you.
[57:17.240 --> 57:22.560]  A whole list of great products that we've got like lung cleanse and others that are going
[57:22.560 --> 57:23.560]  to be ending today.
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.880]  But we also have the activated charcoal toothpaste back in stock and the activated charcoal with
[57:28.880 --> 57:30.920]  great essential oils, mouthwash.
[57:30.920 --> 57:31.920]  It's amazing.
[57:31.920 --> 57:34.760]  Both those back, those are 33% off.
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.120]  You can read all the five star reviews, infowarstore.com, want to thank you all for keeping us on
[57:39.120 --> 57:41.000]  air in the face of the globalist.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.440]  You've got my commitment to never back down, but I need your support plus these are great
[57:44.440 --> 57:45.440]  products.
[57:45.440 --> 57:49.480]  Make sure it's while you're on the side as well.
[57:49.480 --> 57:56.800]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[57:56.800 --> 58:02.520]  I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[58:02.520 --> 58:03.520]  in the arena.
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.280]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.120]  But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear.
[58:11.120 --> 58:16.600]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[58:16.600 --> 58:19.360]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[58:19.360 --> 58:25.520]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off
[58:25.520 --> 58:27.120]  on all the amazing products.
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.360]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.360]  And then you fund info wars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the
[58:34.360 --> 58:35.360]  globalist.
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.520]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[58:39.520 --> 58:44.120]  If you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation and it stands up
[58:44.120 --> 58:50.880]  against the globalist bullies mypillow.com promo code Alex take action now.
[58:50.880 --> 58:55.680]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[58:55.680 --> 58:58.080]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.640]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[59:02.640 --> 59:07.200]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[59:07.200 --> 59:10.520]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you have, you know, with a deep burden
[59:10.520 --> 59:12.520]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.560]  So I took it and then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[59:17.560 --> 59:22.840]  brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[59:22.840 --> 59:27.280]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[59:27.280 --> 59:29.400]  take basically all of your supplements.
[59:29.400 --> 59:31.400]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[59:31.400 --> 59:35.720]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[59:35.720 --> 59:36.720]  It's amazing.
[59:36.720 --> 59:37.720]  It works.
[59:37.720 --> 59:40.880]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[59:40.880 --> 59:41.880]  the globalist system.
[59:41.880 --> 59:46.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[59:46.000 --> 59:47.000]  Beautifully said, brother.
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.720]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[59:53.720 --> 1:00:10.640]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:15.760]  So we are definitely living in a time of the population.
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:18.440]  You're definitely living in a time of world government.
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:23.800]  Christy Lee, it is a great independent reporter and follows a lot of her stuff with info wars.
[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:30.720]  The air it has moved to Austin from California and they said no mask for your kids, but suddenly
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.080]  when she tried to go to school, they said mask.
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:37.000]  I know some of our crew get ready to follow lawsuits in Travis County against them.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  There's a state order.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.040]  They can't do it, but they're trying to bully our children into wearing these face diapers.
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:44.800]  She'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour today.
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:45.800]  Okay.
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:49.960]  So I have only covered maybe five articles today and I don't want to say I've dropped
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:52.120]  the ball because it's really a big deal.
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:01:03.880]  The premeditated plan for yearly genetic engineering gene therapy injections that they've got stuff
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:07.440]  that'll do incredible things with mRNA.
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:11.080]  Pure cancer, you name it, but a small part of the time it ends up killing you when you
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:12.080]  take it.
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:13.880]  They're trying to figure that out.
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:19.120]  What they cooked up for us is designed to give people horrible blood clots in their
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:24.400]  lungs, brain, heart, and the rest of the body and to attack the ovaries, attack the testicles,
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:25.400]  attack everything.
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:29.360]  And then I see Stephen Colbert last night making jokes going, there are no scientific
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:34.960]  studies saying that any of these vaccines ever affect the reproductive tract.
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:37.240]  Well, similar ones in animals do.
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:38.760]  They didn't do any studies in this.
[1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:39.760]  They waived all that.
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:46.880]  So they had all the animal studies and human studies in China on the same type of viruses.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.920]  I believe probably COVID-19 was tested as well.
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:49.920]  We know it was on animals.
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:54.920]  That's come out with Peter Dazik where they had the name COVID-19 in the year before and
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:55.920]  we're testing it.
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:01.720]  I mean, it's on video, but now they've just rolled this out against us and it's all pre-planned.
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  It's all there.
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:03.720]  It's all pre-packaged.
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.560]  It's all pure bull.
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:11.400]  And so some stations don't care this first five minutes, so I'm going to come back and
[1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:15.520]  I'm going to judiciously cover these three stacks of news.
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:19.560]  And I know everybody wants me to talk about Afghanistan.
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:21.360]  It's pretty amazing stuff.
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:27.680]  It's a lot more riveting than Netflix, but it's real people dying and I've got my take
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.880]  on it and I've already talked about it and I haven't seen many people that have gotten
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:31.880]  it.
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:34.320]  Of all people, Charlie Kirk, I saw video gets it.
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:36.680]  This is on purpose to destabilize the region.
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:37.680]  That's all the globalists want.
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:41.920]  They funded the Arab Spring, the same thing under Obama and this is what they're doing
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:44.000]  is turning the world over to Islamists.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.480]  I don't think we should have stayed there.
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:49.600]  I think the way Trump was getting out was good, but Biden ordered the Afghan Air Force
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.800]  to stand down.
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:53.560]  And that was the big question I kept asking.
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:58.680]  It's now confirmed the Pentagon has said that they were told by the Biden administration
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:02.960]  to basically have the Afghan force stand down.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:06.600]  So whoever did that did this.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:12.760]  And I really do think they should be brought upon charges of war crimes.
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:17.680]  So we can argue about it all day and show the footage and say who's to blame.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:22.680]  Who's to blame is us letting this happen, but more importantly, it's George W. Bush.
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.880]  It's Barack Obama.
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:29.200]  And it is Bill Clinton.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:33.960]  Because these are all guys that supported that war.
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:38.200]  These are all little globalist peas in a pod.
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:43.800]  And they're all just a bunch of sick, evil, selfish individuals that think everything
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:45.960]  they're doing is hilarious and the joke's on us.
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:51.160]  Well, the joke's not on us, but I'll tell you this.
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:56.920]  I am deeply, deeply shaken, deeply shaken.
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:02.680]  And I am going through intense sorrow for our country and our world right now and for
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.360]  our children, your children, our children together, humanity's children.
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:09.720]  And I just know that we can't put up with these globalists anymore.
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:11.800]  We cannot be intimidated by them.
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:12.800]  We cannot lay down to them.
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:14.040]  We cannot mince words.
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:20.280]  We cannot hold back on what we're going to say or do because that's what pays the road
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:27.080]  of perdition and the road of oppression and the road to serfdom that we are very, very
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.080]  far down right now.
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:33.120]  I mean, I'm surprised that the globalists are this evil and are doing this much stuff
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:36.200]  because it's going to blow back on them, but you realize they're in a frenzy.
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:37.760]  So they just, they love it.
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:40.200]  To them, the journey is the destination.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:44.360]  They're as happy as a pig and you know what, so God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:45.360]  God help us.
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:49.360]  All right, I'm going to hit a ton of news in 60 seconds when we start the next segment.
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.600]  Please tell your friends and family and neighbors to an end because this is, this is, this is
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:54.600]  the turning point.
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:55.800]  This is the crossroads.
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.480]  This is the point of no return.
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:04.480]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:08.760]  plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and an off-wash?
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:12.200]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best seller within six months.
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:16.080]  And now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns of the supply chain, we haven't
[1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:17.080]  had it.
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:20.200]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:21.200]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:23.040]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:25.840]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or you haven't
[1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:32.520]  tried it, it's back in stock at infowarstore.com discounted because of the COVID lockdown,
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.160]  because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.

[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.360]  at only two places.
[1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:47.080]  It's at infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones Naturals.com.

[1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:42.040]  Welcome back.
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:45.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:55.560]  Okay, so all of the Australian newspapers are reporting on giant 3000 person camps being
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:58.040]  built all over the country.
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:01.080]  And they're now saying if you don't take a COVID shot, we're going to come and take
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:06.100]  you and make you live at a camp for a few months just to see how that changes your mind.
[1:07:06.100 --> 1:07:12.000]  We also have different premieres of different regions running around saying that they're
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:17.360]  going to force tens of thousands of children without asking taking them from the school
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:18.360]  outside of law.
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:24.280]  So I'm going to prove over there and inject the children of the same spokesperson from
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:27.600]  the government that we're about to play the clip of also said months ago.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:32.920]  Okay, yeah, some schools have given children as young as five shots without parental consent.
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:33.920]  Big deal.
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:36.000]  So it's not even approved and they're doing it.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.960]  I mean, this is just the old prison colony of Australia is really showing everybody
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:43.400]  exactly who they are.
[1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:48.040]  But let's let's run through some of these articles because remember just last week,
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:53.800]  I showed you the new CDC document and it says we're preparing to shelter people from COVID
[1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:54.800]  who don't have it.
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:01.080]  And we're going to turn every neighborhood in every rural area and every city into captains
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:05.400]  and the military is going to be there and they're going to make sure that you're protected
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:08.120]  and that you don't leave your house or leave your neighborhood and they're going to bring
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:09.120]  you food.
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:12.440]  Well, then the food supplies are going to run out, that's clout and piven to collapse
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:13.600]  the country.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:20.720]  Now, that was just last week we were covering that and now it's in the news and they're
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.320]  showing it in the UK and Germany and France and Australia.
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:28.920]  Oh, look, we're building the big giant facilities.
[1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:33.680]  So let's go over some of these articles by administration will advise most Americans
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:37.600]  to get a booster jab eight months after the vaccination.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:41.040]  You hear advise that means they're going to force that and of course, that was always
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:44.680]  the plan that is on the vaccine cards.
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.680]  Then continuing.
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:51.040]  Oh, you heard this in England, then you heard it in Australia now in New Zealand, New Zealand's
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:57.200]  Prime Minister orders citizens do not talk to your neighbors only listen to me.
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:00.600]  Remember the clip she said a few months ago, the only voice you should hear is mine.
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:04.040]  Wow, she's not Jim Jones or anything.
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:08.680]  They had one COVID case probably made up and so the entire country's locked back down unless
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:10.680]  you're Larry Page who lives next door.
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:14.080]  He bought basically an island in Fiji a couple islands and then he flies him whenever he
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:19.120]  needs anything but he's he's like God so he's allowed to.
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  So continuing and guys, I can't find it in my stack.
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:23.960]  I fumbled around during that break.
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:30.200]  I sent you the articles out of Australia about how they're building quote COVID camps.
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:31.840]  It's the the Australians one of the others.
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:35.160]  Can we put those on screen thanks because I just had it in my stack but it somehow got
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:37.360]  diverted or I can pull it up myself.
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:39.640]  I just I really need that.
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:40.640]  Thank you.
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:41.640]  It's my fault.
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:43.680]  I can't find it but I did send it to you this morning.
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:49.840]  Okay, US to advise boosters for most Americans again so you know about that.
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:50.840]  Texas children.
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:54.160]  I'm going to rebroadcast actually going to rebroadcast no big deal.
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:55.160]  I'm not ready.
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:56.160]  I got to get ready.
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:57.160]  I had my stacks here.
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:09:59.960]  I had them prepared but I can't come on here and tell you about these emergency camps.
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  I don't have the footage.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:01.960]  I'm going to have the articles.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:03.960]  I'm going to rebroadcast and I'm not having the guest on the bottom of the hour.
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:04.960]  I can't do it.
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  I'm too angry.
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:06.960]  Just it's done.
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:07.960]  Okay.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:08.960]  All right.
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:09.960]  Yeah.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  I just I've reached my end.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:12.960]  I'm not going to get mad.
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:23.360]  Let's just go ahead and there's something else here.
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:24.960]  So much to get to here.
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:27.200]  Yeah, I'm not having the guest on either.
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:29.160]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast.
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:30.160]  I just can't do it anymore.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:35.160]  I can't even have the Australian newspaper.
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:40.560]  Yeah, I got to cover that at the bottom of the hour.
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.560]  That's the most important thing here.
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:43.560]  It's camps.
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:46.360]  I mean, they're building camps and everybody's just totally calm about it.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.600]  And then they announce they're going to start grabbing us and putting them in and I have
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.800]  it out of Australia and have it out of the United States of America.
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  There it is.
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:55.520]  Construction of Mikkelham quarantine camp starts.
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  You got to see these newscasts.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:57.520]  You got to see all this stuff.
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:00.520]  Just reprint me that, guys.
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:04.280]  All right, you guys just pick something whenever you want and start playing and I'll be back
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:05.280]  later, baby.
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:08.280]  I just can't get angry like this anymore.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.640]  And that's my rule.
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:15.360]  So whenever you're ready, just roll something I'm done.
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:20.760]  Hawaii Governor David Igay's emergency order to limit occupancy in restaurants and bars
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:26.600]  to 50 percent or less was merely a popular stepping stone amongst the Democratic Party
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:30.440]  to impose a slippery slope of tyrannical control.
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:33.680]  We are seeing more community spread.
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.680]  We are seeing more gatherings.
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:41.320]  Governor David Igay is asking Hawaii residents to refrain from those gatherings.
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:45.520]  When will you allow fully vaccinated travelers to travel more freely, whether that be in
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:48.320]  our island or back and forth from the mainland?
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.360]  It's really about whether the science says that when you're vaccinated, you can't get
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:59.200]  the virus, right, and that you can't infect others.
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:04.040]  Once they can get access to the vaccination records, I'm pretty certain that we would
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:11.400]  be able to incorporate the vaccination record with the safe travel program relatively quickly.
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:17.280]  The totalitarian emergency mandates have caused nearly 1200 members from Hawaii's first
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:24.080]  responders unions to sue the state over unconstitutional COVID-19 vaccination mandates.
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.160]  The attorneys announced that they plan to file the lawsuit on Friday in order to try
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.560]  to stop the mandate, which takes effect on Monday.
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:36.800]  This one is on behalf of police officers, firefighters, and other first responders.
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.360]  They're just asking for the chance to choose.
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:45.120]  Everyone is a personal, autonomous healthcare decision, and everyone should make their own
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:49.600]  choice whether or not they want to take a vaccine or not.
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:54.960]  Governor David Ige, as well as four county mayors, developed a unified statewide plan
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:00.400]  so hastily that the unions were not given the chance to collectively bargain before
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:02.360]  the order was issued.
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:06.840]  When the governor announced the mandate last week, he said unvaccinated workers had the
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:11.960]  option of getting tested weekly, but the attorneys say that runs into a whole set of problems
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  for the workers.
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:17.360]  If they can't prove the testing because they're waiting for their free tests, then they're
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:20.280]  going to be home without pay.
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:25.200]  So it's almost the same result as being fired as you're having a large majority of our first
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:28.760]  responders off the street and home without pay and being punished.
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:35.240]  The case in Hawaii spotlights how first responders, first, fourth, fifth, and fourteenth amendment
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.080]  rights have all been violated.
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:38.080]  Hi.
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:40.880]  I'm a fire captain with the Honolulu Fire Department.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:43.720]  I've been a fireman for 20 years.
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:46.600]  My father was a fireman for 37.
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:57.000]  Governor Igay's mandate was interpreted by our mayor to mean if you didn't put an experimental
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:04.240]  drug in your body that you don't have enough information about to make an informed decision
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:13.880]  or you didn't get an approved religious or medical exemption, in the next 10 days, it
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:16.880]  literally said you could be fired.
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:26.440]  I spent the last 20 years of my life and 37 years watching my dad do this job.
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:35.960]  And because I didn't want to put an experimental drug in my body, I got to give that all up.
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:42.480]  But at the heart of the findings is the claim that 45,000 people have received the vaccines
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:47.280]  and have died within 72 hours of taking them influenza.
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:53.840]  When they found 53 deaths as a result of the vaccine, they suspended the vaccine.
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:15:00.120]  We can show 45,000 deaths in 72 hours from this vaccine.
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:05.520]  Hawaii's overreach may prove fatal to the totalitarian vaccine movement as the legal
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:09.360]  discovery of facts will serve as a double-edged sword.
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:11.600]  John Bown reporting.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  That's right.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:15.320]  They don't have liability protection from a criminal conspiracy when they waive the
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:19.920]  normal laws and they're not going to escape people coming after them either.
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:24.600]  So again, that's not the address when I get so mad I have to go off air now.
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:26.080]  I've reached my limit.
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:29.200]  I mean, we are witnessing the mass murder of humanity.
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:34.280]  We are witnessing the total psychotic takeover of everything and the numbers are so horrible.
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:40.480]  I mean, it's all, almost everyone I know has gotten cancer that took the shots.
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:45.160]  I mean, Roger Stone's wife, you just get cancer when you take it, too.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:51.120]  These people, the balls on Fauci, man, I mean, these people, what they've done, you understand
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.120]  this is real?
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:56.240]  You understand that half the damn country is going to be dead in a couple of years?
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.240]  Seriously, watch.
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:02.640]  I mean, this is not a game.
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:08.760]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:09.760]  the world.
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:12.200]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.700]  They know you're angry.
[1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:18.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  we've got.

[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:06.040]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:11.320]  set in the year 2020 where a world government is being established, where members of Congress
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:16.240]  and former presidents are censored by Big Tech and where if you don't take an experimental
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:22.200]  injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:24.800]  to fly on an airplane.
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:27.440]  Think about that because that's where we are.
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:32.400]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:37.560]  be happening, but it is happening now and then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's out of
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:42.320]  vaccine as a gene therapy and it doesn't really work, so you got to take it every few months
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:46.560]  and the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.080]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.240]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.160]  of the virus, and that's in mainline studies.
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:00.800]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.240]  The world is awakening.
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:06.760]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:12.120]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:18.080]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:23.240]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:27.840]  come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:30.960]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:35.800]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity
[1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:36.800]  is winning.
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:41.960]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:43.400]  That is invincible.
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:46.680]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:51.560]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action
[1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:52.560]  against the globalists.
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:56.520]  Otherwise, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[1:19:56.520 --> 1:20:03.360]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:33.200]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:36.640]  Okay, so let me just say this very succinctly, and then I'll get into the meat potatoes of
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:39.800]  it, and walk through it all here.
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:43.400]  The globalists know that we were waking up to their operations, there was populist movements
[1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:49.120]  exploding in Mexico, in the U.S., in Brazil, in Australia, in New Zealand, and all over
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:53.600]  Europe, especially Eastern Europe, and the U.K. and Brexit, and people were saying no
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:58.040]  to the New World Order, and no to the casualty society, and no to the Davos group.
[1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:01.520]  And so they went to the shelf, and they said, what do we do during a populist uprising?
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:05.680]  Well, we have a virus scare, and we use that to bring in a worldwide authoritarianism and
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:07.000]  a worldwide police state.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.320]  We make people wear masks because it's a symbol of fear, and then we have a global
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:16.600]  ID for forced inoculation, and then we, and it's all in operation lockstep, and in crimson
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:23.600]  contagion, and in spars, and in all the documents, and you're sitting there reading it, and it's
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:26.360]  a war game.
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:32.320]  You know when the United States trains to attack Russia with B-52s, and atomic bombs
[1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:39.160]  or whatever, nuclear bombs, hydrogen bombs, they don't call it a attack Russia drill,
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:42.840]  they call it a war game.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:49.960]  And when you read these damn plans that former top generals have read and said, yes, this
[1:21:49.960 --> 1:21:55.520]  is a war game for what's happening in live time, spars 20, 23, 20, 25.
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:56.520]  It's live time.
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:57.520]  What's happening now?
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:00.920]  And it's basically word for word what they're doing, because they got to have an operations
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:04.160]  manual where they're walking around with this in their briefcase.
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.160]  This is the play.
[1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:07.640]  This is the script.
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:10.200]  This is the blueprint.
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:16.720]  And oh, it's just a drill set in the future, and that's what I'm saying is, everybody's
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:21.960]  finally getting that I'm not making this up, because I get you to, and it says, okay, this
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:26.400]  this sounds fabulous, this sounds insane, yeah, it is fabulously insane.
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:27.760]  These people are crazy.
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:31.320]  They set up a world government to do this, and they said they want to depopulate us,
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:33.920]  and they've gotten around to it.
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:38.040]  And listen, one area I was wrong, let me explain this to you right now.
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:41.480]  This is very important.
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:48.920]  Is I thought they would release a vaccine or an injection that was really not bad for
[1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:55.600]  you, so they wouldn't get a big backlash and set the precedent to have forced inoculation
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:58.480]  and have their world ID and have their program in place.
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:05.880]  They think so little of us that they went directly to something that's the equivalent
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:06.880]  of a nuclear war.
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:11.120]  I mean, a limited nuclear war with Russia would probably kill 200 to 300 million people
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:13.400]  or China.
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:18.840]  They just hit military bases in main cities, and we hit them.
[1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:23.880]  This thing where you've got guy's search engine, it's probably a fake number, no one
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:29.920]  really knows, but the number of, quote, vaccinated for COVID-19 worldwide.
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:34.280]  But the number is in the several billions last time I saw it.
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:38.000]  Now in China and in India, they can attenuate a virus to people.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:48.080]  They don't give them these virus vector things and all the rest of it.
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:51.920]  And so those folks aren't going to die.
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:57.040]  And then you've got to ask yourself, why the hell, what is the plan to hit Australia,
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:05.840]  New Zealand, Europe, the United States, Canada, Iceland, Greenland?
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:12.720]  What is the point of trying to force those countries to take this injection?
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:14.960]  Why do they want the Western world dead?
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:20.280]  Because this is where people have two car garages and swimming pools and due process.
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:23.680]  And the globalists want to take down, they want to kill everybody in Africa, they want
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:27.040]  to kill everybody in Latin America, they already got them financially where they want them.
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:31.920]  They're busy getting us under control, bankrupting us, getting us real sick to get all our money
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:34.880]  and all our energy sucked up by them.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.880]  The hospitals become prisons that train just to live in a big open air FEMA camp.
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:44.400]  And then they're going to take their time killing the Latin Americans and the Africans.
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:54.440]  But they are targeting Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:55.840]  the UK.
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:25:00.400]  I mean, I've seen the prime minister who says he's a conservative.
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:05.360]  I've seen the leader of Australia say, we're not going to have the lockdowns in until 70%
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  take the shots.
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.360]  And then of course, once that happened in the UK, they said, sorry, lockdown continues.
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:12.040]  We just call it freedom day now.
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:17.080]  So here's footage of folks in England.
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:21.160]  And the local news confirmed these are giant COVID camps.
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:24.600]  This one holds in England, 3,000 people.
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:28.200]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:34.480]  Let me show you the one in Australia, they're both these in every state, in every province.
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:38.560]  Construction of Mikkelham quarantine camp starts the age.com.
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:49.480]  Now, listen how sycophantic this Tom Coley article is.
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:53.520]  Construction is underway at Melbourne Center for National Resilience.
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:55.960]  Oh, don't you love that name?
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:02.960]  The unwieldy name given the new quarantine facility in Mikkelham with the camp set to
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:05.240]  open by the end of the year.
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:11.040]  So Australians started off in camps in forced labor when they used it as a prison colony.
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:14.400]  And now they go right back to it.
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:21.320]  The community engagement session of the community engagement session was held earlier this week
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:27.400]  on progress of the fast-tracked 1,000-bed accommodation site for returning travelers.
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:32.400]  However, residents were told that builders would not be delayed by any construction
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:33.400]  process.
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:34.400]  Oh, no.
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.400]  There's no way for this.
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:42.800]  Earthworks have begun at an emptied paddock in Melbourne's North, which sits next to
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:45.560]  the federal government's pet quarantine facility.
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.040]  See, that's how it starts.
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:49.800]  And it's about 300 meters from homes.
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:50.880]  Oh, but don't worry.
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:51.880]  It's safe.
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:52.880]  It won't get you sick.
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:53.880]  It's all about fetishizing that.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:58.320]  The project is being modeled by the Howard Springs Center in Northern Territory, which
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:03.880]  has proven to be highly effective at preventing leaks of COVID-19 compared to hotel quarantine.
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:05.800]  Oh, you can't have the leaks.
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:07.080]  Then they give you the vaccine.
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:08.880]  It makes you grow it, and it goes right back.
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:11.200]  I mean, this is so sick.
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:15.640]  The total excuse for martial law, they had like 10 deaths this year.
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:20.280]  Multiplex has been engaged in the construction of the facility with 80% of the buildings
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.040]  to be prefabricated offsite.
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:29.480]  The center can be expected to be 300, 3,000 beds, but still be operational soon with 500.
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:34.600]  Among the issues raised by the public at the information session Thursday were questions
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:36.960]  about the impact of the real estate prices.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.440]  Yes, sure.
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:41.320]  Not about how you want to leave the country on business or come back because they want
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.080]  to make you commute digitally, folks.
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:44.080]  That's the takeover.
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.640]  And then it's, oh, you can't leave your neighborhood.
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:47.760]  Oh, you can't go three miles outside your home.
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:49.240]  It's about being a prisoner.
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:52.360]  And if you accept it, that's how you'll live.
[1:27:52.360 --> 1:27:57.180]  Among the issues raised by the public at the information session on Thursday were questions
[1:27:57.180 --> 1:28:02.000]  about the impact on real estate prices and the threat of the virus escaping in the community.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.160]  Oh, no.
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:07.720]  And why residents were only receiving information about the project now.
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  That's right.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:11.640]  You're just now, and it goes on to show the beds.
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:16.640]  The beds are half the size of a twin.
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:18.200]  That's smaller than a prison bed.
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:21.160]  You'll have to sleep on your side, but it's wonderful.
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:25.680]  You'll have a television though to tell you what to do, and you'll all be monitored and
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:26.680]  controlled.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:31.080]  Here it's being built all over the world, and it's just this new thing where, oh, the
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:32.080]  contact tracers are here.
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:33.080]  Oh, they're testing.
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:34.080]  Oh, I'm being taken away.
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  Oh, where'd Bob go?
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:37.080]  Oh, he, he died at a COVID center.
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:38.080]  Yeah.
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:42.680]  He, they put him on a ventilator, and this is the, and the, and big tech gets billions
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:47.560]  of dollars out of this per per country and just all of this, an orgy of control surveillance
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  coming in.
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  You ever wondered how they'd get all the home assistance spying on us and how they'd get
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:52.840]  all the big tech out in the open.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:55.800]  And now they're just Apple saying, now we're going to read everything you do on your phone
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:56.800]  and track you.
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:58.880]  It's, it's just, it's all happening.
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:08.080]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic

[1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:16.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:18.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:23.800]  Okay, so what you see happening in Europe and Australia and the UK is coming here.
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:29.520]  First lockdowns, checkpoints, tyranny, everything you see with these FEMA camps being built,
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:33.200]  federal emergency camps all over the world, that's happening here now.
[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:38.760]  Well, now there's new breaking news at infowars.com and this is pretty powerful video, it's four
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:39.760]  minutes long.
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:43.240]  I don't know if it'll play at all plus there's a little bit of cussing by the police.
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:49.400]  Australian police, pepper spray group of teenage girls for shopping without masks and when
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:55.240]  you look at the hate in the eyes of these goon police, some of which themselves aren't wearing
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:01.840]  masks and how they beat people up and how they attack people, I mean, this is just such
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:21.080]  a shame, this is so out of control, of course, the cops that a lot of them don't wear masks
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:35.320]  but they're gone.
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:39.360]  You notice the first thing the Taliban did was take the guns.
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:44.120]  And what's happened to Australia since they took the guns, this is 12 year old girls and
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:48.840]  others being pepper sprayed and manhandled and shat on by these thug police because they
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:53.280]  wouldn't wear their face diapers and get their pneumonia and be good little slaves.
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:56.480]  And again, the same thing has been said by the national government in Australia and now
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:02.560]  by the leader of New Zealand, New Zealand's prime minister orders citizens, don't talk
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:04.080]  to your neighbors.
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:10.720]  That's an actual quote, New Zealand's prime minister has mimicked Australia's top public
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.680]  health official by telling citizens, do not talk to your neighbors after the country went
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:20.920]  into a full lockdown as a result of just a single COVID case being detected if you even
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:21.920]  believe that.
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.960]  So this is martial law, they claim there's one thing that isn't even as bad as the flu
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.960]  and everybody's shut down and they give you deadly shots, they give you cancer and kill
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:30.960]  you.
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:37.840]  They've made their move and now they're censoring everybody and taking over, entire country of
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:41.600]  New Zealand put under lockdown, every just one single case.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:47.320]  Let's play a clip out of Australia with one of the health leaders, ministers, Zinoxymoron,
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:51.600]  they're coming for your life, they're one of the eugenicists, talk about all the fines
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:56.520]  if you're caught with a fake pass or if you stray too far from your home, they check,
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:00.720]  oh, you're only allowed three kilometers from your house, you know, once a week to get food.
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:03.800]  I mean, how about we stand in our head for you people?
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:07.120]  And again, you're like, well, that's Australia, no, that's all coming here, they get away
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:12.920]  with it, they admit it and I've got clips coming up next segment in Oregon, other areas
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:16.640]  where it's now being announced, the camps, the roundups, the plans, they're going to
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:21.360]  try it, they can't help it because they want that power, they want that control to arrest
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:25.720]  normal people because we have criminal governments run by the globalist.
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:31.800]  Here's an Australian announcement, $5,000 from the spot breach of home quarantine, $5,000
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:37.440]  on the spot for lying on a permit, $5,000 on the spot fine for lying to a contact tracer,
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:43.160]  $3,000 on the spot fine for breaching the two-person exercise rule, $3,000 on the spot
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:49.120]  fine for breaching rules going into regional New South Wales.
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:56.560]  There is your nanny state and now Biden came out today, he's your medical doctor and he
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:02.840]  said, you need to take your third booster shot, it's recommended by him.
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:06.040]  So now it'll be, oh, sorry, can't come in with this business, didn't have your third
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:10.600]  shot and your fourth shot and your fifth shot which destroys your immune system and
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  your body.
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:15.280]  Then we had this powerful interview yesterday with a medical doctor, well-known author,
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:19.200]  he went to the hospital and medical doctor illegally imprisoned in Florida hospital
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:24.320]  dungeon in four-point restraints for helping get a doctor for a marathon runner who was
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.600]  dying in the bed next to him and then refusing to even give him antibiotics for bacterial
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:30.600]  pneumonia.
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:35.240]  Their answer was chaining up for four hours, five hours.
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:41.400]  That's America, that's the corporate takeover, that's us not standing up for ourselves.
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:45.640]  The good news is all over the world, businesses are refusing to enforce France's vaccine
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:50.600]  passport and it's happening in New York, it's happening in LA as well, screw them, do not
[1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:54.960]  comply and don't go to the big box stores and the big chains.
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:00.520]  This is all pre-crime ladies and gentlemen, this is all training us that we're criminals.
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:07.360]  Clown world, Australian prime minister declares citizens must wear masks while drinking outside
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:09.960]  or even alone in their homes.
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:17.320]  It's all a gaslighting operation to see what you'll put up with, he also said last week
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:22.400]  we're going to be coming into the suburbs soon and taking you to the shield centers
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:31.520]  when you're healthy to protect you, oh, the shield, that's in the CDC document but they're
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:38.040]  building shield centers, well who's against shield centers and why is it a shield center
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:42.720]  in France, why is it a shield center in the UK, why is it a shield center in Australia,
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:48.720]  why is it a shield center because it's a global government, who, I know I've said this
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:55.240]  a thousand times, who decides what can be said about COVID-19, the UN, you'll wake
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:58.520]  up and you're inside world government, up until four months ago if you said that it
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:02.400]  came out of the Wuhan lab you'd be banned off the internet, hell, they even did more
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:08.040]  banning of us last year, I found the Wired Magazine article, Jones banned for COVID disinfo
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:11.880]  saying that it probably came from a lab, hell I didn't say probably, I showed the funding
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:18.840]  documents, oh but now the public have a pull of surprise to the Wall Street Journal for
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:25.400]  saying it, Wall Street Journal op-ed COVID-19 most likely worked on in lab then escaped,
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:36.600]  it wasn't escaped, it was released and it just goes on and on and on, I see these articles
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:42.640]  all day long, fully vaccinated Southwest Airlines flight and it dies from COVID-19, oh yeah
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:48.440]  when you die from the vaccine, you died of COVID-19 and boy, a lot of folks are gonna
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.360]  start dying of COVID-19, the vaccine, because in the rat studies it took two to six months
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:58.280]  for the rats to get really sick and rats, again, have a much shorter lifespan than us
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:02.800]  and so they're able to dead reckon with that, that if something kills a rat in a few months
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:06.760]  it'll probably kill you in a few years, that's why most medical doctors say two to three
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:11.000]  to five years, we'll see similar things in humans that have happened to rats, but we've
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.280]  already got at least 45,000 dead people in the US from the shot admittedly, so I mean
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:23.120]  it's already just devastating and then there's all the doubling of suicide, doubling of alcoholism,
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:30.640]  children losing IQ points during the lockdowns, I mean this is a very sick psychological attack,
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:36.360]  really vicious, absolutely horrible, now we're gonna go to break and I started the
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:39.400]  show talking about this and the next hour I'm gonna open the phones up again to talk
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:46.160]  about Afghanistan and we've got not a really good idea, we know exactly what's happening,
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:52.320]  this is Obama and the Kamala Harris wing getting ready to throw Biden overboard, something
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.760]  they've been planning the whole time, they set him up with the briefings, they know he's
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:02.720]  senile and so Kamala is now talking about 25th amendment against Biden, she wouldn't
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:07.000]  stand with him on the stage, so you're gonna really see there's no honor amongst these
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:11.840]  thieves as they prepare to try to install her, we'll talk about how they plan to do that
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:19.080]  and also take calls again from veterans and then after I get a full board of veterans
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:23.840]  on the line, we'll open the phones up to everybody to give us your take on where you see all
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.680]  this going, so that's coming up next hour, but first when we come back, getting a lot
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:33.800]  of attention, now DHS Bulletin says opposition to Cuban mandates is potential domestic terrorism
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:38.320]  threat, close quote, that's finally getting a lot of attention, it's in the official US
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:44.280]  government policy, well now the talking point is not just on CNN and ABC News that American
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:49.000]  gun owners and veterans are terrorists and Christians are terrorists and those that question
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.080]  lockdowns are terrorists, now Stephen Colbert says, yay, let's get our troops back from
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:42:00.040]  Afghanistan to wage war with the Tea Party with the gun owners, so I mean they're really
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:05.160]  trying this, they're really trying this and I don't want to fight with the FBI, I don't
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:09.400]  want to fight with the US Army, and they don't want to fight with us either, but they've
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:14.000]  gotten their weird communists in place at the top and they're gonna try to create an
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:19.800]  atmosphere and they're gonna try to create a situation where this civil war starts and
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:23.560]  America ends, so if you're wondering why it's gonna be so messy and why it's so crazy,
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:29.640]  this is a takeover, they're willing to kill, in fact they want to kill the majority of
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:36.080]  the people and just get rid of us, what does the big Brzezinski say, glory died, that the
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:40.640]  times come is just start killing people, because we can't control the West or two spoils,
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.520]  that's the guy that set the Khmer Rouge up and pulled pot, killed a third of Kim Bodeus,
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.200]  so that was a mass murderer saying that, so they've, I mean I'm sorry folks, I'm completely
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:53.640]  freaked out myself, I'm sorry this is what happened, this really is happening, and only
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:59.560]  a full awakening to this is gonna stop it, you better get together and say no.
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:04.760]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:10.120]  we are told, and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:15.680]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem, consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:21.160]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:26.120]  which have been known for millennia, the Hindu Chakras align with the endocrine system, the
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:31.480]  chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the
[1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:37.360]  soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:40.120]  unseen dimensions of reality.
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:45.680]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy, our water filtration
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:51.080]  systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:44:17.920]  propure shower head will seal the deal, get them both today for yourself or a friend
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:43.840]  or a friend of mine.
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:47.560]  just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.320]  ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:54.320]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.760]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:04.880]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:08.040]  we've talked about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:10.560]  lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:14.440]  new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:18.040]  us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:21.480]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on, but
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:24.680]  let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end. We're going to stay
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:29.520]  on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products and
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:33.520]  then for store.com. They're great products, plus they fund the operation. So you

[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:40.680]  freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.960]  fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:48.200]  why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.520]  leave people like us on the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially

[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:04.400]  trying to destroy everything we ever said. The first time I heard the speech,
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:09.920]  the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade and
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:14.320]  we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:17.800]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the
[1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:22.400]  arena. But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear. But
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.200]  Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:30.960]  even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues. And that's why

[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:01.360]  Everything Stephen Colbert says, along with other late night comedy shows, it's
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:06.800]  come out in the news, is scripted by think tanks and prepared and then his
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:12.000]  comedy writers, he's got more than 50 of them, are giving that material to put
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.960]  into a joke because they learned over a decade ago, no one believes the news,
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:22.600]  you know, the big official nightly news. Sure, your local paper saying a school bus
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:26.080]  had a wreck or something or there was a flood here, lightning struck this and
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:29.680]  that's a real article, but big national official things people have learned is
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:32.880]  total spin. I mean, the way they can edit a film, the way they can edit a movie,
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:39.600]  the way they can do any of this is just wild. And so the directives go down and
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:43.600]  then the media just basically repeats all of it. And so when you see Stephen
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:48.160]  Colbert saying, we have domestic terrorists, they're the Republican Party,
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.360]  they're the people that attack the Capitol. Out of a million people in DC,
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:49:00.080]  600, 700 were waved into the Capitol, maybe 20 or 30 fought cops
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:02.960]  and should be charged with that, but not held in solitary confinement.
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:07.680]  There's people that shoot and kill people in Chicago that are out on bail in a
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:11.760]  week, but you walk through the Capitol,
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:16.080]  velvet robes are still under the jail and they want to set that precedent
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.640]  to arrest us for any reason. And if, you know, a militia in Michigan
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:25.920]  jokes and says, man, I'd like that governor's head on a platter.
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:29.840]  Well, then you get SWAT team enrated and thrown in jail with no bond because
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.800]  you're planning to cut her head off. But meanwhile,
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:40.160]  all these comedians and people, they can talk about how they want to kill Trump,
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:44.800]  they can have plays about killing Trump. That's all fine and dandy.
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.040]  So it's very, very dangerous. DHS Bulletin says opposition to COVID mandates
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:52.080]  is potential domestic terrorism. And I've been harping on this because
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:55.440]  I know Afghanistan's a big distraction. I know it's very interesting.
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:01.440]  I know all this stuff's important, but this is really what's happening.
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:04.640]  And so you have to ask yourself, how are they going to get to the point
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:10.400]  of arresting anti-COVID measure protesters? They're going to blow up a
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:13.680]  testing center or shoot some people or do something violent
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:16.800]  or get some mentally ill person to do it and then say, okay,
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:19.840]  anybody protesting this is a terrorist. I mean, they've already done it.
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:24.240]  So clearly the false flag is the next card they're going to try to
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:28.160]  pull. And we'll talk about that too next hour.
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:32.800]  And I'm glad that the boom operator who's just as smart as I am or smarter
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:36.880]  reminded me about Kamala Harris because that's the rest of the equation
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:40.160]  that I meant to get to at the start of the show today.
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:43.040]  And that is that
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:47.520]  this is Kamala Harris and others getting rid
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:52.720]  of Biden. This is the Obama faction that's come out and attacked Biden.
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:55.760]  And this is Kamala that's come out and attacked Biden. This is Kamala that
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:51:01.120]  refused to be on the stage with Biden. And so
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:05.200]  everybody wants to blame Biden. I'm not defending Biden. He's a puppet
[1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:11.920]  who has Alzheimer's and dementia. So it's the same corrupt globalist
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:15.200]  that a hundred percent engineered this where
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:18.640]  the Afghan Air Force was ordered to stand down all of it
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:21.440]  because Biden
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:26.320]  is out to lunch. And that's perfect. I mean, how are they ever going to get rid of
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:29.200]  Biden? You're seeing how they operate. You're
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.160]  seeing what they do. And it's just totally despicable.
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:38.080]  And they're going to end up throwing Kamala under the bus as well.
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:42.000]  They want to denigrate the presidency. They want to denigrate
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.640]  all of these institutions. This is about demoralizing us.
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:51.360]  So here is the guy that went to the Martha's Vineyard party with a thousand
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:54.400]  plus people where there was no vaccine testing and no vaccine
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:57.440]  passports. He was on the show last night. So I watched
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:01.040]  part of this morning and he said, oh, you got to have a covid
[1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:04.560]  pass. You got to have the vaccine to be here at this venue
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:10.080]  at this famous theater. But then he's at Martha's Vineyard.
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:13.280]  He doesn't eat a passport. Because he's a globalist.
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:18.160]  He flies around on private jets. While he tells you you can't have an
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:21.200]  air conditioner, Obama went to Africa and said, you can't have cars or air
[1:52:21.200 --> 1:52:24.640]  conditions. The earth will burn up. Close quote.
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:27.920]  Notice he talked to the Africans like they were stupid. You don't get
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:31.680]  air conditioner or car. Earth burn up if you do,
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:38.000]  he said. It's all sick. It's all just a bunch of corrupt
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:44.480]  con men and pedophiles ruling over us. We just put up with more and more
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:50.720]  and more and more. And when they couldn't suck 2.2 trillion
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:54.720]  dollars out of Afghanistan anymore because the troops wanted to come home
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:57.040]  and now it's time for China. We've modernized the country. They can come in
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.920]  and get all the rare earth minerals now. It's time for us to go. So of course
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:03.440]  it's done in a big humiliating way. Everything they do is to do that. My
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:07.120]  God. The CIA runs Antifa, runs the universities.
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:11.680]  And what do they say? No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:15.040]  Their whole thing is America sucks and white people are bad and just
[1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:18.560]  and George Washington's evil. This is a takeover by globalist
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:22.160]  and it'll enslave everybody no matter what color you are.
[1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:25.680]  So we need governors and legislatures and others and pastors and anybody that's
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:29.840]  prominent but also just grassroots people to push hard for an awakening
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:32.720]  to go speak at your city council, your county commensures, your school board,
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:37.120]  to go speak at your legislature, to go knock on doors, to get aggressive in a
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:40.880]  legal awful way to say this is BS and call out the gas
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:46.560]  lighting or we'll be next year. They're
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:49.680]  going to have lockdowns again under other names.
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.880]  All the countries are already locking down but they're going to do it full more
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:56.240]  for the election next year. It'll be called a civil
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:00.400]  emergency but it's going to be martial law
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:04.480]  and again those of us that are in opposition to it we're being labeled
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:07.840]  officially under U.S. policy as the terrorist
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:11.840]  and the army's being brought home for us as I said
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:15.520]  on Sunday and as I said yesterday I said as the empire that was the headline for
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.000]  the show as the American empire collapses the
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.760]  military's brought home to oppress us just like the Taliban's going and taking
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:25.120]  all the guns from everybody in the country for control.
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:29.200]  Same story happening again. Here it is.
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:32.640]  We've had troops there for 20 years. They fought,
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:36.160]  they sacrificed, their families sacrificed so that we wouldn't have a
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:41.280]  terrorist attack in America planned in a foreign country.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:45.120]  Why should our soldiers be fighting radicals in a civil war in Afghanistan?
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:55.360]  We've got our own on Capitol Hill. Then Biden pointed out
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:59.840]  then Biden pointed out the U.S. did everything we could for the Afghans.
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:03.520]  We gave them every tool they could need.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:08.480]  We paid their salaries provided for the maintenance of their air force.
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:13.680]  We gave them every chance to determine their own future.
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:18.560]  We could not provide them with the will to fight for that future.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.080]  Just a thought. Maybe we should have checked with the Afghan army
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:25.360]  if they had the will before we gave them the tools and the weapons
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:28.400]  because now the Taliban has the will and the weapons
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:32.320]  and the former Afghan army soldiers are at home rubbing miracle grow on their
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:35.840]  face trying to squeeze out a beard by dawn.
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:40.640]  In the end, Biden argued that whenever we pulled out
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:43.920]  the Taliban would have taken over.
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:48.720]  Yeah, the Taliban's mostly, mostly peaceful.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:53.920]  All right, we're going to go to break, toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:58.960]  877-789-2539. Zach, Mike Clarence, Tim, Boogieman,

[1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:54.320]  you're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:58.320]  Would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:59:01.520]  all this stupidity. Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:06.720]  you for a year, okay? I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:10.960]  infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:15.120]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:19.440]  Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the bible
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:25.120]  Jesus the same as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse 9. Then
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:29.360]  they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:34.080]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:38.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:41.280]  and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother.
[1:59:41.280 --> 1:59:44.880]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what
[1:59:44.880 --> 1:59:47.440]  they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:50.880]  God created this country.
[1:59:50.880 --> 1:59:57.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:13.200]  All right we're into hour number three and at the start of the next segment
[2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:17.600]  which is just six minutes away I'm going to write to Zach and Devin and Paul and
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:23.440]  Tom and Clarence and Tim and Boogie Man. You know I am teleprompter free and I
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:26.640]  don't go off a bunch of notes so sometimes I get weird
[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:30.640]  fat toys in my head that I get wrong. Like I know Michael Lindell of my pillow
[2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:33.600]  I've been watching him on there for over 10 years. I know his name is Michael
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:37.520]  Lindell. I keep calling him Dave Lindell
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:42.640]  because I knew in broadcasting a Dave Lindell for like 15 years
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:47.840]  then he retired. He had a fake radio name but his name was Dave
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.960]  Lindell and he went by Dave Lindell and the paperwork and everything.
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:59.200]  I mean God is that guy like 25 years ago so that's why I keep calling
[2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:02.800]  Michael Lindell Dave Lindell because somehow like you know somebody
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:04.720]  for years you get that name in their head then he starts
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.760]  combining it to separately. Michael Lindell is on the broadcast
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:14.320]  today. There was a bunch of disinfo on Instagram and on
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.120]  Facebook and everywhere. They're trying to create infighting and stuff that
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:22.160]  Alex Jones didn't go to the Cyber Symposium conference
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:25.200]  because it was such a disaster. Well A I didn't think it was a disaster.
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:28.320]  I actually watched a lot of it. I didn't watch most of it live but I watched a
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:34.000]  lot of it taped. I taped it, recorded it and
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:39.120]  B the flight got canceled. The engine had a problem and then we were having
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:42.160]  trouble getting more flights because I only had time to go there
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:45.120]  on the Wednesday and then be there Thursday and come back. It was only
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:48.400]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday so I was gonna go for
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:50.880]  Wednesday and Thursday but only be there at night on Wednesday and then be
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:54.880]  there Thursday then come back on Friday. I had a flight at like 5
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:59.200]  30 in the morning to try to fly back as well and the plane broke and then they
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:01.360]  couldn't get us another plane except one was gonna
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:04.800]  you know go to like some other town in the middle of nowhere and then go here
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.320]  and I'd be there like 10 o'clock at night and as much stuff's breaking down
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:12.960]  and things going on I just said that's it I'm not going
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:16.800]  but oh Jones canceled he cut and run because the thing was a disaster
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:20.560]  um it was not a disaster it was very very successful
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:24.400]  and it has been noted by some leftists out there
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:29.120]  finally they said something true that oh Jones didn't point out to Lindell
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  that the same guy that conned him conned Alex and that's actually true
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:39.440]  me and Arpaio and I said I know this is bad I know he's being set up
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:42.240]  I told him on air I told him off air and he would not listen to me
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:46.400]  and that's okay because I get it I've been conned by
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:50.800]  the same person I've been it's it's you live you learn ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:56.320]  but the evidence of of the algorithms and the numbers and the stuff
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:02:59.120]  ballot boxes and how the democrats knew they had a red
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:02.320]  mirage for Trump they were going to supply whatever number they needed later
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:06.160]  into the machines at the point and his engineers were great people and told
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:10.960]  Lindell all of that Lindell fixated on the Q people
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.200]  and they they beat us again folks I mean those damn Q folks are serious
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:19.120]  psychological warfare experts and they are working for the other side
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  and they come to you at BS like oh here's the file here's the total file
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:27.200]  that is going to show all the proof of all the files that they stole it
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.560]  and the dominion ran it from the top and then it's just a
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:33.280]  computer gift of some random numbers it wasn't even real
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:36.720]  and then oh the guy that gave it to him had a stroke and couldn't be there
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:43.120]  and and it's just the same story people want news that's too good to be true
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:46.560]  instead of the democrats told us what they were going to do they said it'll
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:49.920]  look like Trump wins but the next few days will win because we've got the
[2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:52.640]  mail-in ballots and they were going to produce whatever fraud they wanted
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:56.400]  and then feed them into the machines at the retail level
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:03:59.440]  and I saw the media immediately try to make it about machines
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:02.480]  and I saw groups try to get me on the machines and I did a little bit
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:05.840]  and then I went wait a minute I listen
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:12.320]  4chan 8chan all of it ladies and gentlemen is equivalent of black magic
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:16.320]  it's it's it's voodoo it's it's it's it always ends bad other folks on the other
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:20.480]  denies there's some good come out of it yeah but at the end of the day that the
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:24.240]  real operatives running those things have set us up over and over again
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:27.680]  I mean we have the WikiLeaks proof of pedophile rings and Alistair Crowley
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:31.440]  rituals 100% proof it's it's in the they diverted from
[2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:34.880]  New York to DC to a pizza place to distract us onto that
[2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:38.800]  we took the bait they set us up again they do it over and over again where do
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:42.400]  you think the original sandy hook stuff came from these people
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:46.720]  and so I just I've learned who they are that the the cute thing all of it
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:50.320]  and and so that's what's happening is anything else so tariff you can't trust
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:53.600]  you know who people are what's going on they have a track record if not they're
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:56.720]  going to burn you but when Dell is a man in the arena that's
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:04:59.600]  okay he's gonna learn now
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:02.960]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners

[2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:59.680]  it's right here in the news it's not even hidden that obama has been bashing
[2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:04.320]  biden also kamala Harris wouldn't be seen on stage with him
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:08.240]  she's been bashing him she's talked it's in the news about 25th amendment for
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:11.360]  joe they did all this on purpose to maneuver him and have another
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:15.680]  constitutional crisis and just get you used to lockdowns and crises and
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:19.680]  new presidents and weird elections and mail-in ballots just to
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:23.040]  again condition you to accept all the craziness
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:26.720]  that they are now carrying out this is all psychological operations
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:31.360]  shade war big jamie white article kamala Harris reportedly discussed
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:35.520]  21th amendment after refusing to stand with biden during afghanistan
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:41.040]  speech that is up on info wars dot com and then i've got the articles here
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:44.400]  about what's happening there the big takeaway is
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:47.680]  they got all the biometric databases of the afghan government so now they know
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:50.480]  where everybody's at where they are who to go round up
[2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:54.880]  they're face scanning people at checkpoints now using the same ids
[2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:58.800]  that were used to quote find al-qaeda and isis against everybody which
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:02.800]  shows how dangerous these technologies are
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:07.200]  taliban immediately moves to confiscate firearms from civilians saying we will
[2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:11.120]  protect you now no one is allowed to have guns but us
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:14.320]  so the democratic party agrees with taliban big time
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:17.600]  biden authorizes 500 million for afghan refugees
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:22.400]  while micron worries about three million people flooding europe he worries
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:28.000]  because he wants replacement migration unbelievable photo shows hundreds
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:32.640]  of afghans escaped taliban aboard a usc 17
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:38.000]  nightmare images and people hanging off the wheels as they take off and
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.640]  falling to their deaths thousands of feet
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:43.600]  but don't worry the pentagon's got a new enemy it's the american people
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:47.200]  they're all over the news and they're prepared for war with us
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:51.520]  and you know why they could beat us because we are compliant and we bow down
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:54.800]  to authority and we bow down to clown outfits
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:58.560]  i respect veterans and i respect the military you got to have uniforms to
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:02.000]  know who's who but these generals and their outfits and you've got this
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.800]  idiot defense secretary that wears these darth vader outfits now
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:08.240]  with these big face masks on i mean it's all a virtue signaling joke these
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:12.080]  people are a joke to demoralize destroy our military destroy our country
[2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:15.040]  and if we just wake up and refuse the new world order and refuse the un
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:19.200]  and refuse the wto and the imf and refuse all their fear
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:22.320]  and refuse all the big tech censorship we can save the country and lead the
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:26.160]  world out of the collapse into evil but right now that's not happening
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:29.360]  america's got to be taken down so the new world order can take over and remember
[2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:32.240]  this is a spiritual battle all right thank you for holding
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:37.760]  thank you for calling zach in missouri army on afghanistan go ahead
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:40.800]  hey how's it going thank you alex i appreciate you guys it's time thank you
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:48.480]  guys we do um yeah i was uh active army machine gunner 2011 afghanistan
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:53.920]  in the pack of sand border um uh yeah medically slash honorably discharged
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:57.200]  still trying to uh adjust fire back at home but
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:01.600]  what's going on in our country is uh it's pretty crazy thank you for covering it
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:05.520]  everybody needs to to really wake up and understand
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:11.600]  what's really going on and the but if you may not agree with the war
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:15.680]  in afghanistan it did keep the fight over there what the taliban are doing
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:19.120]  right now taking civilian guns and doing things like that
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:22.800]  that's exactly what we stopped them whenever we were there as we would
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:27.360]  clear collats go into villages conduct kelly's key leader engagements with the
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:32.080]  elders trying to figure out what they needed we let them have their weapons
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:36.080]  we let them have their gun with some ammunition it wasn't
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:39.600]  what we're seeing now is the same thing we're seeing over here
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:42.320]  they've been taking our guns for a long time they're doing it over there a lot
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:45.120]  quicker but the administration's doing now it's
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:52.160]  sad you know we all know that he won and everything changing from
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:55.520]  their turn to try to ruin the country with
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:00.000]  the term that they have biden's not running anything we all know that
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.960]  it's a joke and the way they're making people sick with all this stuff with
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:08.160]  these lockdowns it's coming here and the biggest slap in the face
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:11.920]  that us veterans don't want to see is americans
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:15.680]  not standing up for themselves in the ways they should
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:18.960]  banding together in the right kind of ways peacefully
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:22.080]  putting information out there that's irrefutable
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:26.000]  and everybody needs to do it exactly i mean that's classic communist propaganda
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.280]  to turn black against white and vice versa and what do you make of the
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:34.480]  official terrorism directive of the white house now the pentagon and cia
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:38.320]  fbi all of it that it's basically people that question the election and people
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:41.680]  that question future lockdowns which we know are coming
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:46.240]  and they actually are wanting to use the military uh at emergency camps they're
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:49.040]  already establishing them as we speak i mean this is very
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:51.920]  dangerous that's why they're having the litmus test the military
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:55.680]  asking people of their loyal to the globalist
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:11:59.280]  exactly they're trying to see who's actually a patriot or who's going to be a
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:03.280]  sheep and just follow along and get their little crumbs and go to their
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:06.800]  cage nice and quietly you know it's it's it's that
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:10.080]  without the cage they're already making the lockdowns mandatory
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:12.560]  like you're talking about people can't even talk to their neighbors in other
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:16.240]  countries and the gestapo is here it's just in a
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:20.480]  completely different form and it's it's really scary you
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:23.920]  know you know for a gentleman like me in my 30s that is
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:28.000]  i went to war couldn't serve anymore because you know my body was just
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:33.360]  it was used up you know hips neck back over 100 disabled after i got out after
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:36.640]  it was all said and done but i'm still able to
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:40.320]  to do more here you know people here right brother this is the main assault
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:44.480]  and and and overall obama funded the arab spring
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:48.880]  and al qaeda and isis to take over syria libya and uh
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:52.560]  egypt that's why they're doing this instead of having a good drawdown

[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:04.320]  so when i first started taking survival skill basically i was 275 pounds i was
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:07.200]  overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:11.120]  i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr. group on your show and i
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:13.920]  listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:16.640]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:19.360]  shortly thereafter you came out with that too you have you know with a deep
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:22.720]  burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:27.920]  in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:32.000]  enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.840]  over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:39.040]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:43.120]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:46.080]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:49.920]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:52.720]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:56.400]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you

[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:56.240]  ahead yeah i was uh i was an infantryman in the
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:59.760]  army for 10 years served in taktika province godney province i've been all
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:04.640]  over that place um this this fiasco right now
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:08.240]  it's simply meant to do the moralize the vets
[2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:10.720]  because they know that we are the most dangerous people in the country right
[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:14.400]  now to the globalists they know that and it's just to continue to break us
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:19.680]  down mentally and and try to make us give up more hope
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:24.000]  you know we we already know what we've lost over there we already know
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.160]  the demons we all came back with that we fight with every day since we've
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:31.280]  come home they know that's already a mental battle we struggle with and
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:35.600]  anything they can do to further that mental demoralization
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:39.280]  they're going to do it and it's just a long you know you mentioned
[2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:42.560]  in the previous segment you said they stated they're prepared for war with
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:45.920]  the american people now they've started a war with the american people they've
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:49.200]  already started it they're not prepared they're starting it they've already
[2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:52.320]  started it they're waiting for us they're trying to force our hand to do
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:57.520]  something violent that's why how do you get the most dangerous
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:04.400]  population to fall you vaccine the first the
[2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:08.560]  first government organization to be mandated for vaccine was the va
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:11.840]  so all of the doctors and all the nurses and everything and the va start dying
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:14.880]  off and then you've got more than 22 plus a day that's going to kill themselves
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:16.720]  because those are the guys that rely on that
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:21.360]  organization for that treatment that's how you that's how you and then on top
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:25.280]  of mandating vaccines for all of the people around us
[2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:28.880]  when we start watching our loved ones die and the people that we care about die
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:33.280]  that's what the mentality of a soldier marine i don't care what you are
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:36.800]  a warriors mentality the reason we went to afghanistan is we don't like seeing
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:40.960]  people oppressed we're not bullies we want to help people that can't
[2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:43.840]  i agree and what you're saying is genius and i'll hold you over me because i want
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:46.560]  you to have some time here to say this bogeyman you're laying it down
[2:23:46.560 --> 2:23:50.240]  i normally know how their psyops work so i can trick my mind to not let it get me
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:53.440]  down but watching them do this it's even getting me down now
[2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:56.320]  i can't believe they're so evil and i can't believe they're getting away with
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:23:59.600]  it i can't believe the bullying and oppression and then i get mad at myself
[2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:03.600]  and i'm not calling for violence but as a man i'm i mean i'm dreaming about it
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:06.560]  i'm i'm having real problems like i'm a bad person
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:09.760]  i feel like i'm bad for the first time in my life that i'm not doing enough does
[2:24:09.760 --> 2:24:12.880]  that make sense
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:17.200]  that's why they're so good at this this is why i worked with psyops when i was
[2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:20.480]  deployed i know what they're good at i know how they
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:24.080]  the government is perfect this is their numb diploma this is their bread and
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:27.920]  butter they if they can't get us physically they can easily
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:31.440]  easily hit us mentally especially those of us that have already taken a mental
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:34.880]  hit that are already questioning you know there was always a phrase that said
[2:24:34.880 --> 2:24:37.440]  you know about when we talk about the stuff that we had to do over there and
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:40.720]  the stuff that we saw over there and and you know all that
[2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:44.800]  the response is when a lot of us i'm not religious person myself but
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:48.640]  when preachers and stuff would say hey you just got to talk to god you got to
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:53.360]  ask god talk to god our response is god can't forgive everything
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:56.400]  because the stuff that we did the stuff that we had to do the stuff that we
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:24:59.920]  went through is some stuff that you can't forgive yourself for
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:04.160]  and you i'm trying to discuss sorry i'm getting really emotional
[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:11.040]  you you know that higher power is going to you know in itself look down on you
[2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:13.360]  on that but but to get back to what i was saying
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:17.840]  about our mentality the the anti-bullies the protector mentality that we have
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:22.000]  this was our mentality of what made us go in the first place to a country we
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.760]  never been to people we don't know when you start injecting the people around
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.320]  us and our loved ones start falling from it
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:33.840]  that's when you really really start awakening the beast i have to go first
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:36.640]  thing in the morning i told you her all call screener this first thing in the
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:39.360]  morning i took off work because i have to take my beautiful
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:42.800]  39 year old wife and the mother of my children
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:46.400]  and i got to take her to get her hysterectomy tomorrow morning because
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:51.200]  she's been bleeding since the hospital that she works for mandated that she
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:54.480]  get that stupid clot shot
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  and see now see you see now here's the thing rather it's come home to you
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:01.680]  they knew in the studies they did it on purpose they now assaulted your wife
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:05.440]  there what do you think the sigh up is are they trying to start a civil war with
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:09.360]  us what are they doing they started a civil war right now it's just not hot
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:13.040]  they're waiting for us and what is going to happen like you've said before and
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:16.560]  i'm not you know i'm not saying that you were
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:20.640]  instigating this by any means but the phrase that you always said they wanted
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:23.440]  to fight you better believe they're going to get one
[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:26.720]  if they when this starts happening and the loved ones start falling
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:30.800]  and we start watching our families fall
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:34.240]  then you're going to have to change the info wars bumper from
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.720]  if you're listening to this transmission you are the resistance
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:39.280]  hell no if you're listening to this transmission
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.080]  you are the reckoning and that's what we're going to become
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:48.880]  i just know this in all the studies it it attacked the uteruses of rats
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:51.600]  and they study rats because we're similar to them and they knew this and
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:54.080]  that yeah hysterectomies they say are off the chart
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:58.880]  women did your wife take the Pfizer or the Moderna
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:02.080]  her her parents all of them they they they used to be
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.760]  i fought with them all the time all the time it was a constant fight now warned
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:08.480]  them i warned them i warned them they didn't listen
[2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:10.880]  they they followed the they thought the medical
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:14.880]  dogs that were leading them they followed their advice
[2:27:14.880 --> 2:27:18.560]  they did all the stuff that they were supposed to do like good little sheep
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:21.440]  and now she's paying a price for it she's constantly coughing
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:25.120]  well i really like i really like roger stone but i learned about his wife
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:28.320]  literally swole up a week ever she got the second Pfizer shot
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:31.440]  and then they said that's cancer and they admit the vaccine caused it and we're
[2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:34.480]  not supposed to talk about this i mean i wasn't told that confidence i learned
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:36.240]  about it from somebody else so i'm gonna talk about it
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:40.400]  and i'm sorry if she doesn't want that out but i mean it's like the stock home
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:43.520]  syndrome so wait now your wife's coughing all the time
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:47.280]  yeah she's also coughing on smoker coughing all the time
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:50.880]  and i keep telling her she's like i was just allergies i'm like it's not allergies
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:54.640]  you've been doing it it's no it's growing prions and i'm gonna get a
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:57.760]  bunch of doctors on this weekend next week there's a lot of things that are
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:01.280]  known to counter prions but we're gonna be talking about
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:03.600]  for everything they hit us with there's things to respond unless it's like
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:06.640]  radiation you know if you inhale particles of
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:09.200]  plutonium you know it's not you're you're gonna die but
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.640]  when it comes to the spike protein there's gonna be ways to stop it but
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:16.480]  wow so is your wife awake now yeah she's awake now
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:20.160]  before they mocked me they joke about me you know saying i was
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:26.240]  you know all the name your term and uh now all of her hospitals and she even
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:30.160]  will tell you this the hospitals are not overrun because there's too many
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:33.600]  patients the hospitals overrun because the nurses and doctors are leaving in
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.360]  math when she sent she sent me a text a couple weeks ago
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:40.240]  while i was at work she sent me a text and said
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:45.200]  do you still have access to that uh uh dr francis boil statement
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:48.480]  to give the employer hold on don't don't don't hang up let's talk about that
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:52.000]  when we'll go to everybody else to mark and casey and tom and rick and darin and
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:58.720]  honey and everybody else stay with us
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:02.240]  if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of
[2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:05.920]  off-grid electricity this will be the most important message
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:10.080]  you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:14.240]  generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:19.040]  lifesaving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators solar
[2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:23.680]  generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:26.160]  supply of free electricity from the sun
[2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:29.280]  whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power grid issues
[2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:33.040]  or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:36.560]  power outages again even better all this week radio

[2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:03.200]  so what's the most important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the
[2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:07.520]  globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's all
[2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:10.400]  very important but the fuel is paramount and that's my
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:14.720]  allegory turbo force is vitamins minerals amino acids
[2:30:14.720 --> 2:30:18.400]  that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy
[2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:21.840]  clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:24.800]  metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of some people get about
[2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:28.080]  eight hours but people take this people taking sports people cannot believe
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:32.080]  it's the best they've ever had because it's not high nobody puts as much
[2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:35.440]  product into their pre workouts their pros
[2:30:35.440 --> 2:30:38.640]  workouts you can call us whatever you want it's it's a it's a total solution

[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:45.840]  we don't roll with you we search forward together it's like the bulldozer
[2:30:45.840 --> 2:30:48.560]  without the diesel fuel if we don't have your financial support
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:51.280]  we will be defeated you support us to get products you already need that
[2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:55.040]  literally fuel your body your mind it's a win-win 360 together
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:00.080]  info or store.com or AAA 253 3139
[2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:03.280]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s
[2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:06.960]  and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:10.560]  where a world government's being established where members of congress
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:14.560]  and former presidents are censored by big tech and whereas you don't take
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:17.680]  an experimental injection that grows blood plots
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:21.360]  and and prions all over your body that you're not allowed
[2:31:21.360 --> 2:31:26.080]  to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are
[2:31:26.080 --> 2:31:29.520]  imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.760]  if somebody told you this would be happening but it is
[2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:37.440]  happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene
[2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.440]  therapy and it doesn't really work so you got to take it every few months
[2:31:41.440 --> 2:31:45.280]  and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:47.680]  so i can go outside and not get sick from covid
[2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:50.720]  even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's record numbers of
[2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:54.320]  really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus
[2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:57.840]  and that's in mainline studies bill gates and foulsy did this
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:03.120]  need to go to prison for it right now you say you want to fight tyranny
[2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:06.000]  you say you want to fund the second american revolution
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:09.760]  i know you do that's why you're here so i'm encouraging all of you watching
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:13.680]  and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the

[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:24.880]  monday through friday from 11 a.m the three p.m were here live
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:29.520]  wow incredible times they wanted to stop the air a long time ago but thanks to
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:32.560]  you and all your support we're still here
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:37.280]  punished and definitely scarred but stronger than ever thanks to your prayers
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:39.760]  all right i'm gonna go back to this caller and then i'm gonna hit a couple
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:42.480]  news articles and go right back to your calls after that
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:48.240]  but this tennessee had official that was over the vaccine rollout and once
[2:33:48.240 --> 2:33:52.160]  endless mask she said somebody mailed her a dog muzzle
[2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:56.160]  it turned out she had tennessee homeland security investigate
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:00.320]  and they subpoenaed amazon and it was her credit card and
[2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:05.680]  her card and her order and her cookies and she got it delivered to her house
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:08.880]  rub vines evidence fired tennessee vaccine official
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:13.600]  bought dog muzzle sent to her but why is it a perfect inversion
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:17.120]  she wants a dog muzzle on your kid she wants a face diaper on you she wants you
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:21.040]  to take a deadly experimental shot and then she stages a false flag on
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:25.360]  herself and is dumb enough to then call the
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:29.680]  state police to investigate it and they went and
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:35.840]  investigated it and it was her these people never stopped man
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:42.960]  and you know she's white so i can say she did a false flag
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:46.800]  when the black folks do it liberals oh you're being racist no everybody does
[2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:50.560]  false flags because they're leftists
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:53.760]  they do it over and over and over again so i guess i kind of already covered
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:57.600]  that but uh let's go back to boogie man and femur region seven
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:00.240]  boogie man finish up your point you were getting into your wife's got to have a
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:03.040]  hysterectomy now she was a nurse forced to take
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:05.680]  the deadly clot shot as you call it and then you were going to finish up with
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:10.880]  something yeah uh what i was saying is before she
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:13.760]  before she started realizing that i was actually telling her the truth and i
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:18.400]  wasn't just being ridiculous uh a lot of the doctors
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:22.240]  were getting it have an issues with the mandating thing that they were going to
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:26.160]  have to uh take this vaccine or quote unquote vaccine
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.240]  so i get a text from her a couple weeks ago saying
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:34.720]  all the doctors are getting ready to leave do you still have access because i
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:38.880]  told her before about dr francis boyle's uh statement that he had made and
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:42.080]  prepared for people to take to their employer
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:45.440]  about the you know violation of urin bird code and everything else
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:48.560]  and she just kind of rolled her eyes when i first told her about it well
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.080]  she text me a couple weeks ago saying these doctors which all of them i know
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:56.080]  these are all friends of mine these doctors want to know if you can send
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:02.160]  them that link for the uh for dr francis boyle's
[2:36:02.160 --> 2:36:06.960]  violation of urin bird code statement that he can give that they can give to
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:11.440]  the hospital administrators so they are all waking up now
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:14.640]  they're all starting to realize there are good doctors still out there that all
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:19.200]  realize that this is absolute crap and now i'm having to do this same fight
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.120]  for my daughter who works at the same place
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:27.280]  at the same hospital they're trying to mandate it to her who has already had
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:30.080]  covid and who also has a blockage in her lung
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:33.680]  has a pulmonary blockage oh my god and if she dies they won't care i mean
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:36.560]  these people are like mindless zombies but again
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:39.680]  they're not making the white house take it they're not taking the cdc officials
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:42.640]  take it no doctors i know would dare take it
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:46.080]  this is just total insanity well god bless you brother and i'm sorry to hear
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:50.960]  about your wife and uh well that's just terrible wow there he goes
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:54.480]  yeah that's what i'm seeing everywhere and i know people
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:58.880]  that are like 80 years old and get the shot and they start having a menstrual
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:01.280]  cycle or young women just keep bleeding and
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:05.600]  bleeding and bleeding and now they want to give this to our children
[2:37:05.600 --> 2:37:10.560]  because you know what the virus shell is a very fast-growing protein
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:16.960]  is the same chemical compound dose and that is the
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:22.000]  endometrium and so i didn't i'm not a doctor but i've
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.400]  studied all this i was gonna ask him so your wife has really
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:28.080]  advanced endometriosis or what is it and what happens is you take these shots
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:31.120]  and your body just goes completely crazy starts attacking itself
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:35.280]  having autoimmune responses other things inside the lining of the uterus and
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:38.400]  again for folks that don't know that's not blood when a woman has a menstrual
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:42.640]  cycle that comes out it's a blood product but it's basically like fertilizer
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:46.400]  so that the so the egg that's been fertilized by the sperm
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:51.040]  can nest and get enough nutrients right out of that
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:55.040]  right out of that protein crystal structure that the vitamins basically
[2:37:55.040 --> 2:37:58.480]  supercharged vitamins to then grow a tentacle
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:02.640]  into the side of the uterus and start the placenta
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.080]  that's how this works and so we looked at it early on and wolf king woodhog the
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:09.520]  top scientist in germany all of them the top scientist top advisor the u
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:14.400]  is ignoring said this is going to attack
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:20.880]  the zygote attaching to the side of the uterus wall
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:24.080]  because the way this vaccine looks like it's going to attack
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:28.480]  that product so remember they picked a virus
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:33.280]  that's got the same protein as a woman's menstrual cycle
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:37.520]  what's fast growing a woman's menstrual cycle what's fast growing a virus it's
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:42.080]  the same protein so a woman grows that every
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:45.760]  month so that then she can release eggs and if she
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:51.120]  gets it pregnant if the if the i know
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.160]  everybody knows this but folks this is just so damn evil
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:39:00.160]  and when you look at this weapon it just hits everything
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:03.760]  and reminds me of bill gates and the un project in the mid 90s where they added a
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:06.960]  female hormone that's released in the second trimester only
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.920]  without that hormone being released the baby will be miscarried
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:16.560]  they added that female hormone to the tetanus shot so the body that became a
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:20.880]  autoimmune response to that hormone and would attack the baby
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:25.120]  and we're talking of violent bloody miscarriages babies just eaten alive the
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:29.600]  body would just eat the baby and the reports were just hideous
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:32.400]  and a lot of times it would kill the women it was so it was so violent
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:35.760]  and it would get up attacking the again the lining of the uterus
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:40.240]  just a real mess folks a real mess and that's another gift from the un
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:45.680]  so can't make this up can't make this up can't make this up
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:50.240]  can't make this up and the same damn proteins in your arteries
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:55.600]  it's in your lungs it's all over your damn body
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:39:59.680]  oh god i'm angry now all right who's been home the longest let's go ahead and
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:05.040]  talk to tom in texas um go ahead you're on the
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:09.680]  ear my fellow gladiator in the arena
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:15.120]  good to be with you again listen this afghanistan situation of which i'm
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:19.120]  still an active duty member having served in afghanistan during operation
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:25.680]  maywan this is is really meant to destroy the image of united states
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:30.080]  projection of power on a world stage demoralize
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.840]  that country of the united states in front of every other country that's right
[2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:37.360]  and then nato i'm gonna say it now nato is going to rush back in the year or so
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:40.880]  and be the savior well taiwan is going to be the next
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:45.120]  domino to fall so keep your eye on that now as it relates to
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.280]  everything else that's happening this this demoralization combined with the
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:53.840]  24-hour day psychological operation for covet is meant to demoralize the
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:57.120]  country this is right out of uribesmanoff's playbook
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:01.040]  and it's happening to the entire country at the same time
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:04.560]  their war game is to use that psychological operation
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:07.920]  combined with a form of counterinsurgency so that they can
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.920]  have a an action already in place for our anticipated
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:15.520]  reaction and their heavy artillery is being moved into place their heavy
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:19.760]  artillery is going to be vaccine mandates and vaccine
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:23.680]  passports and mandatory shots once that moves into place
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:28.000]  they are literally going to carve this country up and pound it into submission
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:32.320]  now i will tell you information war information does not win wars
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:36.240]  action on information wins wars and until
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:40.320]  the general public decides to action a lot of this information
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:45.040]  and i know you keep asking what can we do boycotts if you cannot
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:48.800]  develop the motivation to cancel your netflix membership
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:53.120]  to stop shopping in these big box stores and stop feeding this beast your money
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:56.560]  and your economic production this is not going to stop
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:59.600]  it is going to continue and they're going to be emboldened
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.280]  and they're going to put a knife to your throat and they're coming for your kids
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:06.800]  and they're not going to stop until they get them well tom your amazing calls

[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:13.680]  everybody else is holding but you're dead right this is a foreign outside
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:17.440]  multinational behavioral psychology operation
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:21.440]  and because none of the globalists feel any heat like plow swatham bill gates
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:24.800]  they're going to continue on that's why my main mission has been to expose them
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:27.920]  and then they've had some heat that's why gates have been pulled back
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:31.120]  but i want to get your ideas on how we peacefully counter this now while we
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:34.080]  still can but they are coming at us with violence they're saying we're
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:37.040]  terrorist they're preparing to false flag and blame us
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:40.320]  so they can literally declare war on those of us that don't take their deadly
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:43.360]  shots but they've got a big problem in that
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:46.400]  around the world and here's so many people are waking up to how bad these
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:49.120]  injections are they've got a real problem

[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:11.680]  and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:15.760]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then

[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:21.440]  burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and

[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:43.520]  the broadcast today but i didn't get around to it but i'm glad that i waited
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:47.280]  till towards the end to do it because now we've got an article on info wars.com
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:50.880]  about it watch australian health minister announce 24

[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:08.960]  kids at schools without parental consent so now they're just going to take over
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:12.880]  them schools and do it and say if the child once said it's okay
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:16.960]  so they're getting in between parental consent just like the pedophiles are
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:20.400]  doing and i've got a whole article on that with
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:25.520]  this you know big european liberal uh poet saying pedophilia is basically not
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:29.760]  a bad thing i mean these people want to wreck innocence ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:33.280]  they are the scum of the earth so here is the clip
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:37.680]  australian uh politician told parents that 24 000 children would be ushered
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:40.560]  into a stadium receive an experimental shot this is

[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:56.720]  after inside when they arrive they'll be literally ushered
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:00.400]  we'll have nurses we'll have some of the youth command will have
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:05.040]  some of the young police from the various operations within police there
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:09.120]  just to guide them through as to where they go they'll be looked after every
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:12.880]  moment inside the the stadium and they'll be well cared for so
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:16.720]  mums and dads feel secure we've got about 24 000 students who are aiming to get
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:20.080]  through next week uh the messages will come out this week
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  and the opportunity is there but really you've got to take it grasp it with both
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:27.920]  hands um i know uh if you talk to any of our
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:31.440]  olympians i'll tell you you just got a grasp opportunity and this is an

[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:10.240]  see his family or he'll be locked up when he gets there in a covid quarantine camp
[2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:14.000]  even though he took the shot they don't care tom in texas on foreign syop and
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:17.280]  the globalist you're a smart guy how do we counter this just
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:20.720]  your ideas for victory i mean i think we just come out and recognize it's a
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:22.880]  foreign takeover and the government's been seized
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:28.480]  and just tell everybody and stop complying well non-compliance has to be
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:32.880]  a part of the program going forward this is behavior modification training
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:37.040]  they are pounding you into submission and and i'm sorry power cannot be
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:40.560]  negotiated with and power cannot be reasoned with power only
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:44.800]  recognizes and respects a greater power so the more you submit and they're
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:47.600]  testing your resolve when he talks about this is a great
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:50.400]  opportunity he's saying this is a great opportunity
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:54.160]  for them to advance the needle by getting your children
[2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:57.280]  they know that if they come for your children and you don't put up a fight
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:01.360]  you don't get any kind of motivation to get off your butt and fight this
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:04.240]  that they're just going to roll right right over you they're gonna have you roll
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:07.120]  you but but but real leaders would want to empower their people in the west has
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:10.720]  has had both bad and good but why is there such a blooming of evil leaders the
[2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:14.400]  whole globalist construct the whole globalist project
[2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:17.920]  because that's their end goal their end goal is to get rid of you you're the
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:21.440]  carbon footprint you're you're the person that they want to get rid of
[2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:25.200]  this is this is very very diabolical
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:29.520]  it is it is in lockstep throughout the world they've documented it
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:32.720]  you don't need any further proof you can type in three random numbers in the
[2:51:32.720 --> 2:51:35.760]  google search engine and after those numbers put new cases and you're going
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:38.240]  to get a litany of new stories it doesn't matter what
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:41.360]  numbers you choose you can try it and you'll see that it that is happening
[2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:46.080]  this is a styop plane and simple they want your children because they want
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:50.080]  to have access into your family into your home set the precedent
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:53.520]  or taking control of your children taking control of your progeny
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:56.800]  that is taking control of your future by doing that
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:00.720]  they're they're dominating you mentally they're dominating you physically
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:03.760]  and they know if you won't fight for your children you won't fight for anyone
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:05.920]  else
[2:52:06.320 --> 2:52:10.800]  absolutely and i can hear you former army psyops guys understand this
[2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:14.400]  uh who are using truth to try to counter
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:19.040]  you know lies now seeing uh what they call black propaganda being used
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:23.120]  and this is just monstrous and they're in on it even down to mid-level people
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:26.880]  they know this is depopulation operation i found a lot of people join this just
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:29.840]  because they're so scared of it they've got to realize the only hope is not
[2:52:29.840 --> 2:52:33.600]  going along with this uh and saying no so i want to call this whole hour of
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:37.040]  calls uh i'm gonna put your call and one of the
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:42.160]  other callers up front i want to like former army psyops
[2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:45.840]  lays out the war on humanity or what should we call this hour

[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:53.440]  globalist what should we call this hour
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:52:57.040]  so this is a path to action folks at the boycott get to take your money out of
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:00.000]  the system and stop feeding this beast don't understand that what do we call
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:03.680]  because you know a headline's half the battle what do we call the all these
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:06.000]  calls what what's the essence what you're saying is
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:10.320]  awaken awaken to the globalist bio war
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:16.160]  or die i mean or or army psyops experts lay out the covid takeover plan or how
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:19.200]  to stop the covid takeover plan but what should the headline i'm asking you
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:23.600]  be for this this this hour so psyops
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:30.160]  detail covid action plan so army former army psyops or your current army
[2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:34.960]  psyops details globalist uh covid plan
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:38.240]  their action plan this is their action plan and this also our action plan
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:41.360]  going forward because if we don't come together and we don't get
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:44.160]  we don't we don't come together with like-minded individuals put our
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:47.680]  differences aside and attack a common enemy we're all done
[2:53:47.680 --> 2:53:50.640]  i totally agree god bless you brother well let me just say this that's why i'm
[2:53:50.640 --> 2:53:54.720]  so freaked out um because i mean i'm a tough guy i can
[2:53:54.720 --> 2:53:57.840]  handle this stuff i knew it was coming but
[2:53:57.840 --> 2:54:01.520]  there's so many people getting cancer from these injections immediately
[2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:06.000]  that i know um and they're all the same none of them want to talk about it they
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:09.120]  took the shot and they're like well yeah i got cancer right after but
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:12.320]  and it's in the literature too and then the spike protein i mean this is just
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:16.480]  like i they actually did this i mean this is like
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:21.440]  bigger this is nuclear war but nuclear war would hurt globalists so they did it
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:25.040]  through injections i mean they did it they did it and they don't care if you're
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:28.800]  a cop or a firefighter or a or a sheet metal person or a
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:31.760]  farmer who you are they're doing it to everyone all
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:35.520]  these big globalist CEOs of people have been dying after the shots i mean
[2:54:35.520 --> 2:54:40.240]  this is just a mass exercise in obedience
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:43.280]  all right i want to jam in all these calls before the next guest host takes
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:46.400]  over and i really appreciate them coming on we got honeys been holding

[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:00.480]  uh yeah sir i'm actually active duty i would like to uh start off though with um
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:04.080]  what do you believe will happen to us the soldiers in the armed forces when we
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:09.920]  say no to the uh death vaccine and um also the
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:13.680]  the failure in uh middle east and where do you think that will probably lead to
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:16.960]  i've also got to point out i'm really happy to hear all these other people
[2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:21.440]  talking out today or uh fellow military as well it's amazing aren't they great
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:25.920]  people uh let's talk about this i'm not a doctor and so i'm not
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:30.240]  going to try to sit there and i'm not a lawyer but i i've got dr francis boil
[2:56:30.240 --> 2:56:33.520]  who sued and got the last two anthrax rounds stopped
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:37.440]  in the nineties and in 2000 and that's why the current law
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:40.800]  says they can't do this to you they're trying to trick you and say you
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:44.240]  violated a order so the order's got to be written and
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:46.880]  you've got to respond the order back is what i've been told
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:49.760]  but i'm going to boil's either coming on thursday or friday you just got back
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:53.680]  from vacation in illinois uh so we're going to get him on just about
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:56.960]  legality and the nuremberg code and stuff but you know
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:00.000]  they want to trick you and they also want to trick
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.920]  uh the the the the the jag officers and they're going to try to find somebody
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:07.040]  doesn't know what they're doing to burn them to scare the rest into it but
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:10.000]  if you know your rights and this isn't a vaccine this is experimental
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  then how is it applicable that you can take an approved vaccine you can force
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:17.440]  troops to take an approved vaccine that that's the only group you can do it to
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:21.200]  there's been big problems with it but but that's there but it's been held that
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:24.480]  you can't do that with an experimental shot so this is not a
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:28.320]  vaccine so when they're using these definitions it's like saying
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:32.080]  you know abc but this is xyz it's a totally
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.000]  different thing uh and so it's going to be probably pretty easy to defeat
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:39.680]  if large cohorts keep refusing which is critical we don't need you guys
[2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:42.560]  out of the fight uh stay there i'm going to come right back and finish up with
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:44.800]  you mark and then more callers straight ahead

[2:59:05.440 --> 2:59:09.200]  spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots
[2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:13.920]  or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:17.040]  couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous
[2:59:17.040 --> 2:59:22.560]  actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:26.240]  supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do
[2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:29.520]  because i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started
[2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:32.400]  taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:36.000]  over a period of time i started noticing okay
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:39.600]  you know this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know i
[2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:43.360]  don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you
[2:59:43.360 --> 2:59:46.720]  know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really
[2:59:46.720 --> 2:59:50.480]  has totally cleared up my skin
[2:59:50.480 --> 3:00:01.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.480 --> 3:00:09.120]  there's a big article up on info wars dot com it begins
[3:00:09.120 --> 3:00:13.280]  pregnant mom complains doctor won't see her because she's unvaccinated well
[3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.800]  good go have your baby at home statistically your child survives
[3:00:16.800 --> 3:00:19.200]  more often with a midwife than at the hospital
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:22.880]  and that's just where this whole world is going mark finish up on the medical
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:28.160]  tyranny your active duty army of other points you'd like to finish up with
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:31.680]  yeah i just want to add to um what you just said about the anthrax shot
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:36.640]  um how do you feel about i heard i read an article saying about how the fda
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:39.920]  kind of uh fudged some things to try to push through the
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:43.760]  uh anthrax vaccine how do you feel like if they try to do that with this
[3:00:43.760 --> 3:00:47.120]  vaccine say that it's not in the unlawful order
[3:00:47.120 --> 3:00:50.000]  well i'm going from memory but i don't think the anthrax ever got approval it
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:53.520]  got experimental approval which again you cannot force someone under the
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:55.760]  nirnberg code or common sense to take something
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:00:59.040]  that is experimental and not been tested so it's extremely immoral
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:02.160]  god bless you brother great point and we're gonna get dr boil on about that
[3:01:02.160 --> 3:01:07.520]  very soon we're coming right now okay up next

[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:31.600]  there it's called the scotia pass and the liberals have posed
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:35.120]  to get that through and they obviously wanted through because so oh we're
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.480]  going to like to sell with dr strang which is our medical like the top
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:41.840]  doctor in ova scotia but we're going to put through

[3:01:44.880 --> 3:01:48.880]  so basically if you don't have the pass uh well if you have the pass
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:52.000]  you know it's used for restaurants it's used for
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:57.120]  shopping that's absolute 1984 crazy an experimental shot that doesn't protect
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:00.080]  you that causes it to slug off and makes you sick
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:03.280]  and does all this crap with liability protection that you've got to have this
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:07.040]  app to go in there i mean this is this is this is maximum tearing the in-game
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:09.840]  goal you got to have a phone to leave your house or go anywhere
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:14.560]  what a sick joke this thing that's still messed up even i went to see my
[3:02:14.560 --> 3:02:18.720]  doctor and he's like you know there's doctors here that are not going to be
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:22.400]  really seeing patients that are their vaccine he's in this is an md
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:25.520]  and he said but i'll i'll take you because you've been you've been with me for a
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:28.960]  long time and and he can i ask him i talked to
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:32.640]  talked to him about he said yeah he said there's a two page waiver to take the
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:35.920]  vaccine and this is my doctor's word he's like
[3:02:35.920 --> 3:02:38.800]  okay i can't say the f bomb but he's like i'm not going to die from f and
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:44.160]  covid like he literally was like like like brainwashed by this and it was so
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:49.600]  sad he signed a two-page waiver can you imagine a liability waiver
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:54.720]  and he took the two doses and well that's right a lot of hospital groups
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:57.200]  make people sign a waiver even though it's been given emergency
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:00.320]  authorization as liability protection they still are worried because they know
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:03.840]  this i mean this is bad did you hear all the people getting cancer after they
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:09.200]  take the shots i haven't really heard about cancer but
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:11.360]  well that's the thing we're going to be talking about because let me tell you
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:15.280]  let's see what in the news people are getting lethal cancer in like weeks
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:21.360]  after taking the moderna or Pfizer shot um i have i've heard of miscarriages
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:26.320]  for my best friends uh fiancee and they're having fatality problems i've
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:30.400]  heard my grandmother got a blood clot in two weeks in her leg
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:38.160]  um after she got she got the vaccine um my um my one of my aunts got it and
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:41.120]  she doesn't stop coughing like the other caller said
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  she's always has this cough and uh she won't admit that you know it's the
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.520]  vaccine um absolutely growing prion crystals
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:53.280]  in her lungs growing growing growing and
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:56.080]  again what are they going to do when everybody that took the shots is dying
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:59.600]  well that's why they have them slough and create the protein for us
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.040]  so we get sick as well but it looks like it's way worse when you have the shots
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:05.920]  the majority of the deaths and most of the hospitalizations around the world
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:09.440]  are the vaccinated so folks it's a war they came for us they want to
[3:04:09.440 --> 3:04:12.720]  exterminate us it's here i appreciate your call
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:17.440]  all right i'm gonna go to break we've got a special guest
[3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:23.920]  house coming up so i want to jam in honey and kasey and zack when we come
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:28.480]  back in 60 seconds separately
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:31.200]  you have to understand this isn't all the medical literature i saw a bunch of
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:34.720]  tweets people saying oh how does jones think all these
[3:04:34.720 --> 3:04:38.400]  doctors would lie the majority of doctors you see
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:41.440]  out speaking honors thing this is all deadly doesn't protect you we have the
[3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:44.640]  doctors and scientists there are the callers earlier we're like half the
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:47.840]  hospital quit over this that's in the news as well
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:50.400]  so this is not going well for the globalists folks they're just gas
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:53.200]  lighting us because the media is not reporting the fact that
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:56.720]  20 some percent of australia took the shot that's why they're under martial law
[3:04:56.720 --> 3:04:59.680]  great job ossees
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:03.120]  i have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners

[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:34.320]  lockdown because of the globalist siege on small businesses

[3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:21.440]  from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:26.240]  it's alex jones that's right all the major channels can cush
[3:06:26.240 --> 3:06:30.000]  because they're liberal and the cdcs put up billboards and signs in new york
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:34.960]  saying take the effing shot and wear your effing mask
[3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:39.360]  i mean you talk about twilight zone that there's an article in info wars.com
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:42.880]  about that that again you should really really really
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:46.320]  go check out but right now we're going to your phone calls and then i'm going to
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:49.680]  cover that article can we can we put that article on screen
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:53.680]  because you guys i saw it during the break there it is get the effing vaccine
[3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:56.720]  wear an effing mask
[3:06:57.680 --> 3:07:01.520]  we don't know we are going to show it the city of new york
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:05.680]  shows this we can't show the pedophile events
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:08.720]  that they have at public schools with five-year-olds in the laps of men with
[3:07:08.720 --> 3:07:13.280]  only glitter on their penises but then we're not supposed to show
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:17.200]  this on tv to people that they're showing on the sides of new york
[3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:21.040]  it's called documentary that's the same reason
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:25.040]  that when you tune into npr they'll have cuss words on the tapes
[3:07:25.040 --> 3:07:28.800]  is because it's for documentary reasons we have no rights in this country this
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:32.160]  is a perfect example about christians and conservatives
[3:07:32.160 --> 3:07:37.120]  are hamstrung by all the fake rules that are for us but not for them
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:41.600]  leave it on screen right now so that's what i'm talking about the article is on
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:44.560]  info wars dot com that's what the government
[3:07:44.560 --> 3:07:49.040]  puts up in your face with a cdc symbol on it trying to demand you do this
[3:07:49.040 --> 3:07:52.560]  and then you're so stock home syndrome you're not even supposed to show it
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:56.640]  has just got a cuss word on it but the government can do it
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:00.240]  see how that works put take that down now and pull up the article
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:03.680]  i'm taking over the whole hour that's it almost the whole thing
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:07.280]  listen i mean here we are ladies and gentlemen dealing with the total
[3:08:07.280 --> 3:08:10.720]  takeover of civilization total satanic takeover ladies and
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.080]  gentlemen and it's just like in the great
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:22.960]  film and the great writers millis and others that wrote apocalypse now
[3:08:22.960 --> 3:08:25.920]  that's based on a composite true stories but also heart of darkness
[3:08:25.920 --> 3:08:30.720]  as the fiction component where colonel kerch is talking about
[3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:34.240]  we drop napalm on villages of men women and children
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:37.600]  but then the generals won't let them write
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:40.960]  the f word on the sides of the airplanes
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:44.480]  we can't write fuck on the side of the airplane but we're going to drop
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:48.400]  napalm on children it's the same thing the cdc puts up
[3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:54.720]  gangster signs saying you hear me you wear your effin mask you wear your
[3:08:54.720 --> 3:09:00.560]  effin you take your effin shot but then on broadcast tv we're not
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:05.680]  supposed to show it but as i said earlier c and n can show it
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:08.400]  because they're the liberals they get to do whatever they want
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:13.360]  they get to boss you around they get to cuss can we pull up the marketplace
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:17.200]  of the big un supported liberal top
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:21.200]  laureate you know saying pedophilia is not bad and we're all pedophiles
[3:09:21.200 --> 3:09:24.400]  i mean that's who these people are no we're not all pedophiles like you i
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:27.520]  don't want to screw kids i'm not sexually attracted to children
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:31.440]  you are you're screwed up you need to kill yourself
[3:09:31.440 --> 3:09:35.280]  seriously you want to kill us you think we're too many of us how about you want
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:38.000]  the blank bitch
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:43.760]  uh how about that i'm not gonna hurt you you're a second garbage i would
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:47.120]  stomp on you if you're on fire but the fire out the point is
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:50.560]  is that you are a disease you are a cancer
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.760]  and you need to be stood up against all of these people
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:09:59.120]  honey in canada i appreciate you holding honey go ahead
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:02.880]  are you alex welcome go ahead so
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:07.200]  afghanistan i do believe was led to lead to stabilization in the area
[3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:11.680]  against russia so biden doesn't care if uh caliban takes over because
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:14.720]  you know the more area like issues in the area the better
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:17.840]  uh russia is going to have to respond now obviously that
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:21.360]  caliban's going to go for resources probably in the caspian sea they want
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:24.240]  to get out of the mountains they're going to go for areas that are
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:28.000]  low population and then obviously instigate more violence against the
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:31.120]  russians which will lead to more funding needed for nato
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:36.320]  that's a good money scam um there's disputed boundaries to pakistan as well
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:40.080]  so by pulling out the u.s pulled out of afghanistan i'm pretty
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:42.720]  pretty sure that's why the pakistani's probably hacked
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:45.280]  because they're good at that half all the u.s infrastructure and they probably
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:48.560]  will continue to because they're pissed off there's a lot of resources over
[3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:51.760]  there as well so there's trillions and trillions in
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:55.680]  rare earth minerals so we just built the infrastructure for the chai comms to
[3:10:55.680 --> 3:11:00.080]  roll in and get it all yeah yeah so there's going to be lots of you know
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:02.960]  things in the area we're going to have to see the war is not over
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:06.560]  afghanistan is a you know bordering on um you know russia basically they're
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:11.040]  going to take territories it's going to be world war three if that happens so
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:14.560]  well you've got you've got i appreciate your call thank you for holding
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:18.880]  uh yeah china's got attack ships and airplanes off
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:22.720]  taiwan or hong kong threat to invade because it's all signaling america is
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:26.320]  weak america is weak to try to get china to attack
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:29.600]  and this is just the total solid of the country and we've been overrun by
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:32.720]  chinese agents and we're in so much trouble but don't worry steven cobert
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:34.960]  says thank god the troops came back from afghanistan
[3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:38.400]  because they can fight the tea party and the insurrection is now
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:42.880]  the left actually wants a war with the american people
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:46.640]  they don't want prosperity they want nothing kasey in oregon then our guest
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:50.880]  hoax takes over and then is that kasey go ahead norga
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:56.240]  hey hoax you info warlord it's uh pleasure good to talk to you or marines
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:00.560]  serve in afghanistan twice what's your take on this
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:04.000]  uh i just want all my brothers out there to know like this
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:09.920]  this has been planned since since at least 2011
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.480]  that uh trump was never supposed to win and get no office
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:19.600]  and that this pullout in afghanistan would have happened in 2017
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:22.960]  under the first year of the clinton administration
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:26.880]  my first appointment was really gun ho lots of patrols
[3:12:26.880 --> 3:12:31.680]  vehicle patrols foot patrols really taking the fight to the enemy
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:35.040]  and now i realize that that was just a regime change
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:39.280]  and on my second appointment i was a dog handler
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:43.040]  and my job in in uh southern afghanistan
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.960]  was just to search any vehicles that were coming into the base to drop off
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:50.880]  supplies and i was just a corporal on e4
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:57.200]  so uh you know i wouldn't have even seen this if i wasn't a dog handler
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:13:00.960]  searching at the gates for all the vehicles coming in
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:06.000]  and i it struck me as odd our chain of command came out
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:10.160]  and the conix box never made it to our side of the base that made it to the
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:14.640]  afghan national army side of the base and they were passing out
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:20.240]  brand new factory wrapped m16s and m4s to the ana army
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:23.440]  which i just thought they were stupid because
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:29.040]  i had marines in my unit that had m16s and m4s that were silver because all
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:32.960]  the bluing was worn off of them and it made sense to me that we were
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:36.000]  giving them you know up armored humvees and stuff
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:40.160]  like that because we had phased those out they were no longer
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:44.080]  effective they can't stop ied so made sense to me
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:48.320]  but why give them the brand new rifles while we have rifles that are falling
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:52.720]  apart and now looking back and with the fast and the furious
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:57.600]  and the gun running in syria now i see that the chain of command was
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:02.480]  actually gun running to the enemy this was planned way back i mean
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:05.520]  that was in that's right they've been running the criminals inside our
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:08.560]  government have been running radical islamic groups in saudi arabia
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:12.000]  for over a hundred years it goes back to brain intelligence great points thank

[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:36.480]  but what they didn't count on is trump winning obviously reigniting patriotism
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:40.880]  nobody's talking about the chinese over there mining mass amounts of silver

[3:18:59.040 --> 3:19:02.320]  support it is through our five senses that we are
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:06.320]  kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:10.400]  and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:15.360]  which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:19.680]  forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural
[3:19:19.680 --> 3:19:22.560]  functions natural functions which have been known
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:26.480]  for millennia the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system
[3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:30.080]  the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:33.680]  also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland
[3:19:33.680 --> 3:19:36.800]  is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:42.240]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:47.280]  to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:51.360]  proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free
[3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:55.360]  and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get them both today
[3:19:55.360 --> 3:20:01.120]  for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com
[3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:17.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:20.880 --> 3:20:24.720]  hi there i'm k dally from the k dally show thank you alex and
[3:20:24.720 --> 3:20:28.320]  wow how do i how do i follow that wonderful callers
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:34.720]  and we have chaos abroad we have chaos here i don't even know which one to
[3:20:34.720 --> 3:20:37.920]  focus on say the truth folks and on my show today i'm gonna have to
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:41.360]  focus on both because both are so insane right now
[3:20:41.360 --> 3:20:45.440]  as far as afghanistan goes uh let me just say this these were my thoughts
[3:20:45.440 --> 3:20:48.720]  right out of the gate for afghanistan and by the way you can go to kdally
[3:20:48.720 --> 3:20:53.120]  radio.com for more on all these subjects but i'll tell you what this these are
[3:20:53.120 --> 3:20:56.960]  the first things number one it dropped in the very weak
[3:20:56.960 --> 3:21:02.960]  michael indel did his symposium for uh for for the voting fraud so of course it
[3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:06.480]  has to drop in the very same week so none of the media that was there all the
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:08.720]  fake media is not going to talk about it
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:12.160]  secondly is this theater chaos planned of course it is
[3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:15.680]  they know exactly what they're doing i heard a sound clip earlier that said oh
[3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:19.120]  i don't know what you know i we didn't know we couldn't have we couldn't have
[3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:23.600]  even uh foreseen this it's a joke it's a total joke
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:28.000]  so that's not the case either also planned chaos what does that mean
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:31.200]  well uh do we are we are we trying to get a bigger
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:35.840]  presence there now to justify it who knows are they making more money off of
[3:21:35.840 --> 3:21:39.840]  the vaccines than they do the poppy fields that's a good question
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:43.840]  and of course it's changing the conversation so when it changes the
[3:21:43.840 --> 3:21:47.760]  conversation we're not talking about why we were there for
[3:21:47.760 --> 3:21:50.880]  20 years that felt like 50 years for no reason
[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:54.480]  now we're talking about how we're leaving and so it's chaos
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:21:58.480]  it's chaos and also i had this thought too are they throwing biden under
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:02.160]  the bus a little bit on this and the media is kind of jumping on a little bit
[3:22:02.160 --> 3:22:05.360]  which never happens he's a bag of sand with eyeballs
[3:22:05.360 --> 3:22:09.760]  never happens but are they doing this because when kamala takes over
[3:22:09.760 --> 3:22:14.000]  no one will miss him no one will miss him now but the media won't admit that
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:19.280]  so we have a lot going on uh overseas right now and the chaos and without
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:22.960]  without ice is around uh to terrorize us that you know with
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:26.160]  they're matching tennis shoes and they're matching white outfits and
[3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:29.440]  toyota trucks well now we're looking at a situation where
[3:22:29.440 --> 3:22:34.720]  they're building up the Taliban right uh general mark milley was right
[3:22:34.720 --> 3:22:38.160]  on uh i think it was cbs talking about the fact that oh
[3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:41.600]  hey um now that this is happening we're going to have
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:44.960]  terrorists now from afghanistan coming over here
[3:22:44.960 --> 3:22:48.240]  providing us with terror attacks so are we going to get a whole bunch of false
[3:22:48.240 --> 3:22:52.000]  flags well it's a question it's a question
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:56.640]  um i was on uh alex's show for my husband he is doing great we had a
[3:22:56.640 --> 3:22:59.920]  we had a situation in which we were in the hospital and had to
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:02.880]  absolutely change their protocol and refuse the ventilator
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:06.720]  and a lot of people are emailing me from all across the world
[3:23:06.720 --> 3:23:10.640]  with these same kinds of issues but mostly doctors and nurses
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:15.040]  are are telling me to keep talking about what happened to us in the hospital
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:18.480]  almost felt like it was meant to be for a reason for the for the very reason
[3:23:18.480 --> 3:23:22.240]  that i can speak out about it right and tell the truth about it
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:25.920]  and so you know what uh get that video and share it it will save a life and
[3:23:25.920 --> 3:23:30.160]  i'm getting a lot of videos or a lot of messages in my inbox
[3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:35.600]  that are all about hey i my wife is saved and she's uh sitting on the bed
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:38.800]  12 hours after changing the protocol and she's doing great and they're moving
[3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:43.360]  her out of icu so i love that also i want to give you a little bit of
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:46.240]  food for thought before i dive into a little bit of research for you that i
[3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:50.080]  think you're going to find a little shocking and when i say that what i mean
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:54.960]  is this let me give you some research i've done over the last 19 months
[3:23:54.960 --> 3:23:58.480]  what didn't happen last year that they never talk about
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:02.480]  usually the media really kind of bypasses this subject
[3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:07.520]  and they don't mention the very things that usually pop out into the obvious
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:11.120]  right so ask yourself this why did they not
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:14.720]  build one single cemetery in the year 2020
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:18.880]  they didn't i know so you get crickets when you say that because
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:24.160]  there was no cemetery added on to no cemetery for the 500 000 extra dead
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:28.080]  did they just pull from all the other categories and call it covid
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:32.560]  hmm all right and also uh they spent less money
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:38.080]  uh than they did in 2019 on burial okay i looked into this i did the research i'm
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:41.840]  telling you this is just it's it's almost astonishing when you start
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:45.040]  thinking about this because we actually spent a million dollars
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:52.000]  less in 2020 than we did in 2019 yeah also did you ever see the casket makers
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:55.920]  on tv asking for home help because they could not
[3:24:55.920 --> 3:24:59.120]  build enough caskets because they couldn't get to everything
[3:24:59.120 --> 3:25:04.960]  no no shortages there no homeless populations dying off
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:09.600]  no pets dying off all of them unmasked obviously
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:13.920]  not having access to breathing the same air we do
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:18.800]  no amazon workers dying in large numbers or post office employees or
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:23.280]  walmart workers the only people that could well they were essential
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:28.000]  the whole time the reason i say these things is we're about to go into another
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  lockdown i'll i'll bet you and they're going to base it on this fake
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:35.280]  delta variant that has no symptom list it has
[3:25:35.280 --> 3:25:39.840]  absolutely no test they have diagnosed the world
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:44.880]  with a delta variant with absolutely no explanation at all
[3:25:44.880 --> 3:25:48.480]  right and you're supposed to believe that
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:52.400]  you're supposed to believe that i don't believe it for a hot minute
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:58.880]  i know you don't either so based on this we do have people with pneumonia
[3:25:58.880 --> 3:26:02.720]  my my other question was is it uh legionnaires
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:07.600]  legionnaires is like an extreme pneumonia okay doesn't have the crackling in the
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:11.440]  lungs is just all the other problems and there was an
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:15.600]  instance when swine flu came around in 1976
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:19.600]  where all the sudden legionnaires popped up at the same time
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:23.440]  kind of interesting right so i'm going to talk about a little bit of research
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:26.720]  with you and i'm going to bring you into because i just saw a headline
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:34.080]  on msn again just pulling the 1918 flu out of the cobwebs to convince you
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:38.960]  that this covid thing is 1918 all over again
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:43.360]  well i'm gonna blow a hole right through that and uh i looked into the
[3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:47.280]  newspaper archives i actually went back into
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:51.360]  the the archives of 1918 i looked at the numbers
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:58.000]  i went into the archives of 1940 i went back to 1976
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:01.920]  i went back to the swine flu and i looked at the numbers
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:06.000]  that were being uh that were being kind of heralded on cnn and
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:09.600]  how the numbers have changed and i want to share this with you because i think
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:14.800]  this is so fascinating do they lie of course they lie you know this i know
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:18.960]  this of course they do so i'm going to tell you
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:23.840]  exactly how they how they do it and it's actually really easy for them to do it
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:27.280]  surprisingly that's what's so phenomenal about
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:30.720]  this whole thing we have been drug into a worldwide
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:34.560]  lie and we're not noticing this we're not seeing it
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:38.880]  covid cannot be all things it can't be all flu all cold all respiratory
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:42.080]  all pneumonia and when i was in the hospital
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:45.920]  with my husband who had pneumonia if they would have just treated simple
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:49.760]  pneumonia he would have been out just fine right and he was
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:53.120]  that's what we did we under treated rather than over treated they have
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:58.240]  created a circus the cdc spends a lot of dollars giving them
[3:27:58.240 --> 3:28:02.320]  a big cushy paychecks for having people in the icu that long
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:06.880]  so all i'm telling you is look we have we have to go back into history a little
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:10.400]  bit uncover the lies so that people can understand out there
[3:28:10.400 --> 3:28:15.360]  what we're facing right now they've done it before and now it's on steroids
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:19.520]  and i don't think the world is really getting it the reason i talk so much
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:22.560]  about covid too on my show and have for 19 months
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:26.960]  is because you and i both know if they don't see through this
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:31.680]  what else what what's next what are we going to do to save this country
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.760]  they're still stuck on all of these lies and they think that they're selling them
[3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:39.600]  well let's blow some holes through the research shall we
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:43.920]  i think we should and you know what um this this might be pretty surprising to
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:46.480]  you too but this is how they did it you'll love it
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:49.680]  and we'll be right back of course after the break
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:53.280]  again thank you alex for letting me guest host what a thrill right

[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:27.040]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:29.600]  shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:33.760]  and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out the open
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:36.800]  our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off there that's
[3:29:36.800 --> 3:29:40.000]  why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:44.480]  enslaved and america still quasi free you can't have info wars has been
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:48.240]  proven right be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold

[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:54.960]  and get an info war store dot com get some great 2020 election shirts
[3:29:54.960 --> 3:29:57.920]  supplements and so much more they're wonderful products and they support the
[3:29:57.920 --> 3:30:02.080]  info we're thanking so when i first started taking survival
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:05.440]  shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:09.200]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job
[3:30:09.200 --> 3:30:12.640]  and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[3:30:12.640 --> 3:30:16.720]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:19.440]  shortly thereafter you came out with that too you have you know with a deep
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:22.320]  burdened source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:28.000]  and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:32.080]  enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and
[3:30:32.080 --> 3:30:35.920]  over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:39.760]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:43.520]  amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if
[3:30:43.520 --> 3:30:46.800]  you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the
[3:30:46.800 --> 3:30:50.800]  point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist
[3:30:50.800 --> 3:30:54.800]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[3:30:54.800 --> 3:31:00.080]  beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and godspeed
[3:31:00.080 --> 3:31:03.280]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s
[3:31:03.280 --> 3:31:06.960]  and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[3:31:06.960 --> 3:31:10.480]  where a world government's being established where members of congress
[3:31:10.480 --> 3:31:14.480]  and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take
[3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:17.680]  an experimental injection that grows blood clots
[3:31:17.680 --> 3:31:21.280]  and and prions all over your body then you're not allowed
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:26.000]  to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:29.440]  imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago
[3:31:29.440 --> 3:31:33.680]  if somebody told you this would be happening but it is
[3:31:33.680 --> 3:31:37.440]  happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene
[3:31:37.440 --> 3:31:41.360]  therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few months
[3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:45.360]  and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so
[3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:48.640]  i can go outside and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from
[3:31:48.640 --> 3:31:51.760]  covid and now there's record numbers of really sick people
[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:56.160]  from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies
[3:31:56.160 --> 3:31:59.840]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now
[3:31:59.840 --> 3:32:06.400]  the first time i heard the speech the first time i read the writings of
[3:32:06.400 --> 3:32:11.200]  Teddy Roosevelt i was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher
[3:32:11.200 --> 3:32:14.240]  that had us write a paper on the man in the arena
[3:32:14.240 --> 3:32:17.040]  and i just remember thinking about that and saying i want to be the man in the
[3:32:17.040 --> 3:32:20.000]  arena but when it comes to media info wars has
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:23.280]  been the tip of that spear but michael indel has come along
[3:32:23.280 --> 3:32:27.760]  and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes
[3:32:27.760 --> 3:32:31.840]  to election fraud and other issues and that's why if you go to mypillow.com

[3:33:07.520 --> 3:33:24.800]  hi there i'm kate dally from the kate dally show your guest host today happy to
[3:33:24.800 --> 3:33:28.240]  be here with you we have so much to talk about don't we
[3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:32.400]  chaos abroad chaos at home and something we've never seen before
[3:33:32.400 --> 3:33:35.920]  in fact i've been doing radio for about a decade and this last
[3:33:35.920 --> 3:33:40.880]  19 months has been the hardest most exhausting
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:45.840]  craziest most insane part of part of this career i if you want to call it a
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:49.920]  career i was kind of dropped onto a station and had to kind of figure it
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:52.480]  out and i was a little bit of a neocon and then
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:55.760]  all of a sudden i had to start researching and researching and researching
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:33:59.680]  i still stay up to three in the morning uh researching all the time now
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:02.720]  so it's a little crazy uh but i want to share some things that i found with you
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:04.880]  that i think will be very beneficial for you
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:08.240]  there were two more things i wanted to mention that people don't ever talk about
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:11.920]  when it comes to the whole covid narrative and that is a plague an
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:17.040]  airborne plague really is when 30 to 40 of your closest friends
[3:34:17.040 --> 3:34:21.200]  die around you and just drop dead that is an airborne plague
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:24.320]  it is not when you just know somebody that is
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:28.800]  sick in the hospital or you know somebody that has a has an issue going on
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:32.320]  that does not mean it's a plague but people out there have been trained by
[3:34:32.320 --> 3:34:35.920]  the by the mainstream fake news to think that they're in the middle of a plague
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:39.520]  all the time and with this 19 months right 19 months
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:45.280]  later can you believe this insanity uh anyway i thought we'd figure it out by
[3:34:45.280 --> 3:34:49.760]  now but i guess not so as a whole i know you guys get it but as a whole
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:53.040]  and so i just wanted to say that it just because i know somebody with cancer
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:55.600]  doesn't mean everyone's got cancer is going to get it so
[3:34:55.600 --> 3:34:59.600]  just knowing somebody is not a plague the other thing i wanted to mention is
[3:34:59.600 --> 3:35:02.880]  in the back of the cdc protocol that they give the hospitals
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:06.240]  they name about four different vitamins and minerals
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:10.000]  this is really important because there are thousands and thousands of
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:13.120]  minerals and vitamins out there right but they get to the very
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:18.240]  end of this report in the 341 pages of directive that they give the hospital
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:21.520]  and what's really interesting is they only name the four
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:26.080]  that really help in these situations uh for respiratory right that really help
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:30.160]  with inflammation vitamin c zinc and uh and you know
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:34.880]  you've got nac you've got vitamin d they mention these things and they say oh
[3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.560]  yeah and they don't work by the way well i went back into some research and
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:41.760]  back in 1948 doctors were were discussing the
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:46.080]  fact that vitamin c was actually the one of the most powerful
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:48.880]  things you could give somebody with pneumonia because it cleared up the
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:52.240]  inflammation quickly right it really helped the body's own immune system
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:55.200]  and by the way we don't have an immune system anymore do we according to
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:58.640]  everybody uh but we do we do have an immune system so
[3:35:58.640 --> 3:36:02.720]  i just wanted to say that because it's like they only picked out the ones that
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:05.760]  would work and then they said insufficient data and then they said and
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:08.880]  yeah and uh don't look here they don't work uh
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:14.400]  crickets yeah they don't work so yeah bypass these but why didn't they mention
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:18.240]  all the other thousands just the ones that worked right
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:22.240]  anyway so i just it was like uh i stole a cookie from the cookie jar no i i
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:25.760]  didn't steal it but it's in my room you know that kind of thing it's ridiculous
[3:36:25.760 --> 3:36:29.120]  isn't it so just we have to call them on this kind of
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:32.960]  stuff so i went back and i i i know that they always
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:38.000]  pull out 1918 flu every single time they want to scare us to death and promote
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:41.680]  fear porn in this country well i started doing some homework going back
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:45.600]  into the newspaper articles and you might find this pretty interesting
[3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:48.640]  i went back because right now what is the narrative
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:52.480]  okay it is 50 to 100 million people died
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:56.400]  okay in a 1918 and we can't have that again
[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:00.400]  and then i thought wow 50 to 100 million that's a really broad number
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:04.160]  and also where are they getting that number from so i started going back into
[3:37:04.160 --> 3:37:07.200]  the archives and each newspaper in the country they
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:10.960]  weren't like you know mafia owned by back then
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:14.960]  so each newspaper would print this is how many people died of influenza it
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:20.560]  wasn't even front page news it wasn't it was like second page news i mean it
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:24.960]  wasn't like the biggest story in the world like what we do to news right now
[3:37:24.960 --> 3:37:28.160]  but what's interesting about it was the numbers were much different
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:32.960]  one state said in the crux of it which is just the fall of 1918 in the highest
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:36.720]  point the entire state had 7 000 deaths
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:41.280]  Illinois had 22 000 deaths okay they were at an all-time high
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:44.480]  in that and i'm not saying the deaths didn't happen i'm saying the numbers have
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:48.400]  changed so back in 1918 they were saying oh
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:51.520]  hey yeah this was really prevalent in the in the fall
[3:37:51.520 --> 3:37:54.880]  and then it started to disappear by that winter and spring
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:38:00.800]  well we even with 46 cities reporting and counting overseas cases
[3:38:00.800 --> 3:38:03.840]  in the bucklin herald in missouri back in the day
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:07.840]  back in 1918 in november they said uh we had
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:12.880]  you know 82 uh 82 000 um out of all of it
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:16.080]  okay so i think the numbers were much much less
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:19.840]  and what's interesting about this is that if you jump ahead
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:24.960]  13 years let's go to a newspaper in 1940 1941
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:30.640]  um right you know world war two they cited they actually cited back to
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:35.280]  this era to to 1918 flew and they up the number
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:40.240]  ready to 10 million to 10 million people okay worldwide
[3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:43.680]  so i think we were actually around 200 000 deaths
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:47.040]  um here in the united states and that would be a high
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:52.720]  high number um that would be overestimating at 200 000 probably got 150 000
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:39:02.240]  but they said 10 million worldwide then uh if you jump to let's say 1975 in 1975
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:06.400]  ford is president right and he was on a clip saying
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:10.720]  that the number all of a sudden doubled to 20 million people
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:18.800]  that died in the 1918 flu what yeah 20 million wait a minute
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:23.920]  how did it go from pretty low numbers okay each state reporting exact numbers
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:31.360]  to a 10 million estimate in in the 1940s to 1975
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:36.640]  and president ford is also is is on the news with swine flu saying or 76 on the
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:40.000]  news with swine flu saying 20 million people died in
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:43.760]  in in 1918
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:53.440]  deaths in the united this virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:58.240]  that resulted in over half a million deaths in the united states
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:40:02.240]  as well as 20 million deaths oh wait a minute
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:06.800]  okay i'm sorry all of a sudden now we're at half a million deaths in united
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:10.800]  states how did that even happen they had exact numbers back then
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:16.480]  and i'm talking exact so how did they jump to 500 000 deaths
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:24.080]  well mike levitt um under bush um in 2005 wrote for department of health and
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:28.880]  human services he upped the number get this he upped the
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:34.320]  number to 38 million total 38 million people
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:37.680]  wait a minute in 1940 it was 10 million people
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:44.000]  in 1975 it was 20 million people and now it's 38 million do you want to know
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:47.760]  what the reason was this the reason they gave was
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:51.520]  they couldn't count back then um i'm sorry they
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:55.280]  counted just fine yeah they didn't have common core math to screw it all up
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:40:59.600]  and you know they actually counted the deaths and then reported them in the
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:06.480]  individual newspapers yeah so all of a sudden it was 38 million
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:13.360]  that was in 2005 in 2010 they started promoting the number
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:21.040]  50 to 100 million people 50 to 100 million that is a large large number
[3:41:21.040 --> 3:41:25.680]  right huge estimation they still stick with the story they
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:29.120]  didn't know how to count back then and from new data
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:36.720]  new data 100 years old what wait what yeah so it went from probably about in
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:40.080]  the united states about less i would say about 150 000
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:44.560]  would be my estimate after after looking at numerous newspapers okay
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:48.400]  um about 150 000 people we had about 23
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:52.320]  what 103 million people we had about 103 million people at the time we had
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:55.440]  about 200 150 000 deaths let's go with that
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:41:58.480]  because i would say that's pretty close to the estimate then
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:02.240]  it went to 10 million in the 40s it went to 20 million
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:06.960]  in the 70s then it went to 38 million and now we're at 50 to 100 million go
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:10.160]  look go do some research all you will see is that it's
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:13.760]  50 to 100 million and they never say how they got to that number
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:18.640]  they never disclose it they're lying they're lying all the time
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:21.920]  and you know what even back when it was in the newspapers they were saying
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:25.200]  yeah take 0.9 take all these different remedies you'll
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:27.520]  get out of this in a heartbeat it's no problem
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:31.680]  my gosh but we had bad sanitation back then we had we didn't have the things
[3:42:31.680 --> 3:42:35.680]  that we do now as far as uh you know well basic sanitation that's
[3:42:35.680 --> 3:42:40.000]  usually why a lot of people would spread things quickly
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  can you believe the lies when we go back into history we're lied to a lot
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:48.640]  and it's really disconcerting i i don't know i it's it's

[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:03.440]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:09.760]  the criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:13.280]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[3:44:13.280 --> 3:44:16.560]  and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:20.480]  over and over again well guess what it was
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:24.880]  Anthony Fauci and eugenesis globalist that
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:28.960]  ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and other
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:30.800]  chemicals that actually killed more people
[3:44:30.800 --> 3:44:34.880]  than hiv and they were the ones involved in viral research
[3:44:34.880 --> 3:44:38.720]  of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lynx besides the body and create
[3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:42.000]  autoimmune disorders the problem for them was
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:46.800]  the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[3:44:46.800 --> 3:44:50.080]  that's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and the vaccine
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:53.440]  because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:59.280]  basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen

[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:39.600]  and i go i'll be out actually i'll be on right after this so
[3:47:39.600 --> 3:47:43.360]  uh we'll start our show so i'll tell you what there there was a lot of research
[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:46.800]  that i did that was really incredible and i've got the
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:50.560]  screenshots of the articles um where they say all of these things and the
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:55.600]  numbers changed so much that it was it it was just sad
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:47:59.200]  to me to see that and i think one of the other things people don't
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:03.600]  you know quite understand about 1918 or even the swine flu or whatever they
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:08.080]  want to come up with in 1918 that was a product of the
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:11.120]  Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:14.800]  and used the military as guinea pigs in fact
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:19.040]  that started at fort riley in kansas and i think it's kind of
[3:48:19.040 --> 3:48:22.800]  interesting because they were giving kind of this this new vaccine right the
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:26.880]  meningitis vaccine and they had an outbreak there that started it and a
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:29.840]  lot of people don't know that they don't realize that
[3:48:29.840 --> 3:48:33.760]  well i find it kind of strange to be the truth
[3:48:33.760 --> 3:48:38.960]  um and then of course swine flu was at fort dixon new jersey
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:43.680]  that's where that broke out i mean why are they happening it happening at
[3:48:43.680 --> 3:48:47.920]  military bases i don't want to see our good guys i come from a navy family
[3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:51.840]  you know my whole family years back always in the navy and i don't want to
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:56.400]  see anyone used uh used this way and why is it that
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:48:59.680]  they lose all of their constitutional rights and body
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:03.200]  autonomy when they go in the military that just cannot be right
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:06.160]  and uh something's very very wrong with that
[3:49:06.160 --> 3:49:09.680]  and so when they did this when they used them as guinea pigs
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:13.200]  um and then all of a sudden they said oh yeah we've got this we've got this
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:16.960]  outbreak and and and the outbreak came in fact the cdc
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:20.560]  even says today that this started with the u.s military
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:25.680]  they even admit it i think that's kind of
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:29.280]  well they don't mind saying it do they they don't mind telling us
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:32.480]  exactly what's happening and that's the scary part
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:36.640]  i think that's really scary because when we realize and we look back
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:40.720]  um you know when alex jones is bringing all of these topics to the forefront
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:44.560]  has he been wrong has he been wrong about
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:48.880]  any of the things he's broken i mean it usually takes a little bit of time for
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:52.560]  the things to play out because why we're in america we have a constitution
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:49:56.080]  we have a constitution we already fought a bloody revolution over we don't need
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:49:59.200]  that we need to use the constitution to get our country back but has he been
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:05.600]  wrong no and so when i'm looking at at these
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:09.840]  these case scenarios the case scenario with the swine flu what a debacle that
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:14.560]  was they really wanted to get people uh that shot and when people started
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:18.480]  getting a gilling bar syndrome and they started getting really ill they had
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:22.320]  450 cases of that uh they they took it down down off the
[3:50:22.320 --> 3:50:26.880]  market mike wallis actually um who's still bought and paid for but mike wallis
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:31.600]  actually did a a video on this and they actually played it on tv
[3:50:31.600 --> 3:50:34.800]  where he was interviewing the cdc director and said you knew
[3:50:34.800 --> 3:50:38.960]  you knew the problems with this vaccine and of course
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:43.600]  nothing right of course uh the guy just sat there and looked at him
[3:50:43.600 --> 3:50:48.240]  like this
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:52.880]  so that alone i mean i just can't believe people saw that whenever trust the
[3:50:52.880 --> 3:50:57.760]  government again but then we're under this neuroses of
[3:50:57.760 --> 3:51:02.560]  crazy now we love the government we love the media everything they say has the
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:06.480]  golden touch all of a sudden isn't that amazing
[3:51:06.480 --> 3:51:11.600]  that's amazing to me what happened they have lied continuously when were they
[3:51:11.600 --> 3:51:14.720]  not using us as guinea pigs in their little
[3:51:14.720 --> 3:51:18.800]  experimentation that they've been doing another thing that i like to
[3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:24.960]  let people know about is the big big lie of Jacobson versus Massachusetts
[3:51:24.960 --> 3:51:28.080]  now the most that one of the most interesting parts of this is if you
[3:51:28.080 --> 3:51:30.880]  look this up people are going to cite this and they're going to say for the
[3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:34.720]  greater good that's how communist revolutions start by the way
[3:51:34.720 --> 3:51:38.240]  for the greater good you'll do this for everyone else
[3:51:38.240 --> 3:51:41.440]  and you'll sacrifice you know for everyone else well you should be doing
[3:51:41.440 --> 3:51:46.240]  that voluntarily really um but no this is by force right it's
[3:51:46.240 --> 3:51:51.600]  forced for the greater good and so back in the day in 1905 this went to trial
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:56.240]  because back in Massachusetts Jacobson was offered a
[3:51:56.240 --> 3:52:01.840]  a shot or a fine and the fine back then was five bucks well that was an
[3:52:01.840 --> 3:52:05.280]  excessive fine so it went all the way up to the
[3:52:05.280 --> 3:52:08.000]  supreme court he didn't want the want the shot
[3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:11.680]  and he did for smallpox and he did not want
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:17.440]  the uh to have to pay the five dollars well right now today if you look this
[3:52:17.440 --> 3:52:19.280]  up this is what this is what it will say
[3:52:19.280 --> 3:52:22.880]  us supreme court upheld authority of states
[3:52:22.880 --> 3:52:27.280]  to enforce compulsory vaccine they're going to keep using this and using this
[3:52:27.280 --> 3:52:30.080]  and this is why i want to arm you with the truth today
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:34.400]  i actually read that case i'm that much of a nerd i read it
[3:52:34.400 --> 3:52:38.800]  and let me just tell you it was not about compulsory
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:42.560]  vaccination as much as it was about the five bucks
[3:52:42.560 --> 3:52:46.560]  he did not want to be forced to pay five dollars and have to make that choice
[3:52:46.560 --> 3:52:50.000]  so when this went to court to the supreme court it was whether he was
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:53.200]  going to have to pay the five dollars or not
[3:52:53.200 --> 3:52:56.960]  Jacobson back in 1905 was never vaccinated
[3:52:56.960 --> 3:53:03.360]  for smallpox he refused he refused but what do they do now
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:07.200]  they go back and they've even rewritten google can you imagine that
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:11.040]  yeah google government owned google hmm and
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:14.560]  they go back and they change the language to say yes
[3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:18.720]  this is what happened and it meant compulsory vaccine and we did it for the
[3:53:18.720 --> 3:53:22.240]  greater good so that we all didn't come down with smallpox
[3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:26.240]  that's a full-on lie are you kidding me it's a lie
[3:53:26.240 --> 3:53:30.400]  so just so you know when anyone mentions mentions this to you
[3:53:30.400 --> 3:53:33.520]  and i even had an attorney on for a school board
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:38.000]  that had no idea had never even read it he just repeated what he saw on google
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:43.040]  and said oh yeah see we can force vaccines because they did back in 1905
[3:53:43.040 --> 3:53:46.320]  well folks they're rewriting history that's what they're doing
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:50.240]  you need to know that because actually it was about the five dollars
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:56.400]  he was forced to pay and so that's what that was about and i hope that you
[3:53:56.400 --> 3:54:00.720]  share that with other people because we've never lost body autonomy
[3:54:00.720 --> 3:54:03.840]  now the five dollars was wrong and the supreme court
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:09.600]  they made an error in their opinion and i mean that's just point blank right so
[3:54:09.600 --> 3:54:13.920]  they made an error but right now as history is being rewritten
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:18.080]  in 1918 the flu now is 50 to 100 million people
[3:54:18.080 --> 3:54:23.520]  what a lie what a farce it wasn't close to that it wasn't even in the same
[3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:28.960]  ballpark my gosh and then in 1905 they're rewriting
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:33.920]  the vaccine case right the smallpox case in 1905
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:38.320]  they're rewriting history to tell you that well hey back in the day we forced
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:41.040]  vaccines and you all had to deal with it
[3:54:41.040 --> 3:54:46.400]  well it's just simply not true i mean i asked g edward griffin once in an
[3:54:46.400 --> 3:54:49.440]  interview i said how much this was just recently i said how
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:52.320]  much do you think is truthful that comes out of the
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:54:57.040]  government and and he said three percent he
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:01.040]  said 97 percent of everything they tell us
[3:55:01.040 --> 3:55:06.080]  is a big fat lie you know what in order to fix things
[3:55:06.080 --> 3:55:09.840]  we're gonna have to defund the mainstream media because they are the
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:13.440]  protectors of the swamp i know everyone says drain the swamp no
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:17.200]  you know what it's not ever gonna happen it's too swampy in the swamp
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:22.080]  we're gonna have to go after we're gonna have to defund the media
[3:55:22.080 --> 3:55:26.480]  mainstream media not the not the truth tellers and we're gonna have to start
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:30.560]  really researching and reading our own history because ladies and gentlemen
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:34.080]  it has been changed and it's been changed since
[3:55:34.080 --> 3:55:40.320]  about 1908 absolutely just gone and our kids are not
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:43.760]  learning any of this they'll learn when anyone can you know google
[3:55:43.760 --> 3:55:46.720]  flew up and and and discuss that's on google that's been
[3:55:46.720 --> 3:55:51.920]  changed but let me just tell you if we knew our history if we knew
[3:55:51.920 --> 3:55:56.080]  the lies if we knew what exactly we were dealing with in this country over the
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:55:59.840]  last 120 oh about 120 years just even that alone
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:03.440]  okay um we'd be a different country right now
[3:56:03.440 --> 3:56:07.040]  we would be absolutely fighting against this tyranny
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:12.320]  we cannot become complacent in this and as far as the afghanistan thing goes
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:14.640]  you know what we always have to have a boogeyman
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:18.560]  you know uh trump just shredded the north korea boogeyman
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:22.560]  and uh and then of course shredded the isis boogeyman
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:26.800]  they don't have anything you guys they couldn't even drum up russia as the
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:30.960]  boogeyman so is it the taliban now are they
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:34.480]  trying to grow that taliban by leaving equipment for him and and
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:38.400]  leaving all of our stuff there and leaving in chaos this whole chaos
[3:56:38.400 --> 3:56:42.400]  was absolutely planned it was absolutely planned and if we just look back in
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:47.520]  history we're gonna notice that the playbook never changes
[3:56:47.520 --> 3:56:51.840]  and ever since that un came in we've had nothing but chaos in this country
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:56.000]  ever since the cia came in nothing but chaos in this country
[3:56:56.000 --> 3:56:59.840]  who do you think's doing it isn't it obvious by now
[3:56:59.840 --> 3:57:05.200]  it always strikes me that uh that people still have even a shred of belief in
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:10.480]  the in the swampy swamp of dc or um or at this stage in the game
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:13.840]  i'm kind of questioning uh medical people too just because
[3:57:13.840 --> 3:57:17.600]  everyone's everyone's got the string of the dollar right everyone's got a
[3:57:17.600 --> 3:57:21.520]  got a little string that's tugging them in that direction to get that cash
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:24.480]  and that's our biggest problem we got a money machine printing out money and
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:26.560]  we got a lot of people benefiting from it
