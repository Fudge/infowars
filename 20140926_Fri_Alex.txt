[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.520 --> 00:22.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.280 --> 00:35.320]  week slash violent seconds our lives beautiful moments as we stare into the
[00:35.320 --> 00:41.520]  maw of eternity I'm your host Alex Jones we're live it's Friday the 26th
[00:41.520 --> 00:49.280]  the day already of September 2014 and today's news is particularly important
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.000]  and revealing across the board there's a lot of news I'm going to be getting
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.800]  into on the police state on Eric Holder leaving on a bizarre beheading in
[01:02.800 --> 01:10.440]  Oklahoma the latest on Isis Argentina using drones to root out quote wealthy
[01:10.440 --> 01:17.560]  tax evaders we told you drones have been used and will be used find out of your
[01:17.560 --> 01:24.520]  swimming pools green or if you're not paying taxes on all those grapevines and
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.360]  the establishment's answer is to run around saying none of that exist it's a
[01:28.360 --> 01:35.520]  conspiracy theory they treat you like children we don't speaking of police
[01:35.520 --> 01:41.200]  state Pentagon set to deliver millions more in military gear to 12 colleges and
[01:41.200 --> 01:49.240]  public schools MRAPS giant wheeled tanks oh but nothing's going on in the
[01:49.240 --> 01:55.120]  country sound cannons microwave guns underground bases training to suppress
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.440]  political speech kill switches in the internet government announcements
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.720]  taking over smartphones and television and cable radio if you would have made a
[02:05.720 --> 02:09.000]  movie about this 25 years ago and shown it to people that is said man that's a
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.320]  horrible dystopia but see there's two parallels there's still a free society
[02:15.320 --> 02:20.080]  people that exercise the first amendment who aren't intimidated operating and
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.440]  you've got the new parallel system of classical flaming over-the-top oppression
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.680]  the opposite of a free society we know where it leads every time we've got all
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.760]  that going on we've got all that unfolding
[02:36.760 --> 02:44.520]  while there's a huge awakening taking place at the same time so amazing and
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.880]  then a lot of days I come in here and look at seven eight big stacks of news
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.560]  they basically go around the mainstream news alternative government documents
[02:52.560 --> 02:58.040]  the tip box whatever I send in what's on in full wars dot com prison planet dot
[02:58.040 --> 03:04.160]  com drugs report dot com we're old and daily and others and I see a theme
[03:04.160 --> 03:10.720]  emerge every day a lot of different themes but a big one is the CIA just
[03:10.720 --> 03:16.680]  declassified a few weeks ago and we just learned of it yesterday that they were
[03:16.680 --> 03:20.720]  targeting Gary Webb for his dark alliance stories on CIA drug trafficking
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.840]  that they didn't have the LA Times work for them to try to destroy him and of
[03:25.840 --> 03:28.760]  course then he was shot twice in the head by a shotgun and they said that's
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.320]  quite normal they could have me running down the hall and shoot me maybe 10
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.760]  times with a shotgun and have witnesses and they'd say Alex shot himself I mean
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.360]  it's pure bull I will never commit suicide I just want that on record if they
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.600]  find me with a suicide note and three gunshots the head or arms and legs chopped
[03:43.600 --> 03:46.960]  off and gasoline poured on me like family malloc remember in Arkansas
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.000]  Arkansas clinton's medical examiner he would find that people with their arms
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.840]  and legs chopped off in a trash can had committed suicide in plastic bags in a
[04:00.840 --> 04:04.200]  trash can let me explain something you can't chop your arms and legs off and
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.640]  then put yourself in a trash bag put yourself in a trash can unless you're
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.880]  in a Monty Python movie it's really a flesh wound
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.520]  and he's chopped both arms and legs off he's hopping around on nubs I shouldn't
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.520]  even joke about this it's the age of two plus two equals five so why not maybe
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.600]  you can and then that integrates him with this story co until pro revisited
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.520]  Greenwald exposes with the new NSA documents how they target and harass the
[04:35.520 --> 04:39.920]  press believe me I've experienced it but it's kind of mosquitoes biting you with

[04:44.320 --> 04:49.760]  reading my life and then Rob Schneider who I'm a big fan of came out and said
[04:49.760 --> 04:54.240]  we're in a police state warned of vaccines so they ran a CIA FBI opt to
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.520]  getting fired off State Farm and it's all in the documents right here we'll be

[08:20.560 --> 08:26.280]  the resistance it's alex jones
[08:40.720 --> 08:45.440]  we're here it's Friday we're broadcasting worldwide 26 day of
[08:45.440 --> 08:52.000]  September 2014 all right let me tell you what is coming up in the stacks of very
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.840]  heavy news day very important and extremely revealing coming up at the
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.360]  bottom of the hour the CIA has declassified two weeks ago we just
[09:03.360 --> 09:07.920]  learned of it took that long for the media to pick it up managing a
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.520]  nightmare the CIA reveals how it watched over the destruction of Gary Webb
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.800]  working with state-run media like the LA Times to destroy the Pulitzer Prize
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.400]  winner when he exposed CIA drug dealing and by the way I interviewed Gary Webb
[09:22.400 --> 09:26.800]  many times he wanted me to build him a website with all his documents when his
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.280]  new book came out that was gonna prove and validate and vindicate him so they
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.880]  went to his house and shot him twice in the head and called it a suicide but
[09:37.880 --> 09:42.920]  now it's been declassified hundreds of pages of documents how they destroyed
[09:42.920 --> 09:49.480]  him so great job what patriots you are and that integrates him with this story
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.840]  like Kurt Nemo wrote Cohen Telpo revisited Greenwald exposes with new
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.680]  NSA documents the NSA agenda to destroy journalists joint threat research
[09:59.680 --> 10:05.280]  intelligence group engages in everything from trolling to honey traps and if
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.480]  you're a journalist promoting basic bill of rights and Constitution you are to
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.000]  be destroyed now again this is all completely illegal completely un-American
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.800]  just like the warrant was spying just like saying veterans of the main terror
[10:19.800 --> 10:24.920]  threat this is an illegitimate criminal offshore banking cartel that's taken
[10:24.920 --> 10:29.200]  over the nation just like the VG French were collaborators with the Nazis the
[10:29.200 --> 10:32.560]  French just stood down in World War two folks they didn't even fight because
[10:32.560 --> 10:36.280]  90% of their generals almost all of them were already paid off by the Nazis they
[10:36.280 --> 10:39.800]  then got to run the country that's how Hitler weeks after the French invasion
[10:39.800 --> 10:44.280]  to come to France and the police were there the French police controlling the
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.520]  roads for him and giving him security this is what Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan
[10:48.520 --> 10:54.120]  and the Bank of England others have done they run the country we are occupied in
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.960]  their own words Carol Quigley said that in 1965 when he published tragedy and
[10:58.960 --> 11:04.440]  hope or 1966 read the book this is all public they just think you're too stupid
[11:04.440 --> 11:14.800]  to know it it is so frustrating to see this and then that integrates in with
[11:14.800 --> 11:21.120]  Rob Schneider the popular comedian and movie star dropped from state farm ads
[11:21.120 --> 11:28.080]  guess why Schneider had the guts and intelligence to criticize the police
[11:28.080 --> 11:32.440]  state and to say we're turning into a fascist country and to say that vaccines
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.880]  were damaging people so there was an organized online campaign by you know
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.800]  who the insurance companies and banks and Homeland Security Cyber Command to
[11:42.800 --> 11:46.920]  lobby for state farm to drop him so they've now dropped him to send a message
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.400]  you sit down and you shut up as an American you don't have a right to say
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.560]  we're going fascist which we publicly are you don't have a right to say that
[11:56.560 --> 12:03.320]  vaccines need to be investigated you're fired and if America is intimidated by
[12:03.320 --> 12:09.160]  this we will lose everything we will lose everything here's Schneider and CBS
[12:09.160 --> 12:16.960]  News May 2nd of this year Rob Schneider tells Chris Stiegel we are sliding very
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.880]  fast towards fascism well here's an article right here CBS News Pentagon
[12:21.880 --> 12:30.720]  said to deliver scores more m-wraps to colleges and high schools I mean the
[12:30.720 --> 12:37.000]  NSA is warrantlessly spying on us they got drones watching farmers I told you
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.520]  two years ago that my dad got a visit by Homeland Security and they said we want
[12:43.520 --> 12:46.400]  to enroll you we want to give you a card we want to pay you want you to go to
[12:46.400 --> 12:53.960]  meetings monthly we and we want you to basically hum at human intelligence
[12:56.600 --> 13:06.360]  a domestically and a spy on your patients and my dad said my dad said
[13:06.360 --> 13:15.960]  well who am I gonna spy on if I did this like terrorists or something and
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.320]  they said no just everybody we want other political views what they're doing
[13:19.320 --> 13:22.560]  what they're thinking and my dad and came in he said they trying to set me up
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.280]  and I said go around and ask other dentists you know and call around to
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.320]  other lead dentists and oral surgeons and medical doctors and see if they're all
[13:31.320 --> 13:39.080]  getting calls or physical visits and he did it and most of them have been
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.280]  visited including at their homes and most of them were very honored and
[13:43.280 --> 13:46.720]  thought it was patriotic because you know Jack Bauer tortures people on Fox
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.000]  TV to keep us safe and so it's fun to get a little card and go to the meetings
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.080]  like the clergy response team and to sit in the room with the FBI or the CIA and
[13:56.080 --> 14:09.400]  work on continuity of government so how dare Rob Schneider how dare him in his
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.000]  own free time say he's concerned about vaccines and those people whose children
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.040]  were fine and got shots and couldn't talk anymore how dare him be involved as
[14:17.040 --> 14:22.880]  an American and at free speech period how dare him that is so un-American and
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.320]  I'm glad he's lost that contract I hope he's run out of the business and fired
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.560]  maybe even put in prison because that's what a free country is all about and how
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.840]  dare him say that it's fascist that they silence people in America now that say
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.200]  we're turning into a fascist country of course that totally proves we're becoming
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.000]  a fascist country but just how dare him say two plus two equals four or one plus
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.600]  one equals two how dare him and of course I'm being sarcastic it's like the
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.400]  federal judge in the Dinesh D'Souza filmmaker case they played a clip of
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.840]  Fox News in the clip of my show this is in the transcripts of the judge's
[14:58.840 --> 15:06.160]  ruling or D'Souza said I'm being set up and being politically persecuted and
[15:06.160 --> 15:09.760]  the judge said because you did that I'm gonna give you an eight-month sentence
[15:09.760 --> 15:16.000]  locked up one of these little mega prisons but Orwellian style they don't
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.360]  call it a prison so he escaped jail time the headlines were a total bull oh
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.240]  you're not a political prisoner we're just gonna lock you up for eight months
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.400]  and make you go to psychological therapy to cure you directly out of the Soviet
[15:27.400 --> 15:34.200]  Union and five years probation and the judge said we're not political but you
[15:34.200 --> 15:40.600]  went and spoke out so we're going to throw the book at you and don't worry
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.520]  MSNBC has come out and said that Eric Holder was never political that's right
[15:46.520 --> 15:55.760]  and the Jolly Green giant didn't green the Hulk is green folks whenever I said
[15:55.760 --> 16:04.180]  two plus two equals four my son said no I get it the Hulk is green and that's
[16:04.180 --> 16:11.360]  what we're faced with how dare you how dare you say that we should look at
[16:11.360 --> 16:14.760]  vaccines is damaging people look at the studies how dare you say we're becoming
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.760]  fascist so the big vaccine makers and others are gonna get together and use
[16:18.760 --> 16:22.480]  Facebook and Twitter to hammer
[16:22.480 --> 16:34.680]  his sponsor and to get him kicked off the air well the answer to this is
[16:34.680 --> 16:40.000]  anyone who has state farm to do it to not be lazy to call state farm and say
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.240]  listen I'm not gonna argue with you I just want you know in an email and a
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.760]  call I'm going to switch my insurance now I'm not gonna be lazy and I'm going
[16:47.760 --> 16:53.120]  to go off state farm because state farm is allowing people to be punished for
[16:53.120 --> 16:58.160]  their clearly legitimate and tasteful political speech saying America's
[16:58.160 --> 17:09.480]  becoming a fascist system and America needs to look at vaccines there is a
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.080]  mystery illness all over the United States and even NBC News admits it's
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.360]  linked to vaccinated kids I mean should I be thrown off the air for saying that
[17:17.360 --> 17:25.040]  so later in the broadcast bottom of the arm and get into this in detail Gary Webb
[17:25.040 --> 17:31.760]  confirmed targeted by a mockingbird operation that's government run media to
[17:31.760 --> 17:38.640]  be destroyed before they killed him to stop his book coming out and I was
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.960]  talking to freeway Ricky Ross I was talking to Gary Webb four or five months
[17:43.960 --> 17:49.160]  before he died and Gary said I want to come on your show when this happens I
[17:49.160 --> 17:54.200]  want you to he sent me a desk it was just of news articles and clippings and
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.600]  things and nothing secret you know I want you to build a dark alliance website
[17:58.600 --> 18:03.320]  for me I want you to put these documents up I said sure I'll help you well don't
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.160]  do it till till I'm ready my book proves it all and more how the big banks run it
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.200]  all he was on the government was listening they heard the call how he
[18:13.200 --> 18:19.040]  discovered that the whole thing is run not just cocaine we know that from
[18:19.040 --> 18:22.480]  Sybil Edmonds and other NSA whistleblowers the white slavery everything
[18:22.480 --> 18:28.640]  and they shot him twice in the head and here it all is the LA Times is being
[18:28.640 --> 18:32.200]  interviewed with the reporters saying I'm sorry I work with the CIA to discredit
[18:32.200 --> 18:41.840]  him I feel bad about it now oh you feel bad about it now you feel bad but it's
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.160]  like oh the CIA is here oh yes sir let me discredit someone because you said

[24:07.480 --> 24:16.120]  into some articles I'm going to read in part coming up in the next segment and
[24:16.120 --> 24:21.280]  detail exactly how they operate in the culture of total dishonor but what blew
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.520]  my dad away was is that the homeland security person that came to visit him
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.000]  and my dad called and person was quote with Homeland Security was so
[24:30.000 --> 24:38.600]  unprofessional and so ridiculous kind of like a Barney Fife meets Hitler in that
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.680]  he didn't even know that David Jones was Alex Jones his father and see my dad
[24:43.680 --> 24:46.160]  thought it was some setup or something to get him to go to Homeland Security
[24:46.160 --> 24:50.880]  meetings that they knew who he was and I said no they're gonna make the dog
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.000]  catcher a CIA agent because it gives all these weak-minded people incredible
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.520]  confidence to commit all sorts of un-American activities to just give
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.960]  them their little infrared card and they got a lot of well-meaning people
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.160]  involved 12 13 years ago after 9-11 for the terror threat of al-Qaeda but we
[25:13.160 --> 25:15.960]  were pointing out who really ran al-Qaeda and allowed them to attack bare
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.880]  minimum but once they got the pump primed we were sent the celibacy's we
[25:21.880 --> 25:28.760]  published them eight nine years ago a farming communities and it was later in
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.520]  the Associated Press where they would get them to a local hotel all the old
[25:32.520 --> 25:35.840]  farmers and ranchers and they'd show them al-Qaeda training videos for the
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.120]  first 10 minutes while they had donuts and coffee then they'd shift to is your
[25:40.120 --> 25:45.360]  neighbor growing marijuana do they spank their kids are they green did they
[25:45.360 --> 25:48.960]  build a barn they weren't supposed to and all these old-timers would go what
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.280]  in the world is some kind of commie meeting so they get you come on in

[26:06.040 --> 26:12.080]  grassroots I just got chills because here's Reuters today US Homeland
[26:12.080 --> 26:18.040]  Security moves to tackle climate change and to begin criminal prosecution of
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.520]  people that drop a battery in your yard that don't recycle remember the Audi
[26:23.520 --> 26:26.920]  green police ads five years ago at the Super Bowl show people being arrested
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.440]  for their hot tub being too hot and then I said that's real in areas of Europe
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.280]  they've already banned toasters and and and barbecue pits and space heaters and
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.160]  they're already arresting people who have too big a hot tub or have the wrong
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.680]  light bulbs and then the mayor came out with the head of the PR firm where they
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.540]  made the Audi commercial the green police Audi commercial in the
[26:48.540 --> 26:53.080]  San Francisco Chronicle and said this is what we're going to do we're putting

[36:06.720 --> 36:15.280]  Schneider struck an ominous tone he said democracies don't end well we are
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.920]  sliding towards fascism it's an ugly kind of thing the kind of mob mentality
[36:19.920 --> 36:24.400]  that we have to be careful of he said well you know where that came from
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.400]  Plato and the Republic written 2,400 years ago it's so funny this article is

[36:43.560 --> 36:50.040]  daily graphic tyranny naturally arises out of democracy played out we've got a
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.360]  bunch of Nazi flags marching because it was democracy that brought them to power
[36:54.360 --> 37:03.200]  Rob Schneider said two plus two equals four he said what is reasoned
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.800]  intellectual and intelligent but let me tell you what's intelligent now what's
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.600]  intellectual supporting total fascism calling yourself liberal wearing socks
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.240]  that don't match and having a beard and walking around in a feminine way with
[37:17.240 --> 37:23.800]  your hands out at your side going break up families guns are bad men are bad I
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.760]  love black uniforms I love the choppers I love the checkpoints I love the torture
[37:27.760 --> 37:32.600]  I love Obama I love it I love it I mean that you people are sick you're not
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.400]  Nazis in black uniforms that'll actually do the killing yourselves even though
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.360]  they were evil you just sit back and live in some fantasy delusional world
[37:40.360 --> 37:47.960]  get rid of Rob Schneider get him fired he in amongst the campaigns to get him
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.680]  to lose his sponsorship it was the fact that he said America's becoming fascist
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.480]  they convict themselves by their very words even he disagreed with what
[37:58.480 --> 38:02.920]  Schneider was saying you shouldn't boycott him unless he's calling for
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.560]  taking someone's liberty when Rosie O'Donnell called for banning the Second
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.600]  Amendment I called and launched the boycott that others picked up on of
[38:12.600 --> 38:17.320]  Kmart and she lost her sponsorship and shut her mouth about taking my rights I
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.320]  was not trying to stop her free speech I was showing her there be held to pay
[38:21.320 --> 38:27.640]  then Rosie O'Donnell became a listener and when she spoke out for 9-11 need to
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.080]  be investigated I respected that when they tried to boycott her I fought
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.240]  against the boycott so you have to gauge these it's not that a boycotts good or
[38:36.240 --> 38:42.040]  always bad it's that if someone's trying to take your private property take your
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.480]  children take your guns take your right to religion or not to be religious if
[38:46.480 --> 38:52.160]  someone's trying to shut people down for their speech or their rights then you
[38:52.160 --> 39:00.160]  boycott them I have both boycotted Rosie and I have both supported Rosie when
[39:00.160 --> 39:04.160]  she wanted to take my guns and your guns I viciously went up against her and
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.040]  defeated her with your help one of the first big successful things we did back
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.240]  in like 1999 2000 and then when they were trying to boycott her for saying hey I
[39:15.240 --> 39:18.560]  live in New York and I heard them say they blew up building 7 and it needs to
[39:18.560 --> 39:25.000]  be investigated and the reason I know Rosie O'Donnell is a listener is I'll
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.600]  just leave it at that she is a listener she did watch my films on 9-11 and was
[39:31.600 --> 39:35.320]  still angry at me that I had boycotted her on the gun issue but since she had
[39:35.320 --> 39:44.640]  respect for me on the September 11th issue so we could agree to disagree but
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.080]  I don't mean to go back and tell a story I've never told before it's just that
[39:49.080 --> 39:52.280]  that's how I try to gauge things and didn't mean I always have the answers
[39:52.280 --> 39:58.080]  but Rob Schneider has come out and said we're turning into fascism the
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.200]  democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner and that
[40:03.200 --> 40:06.600]  there's clearly something happening with these vaccines we need to investigate
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.960]  them and so there was an organized campaign to run him off the air to try
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.200]  to intimidate everybody else so the big corporations and government can do
[40:16.200 --> 40:29.540]  whatever they want whenever they want the answer is just like I said with the
[40:29.540 --> 40:33.520]  NFL and their ratings have been consistently down because the whole
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.680]  Second Amendment community is sick of it when they got rid of Hank Williams
[40:36.680 --> 40:44.800]  Jr. who was very popular because of his free speech the answer is boycott the
[40:44.800 --> 40:50.360]  NFL when they promote gun control the victim disarmament boycott them when
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.600]  they promote Obamacare boycott them and people are boycotting them you try to
[40:56.600 --> 41:02.320]  take our rights we boycott you we cost you money and they've got their dirty
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.040]  trick campaigns behind the scenes against me but that's to shut me down so I
[41:06.040 --> 41:11.920]  can't promote liberty you see the difference Rob Schneider dropped from
[41:11.920 --> 41:17.040]  state farm ads guess why state farm insurance will no longer run the
[41:17.040 --> 41:20.240]  television advertisement starring Rob Schneider because the actors anti
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.200]  vaccination views the move comes after a social media campaign called for
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.200]  Schneider to be dropped as a spokesman Phil Supple the insurance company's
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.520]  director of public affairs told PR week that Schneider's ad has unintentionally
[41:33.520 --> 41:36.840]  been used as a platform discussion unrelated to products and services we
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.760]  provide he said with that we are working to remove the ad from the rotation of
[41:40.760 --> 41:46.680]  this time well it's all right to drop state farm and if you got state farm
[41:46.680 --> 41:49.240]  folks it's time to go get a local insurance company probably get a better
[41:49.240 --> 41:55.080]  deal anyways drop them nothing to get state farm but we got to defend Schneider
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.800]  because his speech is so American his speech is so on target it's the best
[42:00.800 --> 42:07.840]  it's it's it's the great example of someone trying to help people tyranny
[42:07.840 --> 42:13.120]  naturally arises out of democracy if you have a pure democracy 51% can vote to
[42:13.120 --> 42:19.960]  enslave the other 49 or an elite can propagandize 51% especially when
[42:19.960 --> 42:25.000]  they're on welfare and in some counties upwards of 80% of Americans in fact I
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.360]  have a National Geographic issue came out a few months ago about food deserts
[42:28.360 --> 42:33.360]  and it's and I was looking at county by county graphs in the U.S. on a big fold
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.400]  out map just last night I was thinking about well I live in a country where in
[42:39.400 --> 42:46.120]  some areas 80% of the people are on food stamps and the national average is one
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.160]  third because there's like 50 million on one type and another 50 something
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.920]  million on another but it's over a hundred million
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.240]  yeah there it is food National Geographic why people are malnourished
[42:59.240 --> 43:03.080]  the richest country on earth and if you flip through it it'll show the
[43:03.080 --> 43:08.080]  graphic there it is wow amazing good job guys they found like in five seconds
[43:08.080 --> 43:13.280]  without me telling them to and if you look at the graph down below it it shows
[43:13.280 --> 43:19.360]  the areas that are in red or in brown dark brown that's upwards of 80% on food
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.240]  stamps and you notice it's the border areas the South New York LA places like
[43:25.240 --> 43:34.280]  that scroll down and actually show the what's that called the area that tells
[43:34.280 --> 43:42.360]  you what the statistics are the fact box I don't know scroll down some more
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.960]  they may not have it in the in the in the online issue a little bit different
[43:47.960 --> 43:57.360]  but how do you conquer America you get half the population on welfare and it's
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.680]  came over and even a Mitt Romney had his own problems he got in trouble when he
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.360]  made the truthful statement of two plus two equals four when he said 47 plus
[44:06.360 --> 44:10.800]  percent who were on welfare at that time it's now over half in just a few years
[44:10.800 --> 44:19.560]  now 51% last time I saw now that they've done that now that they've been able to
[44:19.560 --> 44:27.480]  to bring that into fruition and get over 50% it's pretty much game over unless we
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.440]  the producers have an Atlas shrug and stop complying it's now reaching that
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.440]  point where we don't have anything else to do because our money our energy our
[44:36.440 --> 44:43.680]  labor will be used to enslave us and whether it's Goldman Sachs or whether
[44:43.680 --> 44:50.480]  it's Wells Fargo tax exempt or Google or General Electric or the hundred
[44:50.480 --> 44:58.160]  million people on welfare plus and the government workers we have nothing to
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.040]  defend ourselves from them they will always just vote for more they will
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.440]  always demand more they will always hate whoever's produced anything the ultra
[45:07.440 --> 45:12.160]  rich teamed up with a giant masses of people that are third fourth fifth
[45:12.160 --> 45:17.800]  generation welfare who have no idea the three branches of government no idea and
[45:17.800 --> 45:24.440]  then you got corporations teamed up to lobby and organize against a comedian
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.920]  that dares say we're becoming a totalitarian state we're becoming a
[45:28.920 --> 45:35.480]  fascist state democracy's never in good because the majority can vote itself to
[45:35.480 --> 45:44.160]  make the minority slaves and that's now where we are as a country and as a
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.120]  republic so all this other news is just window dressing until we realize just how
[45:49.120 --> 45:52.040]  dire the straights are
[45:52.040 --> 46:01.160]  now we've talked about campaigns to destroy Rob Schneider and I am calling
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.960]  for a national boycott until they reinstate him to can play at that game
[46:06.960 --> 46:10.840]  what's good for the goose is good for the gander this is a two-way street that
[46:10.840 --> 46:17.800]  gun kicks as hard as it shoots see all you people that know about tyranny and
[46:17.800 --> 46:20.480]  know about evil and know about the knowledge of good and evil and know how
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.200]  to manipulate and know how to do bad things do you understand that it always
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.120]  comes back on you many fold and that whatever you do to people that's
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.040]  wicked ends up coming back on you and your children and so you think you're
[46:33.040 --> 46:37.280]  getting away with all of this stuff because you don't follow God's rules you
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.200]  don't follow the rules written on your heart that you don't follow your
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.200]  conscience you don't follow your basic innate human programming you give in to
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.840]  what's easier you think you're winning doing this no you're not and people like
[46:51.840 --> 46:57.440]  Rob Schneider are heroes people like Rob Schneider who isn't stupid he's not
[46:57.440 --> 47:01.840]  a coward ladies and gentlemen he's willing to put it all on the line to warn
[47:01.840 --> 47:08.280]  people because if he doesn't warn people he's not alive anymore I'll guarantee you
[47:08.280 --> 47:11.200]  he's not bummed out losing this contract we're trying to get him on the show I
[47:11.200 --> 47:15.680]  guarantee you that he is happy with what he's done and happy with being
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.200]  censored I've been fired I've been attacked I've been physically gone after
[47:19.200 --> 47:25.160]  I've been demonized I've been lied about my family has and you know what it
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.720]  makes me work harder it makes me commit that much more just like Wolfgang
[47:29.720 --> 47:32.800]  Halberg yesterday said when they came to his house and threatened him and his
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.640]  family repeatedly to stop investigating Sandy Hook being a false flag he said
[47:38.640 --> 47:41.840]  I'm never gonna stop I must spend all the money I got to fight these people
[47:41.840 --> 47:45.920]  they shouldn't have come to my house they shouldn't have threatened me and it's
[47:45.920 --> 47:48.680]  not that people like Halberg are looking for a fight but there becomes a point
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.120]  where you know it's evil you know it's wrong you're cornered and you know what
[47:53.120 --> 47:59.560]  you're gonna start swinging and that's what's happening in this country and
[47:59.560 --> 48:02.560]  they know who's gonna start swinging when the real tyranny comes the veterans
[48:02.560 --> 48:07.480]  retired police officers patriots conservatives libertarians and real
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.200]  Christians not state-run churches they know you're not gonna take the chip they
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.160]  know you're not gonna let them teach your kid Heather has two mommies they
[48:16.160 --> 48:23.200]  know you're gonna bitter cling and so they're coming for us the only thing
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.320]  holding them back is the fact that they know that we really are of all the
[48:27.320 --> 48:31.080]  minorities the largest minority liberty lovers and growing and a lot of their
[48:31.080 --> 48:36.640]  own people are whistle-blowing and on the inside as bad as the system is people
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.440]  on the inside have already had a chance to see that it's just as bad as I'm
[48:39.440 --> 48:41.640]  saying
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.120]  they know what time of this and that's why in the federal government in the
[48:48.120 --> 48:53.160]  military and in the police ranks local or federal are the most awake group they
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.440]  know they're being blackmailed and set up they know they're being surveilled they
[48:56.440 --> 49:01.000]  know they got into something corrupt they're freaked out and let me tell you
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.240]  what keeps the system asleep at night is they know people in the ATF leaked fast
[49:05.240 --> 49:10.560]  and furious who didn't want to lose their soul they know people on the FBI are
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.480]  leaking information of people in the Pentagon so they picked somebody like
[49:15.480 --> 49:22.160]  Chelsea Manning who they think will discredit the whole movement look at
[49:22.160 --> 49:28.760]  this article now the first look.org this is confirmed managing a nightmare the
[49:28.760 --> 49:35.520]  CIA reveals how it watched over the destruction of Gary Webb I knew Gary
[49:35.520 --> 49:42.640]  Webb he wanted me to work for him basically months before he died he called
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.160]  me he said I want you to publish these documents that are already public but
[49:47.160 --> 49:51.400]  prove what's gonna be in my book so they're online well they let him
[49:51.400 --> 49:54.320]  publish his second book proving everything they blew his head off shot him
[49:54.320 --> 50:03.000]  twice in the head now that said the CIA has declassified right as the new movie
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  gets ready to come out with Jeremy Renner being scrolled through that
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.360]  article for folks and they admit and hear the LA Times and others worked to
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.920]  destroy Gary Webb knowing what he said was the truth in his dark Alliance
[50:20.920 --> 50:26.360]  series that won the Pulitzer Prize and the CIA and others threatened the San
[50:26.360 --> 50:30.320]  Jose Mercury news till they even came out and repudiated Webb when nothing he
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.040]  said had been disproven I've interviewed Freely Ricky Ross and others who were
[50:35.040 --> 50:39.320]  there during the trials when Webb was covering it when they would death threat
[50:39.320 --> 50:45.360]  Webb in the hall they broke in his house the week before they killed it when
[50:45.360 --> 50:49.640]  you see the movie they'll have him commit suicide but they even see now the
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.080]  CIA wants you to know yeah we target journalist does this sound like an

[54:27.720 --> 54:33.160]  Telpo revisited Greenwald exposes NSA agenda destroy journalist and you look
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.600]  at how they're trying to destroy Rob Schneider for saying we're becoming a
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.880]  fascist state you look at how they're trying to destroy the journalist and
[54:43.880 --> 54:47.440]  did like Gary Webb and the CIA's declassified that because they want you
[54:47.440 --> 54:51.760]  to know they're very proud of their work then you have Curt Nemo's article
[54:51.760 --> 54:55.680]  where Glenn Greenwald has the new NSA documents and has a story showing on
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.800]  NSA and government agents work to manipulate deceive and destroy that's
[54:59.800 --> 55:05.720]  close quote to deceive and destroy the reputations of journalists over the
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.320]  last several weeks I worked with NBC News to publish a series of articles about
[55:09.320 --> 55:15.960]  dirty trick tactics used by GH HQ's unit in England and then he goes into how
[55:15.960 --> 55:21.240]  it's also happening in the US and then when I read this list of things in
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.280]  addition to cyber and denial of service attacks the strategies include online
[55:25.280 --> 55:31.880]  covert action like false flags this happens constantly where people send
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.040]  handwritten letters or emails or fake faxes to police departments in my name
[55:36.040 --> 55:41.080]  saying horrible things or calling people spoofing different office phone
[55:41.080 --> 55:47.600]  numbers just as dirty tricks and I guess happens so much I know they have a
[55:47.600 --> 55:50.560]  designation in the police computers around here just to basically ignore it
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.200]  but this is the type of stuff the government's doing in addition to
[55:56.200 --> 56:02.440]  internet-based operations GH HQ operations credential harvest a technique
[56:02.440 --> 56:08.360]  used by CIA under mockingbird program and also engages in close access technical
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.040]  operations which includes spying on telephone calls surveilling hotel
[56:12.040 --> 56:17.520]  computers following people harassing them injecting all sorts of false material
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.120]  into the internet or to destroy the reputation of its target other ones
[56:23.120 --> 56:28.840]  include sexual honey traps changing of photos network sites yeah they'll call
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.480]  your wife up and tell them you're cheating on over and over again till they
[56:32.480 --> 56:39.640]  believe it author and researcher Brian Glick noted war at home covert
[56:39.640 --> 56:43.640]  action is us act activists and what we can do about it I'm gonna get him on the
[56:43.640 --> 56:49.920]  show but this is what they did to Gary Webb who was never discredited they just
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.560]  said he's discredited just like dr. Andrew Wakefield a bunch of studies it
[56:55.560 --> 56:57.880]  turned out to be done before him showing the same thing by the British
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.480]  government and studies have come out after the vaccines are attacking the
[57:01.480 --> 57:07.160]  intestinal flora of children it was all verified they just said he'd been
[57:07.160 --> 57:12.120]  discredited when he hadn't oh Alex was discredited with Piers Morgan yeah that's
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.880]  why he lost his job over it oh my gosh you know Ted Cruz has been discredited
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.120]  criticizing Obamacare that's why his poll numbers went up massively they just

[57:37.720 --> 57:41.480]  clan members at his events or Democratic operatives you name it and I said
[57:41.480 --> 57:49.200]  don't you get it you're so discredited only endorsing him would hurt him but
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.080]  you just can't understand you're out of bullets when they attack you in the wrong
[57:54.080 --> 57:59.640]  it empowers you now smarter people in the government know that but I mean I
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.280]  want to say the government you're like a mad beast now like Nixon said out of

[01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.360]  just targeting and savaging reporters and people who expose real corruption and
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.240]  that ties into a new Glenn Greenwald NSA documents coming out about targeting
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.480]  and harassment of the press with even the AP sending letters a few weeks ago
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.000]  and the different association of journalists saying stop the police

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.360]  international bestseller number one on the new york times bestseller list but
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.280]  for was it twelve weeks or longer running and he's gone live all over the
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:08.120]  world rhodesia that's now no longer rhodesia zimbabwe he's got a project

[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.440]  original libertarian slash anarchy capitalist and had a lot of fun i've
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.600]  spoken at standsbury this year i spoke at casey research last saturday to a
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.360]  capacity hall at the hyatt and san antonio and i wanted to just get he's an
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.360]  icon of your ron paul or if you're von mis or your lou rockwell for the
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.520]  intellectuals of the liberty movement everybody knows who he is for a lot of
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.080]  new listeners ron stations all over the country you're like who's dug casey
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.760]  well he's heads up casey research and there's so many websites to give out
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.320]  will ask him which one's probably best but he was asking you know what do i
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.360]  want to cover and i asked him i said well what do you want to cover and he
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.080]  said the need to diversify internationally diversifying your assets as
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.880]  well as the first time your person why you should be living abroad unless
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.960]  you're the captain going on the ship like me and the economy and how the
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.760]  government is clamping down our financial freedoms yeah they just had a
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.800]  big university study last week or two weeks ago that were 36 worldwide for
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.480]  business and freedom that's behind every industrialized nation and a whole
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.680]  group of third world countries the penalization of energy and russia and
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.440]  putin and how he has been working for 10 years to corner the energy market put
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.040]  his true motivation behind the ukraine and what he thinks putin zen game is
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.520]  so we're joined by Doug Casey Doug you got a long bio but for folks that don't
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  know who you are spend if even though you're not an arrogant person spend a
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.280]  few minutes telling folks about Doug Casey and then where do you want to
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.560]  start first well alex pleasure to be here thank you
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:55.160]  to introduce myself I I guess my first book came on the scene in 1978 it was
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.720]  called the international man how to make the most of your personal freedom and
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.440]  financial opportunity around the world and that book sold very well
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.520]  internationally but it was a largest-selling book in the history of
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.800]  Rhodesia which is a record which is never going to be beaten
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:17.720]  Rhodesia doesn't exist anymore at the time there were 250,000 Europeans or
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.560]  people of European background and descent living in Rhodesia now they're
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:28.200]  probably about 2000 maybe anyway my second book was crisis investing and
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.760]  that was number one on the New York Times list for 18 weeks was on the list for
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.120]  39 weeks and it came out in 1979 they talked about your profits and
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.880]  opportunities in the coming great depression and we almost had that
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.320]  depression back in the early 80s when you'll recall interest rates even on
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:54.440]  government paper with 50 and 60% so I've been doing this and I've been to
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:04.200]  145 countries I've lived in 10 and that's kind of the story in a nutshell so
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.080]  you're not just talking the talk you're walking the walk and I want to talk
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.800]  to you about the currency controls the capital controls what you warned about
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.160]  back in 1979 in someplace like Rhodesia where they you know have a million percent
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.200]  inflation and total hell hole now from a garden of Eden basically according to
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.200]  folks out of that have lived there compared to what it is now we can see
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.240]  the writing on the wall for America because you've seen this syndrome play
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.440]  out in country after country well what's happening is that the US
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:42.360]  government since the since the greater depression actually started in 2008 I
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:50.160]  have created trillions of new currency units trillions of new US dollars and
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.080]  right now they're basically sitting in the big banks and insurance companies
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:01.720]  where they went to bail them out as they were failing back in 2007 2008 but
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.840]  at some point they're going to come out into the economy in force right now the
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.760]  stock market and the bond markets are at all-time highs because of those newly
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:20.360]  created dollars and people think that's a good thing but it's going to come down
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.400]  to a retail level where the things that you need to live on start exploding up
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.640]  with in price and that's going to become a real problem Alex because when the
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.880]  currency loses value you're disincentivized to save and saving is how
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.400]  you become wealthy and of course you could say this is why the US of the
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:53.460]  whole is becoming a poor and the middle class is being wiped out again once they
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:58.360]  also start accelerating spending that only throws fuel on the fire what is
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.320]  your gut kind of go back to your speech at Casey research this last weekend this
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.080]  last Saturday where does your gut tell you this country's going we know it's
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.040]  going to collapse that's what all the armored vehicles and martial law
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.720]  preparations are for but I see this as a global meltdown that's coming when do
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.560]  you think it's coming will it come slowly or quickly well I think we're on
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.000]  the edge of the precipice right now and I say that with fear and trepidation
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:30.640]  because all of most of the 300 billion people in this country want to produce
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.320]  more than they consume and set aside difference they understand intuitively
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:41.800]  that that's how you keep the wolf of the door but that's sad I think we're in
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.800]  very very big trouble at this point actually when we go back historically I
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:56.240]  say that the United States peaked back in the mid 50s that's when we were in
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:02.400]  relative terms of much much more powerful than all the rest of the world
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:09.760]  put together the value of our stock and bond market were three or four times the
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.440]  rest of the world put together we produce 90% of the world's car 90% of
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.520]  the world's airplanes all of this has changed we've come a long way from
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:28.880]  producing a 1959 channel and convertible to making a little of the kind of boxes
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.400]  that's all people can afford to drive it was all swindled away it has been it's
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:41.320]  all we have is receipts for the financing of the warfare state and the
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:47.560]  welfare state two things that are antithetical to the idea of America in
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.040]  fact Alex I don't even say I live in America anymore because America was a
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:18:01.280]  fantastic idea a unique idea a wonderful idea but it's vanished and now we just
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.800]  live in the United States which is really just another of 200 other
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.400]  nation states that cover the face of the globe like a skin counter at this point
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.640]  and there's really not much difference between the US and other countries that
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.440]  just say in fact we're less free than a lot of other countries and all the
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.960]  university studies show that we're a police state and it's getting worse
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.200]  fast the establishment obviously thinks that they're going to convert into a
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.080]  pure tyranny as if that's some desirable destination well that's right
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.520]  that's why I recommend that people will diversify themselves internationally
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.360]  and diversify politically because your biggest danger today as big as the
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.360]  economic and financial dangers are and they're huge your biggest danger is a
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:58.880]  political danger what the state can do point due to you so it's important that
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.800]  you diversify so that all your assets aren't under the control of your own
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:10.800]  government and you yourself physically have a crib that you can go to if this
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:20.080]  place turns into 1933 in Germany or 1917 in Russia or 1973 in Vietnam or
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:25.320]  1959 in Cuba this happens all over the world in all countries across the
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.920]  And we know the Cloward and Piven socialists are on record saying yeah we
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.200]  engineered it and when it comes down we're going to sell total socialism
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.480]  as the answer can you imagine the hellhole America will be done well
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:44.440]  actually the average American at this point no longer believes in capitalism
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:50.720]  and free markets and free speech really believes in bread and
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.040]  that's right don't stay there I want to come back to you and ask how you were
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.720]  such a visionary what woke you up so early we're talking to the trailblazer

[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.320]  government is running around like fire ants that have been disturbed gearing up
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.040]  for what it looks like of the apocalypse or something there they are setting up
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.680]  the new currency and capital controls they tripled the price to renounce your
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:12.240]  US citizenship how did you way back in 1978 with the international man in vision
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.920]  all of this I mean what what what woke up Doug Casey well at some point I
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.300]  figured out that the best survival strategy for a human being is not to
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:30.640]  act like a plant and I'm afraid that most people especially most Americans
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.960]  because we've lived in a charmed lie we've lived a charmed life we've like
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:41.000]  we've won the cosmic lottery being born in the United States during the 20th
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:49.280]  century but things change and as a survival strategy you want to be air
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.160]  mobile you want to be able to go anywhere and do anything to take
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.560]  advantage of opportunities whatever they may be but most people have kind of a
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:06.160]  medieval peasant mindset where they were afraid of anything that's over the
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  next valley because perhaps the media told them that there might be dragons
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:18.960]  so they should be afraid so I've always had an expansive outward looking
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:25.440]  approach to making the world my oyster it's a psychological attitude the first
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.840]  and foremost Alex you've lived in 10 countries and I want to spend some more
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.440]  time on that coming up and you've got a project I know going on in South America
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.640]  right now that I want to see some time but looking specifically your prognosis
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:46.920]  as a forecaster economically why you say we're on the precipice well it's
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:54.240]  because in the real world actions have consequences as a fact and from being a
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.840]  free market society when this country started and being a beacon for the rest
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.240]  of the world for free minds and free markets over time we've become in
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:15.280]  prospect with this barnacle and stations of regulatory agencies that stop
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:23.000]  things from happening and impose huge cost on anything that does happen so
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.480]  that at this point we're now an extremely highly regulated extremely highly
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:36.480]  taxed society that's about to suffer from catastrophic inflation which is going
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:45.320]  to wipe out people's savings so a collapse I'm sad to say is inevitable
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:52.160]  now life will go on I've been in countries when they've collapsed and the
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.680]  real wealth or a lot of it still exists it just changes ownership but it's very
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.960]  unpleasant and inconvenient and dangerous for the people that are there
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:10.040]  while it's happening and now we see Homeland Security announcing that
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.000]  they're going to be tackling climate criminals and that they're going to be
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.160]  watching the Tea Party why do you think the Homeland Security's made a
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.800]  libertarian movement or anarchy capitalist the number one enemy well that
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.560]  is interesting because you know Republicans say they believe in the
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.680]  free market but that's a lie they just don't believe in social freedom and
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.480]  Democrats say they believe in social freedom but that's a lie but they
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.240]  definitely don't believe in economic freedom so why does one of these people
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.360]  hate the libertarians who believe in both economic and social freedom well I
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.800]  guess it's because we really don't believe that the government serves very
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:02.720]  much of a useful purpose unlike the Republicans and the Democrats so I think
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.280]  that's why they really hate the libertarians but you mentioned climate
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:13.040]  change before I'm a I've been an amateur geologist for most of my life when I
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.680]  was a kid first thing I wanted to be was a paleontologist dinosaurs and that
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.360]  led me to being a one could be a geologist about that I want to get

[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.200]  30 bucks it's got $2 a product in it if we got something that say $40 it's got
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:22.840]  $20 a product in it something's $130 like DNA force one ingredients $40 of it in
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:26.760]  each bottle that's one of ingredient of a whole bunch that's the kind of stuff

[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.280]  sell out by tomorrow and that's being conservative maybe even tonight but we do
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:02.080]  get more in a few weeks DNA force and your purchase it's a big bottle jam packed
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.000]  with a whole bunch of the caplets funds this operation the very tip of the

[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:22.640]  going what you personally are doing down yeah in South America I want to get
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.680]  into how the government is clamping down the financial freedoms I want to get
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.160]  into the Putinization of energy and in your view of Putin and what's happening
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.880]  Doug Casey you've got the floor okay thanks Alex well some years ago some
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:47.320]  friends and I decided that you would be wise to diversify outside of the US so
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:54.840]  that you have a backup system as a plan B so we went to Northwest Argentina and
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:02.160]  we we bought a lot of land as a matter of fact we bought about 200,000 acres of
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:10.800]  land down there but on a small portion of that outside of a town of 10,000
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:16.080]  people in the middle of a grape growing region where we're surrounded by thousands
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.800]  and thousands of acres of vineyards this is a little town of 10,000 people and we
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:28.640]  built what we think is the best resort in the world on that land we have our
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:33.600]  own grapes we have an 18-hole golf course I'm not old enough to play golf but I
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.120]  know a lot of people like I like to play it unfortunately I'm getting too old to
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.760]  play polo which I played for years and that may sound strange to some of your
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.880]  listeners I'm recommending polo but Winston Churchill said that a polo
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.600]  handicap is better than any passport and he's absolutely right polo is the most
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:41:00.320]  fun you can have with your clothes on quite frankly and it's something that if
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:05.160]  you're in a position to teach your children or your grandchildren how to
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.920]  play that game you're doing a gigantic favor anyway we have a polo field down
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:15.000]  there and offer polo lessons we have not just because it's fun because it's an
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.800]  elite game and that's how you can really get into some interesting circles that's
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.880]  exactly correct but it's not a pooster game either it's we call it horse hockey
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.960]  and it's really playing hockey which is a tough game except you're doing it on
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:37.880]  horseback which makes it even tougher so it's a very martial arts type of a
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:44.320]  game when it originated in Afghanistan except there they play it with dead
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.720]  goats still we were with people's heads that's right we use tick and ball it's
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:56.880]  it's a lower cost than I think but anyway that's one of the things we do
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.360]  down there's something that people can learn to do we have a world-class
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.400]  gymnasium and every bell and whistle and toy that you can want it
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.400]  interestingly although most countries in the world this will surprise a lot of
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.840]  people to hear this although it both companies the world are now more
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.200]  expensive than the u.s. to get the same thing as you get here in the u.s. will
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.480]  cost you twice as much in Europe but Argentina is one of the cheapest
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:32.000]  countries in the world and the cost of living down there is probably about a
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.440]  third of what it is in the united folks about the resort they want to look it up
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:44.320]  well it's called the they should go to a lot as la est
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:52.520]  stands for la estancia dot com so la est la est dot com we'll put that on
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:57.440]  screen and yeah and it'll explain what we're doing down there it's a place
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:04.160]  with a fantastic climate year-round the government totally leads you alone it's
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:14.000]  very unregulated very free and very well with very interesting successful
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.720]  entrepreneurs I mean people are people don't come down there because their
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.360]  cost of living is a third of what it is in the u.s. they come down there for the
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.000]  company and the culture and and the weather so I'd like to investigate it
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.640]  by people to take a look so that's one thing that I'm doing and I spent half of
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:41.520]  the year down there at this point I'm following my owner boy I speak of your
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:47.320]  biggest risk today is a political risk so you have to diversify financially and
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:54.280]  personally to avoid that political risk that the u.s. government is for those
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.480]  that don't know they are really trying to make it hard to get out of the country
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.680]  the borders are wide open but it's very hard to get your money or anything else
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.800]  out of the country even after tax money they're acting like no that belongs to
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:11.280]  them well that's absolutely correct it used to be that there was no limits no
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.240]  reporting taking any amount of money out of the u.s. that you wanted to if you had
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:22.280]  a foreign bank account you didn't even have to report it give the old days but
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:28.120]  now most foreign banks and brokers won't even take your money if you're an
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:35.240]  American citizen because it's too risky and too costly for them so in effect
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:42.920]  Americans are now trapped like lobsters here in the u.s. so and it's getting
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:50.160]  tougher every day so you've got to act now while the door is still open and I'm
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.480]  urging people to do that because when things fall apart here in the u.s. the
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.160]  people who are going to be able to put it back together are the ones that have
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:06.200]  preserved capital from outside the u.s. and they'll be able to come back in to
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.280]  the u.s. that's right because the the big mega rich that are anti-free market they
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:14.480]  admit they can't wait till the collapse happens because they're gonna tell
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.240]  socialism is the answer and further wreck things under Cloward and Piven I
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.280]  mean there's got to be some way to try to stop them do you think there's any way
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:30.800]  to stop them Doug the prognosis is not good I suggest that charity begins at
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.840]  home and the most important thing for every individual in this country is take
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.400]  care of yourself exactly because you can't take care of other people if you
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.960]  haven't first taken care of yourself and the problem is that so many people that
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:52.480]  believe in free market and libertarianism don't have the money and they're not
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:59.360]  putting the theory into practice and people that believe in capitalism and
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:06.040]  freedom well we should all be wealthy because wealth gives you power and we're
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:11.360]  gonna need power to get rid of the bad guys so I want to see everybody become
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.360]  wealthy I'd like to see people do intelligent things with their money in
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.600]  this very dangerous financial environment we're in so that they can
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.360]  weather the storm and come out the other side not just keeping what they have but
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:34.120]  hopefully with more than they went into it and I know over at KC research calm
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.000]  that's some of the advice you give what are some of the basic strategies for
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.480]  folks out there that you would recommend well let's keep it simple and from an
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:50.800]  investment point of view at this point the stock market is manically overpriced
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:56.480]  it could go higher because with the trillions of new dollars that continue
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.440]  to be created a lot of it's gonna go into the stock market stock market could
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:07.800]  go higher but it's risky I very risky I don't recommend it the bond market is a
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.360]  triple threat to your capital today interest rates are at all-time lows
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:20.320]  bonds are at all-time highs if you own an agent sell them tomorrow morning that's
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.960]  not good real estate well at least it's real wealth but real estate taxes are
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.560]  going up because it's time to tax the to eat the rich to tax the wealthy and that
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.120]  means people that own real estate plus the problem with real estate is that it
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.680]  floats on a seed of borrowed money and when interest rates inevitably go up
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.720]  that's not going to be good for real estate so what are we left with I rule
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.360]  about stocks bonds and real estate so what can you do hold cash you're getting
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.480]  zero interest rate but inflation in real terms is running someplace between five
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:05.360]  and eight percent per year even now I suggest that people build a significant
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:13.440]  position in physical gold and silver why because they've historically always been
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.680]  money and they're the only financial assets but I'm simultaneously somebody
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:23.160]  else's liability you can have it as real wealth in your hand it's
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:28.560]  international currency and there were articles out just last week every month
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.720]  sure just last week I think was the London Guardian the telegraph that it was
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:39.200]  a 247% increase in elites buying gold bars in just the last six months while
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.640]  the very same elites tell the public don't in the good don't get into gold
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:50.400]  and silver you're absolutely right because in an unstable situation like we
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:57.640]  are right now you don't want to be holding paper especially the unsecured
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:04.600]  liabilities of the US government which is itself bankrupt at this point so it
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:10.000]  boils down to buying gold and silver the physical metals in your own possession
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.440]  going beyond that you should diversify your assets internationally so it's not
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:22.360]  all in one political bailiwick here in the US the third thing the third tool
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.480]  of tripod if you would is that they're going to create other bubbles they've
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.440]  created a gigantic bond bubble we're in now we're in a stock market bubble the
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:38.520]  real estate bubble broke back in 2008 they're building another one but the
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:46.560]  key is this is that they're going to be creating other bubbles like that and it's
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.880]  possible to take advantage of these bubbles exactly invest in the bubble
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:57.360]  early exactly correct so there are situations aren't there some are only
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:03.000]  available for sophisticated investors like for instance I would short
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.480]  Japanese bonds denominated yen because the baddest things are here in the US
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:14.320]  they're actually going to be worse in Japan so that's a possibility an easier
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:21.560]  thing is mining stocks the mining is a terrible business I can explain why it's
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:27.040]  a terrible business but mining stocks are very very depressed right now and
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:33.640]  essentially when you go over explodes upward in price price out of both fear
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:39.520]  and greed there's going to be a panic into these mining stocks which have teeny
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.560]  weedy market cap all the mining stocks in the world are only worth about a
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.800]  quarter of what Apple alone is worth it's unbelievable
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.880]  unbelievable stay there absolutely undervalued no doubt about that plus
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.480]  things have to be retooled from time to time and they've just been government's
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.000]  been suppressing mining so it's got to make a comeback we'll be right back this

[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.480]  these stories up at info wars.com Ukraine government officially introduces
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:37.080]  slavery with vague terms and that's the same government that of course was
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.880]  financed by the West but does that mean Putin's an angel no it just means there's
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.160]  a clash between different power blocks also see I admits destroying Gary Webb's
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.880]  career with the country's largest newspapers this is so important I'm
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:58.440]  gonna cover that in the next hour FBI critics tech giants Apple and Google for

[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.560]  announcing it that's all up on info wars.com and prison planet.com a lot of
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.760]  news in the next hour some very important special reports and your phone
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:19.840]  calls I'll open the phones up at the bottom of the next hour I'll let Mr.
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.680]  Casey with me five minutes to the next hour Casey research.com I want to shift
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.840]  gears now because we're almost out of time with a short segment the next what
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.200]  are you getting at when you call it the Putinization of energy and you say that
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.160]  it's a long-term strategy by Putin what's your view of Putin and global
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:47.840]  power blocks? Well I'm not a supporter of any politicians anywhere they're all
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:53.600]  out for themselves and it's entirely possible that Putin is actually the
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:56:02.320]  richest man in the world at this point with having taken control
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:10.800]  indirectly of Russian energy companies he may be worth $80 billion now all that
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:18.000]  being said Putin is not a stupid man and he is a thoughtful man and the main
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.400]  thing that Russia has going for it today well there are other things it's
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:30.720]  got a corporate income tax that maxes out of 13 percent a personal income tax
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:37.160]  that maxes out at 10 percent in some ways shocking to say Russia has become
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:45.080]  freer than the United States has but all that said energy is the big play in
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:51.800]  Russia today and there's good reason to believe that they're going to become
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:58.120]  relatively stronger for that reason energy the whole world runs on energy the
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:05.520]  whole world runs on oil and the Russians produce a lot of it so and
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.680]  internally Russia is much more stable than any of these countries in the
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.600]  Middle East what's happening today in the totally artificial countries of Syria
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.320]  and Iraq and those things were created out of whole cloth in the boardroom of
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:32.120]  Europe as was Jordan that matter as was Israel but Saudi Arabia itself is a
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:38.360]  gigantic accident waiting to happen and I expect something on the order of the
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:46.000]  Islamic State to overthrow that corrupt Islamic bureaucracy I mean half of the

[01:57:53.200 --> 01:58:00.400]  unhappy so the person's a gigantic time bomb so Russia is in an excellent
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:07.320]  position to capitalize on the problem Middle East and so now the West is
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.280]  trying to checkmate basically stealing their gas lines which makes the West

[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:23.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:30.640]  final segment of Doug Casey of Casey research Casey research.com we were
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:36.520]  getting into the Putinization of energy what he thinks Putin strategy is and he
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.080]  ended up saying you have to look at things going on in the world like a
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:44.800]  Martian would and I agree politically being an atheist not what you want to
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.520]  believe but what's really going on so what is the strategy arming al-Qaeda
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:52.120]  calling an ISIS to destabilize the Middle East well that actually helps Russia in
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:57.720]  a way but I guess over throwing Syria they think won't to cut off their port
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.080]  to the Mediterranean overthrow Ukraine move NATO up to their borders try to
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.000]  get grab their gas pipelines and give it to Joe Biden's son which they've done
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.600]  Doug Casey you were saying we have to look at this like a Martian well yes as
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:15.520]  far as the thing in the Ukraine is concerned the Ukraine again is an
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:22.480]  artificial country it's borders have been liquid for hundreds of years so it
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:26.680]  makes all the sense in the world that these two provinces Donetsk and Lugansk
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:34.080]  it should become independent countries to create a borderland between Russia and
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:39.280]  the NATO powers and I've got to say also that that NATO was something that
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:45.440]  should have been disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart at this point
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:52.680]  NATO was nothing but a provocation to to the rest of the world and it's really
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.600]  nothing but a giant bureaucracy that's going around looking for a fight so well
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:04.720]  if I look at the Ukraine situation being as objective as I can and speaking as
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:11.640]  an American I've got to say I come down on Putin's side of this thing because as
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.680]  a Martian looking at it this this area they've gone into as the Russian
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:19.040]  infrastructure they've been there for hundreds of years George Soros admits
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:22.520]  they overthrew Ukraine unelected government came in and attacked I mean
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:28.720]  you'd have to be a fascist to not side with the Russians right exactly and I've
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.000]  got to point out that the Russians aren't communists anymore they're more
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.160]  communists in American universities than there are in Russia at this point a lot
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:43.300]  of these these people kind of learned their lesson after 70 years of the
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:47.520]  Soviet Union they don't want any more of that nonsense well the communists are
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.120]  here in the US it's perverse yeah sitting around all the free market wealth
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.800]  they've pissed away lecturing anyone that I tell you why do socialists want to
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:00.080]  destroy wealth they have no idea like Locust they destroy every country they
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.880]  run well it's a psychological aberration from an
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:10.160]  intellectual point of view there's no argument that makes any sense to the
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.720]  defense of folk socialism it's a psychological problem not an
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:20.640]  intellectual problem that's that's what we're dealing with that socialists
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:28.080]  suffer from suffer from a spiritual disease that I would call envy and envy
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:34.920]  says I have what you want but it's not good enough that I get it I want to take
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:41.200]  it away from you so you can't have it either it's it's a it's a horrible ugly
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.440]  cycle well you know they've got studies in England and Canada showing that
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.240]  socialists are six times more likely to steal and lie they're really just pirate
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:54.120]  criminals that hate everybody don't want to do anything yeah it's amazing that
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:59.720]  people use the word socialism and they treat it like a legitimate political
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:07.280]  system it's it's really just uh as a legalization of a fat and barbarism
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.880]  it's amazing to me yeah it's a gang of nobodies getting together to go rob other
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:14.960]  people so Michael Savage calls it a mental illness and that's what it is
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.960]  yeah it is that's a bunch of nothing nobody who are incapable of producing
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:26.200]  anything on their own and like to use the state as a method to steal things
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:31.960]  legally and and the average person out there just rolls over like a whip dog
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:37.000]  and wet himself and accept this I know you're only in the US another few weeks

[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:30.520]  resistance it's Alex Jones
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:35.240]  Eric Holder has announced his resignation as the US Attorney General today
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:40.240]  it's a position that he's held for the last six years so in honor of this big
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:46.080]  announcement we bring you the accomplishments of the holder DOJ now a
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:50.240]  lot of people have accused holder of being the most highly politicized
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:56.000]  attorney general he came into the game with an agenda every day some kind of
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.720]  anti-violence anti-gun message every day every school at every level one thing
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:05.600]  that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.640]  have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.720]  a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of the
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:18.160]  week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.000]  different way so of course it's no surprise that Holder was later tied to
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.120]  the Oklahoma City bombings an event that prompted several federal legislative
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:32.240]  gun control provisions even though there was never a single gun involved a
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.920]  similar allegation stands out in the fast and furious scandal which was a
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:42.920]  covert DOJ mission labeled a criminal false flag by Ron Paul with the full
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:47.040]  knowledge of the Department of Justice ATF agents facilitated the sale of
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:51.360]  thousands of illegal guns to Mexican drug cartels and then dropped all
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:55.560]  surveillance of those weapons once they crossed the border those weapons showed
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:00.240]  up at multiple crime scenes in Mexico and at the murder scene of US Border
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:06.360]  Patrol agent Brian Terry when were you first told or became knowledgeable about
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:12.080]  US officials allowing firearms to be sold to the drug cartels in Mexico I
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:17.640]  don't know then was anyone in the White House first informed about the tactics
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:22.680]  that were used under operation fast and furious again mr. Chairman I don't know
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:29.600]  I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.360]  that I don't know I just don't know I don't know whether or not I just yeah
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.640]  I don't yeah I don't know when the subpoena was issued well I don't know
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.320]  precisely I don't know I don't know I don't know the specific questions now
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.600]  again I don't know what happened this is the guy caught perjuring himself in
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:50.120]  the memo CBS released last week show that they said they were going to blame
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.560]  the guns in Mexico on the second amendment is that not a form of false
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:11:00.400]  flag against our most basic of rights sir and what would you do if president to
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.120]  people like Eric Holder we should be immediately fired and then there should
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.760]  be an investigation and find out if charges should be made and that's
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:14.320]  obviously over the top and all these kind of sting operations and false flag
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.240]  this is this is criminal I don't know whether charges will be made but the
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.880]  he deserves that charges but you know up against him in 2012 the House of
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:28.640]  Representatives voted to hold Holder in contempt after he refused to turn over
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.840]  documents related to the botched gun-running scandal and as recently as
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.680]  yesterday Holder has been accused of purposely stonewalling all efforts by
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.200]  members of Congress to look into fast and furious now Department of Justice
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:48.000]  senior officials have on many occasions barred or delayed inspector generals
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.840]  from gaining access to documents that were crucial to their investigations
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.600]  including the AP wiretapping scandal now the Department of Justice illegally
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.720]  seized phone records of reporters and editors of the Associated Press including
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.880]  their home phones and cell phones and also those of Fox News reporter James
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:26.240]  Rosen so did Holder lie under oath again it was revealed that he personally
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:31.240]  signed off on the 44 page warrant that gave the department access to Rosen's
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:36.280]  email account when it was revealed last year that the IRS purposely targeted
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:41.080]  conservative groups who are applying for tax breaks IRS director Lois Lerner
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:46.200]  twice pled the fifth she conveniently suffered a hard drive crash a Justice
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.560]  Department official in charge of election crimes refused to testify about his role
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.680]  in the IRS scandal and then oops the emails of five other staff members
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:01.720]  involved in the investigation were also lost and it has since been revealed that
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.400]  the IRS began destroying evidence as soon as the investigation into the
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.720]  targeting began House oversight committee chairman Darrell Issa subpoenaed
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:15.280]  Eric Holder accusing the Department of Justice once again of stonewalling
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.400]  investigations by failing to produce relevant material and the lead
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:24.360]  investigator who's been appointed to look into the IRS's political targeting
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:30.000]  of Obama's enemies happens to be a partisan Democrat who has donated more
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:36.320]  than six thousand dollars to president Obama and Democrat causes now Ted Cruz
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.400]  is calling for Holder's impeachment after the attorney general has rejected the
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.840]  call for an independent prosecutor to probe the IRS's targeting of
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:49.760]  conservative groups and that's not the only time that the attorney general has
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:54.880]  refused to enforce the law in order to protect this administration when rampant
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.360]  fraud and corruption was exposed at veterans affairs attorney general Eric
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.280]  Holder announced the Department of Justice had no plans to investigate and
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:08.960]  Holder protected another key player in the fast and furious scandal the
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:14.760]  international banks banks which Holder has time and again refused to prosecute
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.720]  if you do prosecute if you do bring a criminal charge it will have a negative
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.680]  impact on the national economy perhaps even the world economy and I think that
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.600]  is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.200]  Eric Holder these are your accomplishments you've managed to slow
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:38.320]  walk all of the big scandals affecting this administration saving the
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:44.120]  responsibility for a future DOJ appointee to investigate under a future
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:49.640]  administration now unfortunately you didn't manage to grab the guns but
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:54.800]  you did manage to further degrade trust in the office of the attorney general
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.760]  and for that we salute you well either you know or you don't know I don't know
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.200]  I don't know I don't know all right that's the type of information we put out
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:08.560]  every night seven o'clock central infowars nightly news every week night
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.680]  of course I'll be back with this Sunday show with Paul Watson four to six PM
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:20.520]  Central this Sunday now Lee ends just reading the headlines there and they
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.760]  giving her own analysis she did a great job but it's not alleged that they shipped
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.920]  the guns in a Mexico to blame the Second Amendment CBS News got the actual
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:35.520]  memos and there is definitely a stonewalling that's going on and the
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:40.920]  good news is is that two different federal courts have ruled that Holder
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:47.360]  has to release the documents concerning Fast and Furious but Darren McBrain
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:51.640]  put a report out they had to be two years ago and all this was really big news
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:55.880]  we ought to dig that report up and air it again where it showed them talking
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.920]  about Fast and Furious Gunwalker a year before it even broke saying we have a
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.480]  gun tracking program we're doing this track guns and later they said we never
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:08.560]  knew about it wasn't happening when you have the attorney general and big sis
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:14.320]  the head of Homeland Security on a stage saying so none of this is alleged
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  even though there's mainstream media keeps saying it's alleged it's alleged
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:23.920]  it's not alleged the Sun came up this morning so you can go into the CBS
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:27.160]  reports on that of course the reporter that ended up putting all that out got
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:33.120]  driven out of CBS News so that's what's happening here is a war on journalist
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:37.320]  and I want to finish up with this go to break get some other news and take your
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:44.000]  phone calls but I spent a lot of time on this in the first hour that there's the
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.040]  headline they found at CBS News documents ATF is Fast and Furious to make
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:52.000]  the case for gun regulation see and that was the reason they were doing it they
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.680]  told filled agents look just let us do it it's for a greater good and you heard
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.920]  Holder earlier the Congress say well we can't prosecute big banks that have
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.520]  stolen hundreds of billions dollars and engaged all this crime and money
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:08.760]  laundered and drug deal because that would discredit the whole system and
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:16.360]  there is the institutional Machiavellian argument of we're really good guys but
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.760]  if we expose our governments running al-qaeda and bare minimum allowed 911
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.400]  to happen that'll bring down the system I saw a national post article in Canada
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:30.000]  it's what Canada's national paper a few years ago they were interviewing a
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.440]  professor about 911 being an inside job and they said well even if it is we
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:38.560]  don't want to go there because we want to run the government and this will
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:43.320]  discredit the government so it's like a ring of Mordor they're all fighting over
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.560]  and they all want it they're like no no no don't throw it in the lava I want to
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:57.560]  use it it cannot be used for good and so remember that next time they pull
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.340]  somebody over and they have no criminal record and the cop claims they think the
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:07.720]  guns illegal in the vehicle the state laws are written both ways and they take
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:11.600]  some old man to jail who's cooler not a criminal remember they're throwing the
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:17.600]  book at citizens remember the sheriff at Liberty County Florida they pulled over
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:24.240]  a construction company owner it was carrying cash and the state law was
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:27.520]  written well you could have a handgun loaded legally of your carrying cash or
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.920]  going to a from work or whatever but it could also be seen as illegal so we're
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:35.640]  gonna choose to throw you in jail the sheriff shows up goes in the guy's no
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:40.240]  criminal record he owns a company he was carrying cash this law is written but
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:45.680]  two-sided let him go and then they indicted the sheriff who we've had on as
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:52.240]  a guest see that's when you know the government's evil folks is that the
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:59.880]  state with a Republican leader came after that conservative sheriff because
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:06.160]  he said I'm not gonna fill our jails up with legal gun owners they're like well
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:14.000]  the way it's written though we could still maybe jailing see it just makes me
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.120]  want to throw up physically want to throw up but now the CIA is declassified
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.640]  that they indeed targeted and smeared through the LA Times and others Gary
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:27.600]  Webb because he was quote endangering the whole agency exposing their
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.640]  narcotics trafficking operation that stories up on info wars.com that
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.240]  integrates them with Kurt Nemo's article dealing with Glenn Greenwald new NSA

[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:09.840]  policy public members of Congress are urging them to do this according to US
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:15.400]  representative Doug Lamborn of Colorado during a Liberty Group forum Wednesday
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.880]  night in the basement of Colorado Springs bar Lamburn a member of the

[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.200]  leadership from the White House well there's there's leadership in the White
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.960]  House destroy the country and the Congressman got into the fact that

[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.520]  talking to the generals behind the scenes and say hey if you disagree with the
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.080]  policy that the White House has given you let's have a resignation it's not
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:59.760]  just that I believe this article I already have talked to generals and I've
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:03.400]  talked to kernels some of them on the air who have been at these meetings where
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:07.240]  this is being said where they're all saying what do we do we think it's a
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:13.040]  bad idea to give ISIS weapons we were with Rand Paul senator Paul and they're
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:17.720]  told we'll go ahead and resign then and then you could tell people why he
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:22.480]  resigned you know let's have a public resignation the Congressman said and
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.800]  state your protest and going to blaze a glory Lamburn added and I haven't seen

[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.200]  talking about that right now pretty interesting article from last night in
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:42.520]  full wars.com. Continuing another article here that dovetails with Leigh Ann's
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.120]  excellent report earlier, Mikkel failing the crimes of Eric Holder, Holder
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:53.600]  resigns it for years of lawlessness, fast and furious, we break that down too big
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:59.800]  to jail, megabanks, attack on whistleblowers in the press and his report

[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:56.440]  to your phone calls but I do have some more news I want to hit on the second
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:01.800]  amendment front Reuters is reporting a tragedy four children stabbed to death
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:06.920]  in southern China latest in series of knife attacks that have unnerved the
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:13.100]  country well I'm sure if they just banned knives that'll stop it it's the
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:19.680]  knife's fault the knife's making them do it Japan has had a spat of that more
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:22.160]  than a spat what's a work what's something if it's a spat that happens
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:27.320]  over and over again remember some story in Japan years ago where I got killed
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:31.120]  like 10 kids and wounded like 30 or something with a butcher knife well
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:34.560]  England's answer to that is since their crime rates exploded after they took
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.640]  guns muggings and stabbings is like up like 10 fold you look the numbers up
[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:43.320]  yourself it is to try to ban knives yes as if criminals can't get knives can't
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:48.400]  go make a knife baseball bats I mean just just ban everything make the public
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:51.880]  totally domesticated so the criminals can feed on them a man stabbed four
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:57.400]  primary school children to death to death he's not demonically possessed or
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:02.240]  anything it's the fault of the knife today in the southern Chinese region of
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:08.680]  Guanzai is that right state media said the latest in a series of knife attacks
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:12.440]  that have unnerved the country and a separate incident six people were killed
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.360]  in a stampede the primary school the capital of the southwestern province of
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.880]  Yunnan state news agency reported it did not give the tales now it's obviously
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:30.360]  got to be America's fault so let's just blame John Wayne he did it and that's
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.600]  the way it is so there you have it guns are banned for the citizens but they
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:40.880]  have just massive state tyranny dozens of mobile execution vans per city public
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:46.280]  executions mass stabbings lootings burnings killings I mean China is just a
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:57.640]  time bomb I saw some number like 7,000 riots a year but logic here why does it
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.480]  bloom or go over there and start a group to ban the knives it's the knife's fault
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:08.560]  where is a Mike Martinez when you need a make Mike Martinez the dictator of
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:15.040]  China and then he can he imagined being like like this is nationwide worldwide
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.480]  but imagine having a mayor protein that says on TV once we register I want to
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:25.600]  confiscate your guns when the fat pig has police bodyguards and I bet money on
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:35.600]  guns yeah how China stays stable despite 500 protests every day think the
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:42.840]  Chinese people like their mobile execution vans and their suicide nets so
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:48.120]  there's that little tidbit DC which have a clip of this DC city council members
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:53.360]  to cry having to follow Constitution it's been almost six years since DC
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:37:01.360]  Heller the Supreme Court case five and a half years and neither DC nor Chicago
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:04.880]  have allowed the concealed carry that you got to jump through all these hoops
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:15.480]  for so now the DC council member but let's scroll down and see him David
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.200]  Grosso who looks like another trendy know-it-all parasite up there with all
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:23.080]  these delusional idiots that could even fight their way have a paper bag or run
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:26.960]  a shoe shine shop I mean I'm telling you they're out of where suits and sit up
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:33.120]  there at the Dias and I don't believe we did they're gonna make us to let them
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.640]  have guns it's terrible yeah it's terrible you got one of the highest crime
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:39.760]  rates in the country and that all the government people have bodyguards and
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:43.600]  waivers and have guns but everybody else has to be fed on you have the one of
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.480]  the most corrupt police forces in history on record that goes around in
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:53.200]  record trucks stealing people's legal cars and running chop shops I mean DC is
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:59.840]  a joke let's go ahead and go to this dirtbags quote huge change of course
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:04.200]  for a city known for its strict gun laws about an hour ago the DC city council
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.240]  voted to allow licensed gun owners to apply for a concealed carry permit
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:12.960]  news force mark seagraves live outside the Wilson building now with more on the
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:17.920]  implications of this vote today mark that's right Jim and the reason we're
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:21.960]  here today is because a federal judge weeks ago struck down the district's
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:25.760]  ban on carry permits saying it was unconstitutional and then today we
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.520]  learned that us attorney's office is no longer prosecuting handgun carry
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:34.760]  violations until this is all resolved so the council knew they had to do
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:40.960]  something this is not what they wanted to do the DC council reluctantly voted to
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.680]  allow for residents and non-residents to apply for concealed carry permits this
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:51.920]  this is always a difficult situation for the district of Columbia we are put
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.440]  here we know we'd like to have much stricter no carry rules at all and
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.280]  preferably no guns at all but the courts are ruling against us on this on a
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:05.880]  regular basis and if they're not then the Congress is coming down on us while
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:10.000]  the council unanimously approved allowing for carry permits one issue facing
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.480]  lawmakers that wasn't resolved today is the question whether the names of those
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:19.520]  who are issued a concealed carry permit should be made public on that issue the
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:23.200]  council members are divided we should at least give our neighbors and the
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:27.040]  residents how many hours a day he spends on his hair let people you know be proud
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:30.120]  of it if they want to carry a concealed weapon but at least we'll all know who
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:34.160]  it is and we can treat them differently because they have a deadly threat in
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.720]  their possession I'm uneasy about that it runs the risk that we're providing a
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:44.280]  means for somebody to find out who has a gun that then yeah they were eyes are
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:49.000]  a rob who cares about the confidentiality of a gun owner we don't
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.160]  want it while the issue of gun owners we don't want it's up in the air one thing
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:58.080]  is clear gun rights advocates still aren't satisfied saying the new law is
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:02.200]  still too restrictive that's right we don't live in a country where rights are
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:06.760]  enjoyed only at the place's pleasure the court instructed the city to treat the
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:11.600]  carrying of handguns for self-defense as a right the city should comply with not
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:15.800]  resist the court's decision wrote howling girl a lawyer for the plaintiffs
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:21.760]  that's enough news for it by the way they got the former mayor of DC I guess
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.880]  it's still in the council it showed him creeping along behind the back I mean
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:32.960]  what a group of nerdy wills what a group of just pathetic people she's in there
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:36.600]  with armed guards protecting her and police security at her house the city
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.880]  councilwoman it's on record they've all got security in DC at taxpayer expense
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:49.040]  and going who cares about privacy of gun owners I don't like it just this is just
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:54.920]  the belligerence because this is what Bloomberg does they and what Cuomo does
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:00.240]  another sack of horse manure I'm sorry that's what he is they go and they get
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.320]  the names of concealed carry people and they publish it like you're a sex
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:08.400]  offender and then people's houses do get robbed when you do that hey we're gonna
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:14.000]  put it in the newspaper and online who's got guns as a pure form of
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:21.680]  harassment you shouldn't have to get a concealed carry you shouldn't have to
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  get anything criminals should be able to carry guns up until 1968 criminals could
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:30.200]  go buy a gun the day they got out of prison and this country had a lot lower
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:34.200]  crime rate when it came to shootings and things like that because a criminal is
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:38.080]  gonna have a gun anyways do any law will only be used on law abiding
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:42.520]  citizens and that's been proven and their goal these political mafias is to
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:48.240]  disarm their slaves the bitter clingers it is a fundamental of a statist
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:53.240]  authoritarian system to disarm the people as mouse the tongue said the
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:57.280]  greatest mass murder in history political power goes out of the barrel of a
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:03.640]  gun and when you see the belligerence and the arrogance of most of those city
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:10.280]  council members and the little fuddy duddy with his hair all greased back and
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:15.320]  into himself with his trendy you know I'm not against beards it's just that
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:18.920]  it's the guys that like like have them and then they're always the same and they
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:22.240]  just think they're wonderful and it's like they all have the holy grail these
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.080]  guys little manicured beard and everything and you know he watches the
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.160]  hangover every night and he's sitting there talking about how horrible it is
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:35.560]  with his nilly eyes like a deer in the headlight wanting to prey on people
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:40.680]  wanting his slaves to be disarmed while he has bodyguards cops in that room
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.760]  that are armed is just the height of pathetic hypocrisy and I can't handle it

[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:50.600]  handle it anymore Ross in the Czech Republic Ross good to have you on today
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:56.600]  Alex good to hear from you I've thank you first of all for the awakening you've
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:00.760]  given me or even part of my awakening in the last year but I've kind of woken up
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:05.680]  to a lot of this stuff well we're all in this together brother so thank you the
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:09.640]  item I wanted to dress with you with the financial markets and I think what you
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.480]  were saying yesterday and I listened to the podcast is absolutely right I
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:19.080]  believe the term you use the New World Order I have my own pet term for it
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:24.120]  which I call parasite guild or the cabal no I agree it's it's the parasite
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:28.040]  college of control freak world for those that couldn't actually do for
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.000]  themselves who wish to conquer the planet in all of their great grandeur go
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.120]  ahead well they're out in force I think they came out of force with last May of
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:42.400]  June first was Lloyd Blankenfein with Goldman Sachs he goes on the the pet
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:48.200]  network which is CNBC and really psychopathic snake type stuff and then
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:53.800]  he's followed up by a greens band a fault they followed up with the bank of
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:56.840]  international settlements which essentially the Rothschild banks have
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:01.520]  been threatened really issuing thinly veiled threats and it and then in last
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:05.920]  week you had the G20 so it's not like they're not warning people that they're
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.920]  going to pull a plug and I think it's part of it a psychopathic gloating that
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:14.040]  they like to engage in and then there's a good term that you've given me a
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.880]  predictive programming I think that's part of it revelation of the method
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:22.520]  externalization of the hierarchy and then they can also tell you later see I
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:28.720]  told you it was coming exactly but but covering and being part of the problem
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:34.120]  reaction solution so I I really sought to see this watching financial news I
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.520]  used to be on Wall Street spent a half-life on Wall Street and I have to
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:43.280]  tell you that the the whole money management business has been badly
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:46.920]  compromised it seems like they're bright everybody's bribed and controlled and I
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.280]  used to be in that business and when I was in that business we had such a thing
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:56.080]  called fiduciary responsibility and I didn't take orders from anybody when I
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:01.080]  was it when I was a money manager and now I tell but I hear is this total
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:06.280]  control they've stolen out Millie's money and I worry for Aunt Millie the
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.120]  people that have their money placed with Wall Street with these money man
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:15.440]  managers and I don't think the outcome is gonna be good it feels also that this
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.960]  is concurrent with a lot of these false flags that you've been talking about so
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:22.600]  the whole predictive programming the gloating the butt covering and this
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:28.040]  show they've put on it seems like it's almost kind of concurrent with false
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:33.280]  false flag warnings as well it's definitely the season of crises
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.280]  they've already turned Alcatelus are already attacking Russia they're
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:42.560]  already just poking the Chinese who are the Chinese are governments terrible but
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:50.040]  I mean still they're poking them it's just a lot of bravada hutzpah driven just
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:56.240]  wild man behavior going on by the establishment and so I just hope that
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:48:01.040]  cooler heads can prevail somehow and that some good things can happen and we
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:04.520]  can kind of get this corruption under control but I don't know my friend great
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.240]  points thank you so much Russ from the Czech Republic Jesse in Oregon you're
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:14.560]  on the air welcome hey Alex great to be on with you today thanks for calling yeah
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:18.400]  yeah I was wanting to bring up something that's really important for us here in
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:25.200]  Oregon coming up this election and myself being a chef's only organic
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:32.320]  restaurant in the Dallas Oregon we're coming up on a measure 92 voting to label
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:37.840]  GMO here in Oregon and I hadn't heard you talk about that yet so I just wanted
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:40.640]  to put out to your audience well I know that they clearly rigged the election in
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:45.240]  California I mean why can't you have GMO labeled I don't know I mean you think
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.280]  if they're proud of it they'd want the label yeah I mean this corn bugs don't
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:54.320]  eat it because it's got biologically grown pharmacological crop testicide and
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.720]  you know there's nothing like liver failure why not advertise it yeah yeah
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.440]  you know if you're making a great product be proud of it that's what I do you
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:05.520]  know I make a great product well that sounds a little bit terrorist you know
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:12.040]  actually want to know what's in your food how dare you you know have all you
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:15.000]  know everybody kind of you know we got tons of money from out of state big
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.080]  corporations and mega corporations pumping in money into the state to say
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:26.560]  no on 92 and we're we want yes on 92 we want our stuff labeled and well how dare
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.440]  you want to know if something's GMO I think that's terrible and I think it's
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:35.440]  good that they you know we're firing people off TV like Rob a Schneider who
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:38.680]  speaks out and says America's becoming fascist of course we're fascist and
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:44.880]  you're fired and you're fired to caller get out of here Jesse how dare you how
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:49.480]  dare you you were show I mentioned Kim Jong-un I'm gonna go to break and I'm
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:57.120]  back with more of your calls this story illustrates a lot that Kim Jong-un is
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:02.560]  31 he grew up in Switzerland and is so disconnected he thinks getting a
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:09.720]  mega nerd basketball washed up player who's been hated for a decade to come
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.960]  there is really cool but people think money and powers about everything
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:18.720]  actually all the evil comes back on you he hasn't been seen for months and now
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:25.640]  they admit in state-run media that he has discomfort and is ill so see all of
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:29.800]  you that sell out for petty power and narcissism this is what you end up
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:37.560]  producing a 31 year old literal tick who I bet's dead in five years totally
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:41.280]  unhealthy totally unhappy you can look at that guy's eyes and all of them the
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:46.600]  leadership looks more freaked out in the starving peasants living under that
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:50.600]  overlook the red carpet and it's fancy the government's invincible it's big
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:55.320]  and powerful no it's not there's government worship there for you all
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:59.720]  the Democrats and Republicans you should worship Kim Jong-un he's an example of
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:05.200]  what you believe in Americans prepare for financial ruin that is what one of
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:09.000]  the world's richest men Donald Trump said just a few weeks ago what are you
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.600]  doing to prepare the problems that caused the last financial crisis were
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:16.720]  never fixed in fact they're even worse now the total amount of debt in the US

[02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:57.680]  soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and
[02:58:57.680 --> 02:59:01.520]  every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been
[02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:05.120]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:09.640]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:13.400]  chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the

[02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:29.200]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:32.760]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.

[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:35.400]  Carolina here on the air. Yeah hey I had an idea for a story that would be kind of
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:39.520]  good and might not necessarily be a drudge-making blockbuster but I was
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:46.200]  monitoring some propaganda media watching an episode of 60 minutes and they
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:51.640]  had this piece on this was this past um I don't know some day I guess and they
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:59.600]  had this piece on and basically they did a massive tutorial on how to commit
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:05.040]  massive identity theft. They gave the the best methods to use. Oh yeah and then
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:08.440]  they allow the illegals to do it and it's always big banks and government that
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:13.200]  are releasing 20 million 50 million 5 million names and IDs then their answer
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:19.120]  is biometric access biometric world ID to fix the problem they've helped create.
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:23.320]  Well that's absolutely true but it was it was amazing and then they said yeah
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:27.520]  here's what you do you get your um you go to the grocery store and buy your you
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:32.880]  know paid visa or Mastercard cash cards and you know you have the money sent
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:36.360]  from this website and they I mean they broke it down like it was a tutorial so
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:42.920]  it would make a good story like CBS um CBS gives massive tutorial on how to
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:47.400]  commit fraud you know or something. Yeah CBS you know does workshop on identity
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:51.360]  theft. Yeah I think that make a good story you really you guys should really
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:55.640]  roll with that. What was the name of the 60 minutes piece? You know I don't remember
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:59.640]  the name of it but it was it aired this past week and it was. Well there's no
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:03.360]  doubt the government finances and runs the identity theft and brings in the
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:07.480]  illegals and everything and then throws the book at citizens it's just it's just
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:11.520]  a joke when you comply you're a chump now and I've always been somebody that's
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:15.600]  law and order but when the government's run by criminals complying with it is
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:19.040]  like doing what Hitler said I'm just not doing it anymore you know when it
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.080]  comes to like all their bull I mean really they'll already comply with
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:25.960]  everything anyways there's nothing for me to buck up against it's just that if
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:29.200]  I guess if I want to buy Amish raw milk I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go to Amish
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:34.280]  that don't follow the so-called rules because the the FDA is a joke appreciate
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:40.560]  your call well Floyd in Ohio you're on the air welcome good to talk to you
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:46.680]  Alex Twitter angle is shepherd of fire long-time fan brother well thanks for
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:51.440]  calling in buddy what's on your mind well several things I'm gonna try to link
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:57.280]  together as fast as I can first thing up on through news 54 year old woman be
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:02.800]  headed at a company in Oklahoma yeah that's that's Fox News CNN we talked
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:06.120]  about it earlier this morning we don't know if it was Islamically connected or
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:11.200]  whether he was just crazy but yeah that that that reports on info wars well the
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:17.520]  point good the point that I'm trying to make behind us is also when that column
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:21.160]  that you talked about was coming in and they could have just wiped ISIS
[03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:28.360]  completely out okay um there were there's just tons and tons of pictures
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:32.240]  and I've had to post some of them of little children with their heads chopped
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:38.440]  off well are you being racist that's liberal and trendy right and what I'm
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:42.880]  trying to drive drive home behind this is is the American people need to
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:49.120]  realize that this is their taxpayer dollars Rand Paul 600 million 600 tons
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:56.960]  of weapons given to these guys by Obama if you do not stand up and say
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:03.360]  something you are literally complicit in Merck mass murder well I agree and
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:09.200]  that's why they're in deep trouble is the military the brass knows that I mean
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:12.120]  this is even too much for them that they're that our government gave them
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:16.360]  the weapons the so-called bombing of them was only a cover that's why they're
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.080]  bombing a subgroup this is a takedown Assad a replay of what happened last
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:23.480]  year and I don't think they're getting away with it and now the attorney
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:28.440]  general's resigning I think you're gonna see a lot more resignations evil is
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:31.640]  not invincible and a lot of people are seeing through it there's a lot of
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:34.120]  people in the government that have done bad things but they did it because they
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:38.120]  were compartmentalized now stuff's getting so clear people are having to
[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:46.640]  come to Jesus Saul on the road to you know Tarsus get knocked off his horse
