[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  Another live transmission gets completely under the skin of the devil worshiping tyrant seizing control of our planet.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  It's Tuesday, February 14th, 2023.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  And we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast again today.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  Wow, the world is really waking up.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Without even looking, I've seen a bunch of big comedians on national television.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  Edward Snowden, a former big NSA whistleblower, he's on public.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Cy Hersh has come out.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  And they're all saying what we all know.
[01:07.000 --> 01:16.000]  This UFO hysteria is 100% a distraction from the entire agenda of the New World Order falling apart in front of our faces.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  The Nord Stream being blown up.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  All the Epstein files starting to come out.
[01:22.000 --> 01:32.000]  The open borders, the imploding economy, inflation exploding in its acceleration upward yet again.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  The expanding war in Ukraine.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  All of it is nothing but a distraction.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  A much bigger distraction than the Super Bowl.
[01:43.000 --> 01:51.000]  Super Bowl hits six year audience high with 113 million viewers on Fox alone.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  And what position are we in now?
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  A better position or a worse position watching the bread and circuses.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  Meanwhile, two more trains derail across the U.S. after Ohio catastrophe.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  Harrison Smith is going to be popping in.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  He's been doing a great job weekday mornings with American Journal, 8 to 11 a.m. Central.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  Really focusing in on it.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  I've done some research into it as well.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  Bazaar a few years ago they shot a movie of a train derailing in the same town blowing up in a chemical explosion.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  Very, very bizarre to see life imitating art.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  And to see the government claiming it's safe when they know it's deadly toxic and poisonous.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  Reminds us how many other disasters that our loving government has covered up and told us was safe.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  Namely 9-11 and all the poison dust.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Huge news on the emerging viruses front.
[02:45.000 --> 02:54.000]  Yahoo may mutate to kill more than 50% of humans who catch it as a result of unprecedented outbreak sweeping mammals experts fear.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Of course, the U.N. has been warning of that being imminent.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  And remember, they're a bunch of depopulationist.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  Yahoo News, U.S. City Day.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  They're all reporting little by little they're winning.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Tide turns in key Ukraine.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  City updates as Russian offensive begins.
[03:11.000 --> 03:21.000]  We're going to look at the trend happening more and more of governments openly spying without warrants on populations with hidden cameras and microphones,
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  including in light poles and other infrastructure.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  I already mentioned this but here's some of the headlines on that front.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  Biden economy inflation up 6.4 on top of what it was a year ago.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  Higher than expected, household budget stressed, strained and broken.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  That's the plan.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  And if you think you're going to live in an underground cash economy and survive and buy that baby food,
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  think again, ladies and gentlemen, 87 new IRS agents to target the working class.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Rhode Island Mill would make it possible for illegal immigrants to vote.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  The Sanis has now secured 10 million in funding from the legislature to ship illegal aliens to the sanctuary cities.
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.000]  And the New York mayor is now being criticized by Canada because he's shipping the illegal aliens to Canada.
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  So it's just ship them all around while the U.N. ships them into our country.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  Why don't we talk about the source of the problem instead of moving these people around all over the place,
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  who are economic and cultural refugees from the policies and the lockdowns and the New World Order.
[04:27.000 --> 04:36.000]  It's just some of what we are going to cover on this big broadcast today as we go in through and beyond.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Infowars.com.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  The coordinates of the resistance are at man.video.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Newswars.com.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  Infowars.com.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  A conspiracy fact, dial info.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Open phones and more.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's really just incredible.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  I know you spread the word.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowars.com.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  You never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowars.com.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[05:59.000 --> 06:19.000]  Please take action now.
[06:29.000 --> 06:43.000]  A powerful combine of major corporations working their governments and media to control and
[06:43.000 --> 06:52.000]  dumb down and dispossess the public would be best described as magicians or con artists,
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  sleight of hands, smoke and mirror, carnival barkers.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  And the world is awakening.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  We have two different futures.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  The great reset or the great awakening.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  Snowden says UFO hysteria is engineered distraction from Nord Stream Pipeline bombshell.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  Yes, that's what we said last week and Pulitzer Prize winner,
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  said the same thing.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  A lot of comedians are saying the same thing.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  In fact, let's play clip one first before we get to the Pentagon spokesperson,
[07:29.000 --> 07:38.000]  John Kirby and his clown world, pointing out what the so-called UFO shoot downs are really all about.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  Hi, I'm Tom Green and forgot to mention the other reason this UFO information is coming out now
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  is because they're trying to distract us all from the fact that we're about to get released the Epstein Island list
[07:55.000 --> 08:03.000]  as well as what's going on in Palestine, Ohio with the train derailment and the chemical release of chemicals into the air,
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  which is being called possibly as bad as Chernobyl.
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  And the fact that World War III might be about to start in the Ukraine war between USA, Russia and China.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  So that's what's going on. Good to see you guys.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Hope you guys are having a great day.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  There's UFOs.
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  Bingo, Tom Green.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  Snowden says UFO is engineered distraction from Nord Stream Pipeline.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  We can put his tweet up on screen.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  He says it's not aliens.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  I wish it were aliens, but it's not aliens.
[08:34.000 --> 08:44.000]  It's just the old engineered panic and attractive nuisance ensuring that these servile reporters get assigned
[08:44.000 --> 08:54.000]  to investigate balloon BS rather than budgets or bombings a la Nord Stream.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  But don't worry, the Biden administration has come out and told us that it's not aliens
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  after their people said it could be aliens, including the head of NORAD.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  Biden administration forming team to study unidentified aerial objects.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  U.S. doesn't know what shot down Lake Huron object is and doesn't rule out a UFO.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  What is a UFO? It's unidentified.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  So they still have it identified and it is a UFO.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  That has a connotation of aliens. It's not.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  Here's an interesting factoid.
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.000]  First, Seinweider missile targeting object over Lake Huron missed at a cost of $400,000.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  So it took two of them to hit it. That's $800,000 to blow up a little craft.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  Don't let balloons distract you from the global economic collapse.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  This is Tyler Durden over at Zero Hedge.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  Big article and interview with Cy Hur speaks out.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  You have to hold the president to account for blowing up Nord Stream and not be distracted.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  You have to seriously and completely agree with those statements.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  Now before we move into two more trains to derail, on top of the Ohio catastrophe
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  and the latest weaponized virus news and then what's happening with the economy and more.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Let's go ahead and look at this report out of U.S. today,
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.120]  published in Yahoo News.
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.760]  Little by little, they are winning.
[10:35.760 --> 10:38.520]  Tide turns in key Ukraine city,
[10:38.520 --> 10:40.800]  which is the Stalingrad type of battle
[10:41.800 --> 10:43.700]  that we saw in World War II happening,
[10:43.700 --> 10:45.340]  repeating in Ukraine,
[10:45.340 --> 10:49.100]  updates as Russian offensive begins.
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.920]  So, the USA Today is about as CIA as it gets.
[10:54.920 --> 10:58.680]  I'd say the thoroughbreds, obviously the Washington Post,
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.640]  but when you look at this,
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.160]  what did I tell you three days ago?
[11:05.160 --> 11:07.840]  What did I tell you two days ago?
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.540]  What did I say yesterday?
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.920]  I said about three weeks ago,
[11:12.920 --> 11:16.920]  I believe that they will launch,
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.440]  the Russians will launch their second big offensive
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.720]  of the last year,
[11:22.720 --> 11:25.840]  a much larger offensive with 500,000 troops,
[11:25.840 --> 11:28.600]  2,000 plus tanks and armored vehicles
[11:28.600 --> 11:31.840]  before the anniversary on the 24th,
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.520]  just for researching things
[11:34.520 --> 11:37.480]  and making my dead reckoning assumption.
[11:37.480 --> 11:41.520]  And then I said that I believe the offensive
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.020]  has already begun and that Putin is not going to announce it
[11:48.160 --> 11:49.840]  because of political fallout.
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.480]  That's how you would up the ante in an invasion,
[11:54.480 --> 11:58.800]  but not try to up the threat continuum
[11:58.800 --> 12:01.080]  to the next room on the ladder.
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.680]  And now mainstream press from CNN to ABC News
[12:06.680 --> 12:08.240]  to USA Today, you name it,
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.960]  are saying that the invasion,
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.720]  the second big offensive has begun.
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.680]  Just like I told you last October,
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.440]  I believe the Russians would invade
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.240]  by the end of February,
[12:20.240 --> 12:21.840]  and of course that happened,
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.760]  again just pointing out that God gave us
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.920]  interesting minds, didn't he?
[12:27.920 --> 12:30.400]  When I just go with my deep research
[12:30.400 --> 12:32.800]  and then just lean back and say,
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.320]  I believe the invasion has already begun,
[12:35.320 --> 12:37.160]  the second invasion has begun.
[12:39.840 --> 12:41.640]  The answer is correct, isn't it?
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.320]  That's not being grabbed out of the air,
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.160]  that's called knowledge and wisdom
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.120]  to be able to then make that analysis.
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.400]  And all of you obviously have that
[12:51.400 --> 12:53.480]  to some degree, many of you more than I do.
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.520]  That's why it's important for you
[12:54.520 --> 12:56.400]  to stand up and be leaders in your area,
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.720]  whether it's to 10 people or 1,000 or a million,
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.560]  because that's how we change the world.
[13:00.560 --> 13:02.760]  The globalists are all about making you feel stupid
[13:02.760 --> 13:07.680]  and ineffectual so you won't be on the field of reality
[13:07.680 --> 13:09.560]  and on the battlefield of minds.
[13:12.040 --> 13:14.920]  And again, this is pretty much purely a ground war now.
[13:14.920 --> 13:16.560]  The Russians have been using missiles
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.200]  to take out Ukrainian infrastructure and weapons.
[13:22.200 --> 13:23.880]  But because they got hurt so badly
[13:23.880 --> 13:27.840]  by the giant stockpile of Western high-tech ground
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.360]  to ground to air missiles, you're not
[13:33.360 --> 13:35.160]  seeing a bunch of Russian aircraft
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.320]  and helicopters flood in like you saw last time.
[13:38.320 --> 13:41.240]  This is about as close to a ground war
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.880]  as a pure ground war as you're going to get.
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.280]  And now they're just going to take the last few cities
[13:47.280 --> 13:50.560]  and towns that was Putin's original goal
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.520]  in the east of Ukraine as a buffer zone controlling
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.480]  the east and the south of Crimea.
[13:58.480 --> 14:00.800]  And then he will harden those points
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.040]  and declare that the war is over, but don't think
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.040]  for a minute that the West and Zelensky are going to stop.
[14:08.040 --> 14:10.920]  So all Putin's done is move the front lines
[14:10.920 --> 14:13.960]  of the war that's been going on for nine years, the proxy war,
[14:13.960 --> 14:16.400]  then a hybrid war, now a pure hot war,
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.400]  leading to possible nuclear war.
[14:19.400 --> 14:25.360]  All he's done is driven those lines 50 to 100 miles,
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.600]  to the case of Crimea, 200 miles in the south,
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.720]  into Ukraine proper.
[14:31.720 --> 14:35.160]  And so the war is not going to end anytime soon,
[14:35.160 --> 14:39.440]  and Putin has boxed himself into a corner.
[14:39.440 --> 14:41.640]  But so has the West, because we're
[14:41.640 --> 14:44.360]  going to get to articles where Europe has spent hundreds
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.960]  of millions of dollars trying to hide the real costs of energy
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.760]  and things from the population, bring them deeper into debt,
[14:50.760 --> 14:52.800]  but they still can't hide it.
[14:52.800 --> 14:55.640]  And then as the West pumps in more and more heavy weapons,
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.800]  this is just going to continue to escalate and only ends bad
[14:58.800 --> 15:00.920]  if it doesn't stop now.
[15:00.920 --> 15:03.360]  This is called a stalemate, and nobody
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.200]  wins but the central banks that consolidate power and control
[15:07.200 --> 15:09.480]  and give people a deeper debt.
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.800]  Russia has already begun.
[15:10.800 --> 15:12.960]  It's expected spring offensive in Ukraine,
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.240]  sending thousands of additional troops
[15:15.240 --> 15:17.160]  in an attempt to overwhelm Ukraine's defenses.
[15:17.160 --> 15:24.200]  NATO, Secretary General said yesterday evening.
[15:27.640 --> 15:35.440]  So there you have the head of NATO saying the new offensive
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.320]  began yesterday.
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.960]  We did call that one.
[15:39.960 --> 15:42.760]  I think that's called nailing it.
[15:42.760 --> 15:44.400]  I'm not bragging or anything.
[15:44.400 --> 15:46.000]  It's just I really think God with the brains
[15:46.000 --> 15:46.800]  we've been given.
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.480]  I know a lot of you got good brains, too.
[15:48.480 --> 15:50.000]  Why don't we use them?
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.080]  We'll leave the rest of the story when we come back
[15:52.080 --> 15:55.200]  and make some more predictions here
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.880]  that could happen depending on different probable.
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.160]  The cavalry has arrived.
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.080]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality
[16:07.080 --> 16:08.320]  chicken-based bone broth they're

[16:20.200 --> 16:22.720]  the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom,
[16:22.720 --> 16:26.000]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric.
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.040]  The list goes on and on.

[16:31.200 --> 16:34.200]  and your purchase supports the M4, a 360 win.
[16:34.200 --> 16:37.120]  If you've not experienced bone broth and even the regular ones

[17:59.720 --> 18:01.400]  You wanna beat the new world order?
[18:01.400 --> 18:03.240]  You wanna stop their globalist agenda?
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.640]  Well, so do I.
[18:04.640 --> 18:07.040]  And I've been the most affected individual
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.600]  in the fight against the globalist
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.440]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[18:11.440 --> 18:13.720]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it
[18:13.720 --> 18:15.400]  without your support.
[18:15.400 --> 18:17.680]  And the good news is we're only under
[18:17.680 --> 18:20.040]  about $200,000 a month.
[18:20.040 --> 18:22.640]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[18:22.640 --> 18:24.680]  on every front but I'm not gonna back down
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.680]  and I'll never give up but I could give out.
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.480]  So please keep me on the field,

[18:53.240 --> 18:56.280]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.280]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.880]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.440]  not just in America but in the world.
[19:08.440 --> 19:11.880]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[19:11.880 --> 19:15.320]  in the information war but I don't deserve the credit.
[19:15.320 --> 19:18.320]  Yes, I've persevered but the listeners and viewers
[19:18.320 --> 19:20.800]  who support m4wars for the real reason
[19:20.800 --> 19:22.800]  we've had the success.
[19:22.800 --> 19:26.320]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight
[19:26.320 --> 19:28.480]  against the new order we've ever had.
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.480]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.680]  and that's why today it's more important than ever
[19:35.680 --> 19:38.080]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[19:38.080 --> 19:40.640]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[19:40.640 --> 19:42.000]  and to intensify them.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.280]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you
[19:45.280 --> 19:48.440]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.000]  because we are over the target.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.680]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[19:53.680 --> 20:20.680]  God bless you all.
[20:23.680 --> 20:41.560]  I want to go through the rest of the World War III stack
[20:41.560 --> 20:45.680]  in this segment and the next segment we're going to look at
[20:45.680 --> 20:52.240]  the three massive train derailments of the last week
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.960]  and the government response to that
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.960]  and a point that a US Senator made on Tucker's show last night
[20:58.960 --> 21:01.800]  how they keep us distracted with the black national anthem
[21:01.800 --> 21:05.320]  and all the race garbage while our infrastructure
[21:05.320 --> 21:11.240]  is undoubtedly falling apart around us.
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.920]  And I've had quite a lot of family that worked for the railroad
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.560]  and dad worked for the railroad when he was going
[21:17.560 --> 21:23.000]  through medical school for four years
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.320]  and he knows quite a bit about it
[21:24.320 --> 21:26.360]  and anybody that knows anything about it
[21:26.360 --> 21:30.560]  knows that we have the worst railroads in the modern world.
[21:30.560 --> 21:32.360]  I'll explain what's really going on coming up
[21:32.360 --> 21:34.920]  but it's just one more example of how this country has been
[21:34.920 --> 21:39.320]  allowed to rot for 50 years.
[21:39.320 --> 21:41.480]  That's coming up, then we're going to look at again
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.880]  the big developments with new weaponized viruses
[21:43.880 --> 21:45.760]  they're getting ready could not be more important,
[21:45.760 --> 21:47.960]  the economy and more.
[21:47.960 --> 21:51.320]  But Harrison Smith will be with us the next few segments
[21:51.320 --> 21:53.360]  because he's been really digging into this
[21:53.360 --> 21:56.520]  to talk about it with me.
[21:56.520 --> 21:58.880]  But let me make a very exciting announcement.
[21:58.880 --> 22:02.400]  It's been sold out for almost a year
[22:02.400 --> 22:03.680]  and it was a very popular product.
[22:03.680 --> 22:06.640]  I can tell you that I've been upset that it was not there
[22:06.640 --> 22:11.560]  because I got dramatic results in my gut health
[22:11.560 --> 22:13.320]  from this product.
[22:13.320 --> 22:16.560]  Restocked for the first time in,
[22:16.560 --> 22:18.320]  I guess they put in my notes, over a year.
[22:18.320 --> 22:19.760]  I thought it was less than that.
[22:19.760 --> 22:26.120]  InfoWarsLife prebiotic fiber is back and 40% off.
[22:26.120 --> 22:30.600]  And I'm not going to go over the entire right up on this
[22:30.600 --> 22:33.120]  but you absolutely need to get it.
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.960]  It's in a new container but it's the same amazing formula.
[22:38.960 --> 22:41.800]  They couldn't get the previous container it was in
[22:41.800 --> 22:43.480]  so we have it in another container.
[22:43.480 --> 22:45.760]  That's part of the supply chain breakdowns.
[22:45.760 --> 22:50.480]  It's got organic acacia fiber of the highest quality,
[22:50.480 --> 22:53.600]  unbleached and unmodified by chemicals,
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.320]  clinically studied for its prebiotic benefits.
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.040]  We could buy a similar formula to this
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.400]  for about a third the price but it's all bleached.
[23:00.400 --> 23:02.400]  It's inorganic.
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.400]  That is, it's not organic, it's from an organic base
[23:05.400 --> 23:08.640]  but not certified organic and it's not the same quality.
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.840]  Organic apple fruit fiber, a mixture of soluble,
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.000]  prebiotic fiber and insoluble bulk forming fiber.
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.400]  Organic flax seed is known for its soluble fiber ability
[23:20.400 --> 23:22.800]  to absorb water and increase its size
[23:22.800 --> 23:25.080]  to create a feeling of fullness.
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.840]  It's also good for dieting.
[23:26.840 --> 23:29.640]  Organic blueberry and fruit fiber,
[23:29.640 --> 23:31.000]  it's the equivalent of each little scoop
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.320]  of a whole package of blueberries,
[23:33.320 --> 23:36.120]  is known for containing antioxidants,
[23:36.120 --> 23:39.720]  good for, from the skin of the blueberry as well
[23:39.720 --> 23:43.040]  as providing a high quality fiber.
[23:43.040 --> 23:45.240]  Organic cranberry fruit fiber,
[23:45.240 --> 23:46.240]  it's not just good for your guts,
[23:46.240 --> 23:48.560]  but very good for your kidneys and bladder.
[23:48.560 --> 23:51.560]  Dried, unsweetened cranberry fruit is high in fiber
[23:51.560 --> 23:53.360]  as well as vitamin C antioxidants,
[23:53.360 --> 23:56.480]  vitamin E and vitamin K.
[23:56.480 --> 24:01.480]  This is a great formula and at $23 you're not gonna find
[24:02.320 --> 24:05.840]  anything of this quality near that price.
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.440]  It's a high end product for about 30, 40% off
[24:09.440 --> 24:12.280]  what you would find it in stores for
[24:12.280 --> 24:13.920]  and that's when it's not discounted.
[24:13.920 --> 24:16.600]  When it's discounted, it is an insanely good deal.
[24:16.600 --> 24:19.600]  Show the prebiotic fiber back in stock
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[24:22.840 --> 24:26.160]  There's a big prebiotic fiber summary at infowarstore.com.
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.360]  I suggest you go read it.
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.680]  And I suggest you just take it to month supply,
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.280]  take a scoop every day in your water,
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.160]  doesn't taste bad, just gulp it down.
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.080]  And you're gonna see dramatic effects.
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.360]  Everybody that takes it does.
[24:40.360 --> 24:42.640]  Also take your focus a little clearer the next level.
[24:42.640 --> 24:45.320]  Brainforce Ultra and Brainforce Plus,
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.920]  two different Neutropics are both 50% off as well.
[24:49.920 --> 24:51.600]  They're both amazing.
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.520]  Ultra is my favorite because I've got to work late at night
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.560]  or my wife wants to go out to dinner with friends
[24:58.560 --> 25:01.200]  or something and we got a babysitter at seven o'clock
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.240]  at night and I wanna go to bed at eight o'clock.
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.800]  I just take a half dropper under the tongue.
[25:05.800 --> 25:07.840]  It hits really quick, 10 to 15 minutes
[25:07.840 --> 25:09.280]  and goes away in two to three hours.
[25:09.280 --> 25:11.640]  It's a very interesting formula
[25:11.640 --> 25:15.720]  and it's my favorite combination
[25:15.720 --> 25:17.400]  of natural stimulants out there.
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.920]  Brainforce Plus is great.
[25:18.920 --> 25:19.880]  That's five to six hours.
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.680]  It's a good, strong, clean energy boost as well
[25:22.680 --> 25:23.960]  and helps focus the mind.
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.840]  Those are 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.840]  And Ultimate Krill Oil and Ultimate Fish Oil are 50% off.
[25:31.840 --> 25:34.880]  They're really good for your body as well.
[25:34.880 --> 25:38.400]  All of this at infowarstore.com.
[25:38.400 --> 25:41.240]  And that is what keeps the broadcast on the air
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.080]  and I thank you for supporting us as we support you.
[25:46.080 --> 25:47.640]  There's no broadcast like it.
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.320]  I wish there were more but we are the best there is
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.800]  and that's not saying a lot but it's just the truth.
[25:55.800 --> 25:58.160]  That means this whole family of guest callers myself,
[25:58.160 --> 25:59.760]  this crew.
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.320]  Little by little, they are winning tide turns in Ukraine,
[26:03.320 --> 26:06.240]  city and many other battlefield areas.
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.560]  USA Today, US Today.
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.960]  Little by little, Russia is winning key ground war.
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.360]  French historian, World War III has already begun.
[26:15.360 --> 26:17.160]  I agree with that statement.
[26:17.160 --> 26:21.280]  Former president of Italy and current member of parliament
[26:21.280 --> 26:23.840]  blames Zelensky, Berlusoni blames Zelensky
[26:23.840 --> 26:24.960]  for your Korean War.
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.040]  All he had to do was stop attacking the Donbass
[26:28.040 --> 26:29.760]  and this would not have happened.
[26:29.760 --> 26:32.280]  Putin told them that, he told him that.
[26:32.280 --> 26:34.200]  We will not enable escalation of conflict
[26:34.200 --> 26:35.400]  that may lead to World War III.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.600]  Elon Musk tells off lefty astronaut Scott Kelly
[26:39.600 --> 26:42.920]  at the Super Bowl to stop pushing for the end of the world.
[26:42.920 --> 26:46.080]  Paranoid Putin only travels by special armored trains
[26:46.080 --> 26:47.880]  as he fears an assassination.
[26:47.880 --> 26:50.240]  You have world leaders calling for his assassination,
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.920]  US senators, you name it.
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.160]  And then he's paranoid?
[26:54.160 --> 26:57.960]  Okay, you're not paranoid if you're protecting yourself
[26:57.960 --> 26:59.360]  and they're out to get you.
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.760]  Biden suddenly orders release of another 26 million barrels
[27:04.760 --> 27:07.520]  for the strategic oil reserve, not for America,
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.160]  but for the China, the lowest the strategic oil reserve
[27:11.160 --> 27:12.240]  has ever been.
[27:13.680 --> 27:15.360]  Ron Paul wrote an excellent article
[27:15.360 --> 27:19.160]  that's on infowars.com for the Ron Paul Institute.
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.080]  It will be reading later in the next hour.
[27:21.080 --> 27:22.000]  I'm gonna read the whole thing.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.120]  It's not that long, but it's very important.
[27:24.120 --> 27:27.200]  How we can stop the coming war with Russia.
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.040]  Ron Paul, tanker rates on oil tankers
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.200]  to haul gasoline soar 400% after the Russian sanctions,
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.040]  not hurting us, is what Biden claims
[27:40.040 --> 27:42.440]  when it is hurting the American people big time.
[27:42.440 --> 27:45.920]  You can look at the prices there and see that for yourself.
[27:45.920 --> 27:47.560]  So when they claim the war isn't hurting the people,
[27:47.560 --> 27:49.160]  that's a lie.
[27:49.160 --> 27:54.160]  Here's an example, Europe has spent 792 billion euros
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.160]  to shield citizens from energy crisis
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.680]  using government money to buy the energy
[28:01.680 --> 28:04.320]  and then passing it on, but that's still,
[28:04.320 --> 28:07.600]  is gonna be paid in taxes and in interest later.
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.400]  792 billion, yeah, not hurting the people.
[28:14.640 --> 28:17.600]  Charting the global decline in consumer confidence.
[28:17.600 --> 28:20.080]  Big article from zero hedge on that.
[28:20.080 --> 28:22.040]  Russian nuke bombers flying near Alaska
[28:22.040 --> 28:25.920]  as Putin taunts US after UFO was shot down.
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.200]  Russia abandons wartime, Russians are leaving
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.160]  and abandoning wartime Russia in historic exodus
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.320]  because they know how dangerous World War Three is.
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.040]  And it goes on and on from there.
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.480]  All right, Harrison Smith, let's get him ready.
[28:42.480 --> 28:43.880]  Let's get him suited up.
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.600]  Let's get him on the field, on the serious situation
[28:47.600 --> 28:49.240]  with the train derailments
[28:49.240 --> 28:53.600]  and the giant toxic nightmare taking place in Ohio.
[28:53.600 --> 28:54.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.480]  Please stay with us.
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.680]  Well, I think we're gonna have to die at force.
[29:02.680 --> 29:03.520]  Die at force.
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.400]  Die at force is amazing.
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.760]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[29:06.760 --> 29:10.080]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[29:10.080 --> 29:12.840]  And die at force has helped me move those bits.
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.840]  Like under my pack, my belly, I'm just taking die at force
[29:17.840 --> 29:19.080]  two tablets a day.
[29:19.080 --> 29:23.640]  Man, if you're struggling to get like chip shaped
[29:23.640 --> 29:27.480]  for the ladies, mate, die at force is the go.
[29:27.480 --> 29:30.320]  You have to get the die at force and have to a day
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.880]  and just keep acting.

[31:59.440 --> 32:02.400]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film,
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.320]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[32:05.320 --> 32:08.640]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders
[32:08.640 --> 32:12.000]  practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.280]  Six summer sets us free.
[32:14.280 --> 32:17.880]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame,
[32:17.880 --> 32:19.960]  exposing the world elite's plans
[32:19.960 --> 32:22.880]  for covertly using biological weapons
[32:22.880 --> 32:25.000]  against all of mankind.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.240]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[32:28.240 --> 32:31.640]  Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[32:31.640 --> 32:35.200]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[32:35.200 --> 32:36.840]  that we knew were coming.
[32:36.840 --> 32:38.880]  This is why they attack us.
[32:38.880 --> 32:41.440]  This is why we need your support.
[32:41.440 --> 32:45.360]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[32:45.360 --> 32:49.880]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause,
[32:49.880 --> 32:53.720]  share the links, join us in the fight for freedom,
[32:53.720 --> 32:56.160]  and help us defeat the New World Order.
[33:01.280 --> 33:05.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[33:05.840 --> 33:07.080]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.640 --> 33:25.400]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[33:25.400 --> 33:30.280]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[33:30.280 --> 33:32.520]  Thomas Jefferson.
[33:32.520 --> 33:35.320]  Well, newly elected patriot, J.D. Vance,
[33:35.320 --> 33:38.280]  who's defended my free speech, a great guy,
[33:38.280 --> 33:40.480]  knocked it out of the park last night with Tucker Carlson,
[33:40.480 --> 33:42.520]  pointing out that a lot of the globalist politicians,
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.520]  mainly in the Democratic Party,
[33:43.520 --> 33:44.920]  but also some of the Republican Party,
[33:44.920 --> 33:46.760]  are diverting us from real issues
[33:46.760 --> 33:47.840]  with distractionary ones.
[33:47.840 --> 33:49.200]  And I know we all know that,
[33:49.200 --> 33:51.480]  but it's important to educate the other sheeple about it,
[33:51.480 --> 33:53.320]  if they're to be free.
[33:53.320 --> 33:55.800]  J.D. Vance is a senator in the US Senate.
[33:55.800 --> 33:56.920]  He represents the state of Ohio.
[33:56.920 --> 33:58.320]  We're happy to have him join us tonight.
[33:58.320 --> 34:00.720]  Senator, thank you so much for coming on tonight.
[34:00.720 --> 34:05.000]  The tragedy in Palestine in your state kind of points up
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.320]  that something is kind of wrong with the fundamentals.
[34:08.320 --> 34:11.360]  I mean, if there are hundreds of trained derailments,
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.040]  like who's paying attention to this stuff
[34:13.040 --> 34:14.080]  and trying to prevent it?
[34:15.200 --> 34:18.160]  Well, Tucker, we've had hundreds of trained derailments
[34:18.160 --> 34:20.880]  after we spent over a trillion dollars
[34:20.880 --> 34:22.280]  on infrastructure in this country.
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.080]  So the fact that this isn't getting obviously better
[34:25.080 --> 34:27.920]  is a major indictment of the people spending the money
[34:27.920 --> 34:29.360]  and what they're spending the money on.
[34:29.360 --> 34:32.760]  Now we know, if you listen to Secretary Buttigieg today,
[34:32.760 --> 34:33.920]  that they are focused more
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.160]  on whether we have too many white men in construction jobs
[34:37.160 --> 34:39.600]  than he is on the fundamentals of his job,
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.160]  which is ensuring we have a viable transportation infrastructure
[34:43.160 --> 34:44.000]  in this country.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.960]  And unfortunately, my constituents in East Palestine
[34:46.960 --> 34:49.640]  have been some of the main victims of the fact
[34:49.640 --> 34:51.640]  that we have failing infrastructure in our country.
[34:51.640 --> 34:54.600]  Again, after spending tons of money
[34:54.600 --> 34:56.160]  in an effort to actually fix it.
[34:56.160 --> 34:58.160]  So the problem we have, Tucker,
[34:58.160 --> 35:00.720]  is that we are ruled by unserious people
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.720]  who are worried about fake problems
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.760]  instead of the real fact that our country is falling apart
[35:05.760 --> 35:07.520]  in some of the most important ways.
[35:07.520 --> 35:09.440]  You mentioned the Environmental Protection Agency.
[35:09.440 --> 35:10.720]  Of course, it says it right there.
[35:10.720 --> 35:13.240]  It should be focused on clean air, clean water.
[35:13.240 --> 35:15.080]  It's the thing that I'm most focused on
[35:15.080 --> 35:16.520]  for the people of East Palestine,
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.360]  but so often they're focused on environmental racism
[35:20.360 --> 35:22.160]  and other ridiculous things
[35:22.160 --> 35:25.880]  instead of fixing the problem that they are established to fix.
[35:26.760 --> 35:28.920]  You got elected to the Senate in part because you said,
[35:28.920 --> 35:30.400]  look, the people that I grew up with,
[35:30.400 --> 35:32.200]  in your case, literally that you grew up with
[35:32.200 --> 35:34.840]  and are related to are dying of drugs
[35:34.840 --> 35:37.120]  and no one in Washington seems to care.
[35:37.120 --> 35:39.040]  This seems a corollary to that.
[35:39.040 --> 35:40.920]  They talk a lot about the environment
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.400]  and environmental racism,
[35:42.400 --> 35:45.000]  but this seems like an actual environmental disaster.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.080]  I don't detect any urgency from the EPA
[35:47.080 --> 35:48.520]  or from Washington at all.
[35:48.520 --> 35:51.320]  Is it because these are not their voters?
[35:51.320 --> 35:52.440]  I think it's a big part of it.
[35:52.440 --> 35:54.080]  I think that the entire country,
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.400]  the media complex, the leaders of this country
[35:57.400 --> 36:00.640]  have decided to disregard the people of East Palestine.
[36:00.640 --> 36:02.800]  If you look at the way the story has been covered,
[36:02.800 --> 36:04.040]  if it's been covered at all,
[36:04.040 --> 36:07.560]  it's about how there are poor people in East Palestine
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.600]  who have been victimized by this disaster.
[36:09.600 --> 36:10.920]  Well, of course that's true,
[36:10.920 --> 36:13.120]  but you want journalists asking tough questions
[36:13.120 --> 36:14.440]  about what's going on.
[36:14.440 --> 36:16.040]  You wanna know, for example,
[36:16.040 --> 36:17.920]  what level of vinyl chloride
[36:17.920 --> 36:19.760]  is actually acceptable in the water?
[36:19.760 --> 36:22.000]  I've been trying to get an answer to that question for days.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.720]  I haven't been able to get an answer to it.
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.560]  Why is vinyl chloride being or showing up
[36:27.560 --> 36:30.720]  in the Ohio River in West Virginia and Cincinnati
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.440]  hundreds of miles away from where this accident took place?
[36:34.440 --> 36:35.760]  There are a lot of questions
[36:35.760 --> 36:38.000]  and we don't unfortunately have a media
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.920]  that's actually interested in asking those questions
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.080]  and answering them.
[36:41.080 --> 36:41.920]  It's just crazy.
[36:41.920 --> 36:43.760]  All these people are like defacing paintings
[36:43.760 --> 36:45.040]  because they care about the earth.
[36:45.040 --> 36:45.960]  If you care about the earth,
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.240]  clean air and water is the first step.
[36:49.240 --> 36:51.600]  I mean, it's like, anyway, I appreciate it.
[36:51.600 --> 36:53.720]  If you can't get an answer as a sitting US senator
[36:53.720 --> 36:54.760]  from the state affected,
[36:54.760 --> 36:57.080]  that just tells you everything right there.
[36:57.080 --> 36:57.920]  Thank you, Senator.
[36:57.920 --> 36:58.760]  We're working at Tucker.
[36:58.760 --> 36:59.600]  Thank you.
[36:59.600 --> 37:00.440]  Amen.
[37:00.440 --> 37:01.560]  Whether it's the balloons,
[37:01.560 --> 37:03.000]  they're trying to say are aliens.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.800]  There's a distraction of the Nord Stream Pipeline
[37:04.800 --> 37:07.200]  or the Jeffrey Epstein list about to come out
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.440]  or black national anthems at the Super Bowl.
[37:12.440 --> 37:14.440]  It's all just window dressing,
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.120]  candy coating on the poison of the decision
[37:18.120 --> 37:23.120]  really since the 1970s to not rebuild America
[37:23.120 --> 37:24.280]  and to deindustrialize us
[37:24.280 --> 37:26.880]  and no matter how much money is shoveled into it,
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.120]  it's all just break down and transferred to China
[37:30.120 --> 37:32.760]  and other globalist investment zones.
[37:32.760 --> 37:34.440]  That's what the New World Order is,
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.040]  is economic warfare against the people
[37:38.040 --> 37:39.960]  of the once great Western world
[37:39.960 --> 37:42.360]  because they don't want the populations of the world
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.040]  aspiring to what America and Europe
[37:46.040 --> 37:48.360]  and places like Australia and New Zealand
[37:48.360 --> 37:49.480]  and the UK used to be,
[37:49.480 --> 37:51.640]  they want everything to be an equal hellhole
[37:51.640 --> 37:55.800]  of the powerful elites living their own gated sectors
[37:55.800 --> 37:56.880]  and reservations.
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.280]  And I know that the host of American Journal
[38:00.280 --> 38:02.440]  weekday mornings, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.080]  Harrison Smith has been all over this like white on rice.
[38:07.080 --> 38:08.440]  There's so many facets to this,
[38:08.440 --> 38:10.720]  we just obviously heard Tucker there
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.680]  dealing with the distractionary issues
[38:12.680 --> 38:14.480]  that they're not focusing with them lying
[38:14.480 --> 38:15.600]  and saying it's safe,
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.000]  just like 9-11 and the deadly dust saying it was safe.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.200]  But I knew it was a death sentence
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.120]  and told folks they didn't even need respirators
[38:22.120 --> 38:23.560]  in the cleanup crews.
[38:23.560 --> 38:25.280]  And now upwards of half the people
[38:25.280 --> 38:26.840]  that were in the cleanup were dead.
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.840]  The whole area is a giant national waste site basically
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.320]  or a superfund site,
[38:34.320 --> 38:36.040]  but it's undeclared superfund site.
[38:36.040 --> 38:38.200]  But then you've got the National Guard
[38:38.200 --> 38:39.360]  roughing up journalists,
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.000]  you've got them basically declaring unofficial
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.240]  martial law investigations of that.
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.760]  You've got more trained derailments,
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.680]  two more trained derailments in East Texas
[38:51.680 --> 38:53.480]  and then other areas.
[38:53.480 --> 38:55.920]  A lot of craziness unfolding.
[38:55.920 --> 38:59.040]  Harrison Smith, what's your boil down of this?
[38:59.040 --> 38:59.880]  Well, you're right.
[38:59.880 --> 39:01.000]  I mean, there's so many angles to this.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.480]  It's almost overwhelming,
[39:02.480 --> 39:06.360]  but the simple boil down is bad.
[39:06.360 --> 39:07.200]  It's really bad.
[39:07.200 --> 39:09.240]  It's worse possibly than we even know.
[39:09.240 --> 39:11.280]  And mainstream media is hardly covering it.
[39:11.280 --> 39:12.840]  So of course we're having to get information
[39:12.840 --> 39:13.800]  from people on the ground.
[39:13.800 --> 39:15.720]  And thank God that we actually have social media
[39:15.720 --> 39:17.200]  somewhat free at this point
[39:17.200 --> 39:19.480]  to where people can get this information out.
[39:19.480 --> 39:23.480]  But it looks like as soon as this train went over,
[39:23.480 --> 39:25.840]  it was sort of which worst case scenario
[39:25.840 --> 39:26.680]  are you going with?
[39:26.680 --> 39:29.760]  So what happened was this train falls over
[39:29.760 --> 39:31.560]  and then they say it's about to explode.
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.760]  And they say the explosion will be a mile in diameter.
[39:34.760 --> 39:37.880]  I mean, it'll be essentially a tactical nuclear weapon
[39:37.880 --> 39:39.600]  with the added chemicals on top of that.
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.960]  So in desperation, they poke holes in the side,
[39:41.960 --> 39:43.680]  drain all of the vinyl chloride,
[39:43.680 --> 39:45.600]  which is hugely carcinogenic
[39:45.600 --> 39:48.280]  with unique liver cancers that it causes
[39:48.280 --> 39:50.200]  and all sorts of other stuff into a big trench
[39:50.200 --> 39:51.400]  on the side of the railroad.
[39:51.400 --> 39:52.560]  And they decided to blow it up.
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.800]  So we covered this for two hours on American Journal.
[39:54.800 --> 39:55.760]  And we actually for the second hour
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.200]  opened up the phone calls to experts to talk about this.
[39:58.200 --> 40:01.160]  And we had somebody in environmental remediation calling
[40:01.160 --> 40:03.520]  who actually said this was probably the right thing to do
[40:03.520 --> 40:06.080]  because vinyl chloride, what happens is when it's in the air
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.160]  it's like rubbing alcohol.
[40:08.160 --> 40:10.120]  It evaporates really quickly.
[40:10.120 --> 40:12.000]  But when it's in the ground, it seeps into the ground
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.880]  and it off gases for years or maybe decades after that.
[40:14.880 --> 40:17.280]  So if you let it get into the soil, I mean, that's it.
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.120]  It's over.
[40:18.120 --> 40:19.360]  It's carcinogenic and it's there forever.
[40:19.360 --> 40:20.880]  So they wanted to explode it.
[40:20.880 --> 40:22.520]  But of course, then it's a giant cloud
[40:22.520 --> 40:23.880]  that goes over several states.
[40:23.880 --> 40:26.200]  And so they lie and say it's not bad for you.
[40:26.200 --> 40:27.880]  Well, now they're saying that it's not in the water.
[40:27.880 --> 40:28.800]  It's safe to come back.
[40:28.800 --> 40:30.560]  And then you've got people posting on TikTok,
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.680]  like I just walked into my house
[40:31.680 --> 40:33.600]  and everything smells like chlorine.
[40:33.600 --> 40:34.440]  And you know.
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.080]  Is animals dying everywhere?
[40:36.080 --> 40:37.600]  Our animals are dying everywhere.
[40:37.600 --> 40:39.200]  So yeah.
[40:39.200 --> 40:41.280]  What is their lying instead of being honest?
[40:41.280 --> 40:42.360]  Well, absolutely they're lying
[40:42.360 --> 40:43.200]  and they're covering it up
[40:43.200 --> 40:44.840]  and they're completely ignoring
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.360]  what seems to have caused this,
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.000]  which is the Biden administration's quiet war
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.920]  with the train unions
[40:50.920 --> 40:54.120]  where essentially trains are hardly staffed
[40:54.120 --> 40:55.280]  to an appropriate measure.
[40:55.280 --> 40:57.200]  They're skipping safety measures.
[40:57.200 --> 40:59.520]  That's why we've seen some of the strikes.
[40:59.520 --> 41:00.360]  Well, this is, yeah.
[41:00.360 --> 41:02.240]  This is all as a consequence of the strikes.
[41:02.240 --> 41:03.640]  We actually had a train conductor,
[41:03.640 --> 41:05.120]  train engineer call in yesterday
[41:05.120 --> 41:06.800]  and totally confirmed that and said it's, you know,
[41:06.800 --> 41:09.440]  it's almost impossible to get capable people
[41:09.440 --> 41:10.720]  on staff anymore.
[41:10.720 --> 41:13.760]  And this was just a disaster waiting to happen, essentially.
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.800]  And we had two more.
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.200]  We had one in South Carolina
[41:16.200 --> 41:18.160]  and one in East Texas, huge ones.
[41:18.160 --> 41:19.600]  Yeah, and these were a little different though
[41:19.600 --> 41:21.400]  because the one in Houston at least
[41:21.400 --> 41:23.040]  was a truck that it hit,
[41:23.040 --> 41:25.040]  an 18-wheeler that it hit.
[41:25.040 --> 41:26.760]  So that was somewhat unexpected.
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.600]  While the occurrence in Ohio had to do with a failure
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.120]  to either pay attention to the alarm
[41:33.120 --> 41:34.400]  or the alarm didn't go off.
[41:34.400 --> 41:36.560]  Basically they have these hot boxes
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.000]  that measures the temperature of the axles of the train
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.080]  and it shows that an alarm actually went off
[41:41.080 --> 41:43.560]  something like 20 miles away from Ohio
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.880]  but the train was never stopped.
[41:44.880 --> 41:47.880]  The emergency application was never applied
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.600]  and it went off the rail.
[41:49.600 --> 41:50.440]  So I mean, again.
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.120]  And that's just like the deep water horizon.
[41:52.120 --> 41:52.960]  Yep.
[41:52.960 --> 41:54.120]  All their alarms were going off.
[41:54.120 --> 41:55.720]  The whole rig was falling apart
[41:55.720 --> 41:58.360]  and then they had them dig, drill the deepest well
[41:58.360 --> 41:59.320]  ever drilled.
[41:59.320 --> 42:00.960]  And then they said, we're gonna put concrete in the hole.
[42:00.960 --> 42:02.360]  We're gonna just come and let seawater
[42:02.360 --> 42:03.520]  with pressure hold it in.
[42:03.520 --> 42:05.800]  And the engineers, as we said, will explode.
[42:05.800 --> 42:06.960]  And the company said, we don't care.
[42:06.960 --> 42:08.520]  We'll save $2 billion, you know,
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.760]  dollars if this works on our next few rigs.
[42:10.760 --> 42:12.200]  Do it as a test and it blew up.
[42:12.200 --> 42:13.480]  It just shows insanity.
[42:13.480 --> 42:15.840]  Yeah, I mean, we just blow up an underwater pipeline
[42:15.840 --> 42:17.920]  to get back at Russia on our stream.
[42:17.920 --> 42:19.920]  So it's like, and a lot of people are asking, you know,
[42:19.920 --> 42:21.760]  are we under, I saw yesterday all over Twitter,
[42:21.760 --> 42:22.600]  are we under attack?
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.920]  Like first of all, yes, we are obviously under attack.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.240]  Hundreds of food processing plants blow up.
[42:27.240 --> 42:28.440]  It's endless, right?
[42:28.440 --> 42:30.360]  So whether it was an accident or on purpose,
[42:30.360 --> 42:31.640]  it's the same people at the helm.
[42:31.640 --> 42:32.880]  It's the same people in the charge.
[42:32.880 --> 42:35.200]  And it's the same people that are being covered up for
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.400]  by the mainstream media who aren't covering this
[42:37.400 --> 42:39.720]  to nearly the extent that it deserves.
[42:39.720 --> 42:41.840]  I mean, it's almost impossible to describe the ecological
[42:41.840 --> 42:44.560]  disaster that we're witnessing unfold.
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.600]  And it's only going to get worse because the globalist said
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.280]  at the Rio de Janeiro 1992 meeting,
[42:50.280 --> 42:52.040]  they want to post industrial world.
[42:52.040 --> 42:52.920]  This is a plan.
[42:52.920 --> 42:55.280]  We'll talk about the great reset when we come back
[42:55.280 --> 42:56.280]  with Harrison Smith.
[42:59.040 --> 43:02.000]  Well, I would say about diet force.
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.680]  Diet force is amazing.
[43:03.680 --> 43:07.200]  I'm 45 and I have bit, I go to the gym
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.360]  and I have bit that won't move.
[43:09.360 --> 43:12.080]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[43:12.080 --> 43:15.640]  Like under my pecs, my belly,
[43:15.640 --> 43:18.280]  I'm just taking diet force two towers a day.
[43:18.280 --> 43:20.720]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[43:21.720 --> 43:24.000]  like chip shape for the ladies,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.720]  mate, diet force is the go.
[43:26.720 --> 43:29.560]  You have to get the diet force and have to a day
[43:29.560 --> 43:31.120]  and just keep acting.
[43:31.120 --> 43:34.080]  InfoWarsStore.com X7 diet force.
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.200]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby.
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.200]  Now on sale, but we're cutting that out.
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.840]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[43:40.840 --> 43:41.680]  I can guarantee you that.
[43:41.680 --> 43:43.640]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[43:43.640 --> 43:45.200]  God bless Australia.
[43:45.200 --> 43:46.360]  We'll be right back, folks.
[43:46.360 --> 43:47.200]  Don't go anywhere.
[43:47.200 --> 43:48.680]  InfoWarsStore.com, diet force.
[43:48.680 --> 43:49.520]  Get it now.
[44:00.400 --> 44:02.280]  Cover commander here
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.680]  with an important message to humanity.
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.240]  I have decided that all of you
[44:08.240 --> 44:10.960]  will take a special injection
[44:10.960 --> 44:13.160]  so that you will be safe,
[44:13.160 --> 44:16.640]  but the injection is not ready yet.
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.560]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.040]  for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[44:26.040 --> 44:28.520]  I also need you to wear masks
[44:28.520 --> 44:33.520]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[44:33.960 --> 44:37.320]  That way we can consolidate control
[44:37.320 --> 44:40.000]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.400]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[44:44.400 --> 44:47.080]  You will then be my slaves.
[44:47.080 --> 44:50.360]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot
[44:50.360 --> 44:52.240]  of freedom from Cobra.
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.360]  It will improve your immune system
[44:54.360 --> 44:55.840]  so you'll be dependent on me
[44:55.840 --> 44:58.280]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[45:00.200 --> 45:05.120]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globals.
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.040]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[45:09.040 --> 45:11.560]  not just in America, but in the world.
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.040]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[45:15.040 --> 45:18.440]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[45:18.440 --> 45:21.440]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[45:21.440 --> 45:23.880]  who support InfoWars are the real reason
[45:23.880 --> 45:25.600]  you've had the success.
[45:25.600 --> 45:27.840]  We're having now the greatest victories
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.000]  in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.320]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon,
[45:35.320 --> 45:38.440]  and that's why today it's more important than ever
[45:38.440 --> 45:40.600]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[45:40.600 --> 45:43.200]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[45:43.200 --> 45:44.560]  and to intensify them.
[45:44.560 --> 45:45.880]  God bless you all.
[45:45.880 --> 45:49.040]  I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you
[45:49.040 --> 45:50.960]  to intensify what you're doing now
[45:50.960 --> 45:54.120]  because we are over the target and this street is happening.
[45:54.120 --> 45:56.760]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[45:56.760 --> 45:57.920]  God bless you all.
[45:57.920 --> 46:00.920]  InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.
[46:00.920 --> 46:02.920]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[46:02.920 --> 46:05.160]  for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life,
[46:05.160 --> 46:09.360]  for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air,
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.360]  and I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products
[46:14.360 --> 46:16.640]  for what you pay for similar products
[46:16.640 --> 46:19.200]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[46:19.200 --> 46:21.640]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer
[46:21.640 --> 46:24.240]  in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[46:24.240 --> 46:26.240]  They then give us the best deal out there
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.240]  because the owner is a listener and we're able to bring it
[46:28.240 --> 46:29.920]  to you with massive discounts.
[46:29.920 --> 46:33.280]  You're not gonna find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD
[46:33.280 --> 46:34.960]  for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[46:34.960 --> 46:37.320]  You're not gonna find at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram,
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.120]  you're not gonna find tumor at 95% or humanoid
[46:40.120 --> 46:41.160]  at the price we're selling it.
[46:41.160 --> 46:43.760]  You're not gonna find any of this anywhere near that.
[46:43.760 --> 46:45.800]  These similar formulas or the same formulas
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.760]  sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.

[46:52.640 --> 46:56.400]  at infowarsstore.com, a true 360 win.
[47:00.400 --> 47:03.080]  Leading up front to assault on the lies
[47:03.080 --> 47:06.640]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.640 --> 47:19.120]  It's had its challenges.
[47:19.120 --> 47:20.120]  Right.
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.120]  I mean, if you look at what the American transportation
[47:22.120 --> 47:25.120]  systems have faced in the last two or three years,
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.120]  partly because of the pandemic, we've faced issues
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.120]  from container shipping to airline cancellations.
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.120]  Now we got balloons.
[47:36.120 --> 47:37.120]  That's right.
[47:42.120 --> 47:47.120]  The technocrats are on record that they're going to slowly
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.120]  shut off our civilization, our energy,
[47:51.120 --> 47:53.120]  our transportation infrastructure, our farming,
[47:53.120 --> 47:59.120]  and all the staple production crops that we've had
[47:59.120 --> 48:06.120]  from beef to every other piece of the economy.
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.120]  And you ask why?
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.120]  If they own pretty much everything and control it,
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.120]  why would they do that?
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.120]  Because they're at war with us, and as things get more scarce,
[48:14.120 --> 48:17.120]  they will consolidate even more power and more control over us
[48:17.120 --> 48:20.120]  because if someone is poor and can't even feed themselves,
[48:20.120 --> 48:23.120]  you can dictate to them how they're going to live their lives.
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.120]  This is a very simple equation.
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.120]  It's the post-industrial world, and you have hundreds of attacks
[48:31.120 --> 48:33.120]  that have led back to Antifa.
[48:33.120 --> 48:36.120]  They get arrested all the time, derailing trains,
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.120]  setting fires all over the country, and the media suppresses
[48:39.120 --> 48:40.120]  that.
[48:40.120 --> 48:42.120]  Facebook and Twitter and Google would suppress it
[48:42.120 --> 48:45.120]  when they got arrested, and you've got Extinction Rebellion
[48:45.120 --> 48:48.120]  funded by the big central banks and the Rothschilds
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.120]  out running around blocking trains and blocking roads
[48:51.120 --> 48:53.120]  and attacking blue-collar commuters,
[48:53.120 --> 48:57.120]  and you've got all over the western world the equivalent
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.120]  of the IRS, including IRS here, ramping up
[49:01.120 --> 49:03.120]  and seeing their main focus is working poor.
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.120]  The plan is clowered and pivoted to make capitalism fail
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.120]  so you will go on welfare that is social credit score controlled.
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  Harrison Smith, host of American Journal Weekly Mornings,
[49:14.120 --> 49:17.120]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Central at infowars.com.
[49:17.120 --> 49:19.120]  Your view on where this is going.
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.120]  I think the public is waking up to it.
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.120]  What do we do?
[49:23.120 --> 49:25.120]  Well, you get prepared as best you can.
[49:25.120 --> 49:28.120]  And of course, if you're one of the five million people
[49:28.120 --> 49:30.120]  that get your drinking water from the Ohio River,
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.120]  you definitely filter your water and you make sure that,
[49:32.120 --> 49:34.120]  you know, if you're tasting anything strange,
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  try bottled for a little while.
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.120]  But yeah, I had a caller again this morning talking about
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.120]  the egg situation with all of the egg destruction,
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.120]  the food shortages, and it seems like the obvious conclusion
[49:43.120 --> 49:44.120]  is exactly what you just said.
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.120]  They're attempting to destroy any sustainability
[49:47.120 --> 49:48.120]  that we have as human beings.
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  I got chickens in my backyard.
[49:50.120 --> 49:51.120]  We get eggs from them.
[49:51.120 --> 49:52.120]  I mean, that's totally free.
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.120]  They aren't involved in any way.
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.120]  They can't stop me from doing that.
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.120]  They're trying to stop that from even being a possibility.
[49:58.120 --> 50:00.120]  And you don't need exterminators because the chickens eat all the bugs.
[50:00.120 --> 50:01.120]  Exactly.
[50:01.120 --> 50:03.120]  And if you want it, you can grow.
[50:03.120 --> 50:04.120]  I mean, the earth is there.
[50:04.120 --> 50:05.120]  I mean, it's bountiful.
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.120]  You can plant seeds, grow the crops, eat the crops.
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.120]  No bureaucracy involved.
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  But what's Monsanto and the rest of the company's doing?
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.120]  They've been buying up tens of thousands of heirloom seeds,
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.120]  literally putting them in vaults,
[50:17.120 --> 50:20.120]  and then only selling the seeds that don't produce more crops.
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.120]  And so, exactly.
[50:22.120 --> 50:23.120]  And so this, you know...
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.120]  That's a microcosm.
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.120]  You've got the Ohio River.
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.120]  Ohio River, just some stats for you,
[50:28.120 --> 50:30.120]  serves 10% of the U.S. population.
[50:30.120 --> 50:33.120]  Over 30 million people rely on the Ohio River,
[50:33.120 --> 50:35.120]  including 5 million people who get their drinking water
[50:35.120 --> 50:36.120]  from the Ohio River.
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.120]  Combine that with the Colorado River.
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.120]  But then the media makes fun of us when we say
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  the supplies tainted most areas, filter it,
[50:42.120 --> 50:45.120]  and then sell water filters that are the highest quality,
[50:45.120 --> 50:46.120]  highest rated.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.120]  We're bad for saying...
[50:47.120 --> 50:49.120]  It's been big national news stories everywhere.
[50:49.120 --> 50:51.120]  Hundreds of them over the years.
[50:51.120 --> 50:53.120]  We're evil saying you need to filter your water.
[50:53.120 --> 50:55.120]  And we're trying to make money
[50:55.120 --> 50:57.120]  off selling you something to protect yourself.
[50:57.120 --> 51:00.120]  Well, obviously I want to sell you stuff that's good for you.
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  But I'm not supposed to sell you poison?
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  Well, and that's sort of the same as all of this stuff.
[51:04.120 --> 51:07.120]  Whether it's on accident or on purpose,
[51:07.120 --> 51:08.120]  you should be protecting yourself.
[51:08.120 --> 51:10.120]  Whether they're putting chemicals in the water,
[51:10.120 --> 51:12.120]  you know, like, you know, all the stuff that they put in.
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.120]  Remember them suppressing therapeutics?
[51:14.120 --> 51:17.120]  Arresting doctors that said take vitamin D and vitamin C
[51:17.120 --> 51:18.120]  as a preventative?
[51:18.120 --> 51:21.120]  When it's on the CDC website, they arrested doctors in Texas,
[51:21.120 --> 51:23.120]  in Michigan, other areas, two and a half,
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.120]  three years ago saying therapeutics don't work,
[51:25.120 --> 51:26.120]  vitamins don't work.
[51:26.120 --> 51:28.120]  Again, they've attacked us everywhere
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.120]  because we sell supplements saying they're good for you.
[51:31.120 --> 51:33.120]  These people are out to get you.
[51:33.120 --> 51:34.120]  I know the public understands that,
[51:34.120 --> 51:37.120]  but my goodness, folks, this is so obvious.
[51:37.120 --> 51:39.120]  I know, and I mean, this is just the latest salvo.
[51:39.120 --> 51:41.120]  People, again, on Twitter yesterday going,
[51:41.120 --> 51:43.120]  are we under attack these UFOs, these trains?
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.120]  It's like you've been under attack for 10 years at this point.
[51:46.120 --> 51:49.120]  It's good you're realizing it now, but please catch up
[51:49.120 --> 51:51.120]  because we got a lot of ground to make up here.
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.120]  What do you make of the balloons?
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.120]  What do you make of the pipeline?
[51:55.120 --> 51:59.120]  I agree with Cy Hirsch and with Edward Snowden
[51:59.120 --> 52:03.120]  that they've called the balloons UFOs to scare people,
[52:03.120 --> 52:06.120]  to distract from the pipeline news and other news.
[52:06.120 --> 52:08.120]  Yeah, I think that's definitely true.
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.120]  I also think that the Chinese balloon,
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.120]  the first one, the big one that got everybody's attention,
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.120]  I think that was really a wake-up call.
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.120]  I don't think these balloons are a new phenomenon.
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.120]  I think we've ignored them before now.
[52:18.120 --> 52:21.120]  I think that there's been lots of just little balloons,
[52:21.120 --> 52:23.120]  little signatures on radar that they just sort of brush off,
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.120]  and now they're not brushing that off anymore
[52:25.120 --> 52:27.120]  and they're just going after everything.
[52:27.120 --> 52:29.120]  So I don't think the balloons are necessarily a new phenomenon.
[52:29.120 --> 52:31.120]  I think our reaction to it is a new phenomenon
[52:31.120 --> 52:34.120]  and is telling that our elite are a little bit nervous
[52:34.120 --> 52:35.120]  about what's going on.
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.120]  Harrison, I think you're 100% correct.
[52:38.120 --> 52:41.120]  We're going to play clip 7 here of Kirby,
[52:41.120 --> 52:44.120]  the Defense Department's spokesman.
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.120]  Now, listen to this.
[52:46.120 --> 52:47.120]  Listen to this quote.
[52:47.120 --> 52:49.120]  He says,
[52:49.120 --> 52:51.120]  this has been going on under Trump,
[52:51.120 --> 52:53.120]  but he didn't know we knew.
[52:53.120 --> 52:55.120]  Now, we know it came out last week
[52:55.120 --> 52:58.120]  that the Pentagon decided not to tell the president of the United States
[52:58.120 --> 53:00.120]  their commander-in-chief,
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  so that when it came out that there had been a bunch of balloons
[53:02.120 --> 53:04.120]  in his administration that they'd ignored
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.120]  some of them by China,
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.120]  that come across over the Arctic,
[53:08.120 --> 53:09.120]  down over Alaska,
[53:09.120 --> 53:11.120]  and then down over the west,
[53:11.120 --> 53:12.120]  over the central part,
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.120]  and then exiting over the Carolinas,
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.120]  and then on their way back to China,
[53:16.120 --> 53:17.120]  surveilling us,
[53:17.120 --> 53:20.120]  they could carry weapons platforms, you name it.
[53:20.120 --> 53:23.120]  Well, that was such an incredible admission,
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.120]  and then now Kirby makes the admission
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.120]  offhandedly that, well,
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  the White House didn't know,
[53:30.120 --> 53:32.120]  the administrations didn't know,
[53:32.120 --> 53:35.120]  as if the Pentagon is its own separate thing.
[53:35.120 --> 53:36.120]  Here's the club.
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.120]  But we were able to determine
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.120]  that China has a high-altitude balloon program
[53:41.120 --> 53:43.120]  for intelligence collection
[53:43.120 --> 53:46.120]  that's connected to the People's Liberation Army.
[53:46.120 --> 53:49.120]  It was operating during the previous administration,
[53:49.120 --> 53:51.120]  but they did not detect it.
[53:51.120 --> 53:52.120]  We detected it.
[53:52.120 --> 53:54.120]  We tracked it.
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.120]  And we have been carefully studying it
[53:56.120 --> 53:58.120]  to learn as much as we can.
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.120]  We know that these PRC surveillance balloons
[54:00.120 --> 54:02.120]  have crossed over dozens of countries
[54:02.120 --> 54:05.120]  on multiple continents around the world,
[54:05.120 --> 54:08.120]  including some of our closest allies and partners.
[54:08.120 --> 54:11.120]  We assessed that at this time,
[54:11.120 --> 54:14.120]  these balloons have provided limited,
[54:14.120 --> 54:16.120]  additive capabilities to the PRC's
[54:16.120 --> 54:18.120]  other intelligence platforms
[54:18.120 --> 54:21.120]  used over the United States.
[54:21.120 --> 54:22.120]  But in the future,
[54:22.120 --> 54:25.120]  if the PRC continues to advance this technology,
[54:25.120 --> 54:29.120]  it certainly could become more valuable to them.
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.120]  All right, so everything Admiral John Kirby
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.120]  just said was from a carefully prepared script,
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.120]  not a slip of the tongue.
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.120]  The administration, the previous administration,
[54:40.120 --> 54:43.120]  did not detect it.
[54:43.120 --> 54:47.120]  The Pentagon detected it and didn't tell us.
[54:47.120 --> 54:49.120]  That's a message to the world.
[54:49.120 --> 54:51.120]  These presidents are puppets.
[54:51.120 --> 54:53.120]  A message to the Chinese and others.
[54:53.120 --> 54:54.120]  The Pentagon is in control.
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.120]  We now know from all the documents they were in,
[54:56.120 --> 54:58.120]  the development of COVID-19,
[54:58.120 --> 55:01.120]  the release of it, the poison shot,
[55:01.120 --> 55:04.120]  all of it, Moderna and Pfizer were just front companies.
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.120]  Harrison Smith.
[55:06.120 --> 55:11.120]  Yeah, and of course, the previous Pentagon spokesperson
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.120]  or whoever it was, the major general,
[55:13.120 --> 55:15.120]  was saying that they didn't want to tell Trump
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.120]  because they didn't want him to overreact.
[55:17.120 --> 55:19.120]  They withheld this information about Chinese incursions
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.120]  onto American mainland with spying devices
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.120]  because they didn't trust Trump.
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.120]  I mean, that is an open admission.
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.120]  Combine that with General Milley calling China
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.120]  to comfort them and say,
[55:29.120 --> 55:31.120]  don't worry, we're not going to do anything
[55:31.120 --> 55:33.120]  and if we do, we'll tell you before we do it.
[55:33.120 --> 55:35.120]  I don't know how this is anything but treason.
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.120]  I mean, when you have these people usurping the rightful duties
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.120]  of the president of the United States.
[55:40.120 --> 55:43.120]  You've got Mattis and you've got Milley routinely saying,
[55:43.120 --> 55:45.120]  we chose not to tell Trump.
[55:45.120 --> 55:47.120]  I never voted for those guys.
[55:47.120 --> 55:49.120]  I never voted for Mattis or Milley.
[55:49.120 --> 55:51.120]  Remember, they would brag too that he'd sign executive orders
[55:51.120 --> 55:53.120]  or government order, they just throw it away.
[55:53.120 --> 55:55.120]  That is literal treason.
[55:55.120 --> 55:57.120]  We did it with Nancy Pelosi where Nancy Pelosi said,
[55:57.120 --> 56:00.120]  I guaranteed her that I had access to the nuclear codes
[56:00.120 --> 56:02.120]  and Trump wouldn't be able to do anything
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.120]  in his last days in office.
[56:04.120 --> 56:06.120]  That is a right of the president of the United States
[56:06.120 --> 56:08.120]  as duly elected and they usurp that from him.
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.120]  And so Kirby was literally just pee-pee in her face.
[56:12.120 --> 56:14.120]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.120]  That's exactly how I described what China was doing to us
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.120]  with the balloons, just sort of,
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.120]  because that's how it comes across to me,
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  is just sort of showing we can do this now.
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.120]  Harrison, stay there and do five more minutes
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.120]  and make calls.
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes,

[56:34.120 --> 56:36.120]  over a year, they tell me.
[56:36.120 --> 56:38.120]  I thought it was only like eight, nine months.
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.120]  It's back, it's just in a new container
[56:40.120 --> 56:42.120]  with a supply chain breakdowns.
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  We couldn't get the other container.
[56:44.120 --> 56:46.120]  This container is just as good or better,
[56:46.120 --> 56:48.120]  but that's the only difference.
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.120]  It's back in stock, infowarslife.com, 40% off,

[57:17.120 --> 57:19.120]  This is one of my favorite products,
[57:19.120 --> 57:21.120]  and a lot of folks got upset the last year we couldn't get it,
[57:21.120 --> 57:23.120]  because the supply chain broke down from the ingredients
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.120]  and the container.
[57:25.120 --> 57:27.120]  Well, we could never get the same containers again,
[57:27.120 --> 57:29.120]  so again, it's a new container, new label,
[57:29.120 --> 57:31.120]  but the good old-fashioned, super-high-quality,

[58:01.120 --> 58:03.120]  but more importantly, your immune system.

[58:55.120 --> 58:57.120]  And I've been the most effective individual
[58:57.120 --> 58:59.120]  in the fight against the globalist,
[58:59.120 --> 59:01.120]  and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[59:01.120 --> 59:03.120]  But, ladies and gentlemen,
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.120]  I can't do it without your support.
[59:05.120 --> 59:07.120]  And the good news is,
[59:07.120 --> 59:09.120]  we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[59:09.120 --> 59:11.120]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying
[59:11.120 --> 59:13.120]  their attacks on every front,
[59:13.120 --> 59:15.120]  but I'm not going to back down.
[59:15.120 --> 59:17.120]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[59:17.120 --> 59:19.120]  So please keep me on the field.

[59:43.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  not taking action.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]  Alright, final segment with Harrison Smith.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120]  And I'm going to give the number out next segment
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120]  and take your calls, intersperse the breaking news,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.120]  and analysis.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120]  And I want to read next segment
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.120]  this Dr. Ron Paul article
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120]  that's on infowars.com about
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120]  how we can stop the coming massive escalation
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.120]  of war with Russia.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.120]  His headline is
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.120]  how we can stop the coming war with Russia.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.120]  It's already begun, but
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  that's my little
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.120]  spin on it, I guess you could call it.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120]  But I asked Harrison
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.120]  in this final little five-minute segment
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.120]  what he wanted to hit next, and that's the escalation
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.120]  in that war,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.120]  and some of the things that are developing
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  on that front. But now the head of NATO
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.120]  said last night,
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.120]  as we've been telling you the last week or so,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.120]  the Russian invasion
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.120]  or part two of their offensive has begun,
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.120]  and now NATO
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.120]  says that it's begun.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.120]  You can see the activity on the ground
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.120]  and tell that clearly it was bigger than a new
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  probative action, so I made that call
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.120]  and now NATO
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.120]  has concurred with that.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.120]  So the time we have left, Harrison,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.120]  where do you see the situation going?
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.120]  Not anywhere good,
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120]  because obviously there's one thing we know about
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120]  the elites in the western countries,
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120]  they don't just give up and admit that they're wrong.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  About anything ever, even when it's obvious,
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.120]  and here they've
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120]  spent all this money, they've dedicated
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120]  all this time, they've really propped up Zelensky
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120]  and acted as if, you know, if he loses
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.120]  the world is over, they're not going to give up
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.120]  easily, and yet they are
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.120]  losing on all fronts as far as I can tell.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.120]  Russia seems to be about to mount a huge offensive.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.120]  Recently there were Russian
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.120]  jets that had to be escorted out of the
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.120]  Polish air zone from
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120]  by Dutch fighters, so they seem to be
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.120]  provoking their neighbors a little bit
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.120]  more, and there's even videos
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.120]  out of Ukraine where they're now
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.120]  shoving 16 and 17 year olds into vans
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  because they're running out of people, so they're having to lower
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.120]  the age limit.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120]  These are the rumors, of course,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.120]  we can't actually get any legitimate information
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120]  out, so we have to go by the video.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120]  I've seen the footage of teenagers being grabbed by troops
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120]  and thrown on the back of trucks.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.120]  While their mothers try to stop them and the soldiers
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.120]  smack the women away and take the
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.120]  drag their sons off, and then there's even
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.120]  videos like of the young guys in trenches,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.120]  you can just see they're nervous, they don't know how to hold a gun,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.120]  I mean they're being set up for slaughter.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.120]  Even though there's an Austrian general
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.120]  that there were NATO soldiers now
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120]  in Ukraine, but they changed uniform.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120]  We're dealing with like false flag at the most
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120]  basic level. NATO clearly
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.120]  plans on this war getting bigger.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  Apparently Putin's strategy, as far as
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.120]  I've heard, is he wants this war to go on
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.120]  for as long as possible because he knows that
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.120]  the western people are getting sick of it,
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120]  and they are. In fact, there's a massive
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120]  rally in France yesterday. They
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.120]  burned a NATO flag and were
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.120]  infuriated at the fact that France is still
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  sending weapons into Ukraine.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  The public support for this war is waning
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.120]  and I think Putin knows that and knows that if
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  he can just keep it going for a little longer
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.120]  or even go even harder in the next
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.120]  little while, it's going to be the
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.120]  people of the west that will demand that
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120]  our leaders pull us out of this and
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.120]  stop this folly before it gets to
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.120]  a nuclear level.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  Absolutely, and my big concern is what we saw
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.120]  a few months ago, we forget about. Zelensky
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.120]  fires a couple of missiles into Poland.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120]  Instantly, Lehm's Russia says
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.120]  we need nukes, nuke Russia.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.120]  Compensate nuke, nuke, nuke, so liberal.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.120]  Into the world so trendy, so fun, so
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120]  loving, so anti-war.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120]  And then a day later, they go,
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.120]  okay, it was actually Ukrainian
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.120]  missiles. Right, and they got caught
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.120]  because it just so happened that
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  an independent journalist was the first
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120]  on the scene and was able to take pictures of the missile.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.120]  If that hadn't happened,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120]  they would have swooped in, classified everything
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.120]  and said, yeah, it was Russia, but luckily
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120]  they got some of those photos out. And that's really
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.120]  what's got the globalist and checkmate is
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.120]  they can censor all the patriot people that are awake.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.120]  But just random folks are
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120]  shooting footage of stuff now, and it never
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.120]  fits in with the official narrative, or like when they were trying
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120]  to stage false flags six, seven years ago
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120]  in Syria, the Islamists
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120]  firing the chemical weapons, the chlorine bombs
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.120]  to cross
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.120]  Obama's red line
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120]  that he would send in troops
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.120]  if Syria
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120]  used chemical weapons. They still wanted the bonus
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.120]  money they'd get from the jihad groups, so they
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.120]  kept videotaping themselves, screaming Allah Akbar
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.120]  and firing the chemicals. So it just kept coming out.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120]  Oh, it's completely absurd.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120]  So yeah, things are clearly getting to
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.120]  a very dangerous place,
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.120]  and if there's one thing we know about
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.120]  the New World Order is they aren't going to give up
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120]  anytime soon, and they'll push you to global
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120]  suicide if it means they think they'll get their way.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.120]  So it's the unstoppable force
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.120]  encounters the immovable object.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120]  Harrison Smith, weekday mornings
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.120]  8am, infowars.com
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120]  sports live show and stations across the country
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  for sure and follow Harrison Smith
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  and listen to his show. It's amazing. We'll come
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  back and talk more about how to stop World War 3. Thanks, Harrison.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120]  Call in.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.120]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.120]  And it is
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.120]  because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.120]  When we talk about the crew
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.120]  at infowars, people behind the scenes,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.120]  the researchers, the writers,
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.120]  they really have been
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.120]  the MVPs in this fight.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.120]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.120]  and the hard work they engage in
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.120]  every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week,
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.120]  it's really just incredible.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.120]  So for myself, the whole infowars crew,
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.120]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120]  I only encourage you now to realize
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.120]  that infowars cannot
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120]  stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.120]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.120]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it. But
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120]  most viewers and listeners never go to
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.120]  infowars.com and you never buy
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.120]  great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.120]  actually go buy products at infowars.com.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.120]  If just 1% more of you
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.120]  took action at infowars.com,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:19.120]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120]  Thank you.

[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.120]  Thank you very much.

[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.120]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:05.120]  Hi Alex. Welcome.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.120]  Hi Alex. Welcome.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:15.120]  One thing that Recruiting War is doing is basically draining us of all of our oil
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:21.120]  draining us of all of our munitions, our conventional munitions for our military
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:28.560]  they're losing all the conventional military munitions. And, uh, and I don't know, you
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.400]  know, Pope Vladimir Putin. I mean, I've read that he's good friends with Henry Kissinger.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.120]  He was a member of Paul Schwab's World Economic Forum and he very rarely missed a meeting
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:46.280]  at Davos. And, uh, so is, is this part of a bigger plan or is he really turned on him
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:53.320]  in fighting or what? I mean, I know he's been to the Davos scripts. That's one of the main
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:58.840]  centers of power. But I think legitimately China has split with the globalists at a certain
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:05.200]  level. And I think Russia really has split with them just in the policies. I don't lionize
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:11.200]  Putin. I don't think he's the hero here. But, uh, you know, the globalists, I believe are
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.920]  the ones that started this war and have been pushing it all along. And they're the ones
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.400]  that run our country and are attacking us and running us in the ground. And they're
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.000]  the ones that want to use a war like this to have a pretext to economically squeeze
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.160]  the American people. And so you, you, you, I mean, look at Biden draining the strategic
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.680]  oil reserve and giving it to China. And so with friends like that, you don't need enemies.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:39.400]  What do you think? Yeah, he's doing his share to try and put us in harm's way that, uh,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:44.440]  but one thing I do know just from history, that the fact that what Vladimir Putin's lost
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.840]  in the Ukraine is nothing. It's, it's about what they, they lost in the first couple
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.360]  weeks of Operation Barbarossa. If it's nothing, they, they said, all Russia's going to lose
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.080]  the war. Well, hey, that's nothing compared to what they lost in World War II, 29 million.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:05.000]  Yeah, I read it was a little over 20 million in Russia and 20 million in Germany. And the
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.240]  Germans won during the first year of Barbarossa, but then stopped at Stalingrad. And that became
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.520]  the main focal point of the war. And then about a year later, collapsed. And then there was
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:20.880]  the retreat back to, uh, Germany that took quite a while. And then of course you have
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:26.760]  the fall of Berlin and Hitler. I appreciate your call. Let's go to another caller on the
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:33.360]  same subject. Let's talk to Matt in Indiana. Matt, thanks for calling. You're on the air.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:40.200]  Hey, Alex. Good afternoon. 24 year military veteran whose career just culminated the
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.160]  last summer working for the chairman. Um, what I really wanted to talk about is, is
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:52.280]  what John Kelly or I'm sorry, Kilby's announcement indicated to me. And that's, uh, exactly
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:57.560]  what our founding fathers feared when the country was standing up. And that's the politicalization
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:02.280]  of the military. You can see the military starting to align its allegiance with the
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:07.800]  political party instead of safeguarding the country from, you know, enemies, foreign and
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.720]  domestic. And I think Sharon, just as we have the justice department captured by the Democrats,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:18.680]  now the Pentagon's going fully under them. It is Alex. And it's, it's troubling to see.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.920]  I served, um, underneath the chairman. I worked on the basement of the Pentagon. I'll leave
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.920]  it at that, uh, for several years. Um, but worked underneath the Trump administration
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.320]  as well, the Biden administration and saw how the DOD worked with the administration.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:40.360]  And it was a stark contrast on how we would, um, you know, keep the White House sit room
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.000]  in particular informed even, uh, conversations with the security council, just again, stark
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.680]  contrast. And it's sad to see, uh, I thought maybe it was just my, you know, parochial
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.960]  perspective working down there. But once I've gotten out of the military and, and, uh, seen
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.160]  how DOD interacts with the media, it's even worse than what I thought.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.200]  So you're saying it's fair to say that when you were in the Pentagon, obviously working
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:12.520]  in an area directly liaisoning with the White House, uh, you saw channels being controlled
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.280]  versus being carefully coordinated once Biden got in.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.240]  Yeah. Well, let me, let me share an anecdote with you, Alex. Um, and, and this is first
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:27.480]  person, this isn't hearsay. Uh, this was me working, um, down there and being directed
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.240]  for some of this stuff. So first I want to say that, uh, that I, I, I witnessed a, uh,
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.720]  a personal physical embrace between, um, you know, Susan Rice and the chairman, which really
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.800]  caught me off guard. And that was during, um, a, a Biden administration rehearsal for
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:48.400]  the inauguration and that one caught me off guard. So there was some, that kind of foreshadowed
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.640]  what the relationship was going to be now underneath the Trump administration. We were
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.840]  restricted from passing any information to the sit room and the security council directly.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.000]  And it had to go through the, um, the, um, uh, secretariat side. So, you know, through
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.800]  the sec def side, no direct, uh, DoD contact with the sit room or the security council.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.960]  Now once, once the Biden administration came in, we were actually crafting documents at
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:21.600]  the secret, no foreign level that were highlighting, you know, operation 72 hours out and sharing
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:28.160]  those firsthand with the administration. And it was again, I mean, I, that is a completely
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.760]  completely conflicts with how we were handling underneath the Trump administration.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.000]  So they weren't telling Trump about operations, but they are telling Biden, I remember Trump
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.960]  complaining that he started having to keep operations secret and compartmentalizing
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.560]  when he wanted to launch something, uh, because the word was he was getting sabotage.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:54.200]  Yeah. Uh, I don't know if I would go as, as far as to say sabotage, but I would certainly
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.040]  say that they were restricted to information. I, I would go as far as that way to sabotage
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.720]  the president if he's not being given information.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:07.360]  Alex, that's not for me to, to go to, uh, to that level, but, but that would, but that
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.840]  could be a perspective. Yes.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.600]  Well, you sound like a guy knows what he's talking about. Please enlighten us with more
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.080]  information, sir.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.840]  Well, I, so I do want now, I do want to say to all the listeners out there. So, um, you
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:27.360]  know, at the O six of the Colonel or Navy captain level and below, I think by and large
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.640]  they're patriots and they deeply care about the country. I think, I think there is somewhat
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:39.080]  of a, um, of a struggle over information and understanding what the truth is. And, and
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:44.280]  people want to deeply believe into their, you know, believe in the country and their
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:50.120]  leadership. Um, but once you start getting above that, uh, captain, uh, Colonel, you
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.480]  know, the, the O six level, um, they start to chase that ring of power. I kind of liken
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:03.680]  it to the ring of power in, and it's that, uh, uh, they start to get a little bit corrupted.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:09.360]  Not all of them, but, um, but there's a significant percentage. I think that, that, that very
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.640]  want, very much wants to please their political masters instead of serving the country that
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.160]  they pledged allegiance to.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.120]  Matt, you're a really informative caller. We've got to go to break, but do two minutes
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:25.200]  with me more on the other side, because I've got a few other questions or I want you to
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.160]  be able to talk about anything else that's obviously not secret or classified when we
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.400]  come back. But, but, but think about this for a moment. You mentioned, I mentioned a
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.680]  few examples of publicly where they brag. Don't worry. We're not telling Trump. We got
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.040]  them under control. I know that violates a whole bunch of laws, but where do you see
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:46.440]  that type of breaking away of the military into a political body? How do you see that
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.560]  ending or how could Congress or who is the group to try to reverse that in government
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:00.080]  or it's just public knowledge about it. It's going to be enough. We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.640]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.480]  it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.880]  at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:20.640]  been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:27.320]  hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.560]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.960]  you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you

[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.520]  viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:10.600]  war. InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago. And today, whether it's
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:17.680]  Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.960]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.480]  them. But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.480]  and power you and your immune system and your family as well. You can also make straight

[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:39.600]  But I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent. But every time you donate money, every time
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.560]  you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally non violently politically
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.880]  punching the new world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose. We are going
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.920]  to defeat the new world order. We're going over the top right now as a critical juncture.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:59.080]  So please go to InfoWarsTour.com and donate now, donate now, donate now, donate now.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:05.720]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist and minds famously said more
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:12.280]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.600]  kept saying he died decades before he did die. And it's the same PSYOP today. InfoWars
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.560]  is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because of the
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.120]  facts of what we've covered is coming true. But if they can convince you we've been shut
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.960]  down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.200]  spreading the word, then they do win. Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.120]  that could shut down InfoWars and that's you, the viewers and listeners. If you decide we're
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.040]  done, we're done. If you decide to go to InfoWarsTour.com and get supplements and books and films
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.400]  and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely. It is all in your
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.160]  hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists. Go to InfoWarsTour.com
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:00.640]  right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:19.080]  Getting your calls. A lot of great callers already. I can't imagine how amazing the others
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:25.160]  will be. Matt worked in the basement of the Pentagon directly with the chairman of the
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.760]  staff so he can specifically speak to what they're admitting that they're kind of their
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.160]  own group, ally with the Democrats now more and more. And they're now admitting that,
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.560]  I guess, just normalizing it with the permanent bureaucracy really setting up a form of bureaucratic
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:44.880]  elitist dictatorship. Just like Chuck E. Schumer said, the intelligence agencies have
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.560]  seven ways to Sunday or six ways from Sunday to get back at Trump. Just any other points
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:57.720]  you'd like to add and any ideas on how we can peacefully expose this and get back control
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:03.840]  of the military industrial complex from the deep state scientific technological elite
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:09.800]  that President Eisenhower warned us of. Yeah, excuse me, yeah, Alex, thank you
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:17.240]  for that. So talk to see us wrangling control back from the military industrial complex
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:24.760]  but my points are more centered on the actual military itself. And I think, you know, further
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.920]  downstream maybe that'll help influence the military industrial complex, but my big concern
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.880]  is the military. And that gets after the heart of kind of what John Kilby is alluding
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:41.440]  to publicly or nationally, you know, within the media. I think there's two key components
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:47.480]  to this mitigating strategy of this politicalization of the military. And again, that goes back
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.120]  to the founding fathers of this, their reluctance for this large standing army because they
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.520]  fought, you know, there was going to be some type of corruption or politicalization. And
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.440]  here we are, unfortunately, the two key components I'm talking about. The first one is congressional
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.200]  oversight. And I think we're starting to head down that path already. Of course, we know
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.680]  that all the senior military leaders are all, you know, they go through confirmation hearings.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:21.040]  So I think, you know, electing the right reps and senators, I think are key. Of course,
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:29.360]  your audience is already pushing for that anyway. So nothing new there. The second key component
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:36.440]  of this, and I think it's the most important really in this country for every issue. And
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:44.040]  that is public awareness and public action, because don't forget who puts those Congress
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:50.200]  people in office. And then also something that the military has been wielding. It has
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:58.600]  been, you know, their sort of power is positive public opinion. Well, now it's the sort of
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.120]  democles hanging over their head, because that may very well be the thing that brings
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.920]  them down is the public dissension as we're really watching the politicalization of the
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.920]  military.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.680]  Well, that was my next question for you. And I know you've got to go and I get other
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.920]  callers, but I'm glad you called fascinating stuff. So we appreciate your service to what's
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.400]  left of the Republic. You're still serving the Republic. Speaking out today as a citizen,
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.320]  you're right to do so. Look at the critical race theory. Look at the transgenderism. Look
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.400]  at all the wokeism. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know that would kill recruiting and drive
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.360]  out the best men and women. It's now done that. I know so many great people that have
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.520]  been in 10, 20, 25 years that got out. When they saw this, they just couldn't handle it.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.400]  Well, I kind of wish they would have stayed. I get why they left, but now they've only
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.200]  got that they're people that they want. They can continue the purge. A, do you agree? We've
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.840]  been seeing a type of purge of real Americans that actually know what's going on out of
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.000]  the military like we've seen in academia and media and everywhere else. And B, how do we
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.800]  paradoxically keep good people in the military when we can't blame them for leaving because
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:11.480]  this becomes so globalist? Yeah. So I've struggled with that, Alex, for years. Yeah. So I saw
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:21.520]  almost kind of like a sabotage of, you know, of people, of patriots. And I think the culture
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:27.080]  that they're creating in the military now really isn't this. I wouldn't call it it's
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:35.680]  not servant, but I think it's you're creating bins of people this, you know, this ideology.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:41.760]  It's, you know, this is the gay group. This is the, you know, black group. This is the
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.040]  Asian group. This is the white group. It's Americans that have a code and something we
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:53.280]  stand for. Now we're part of an ideology that the Democrats control. Right, right, right.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.480]  So they create those fragments in the military community and then they start labeling things,
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.960]  you know, like, I mean, I've been in trouble. I've been called into the, you know, my commanding
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.560]  officer's office one time because I had talked about, you know, maybe seeking Christ as a
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:15.960]  way to stop so much suicide in the military. I actually got called into my boss's office
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:23.440]  because I had, because I said that and I was like, this is insane. And, and let's see,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:33.440]  Fred, oh, pro-life, pro-life people actually on that, the latest round of, of briefings
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  that we received were, were violent extremists. There we go. So a pro-life group would be
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.440]  a violent extremist.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.040]  Well, we just saw the Justice Department secret memos saying the main domestic threat, and
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:50.680]  they say the main threat is our own people, which is a lie, is the conservative traditional
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.960]  Catholics. And so here's a clip from a year ago with a young woman in the military, and
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.800]  I guess it's the army, talking about how she's spoiling for a fight with the American people.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.800]  Here's the clip.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.080]  Understand that if active duty military actually get deployed within the United States, that
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.800]  weapon is not just pointed at other people, other countries. It's pointed at you. If you
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.200]  do not get in your house when I tell you to, you become the enemy, martial law.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.920]  And that's not taken out of context. It's like a five minute clip. There's a boil down.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.720]  You probably saw that, Matt, but, but I see a lady like that as the problem or swallows
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.640]  well, saying we'll use nukes on American gun owners. And we see statements about Biden
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:35.240]  about using, you know, F 18s of the American people. I mean, they're really pushing a culture
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.880]  of a government and a military and a Justice Department that occupies America. That seems
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.960]  to me like the quickest way to turn the people against the government.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.960]  Yeah, it is Alex. It is. But it, but so what they're doing is anyone who would really identify
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.600]  or empathize with, with public America, to your point, seems to be being pushed out of
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:00.120]  the military. And then if you look at, you'd mentioned the military industrial complex,
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.800]  look where all of the money in research and development science and technology is going
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:10.720]  into right now, it's going into automation. So, so, you know, the military is looking
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:19.120]  at mass, how do we do this mosaic warfare? And it's effectively going back to, you know,
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:25.080]  just creating mass. And, well, it's not going to be with people, is it? Right? Because we
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.120]  can't even meet our recruiting.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.880]  Sure. So they deliberately sabotage the human military that's so much better than just
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:35.960]  a pure machine military from so many aspects, because the machines will follow illegal orders.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.200]  That's one reason globalists want it. So they're just deliberately spiking the former human
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:45.640]  weapon, spiking the cannon, the age of humans is over, and they're just beginning the demoralization
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.640]  and breakup of the human military.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.240]  Alex, it breaks my heart to admit that, but I, but that's the only logical reason I can
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.240]  see for this.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:01.560]  Wow. Powerful, Matt. Anytime you can get through, we love it. We won't share your number with
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.840]  anybody. We'll probably lose it and never even call you. But we like to get particularly
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.960]  smart callers on again, sometimes. So I'm going to put you on hold. If you'd like to
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.720]  give us your number, we'd love to have you back on as somebody to give us your view on
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.320]  the situation, because I've not been in the military, but I've been studying it for 30
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.680]  years. This is interesting. And I can say that guy knows what he's talking about. Now,
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.800]  I don't normally spend 15 minutes with a caller, but we had to. Speaking of another caller who's
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.080]  been calling in for 15 years or so, Carlos in Canada seems really smart. He gave us his
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.680]  curricula vitae. He's a very well known guy in Canada. So a lot of things in government
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.200]  and corporations and he's on public with his name here before he got in on the line, but
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.200]  I can't do 15 minutes with him. Even though he's a great caller, I got to get to everybody
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.120]  else as promised because who knows where their incredible callers are, are, are waiting
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.200]  there lurking lovingly on the phone lines. We'll go to break them back. Please remember

[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.200]  us again. So we can collectively promote freedom together, but I can't do it without you. We

[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.060]  In full wars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:06.700]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, maitre media told
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.580]  you, but it's not true.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:10.660]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:12.780]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:13.780]  None of that's true.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.100]  It's all being appealed.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:19.660]  They want you to think in full wars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support in full
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:24.100]  wars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.700]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:30.220]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:34.700]  Go to infoworkstore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts,
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.700]  you name it.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:39.380]  They fund the info war and empower your life and let the globalists know their sigh up
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.380]  has not worked.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.060]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:48.140]  Take action at infowarstore.com today because the only people that can take us off the air
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.460]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.820]  The majority of you have not been sidelined, but some of you have.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:55.820]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:59.020]  Go to infowarstore.com and keep us on the air.
[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:01.180]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.980]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:05.180]  This is an information war.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:10.980]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:17.700]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:21.940]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.940]  them.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:26.620]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:29.420]  power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:34.220]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com clicking on the big red banner, a one time
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.020]  report or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:40.460]  We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:44.260]  time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:48.420]  world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.300]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.900]  We're going over the top, but right now is a critical juncture.
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:47:01.020]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:13.580]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:18.060]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show, continuing with your very informative phone calls, hearing
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.740]  about 30 seconds, but I want to make this really chilling point.
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:28.860]  The last caller and I were just discussing the slow motion cultural political coup over
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:34.660]  all of America's institutions directed by the scientific technocrats and they are busy
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:40.060]  and they're very close to controlling the U.S. military right now and they've adopted
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:46.380]  the mission that the main enemy is the American people and that needs to be held in high contempt.
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:50.980]  That needs to be exposed in Congress, exposed in the media, exposed by us and we need to
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:56.980]  rally behind those that are exposing this criminal activity, but this is a coup.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:59.380]  A globalist bureaucratic coup.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:04.140]  And so when you talk about who's really powerful, the Davos group is the spokesman or PR firm
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:09.620]  of these people, one of them, but the real power is the U.S. bureaucracy and the military
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:14.980]  that we paid for now being used against us and we just have to be honest about that.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:17.700]  Carlos in Canada wants to talk about the same subject.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.700]  Carlos, thanks for calling.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.780]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:27.300]  I was reminded hearing the great call you just had of, I think President Truman was
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:32.500]  not supposed to win, they even thought that Dewey was going to be the next president and
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:36.140]  it was newspaper, printed or something could be released.
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:42.260]  The same thing happened when Trump was not supposed to win the presidency in 2016 and
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:48.180]  they had a magazine ready for Clinton, Hillary Clinton to be president.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:55.060]  The fact is that it's worthy of Seymour Hirsch to actually write a book on this because the
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:02.180]  betrayal of the presidency by the Republican Party and the Democratic Party was almost
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:08.420]  a collusion between these two powers who didn't want this man, President Trump, elected by
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:11.540]  the majority of the people to be president.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:17.980]  And therefore you had a long story, but you know, Nancy Pelosi tearing up a speech after
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:22.140]  it, but at the State of the Union address, I mean, how disrespectful is that?
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:28.460]  And you had all of the information from Senator McCain saying, oh, don't give him any intelligence,
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:35.300]  or keep him in the dark, you know, like a mushroom, you know, feed him garbage.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:41.220]  And he was being essentially, even in the CIA during the assassination or the killing
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:47.660]  of Soleimani in Iran, which could have been a cause of belly, a cause for world war,
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:52.940]  the CIA, Pompeo, kept him pretty well, you know, part of the outside.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:59.300]  And the brother of the prince of Saudi Arabia shows up in the White House to tell the president
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:03.900]  of the United States, unannounced, here I am, we got to stop this because we're at the
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.860]  edge of war.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:11.340]  I mean, the president of the United States was literally left aside.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:16.980]  And at the end, obviously, this respectfully all the way to January the 6th.
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.460]  Now, what am I going to tell you?
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.940]  This is very, very sad because you've got to examine the democratic process in the United
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.700]  States at the highest levels.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.060]  How can the Supreme Court come to a decision when you've got the Senate and the Congress
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.860]  conspiring against the president?
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:34.260]  And remember what Biden just said last year when the Supreme Court overturned all their
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:38.100]  greenhouse gas garbage, manning coal plants, the only put out carbon dioxide?
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:40.260]  He just said, we're going to ignore that.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:42.540]  And they said, we were probably going to ignore the Roe v. Wade.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:48.900]  But since you mentioned the Dewey Beats Truman famous newspaper headline the crew found and
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.020]  put on screen, they did the same thing again.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.660]  As you mentioned 2016, they already pre-printed hundreds of thousands of news weeks saying
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:00.780]  Hillary Clinton has won the presidency, her historic march to the White House, and how
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.580]  she won the White House.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:07.220]  These people are not all powerful is the point, and especially when they're identified.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:14.740]  Exactly, and how the Photoshop, the attendance to Hillary's rallies, et cetera, I mean it
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.300]  was like the media was compliant and so on with it.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.180]  Look, it's very, very serious.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:24.860]  We have to remember it goes all the way back correctly to JF Kennedy.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.860]  It goes all the way back before that.
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:29.900]  You're absolutely right, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:32.900]  And even if the deep state at that time had its reasons to kill Kennedy, I don't agree
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:37.500]  with it, they become a permanent imperium and become more and more corrupt, and you've
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:38.500]  seen that.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:42.700]  And they're using leftist ideology as a weapon to destroy the country.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:46.980]  Yeah, get woke, go broke, well a country gets woke, it goes broke, that's the plan.
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.220]  So they consolidate power.
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:56.020]  Jewel in Ohio, thank you for calling on the situation in Ohio with the Palestine, Ohio
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.020]  derailment.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.020]  What's your view on that?
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.020]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:07.500]  I grew up in East Palestine, and I currently lived just about 40 miles west, but my parents
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:08.820]  still live there.
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:15.860]  My father was in the evacuation zone, and the EPA, the railroad, everybody is lying
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.340]  about what's really going on in that town.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.340]  So...
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:24.580]  I mean, what's your view on what's really going on?
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:28.100]  My view is that it's extremely unsafe.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:33.540]  The EPA is going around testing houses, saying that everything is safe, however, independent
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:35.580]  testing is coming back with higher levels.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:41.260]  Yeah, just like with Fukushima, just like with Chernobyl, just like with 9-11, they
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.580]  lie to us as a default position.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:48.220]  Correct, and then they said that they only needed to evacuate one mile, and they did
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.980]  that based on a different chemical.
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:56.300]  People are confusing like the PVC with vinyl chloride, and they did it within one mile
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.980]  driving instead of as the crow flies.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.980]  Incredible.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:02.540]  It's just an excuse to get people away from it.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:09.580]  It is, and I have friends that have fifth generation farms, and they have film coming
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:14.180]  up on top of their ponds where their cattle and their horses drink.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:15.900]  Animals are dying all over the place.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.420]  All the fish in our creeks are dead.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:18.420]  It's just...
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:19.420]  I'm heart sick.
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:24.300]  Well, I'm really sorry this has happened, and Buddha judge is up giving speeches laughing.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:25.540]  I think you should be removed.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.540]  He's a train wreck himself.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:31.340]  Do they even know how the derailment happened?
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:37.780]  So there is some security footage from a few towns over where you can see the axles of
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.900]  the train were already on fire at least 20 miles away from East College.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.660]  Yeah, that's what I was seeing the media say.
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:45.460]  I just wanted to know if you had some other information.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.660]  I'm so sorry for what's happened.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.660]  We're all in this together.
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.660]  God bless you.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:49.660]  Jewel.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:51.660]  Another caller, Chad N'Ohio, on the same subject.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.660]  Chad, give me a sure view.
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.660]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:56.660]  How are you?
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.140]  I just really freaked out.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:59.140]  I got four children.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.180]  I live in this planet with you, and it's just we got crazy people running things.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.180]  That's true.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:08.380]  Before I get to Ohio, I just want to say, you know, talking about, you know, politicians
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:13.500]  in this new world order, it's not to take the power away from any one person.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.060]  It's to take the power away from us as God-fearing individuals.
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.900]  They want to take your soul.
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.060]  They don't care about your boat.
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:22.780]  They don't care about who's in the White House.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.220]  They want your mind.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:25.220]  They want your soul.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:29.340]  They want you to live in fear, and they want you to be a soul afraid that you'll follow
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.780]  by anything else to be said.
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:36.900]  And that's not, and everything else, it doesn't matter who's in what office.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:41.700]  Trump was great, but they still tried to do the same things when he was in there, and
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:43.100]  the games will always continue.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:47.900]  It was a trust in one thing, trust in the Lord, and that's all you can do.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:50.740]  I 100% agree with you.
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:56.580]  So, but moving on to Ohio, I'm just moved to Ohio from New York City about two years
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.580]  ago.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:07.020]  I live about 45 miles away from due west, from Palestine, and I have two young children,
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.020]  and I'm not going to lie.
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.020]  I'm a little bit worried.
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:16.460]  I know that I have guys covering over my family, but any type of like recommendations for precautions
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.660]  what you to look out for, because we're giving you a-
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.860]  And I got to tell you, if you're downwind from this, I would think it would be smart
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:26.740]  to leave for a couple of months if you've got a family where you can go.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:30.620]  God protects us, but God gives us a brain to use, and then I would go off local groups
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:32.380]  that are testing the food and water.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:37.340]  Unfortunately, it's winter, which is fortunately, but unfortunately, throughout the summer,
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:41.020]  you probably won't be able to trust a lot of the produce that's downwind from this
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:45.060]  for a while, let it be thrown out, and I think that's up for farmers to be conscientious
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:49.740]  and admit that there should be a fund established and government direction to get rid of it.
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:53.420]  But of course, the government instead is telling you it's all safe and wonderful, and go ahead
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.860]  and eat the food, so that's my recommendation.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.020]  God bless you, sir, and I appreciate your great point about they want our souls.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:00.020]  They want our souls.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:01.700]  There's a song we used to play.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:02.700]  I haven't heard it in years.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.940]  I forget who does it, but it's like, they want your soul, or we want your soul.
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:07.940]  Get a car.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.940]  Get a loan.
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:09.940]  Get us other sets.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:10.940]  I mean, we'll find that song if you can.
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:13.060]  I want to play it coming in at six after next hour.
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:15.180]  David in Ohio, got about a minute and a half.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:16.180]  Thanks for calling.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:17.180]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:18.180]  Retired Railroad individual.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:19.180]  What's your view on this?
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:20.180]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.180]  Got a good connection now?
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:22.180]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180]  Okay.
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:31.940]  First off, as for the infrastructure, I want to remind everybody that the railroads are
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:34.540]  fully responsible for all of their infrastructure.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:39.580]  The equipment, the roadbed, the ties to rails, it's not tax money.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:44.220]  So infrastructure stuff, yeah, I guess they give some stuff for Amtrak, but basically
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:48.020]  all the stuff is the responsibility of the railroad.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:52.620]  Now, I'm kind of leaning towards the sabotage.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:57.020]  I never worked for North Fork Southern, but as railroads go, now-
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.020]  Hold on.
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.020]  Don't hang up, David.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]  This is too important to call.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.020]  Stay there.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:03.380]  We know Antifun, the left, have been sabotaging infrastructure.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.380]  I want to hear from your expert point of view why that's the case.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:07.380]  Don't hang up.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:08.380]  It's only a two-minute break.
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:12.660]  And right back to David, retired railroader on the other side, then we'll continue with
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:18.580]  all the other calls on a bunch of other subjects that the order received, James in Oklahoma,
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:24.780]  Jeff in South Carolina, Max in Wisconsin, Bart in Georgia, and everybody else that the
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:30.340]  order your calls are received from the UFO shoot-downs to war with Russia, to all the
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:34.820]  rest of the garbage going on, to our mainstream media promoting suicide for children.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:38.500]  It's all coming up next hour, and we have a special guest who's been brought up in these
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:42.820]  congressional hearings about big tech spying and censorship popping in as well.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:48.460]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:51.300]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:57.100]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going

[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:15.900]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:15.420]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:22.260]  All right, some big news just broke today, it's just now getting traction, we learned
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:25.860]  about it about an hour ago, but it was coming any day now.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:31.940]  The Jeffrey Epstein files have dropped, they're on m4warstore.com as we speak, it's being posted.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:35.500]  So I'll have to hit a little bit of that, not half to, but I don't really want to get
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.900]  into it until I've had time to go over it.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:43.300]  So you can bet that I've got crew and researchers and writers going through this list right now
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:44.740]  and searching it.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:48.580]  This is the list of the clients, the whole nine yards they've been suppressing, it's
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:54.580]  a big deal because this is the deep state and how they control people.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:01:03.980]  Going back to David in Ohio, David, you are on the air, you were going to finish up getting
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:09.020]  into believing it could be sabotaged as a railroad.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:14.660]  The North Fork Southern, when it comes to operations for the maintenance of their equipment,
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:20.660]  their roadbed, and for the safety of the employees, North Fork Southern has always been the cops
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:22.740]  in the United States.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:29.420]  So now Harrison was talking before about the hot box detector and so was the previous caller.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:35.420]  If you have a hot box detector go off on the side of the train, there's usually radio communications
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:39.420]  with the engineer, he has a condition, he has a hot box.
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:44.820]  If he slams on the brakes, it will cut the wheel off and that will cause a derailment.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:50.420]  So if that was the case, then the engineer would have a choice.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:55.560]  Now you've got Pittsburgh there, you've got Youngstown, he might have slowed the train
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:03.580]  down to a less populated area, too bad for the Palestinians, but he probably tried to
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:07.740]  get the train to a place where it was less populated.
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:12.420]  And so it would either be that way or, like I said, the sabotage.
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:20.180]  The North Fork Southern has always been the best for every category on railroads.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:30.260]  Now as for the CEOs of North Fork Southern, you started with North Fork Southern as a
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.180]  breakman and you work your way up.
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:39.580]  You have full understanding of the operations as opposed to other railroads like the famous
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:43.540]  CEO of CSX, John Snow, the US Treasurer.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:49.620]  He was a lawyer, never touched a railroad car engine in his life.
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:57.820]  The Oracle of Omaha was the Burlington Northern, you know, he's never had any railroad experience.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:01.100]  They attack railroading in a different way than the North Fork Southern.
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:05.740]  But North Fork Southern has always been an operational excellence railroad.
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:10.300]  And I have never worked for them, I'm just telling you.
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:12.900]  So you're seeing some anomalies.
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:19.700]  Yeah, like I said, at that hop, the engineer would probably be aware of it, the dispatcher
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:24.580]  would have been aware of it, and he might have taken the train to a less populated area.
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:31.340]  But with North Fork Southern, I'm kind of leaning towards sabotage more than anything else.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:33.100]  Well we know we're seeing a lot of sabotage.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:37.540]  Our own government cut off our biggest pipeline, the Keystone Pipeline, and then blew up the
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:39.260]  Russian Pipeline and so much more.
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:42.620]  So these guys are like a pack of gremlins.
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:46.860]  So I'd have to say we have to investigate what you're saying.
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:47.860]  Okay.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:52.020]  Oh, can I say something about your sales?
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:59.580]  I love the, Alex Jones was right sale, and I always thought maybe you should, you know,
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:02.380]  all these things that come across the news.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:05.740]  And two or three days later, we always forget.
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:10.300]  And you know, like your Christmas sale, the Easter sale, the Good Friday, why not the
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:15.540]  Hunter Laptop sale, the Chinese Balloon sale, you know, something that you think is important.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.540]  I agree.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.540]  So let's focus attention.
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:18.540]  You're a genius.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.540]  And I agree with you.
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:20.540]  Thank you so much, David.
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:25.900]  All right, here's what's going on.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:31.060]  I have a guest censored massively who's been reported on in Congress and all the big tech
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.860]  surveillance and spy has been going on and how, and she's got a lawsuit against them
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.820]  is moving forward.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:39.740]  And I'm going to still have her on, but this, this Epstein thing is just got me like a deer
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:42.380]  in the headlights because I am really wanting to read it.
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:43.380]  I'm wanting to cover it.
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:49.060]  It's posted in the live show feed and it's being posted as his own article at info wars.com.
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:53.580]  But we need to get all the riders on this searching the key names and getting barbs out
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:54.980]  because this is the secret list.
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:55.980]  They didn't want to be released.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:57.980]  This is a big deal, right here.
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:03.500]  Well, I think one of the things that I have died for is amazing.
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:05.820]  I'm 45 and I have a bit.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:09.380]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.

[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:35.380]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:39.980]  It's time to wheel the blade.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:43.260]  The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:54.100]  Well, Steve's a ride to come to take your life out of the dead of night.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.660]  See the horsemen ride.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:59.300]  So choose your fate and die.
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.300]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:07.300]  You've been dying since the day you were born.
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:24.820]  All right, it's kind of hard to not clear the decks right now and cover this, but I
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:30.180]  want all hands on deck with all our writers, all our researchers start going over this.
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:35.420]  It just popped up an hour or so ago on Mike Cernovich's Twitter.
[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:38.380]  He's a lawyer, great source of information.
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:44.140]  And they said last week, AP Fox News, all of them that sometime this week, the court
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:45.420]  said they were going to release it.
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:47.420]  Well, it just got released.
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:49.100]  There's no news articles about it yet.
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:50.980]  I'm sure there will be in minutes.
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:57.420]  We posted the live show feed and it's being posted on the front page of info wars.com.
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:02.980]  And we were having some trouble the last hour getting the weird PDF to be embedded in the
[02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:03.980]  article.
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:04.980]  I don't care about that.
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:05.980]  I don't mind.
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:14.140]  Jeffrey Epstein client list released despite deep state's best efforts, the holy grail
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:18.420]  of the deep state control mechanism now public.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:19.420]  I mean, something like that.
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:20.860]  And we'll just have the tweet there.
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:21.860]  Everybody can find it.
[02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:27.020]  It's in the live show feed on info wars.com where you can find it posted right there.
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.020]  But we need it.
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:30.620]  Just a big article on info wars.com with the links to it.
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:31.740]  Get it out now.
[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:37.740]  I am very strongly considering, yeah, I need to reset my brain.
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:40.980]  I'm going to rebroadcast for a little bit here, just like I just can't have something
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:42.860]  like this and not be looking at it.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:46.580]  We got Laura Lumer coming on and I really appreciate her.
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:51.220]  But let's back her up another segment into the callers.
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:52.220]  I respect you.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:53.220]  You're amazing callers.
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:57.740]  But I've, this is just unbelievable.
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:59.340]  I mean, I can't wait.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:06.220]  And I got reading glasses last year and I just can't stand wearing the things.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:10.780]  But maybe like an old man have a big magnifying glass like my grandfather had.
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:18.060]  But I've got the crew digging through all of these right now.
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:24.740]  And if I had kind of a choking moment here on air, it's just, this is, this is so important
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:29.300]  to bring down the deep state, how they control people, but these wicked pedophiles have done
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.300]  it.
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:33.780]  And this is out of his little black book.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.580]  This is released by the court.
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:45.460]  It's what the system is fought to not release.
[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:51.260]  And this is how that monster for Israeli intelligence and other intelligence groups was controlling
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:53.740]  so many people.
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:56.740]  Wow.
[02:09:56.740 --> 02:10:00.940]  And I'm told more documents are on the way as well.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:07.500]  But this appears to be a flight log, never saying that we're going to release the black
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:08.500]  book.
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.580]  So I'm going to do this.
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:13.940]  I'm going to get eyes on what's going on here.
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:15.460]  And then we'll come back.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:23.740]  Let's go ahead and, yeah, that's too long.
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:35.260]  I want Tucker Carlson, clip, sex, go ahead and roll that.
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.020]  We don't want to second guess anybody.
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:41.140]  We've got to assume everybody involved was doing their best under a highly stressful
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:42.140]  situation.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:44.140]  But did you see that mushroom cloud?
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:45.140]  That was caused on purpose.
[02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:48.260]  And maybe there's a good reason to get no second guessing.
[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:55.580]  But what it means is those clouds of toxic smoke flew up and out.
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:58.420]  And that toxic smoke almost immediately began killing animals.
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.420]  Dead fish washed up on shore.
[02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:05.300]  As one hazardous materials specialist put it, we basically nuked a town with chemicals.
[02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:09.740]  So then representatives from the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, arrived
[02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:11.260]  to restore calm.
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:16.220]  Yes, an EPA spokesman explained chemicals from the derail train did enter the local
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:19.460]  watershed, and yes, they did kill fish.
[02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:24.060]  But the drinking water supply remains totally safe.
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:29.020]  The fish are dead, but go ahead and fill your thermos and brew some coffee.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:30.020]  Everything's fine.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:35.020]  Now, we don't know if the locals in East Palestine are drinking the water tonight, but we can
[02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:39.940]  tell you the Biden administration doesn't seem too concerned about it either way.
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:45.780]  Donald Trump got over 71% of the vote in the county in the last presidential election.
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:48.780]  That's not exactly the Democratic Party's core demographic.
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:51.980]  Fentanyl, toxic waste spill, whatever.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.380]  They're not our voters.
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:57.680]  And by the way, what does a chemical spill have to do with climate change?
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.180]  If you can't use it to sell solar panels, it's not really an environmental disaster.
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:04.900]  That's the rule in Washington.
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:08.500]  So no one in the Biden administration bothered to issue warnings to communities that might
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:14.860]  be in the path of those toxic mushroom clouds you saw floating up from the train wreck.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.500]  Because no one cared enough to do that.
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:21.700]  Pete Buttigieg is the official who's supposed to be in charge of our transportation infrastructure.
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:25.700]  Technically, he's the transportation secretary.
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:29.580]  At an appearance today, he seemed to have no idea that there was a train derailment in
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:31.500]  East Palestine, Ohio.
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.020]  His real concern, he explained, is that we have too many damn white construction workers
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:38.020]  in this country.
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:43.940]  We have heard way too many stories from generations past of infrastructure where you got a neighborhood,
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:47.460]  often a neighborhood of color that finally sees the project come to them, but everyone
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:53.020]  in the hard hats on that project looking like, you know, doing the good paying jobs don't
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:55.500]  look like they came from anywhere near the neighborhood.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.460]  Yeah, that's the problem, Mayor Pete.
[02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:00.540]  Too many white guys in hard hats.
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:03.060]  Why didn't we realize this before?
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.700]  We built all this infrastructure that's now crumbling.
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:10.820]  It's actually not funny, and future historians will marvel at just how much damage one incompetent
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:16.220]  narcissist can cause when he's elevated to a serious job like transportation secretary.
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:21.900]  Here's a guy who could not on a bet, who could not at gunpoint change his own tire, who oversees
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:28.700]  our roads, railways and airports, all of which are crumbling from mismanagement and neglect.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:34.860]  And not just from mismanagement and neglect, but also from actual acts of sabotage.
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:40.460]  Over the last two years, the FBI has investigated more than 40 cases of rail sabotage in Washington
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:42.700]  state alone, in one state.
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:47.260]  Now, a lot of those attacks involve so-called shunt devices, those are wires stretched between
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:51.740]  tracks that interfere with the train's electrical signals and cause derailments.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:56.260]  In one incident, just before Christmas in 2020, a shunt caused a train to derail in
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:57.700]  Custer, Washington.
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:03.460]  That train spilled 30,000 gallons of crude oil and forced locals to evacuate their homes.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:08.380]  Well, that's not the environmental disaster that Joe Biden talks about, because of course
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:11.900]  he can't buy solar panels from the Chinese to fix it.
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:15.620]  But it was, objectively speaking, an act of terrorism.
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:20.300]  The interesting thing is, very often, in fact in the majority of cases, people who commit
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:24.860]  acts of terrorism against infrastructure, whoever they are, are never punished and the
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:27.460]  ones who are caught aren't really punished.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:32.420]  One woman who tried to destroy trains using a shunt got out of jail after only a year.
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:37.660]  Oh, so no one's paying any attention and no one really seems to care, because what does
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:41.220]  that have to do with the environmental racism and climate?
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:45.300]  And possibly as a result of that attitude, there are an awful lot of train derailments
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:47.900]  in this country, many more than you may realize.
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:52.220]  In the last calendar year, more than a thousand trains went off the tracks in the United States.
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:54.940]  Well, how's that for a metaphor?
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.820]  Just today, two more trains derailed.
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:00.180]  One of them was in South Carolina and one was in Texas near Houston.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:05.860]  The train near Houston was also carrying hazardous materials, as so many trains are.
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:07.860]  What's going on here, exactly?
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:17.860]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:25.860]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:50.860]  Good lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:15:50.860 --> 02:16:02.620]  I have an extremely important mess to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:04.820]  States and around the world.
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:09.420]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.
[02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:14.820]  It turns out the top company in the U.S. for supplements is owned by a patriot and it turns
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:18.700]  out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to
[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:21.300]  support Info Wars and keep us on the air.
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:24.500]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:25.500]  market.
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:30.780]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands are the highest rated under the Info

[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:58.700]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps Info Wars on the air, Info Wars MD.
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:03.100]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:08.100]  fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:12.100]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:17.460]  war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarStore.com right now and taking action.
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:21.260]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:25.940]  only your commitment to keep Info Wars on the air will ensure our victory against the
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:26.940]  new world order.
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:30.780]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me, they're coming for the children
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:33.460]  but to get to the children they've got to get through us first.
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:36.980]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies, they're
[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:41.260]  already given to the pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart, 80 plus percent increase
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:45.860]  in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:51.020]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us, let's do it together.
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:55.500]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com and the fight continues with your financial support
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:18:24.100]  at InfoWarsStore.com now take action now.
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:30.500]  By the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's InfoWars and our audience
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:35.940]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.960]  This is why they attack us.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:44.580]  This is why we need your support because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:50.420]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the links.
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:58.300]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:03.340]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the Wellness
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.340]  Company.
[02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:08.380]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company, I contribute
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:12.580]  with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:18.300]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:19.940]  features natto kinase.
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:22.380]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:27.940]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:28.940]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:32.820]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:33.940]  the vaccines.
[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:36.300]  People are lower with the spike protein, they don't feel well.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:38.340]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:40.980]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:43.980]  So does ibermectin and now natto kinase.
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:45.580]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:51.580]  Natural substances in a sense combating this manmade disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:55.260]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:59.860]  it's important you didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:16.140]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:21.260]  About four or five days ago, Fox News, CNN, AP, all of them reported they were going to
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:25.140]  release Jeffrey Epstein's, the court, his client list and more.
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:30.140]  It's a 2000 plus page document and I wanted to go to those clips I was already going to
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:34.620]  play during the show so I could go check it and make sure.
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:37.500]  A lot of this looks like it's old info, but it's going to be the full file, it's going
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:40.860]  to be some of the stuff that was already out, like the flight logs that came out a few years
[02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:41.860]  ago.
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:46.180]  It does look like there's new stuff in here and notes to Epstein and some of his clients
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:50.500]  calling him and things, but I'm not going to say what the internet was saying that this
[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:57.060]  is the big data dump until we've proven it is and so I'm going to change the headlines
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:21:01.100]  to is this the data dump, is this all we're getting and just move on from there and then
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:04.820]  I'll have time once I'm off air to go research it and then I'll obviously be popping in on
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:10.620]  the one shorter show if indeed this is it, but there's no way to analyze 2000 plus pages
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:13.900]  of this here while we're live on air.
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:14.900]  So just look for that.
[02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:18.780]  Plus we already know what they did, we understand it, but it's obviously going to be those lists
[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:23.940]  that are so incredibly important and that's the problem with a live show is this stuff
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:30.540]  just comes in so fast, there is no way to be able to digest it all, it's like trying
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:36.420]  to eat an elephant with a tiny little baby fork, one person, it's going to take some
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:37.420]  time.
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:40.980]  The good news is, just like the WikiLeaks, if indeed this is the big data dump that was
[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:46.740]  supposedly coming today or tomorrow, we'll be able to analyze it and go over all of it
[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:51.460]  because the Internet itself will fair it through it all and find the most important parts.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:54.460]  That's how they tried to claim Hunter Biden wasn't real because it was tens of thousands
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:59.620]  of pages and thousands of photos and videos, it turned out it was all real, but people
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:03.580]  were concerned that other people could insert fake stuff in there to try to discredit it
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:09.540]  all and they did try some of that, that's kind of what Carl Rove did to Dan Rather
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:16.660]  on the whole Iraq invasion, 2003, those documents 99% of them were real, but Carl Rove bragged
[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:20.500]  how they put this info into it to be able to then discredit it.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:25.140]  Same thing happened with PizzaGate and WikiLeaks, 99% of it was real, but then the media focused
[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:28.500]  on parts that had been put out that weren't real to try to discredit the whole thing,
[02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:35.300]  so that's one of the main tactics they used, but what we do know now is that in hindsight,
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:39.380]  the deep state when Obama left office did put in stay behind groups of billions of dollars
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:44.980]  to block Trump's agenda and to spy on and to censor the opposition to the globalists
[02:22:44.980 --> 02:22:51.660]  here in America and chief amongst those targeted and demonized was myself, Laura Loomer, Paul
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:56.260]  Watson, Gabb McGinnis, and Lewis Faircott of all people, 12 people they said were dangerous
[02:22:56.260 --> 02:23:01.060]  individuals and that, quote, violence could be called for against us on the official Facebook
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:05.020]  policies page, which they admitted was real, but later withdrew, so it shows where they
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:06.020]  want to go.
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.420]  Laura Loomer filed a lawsuit, was it last year before that, I forget she's here to join
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:14.580]  us, and it's now being discussed in Congress, it's in the hearings, and it's moving forward
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:18.180]  and got the deep state really, really, really concerned, it was Laura and I four years ago
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:22.660]  repeatedly at Congress pointing all this out and being laughed at, you had the one Congressman,
[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:30.580]  looks like Porky Pig doing the whole auctioneer voice talking over her, remember all of that,
[02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:33.380]  well now the chickens are coming home to roost with the incredible hearings that happened
[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:38.060]  last week, so Laura Loomer completely vindicated, joins us now to talk about her suit and why
[02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:41.900]  it affects every American, Laura, you're the expert on this, you're living it, you're
[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:46.740]  right in the middle of it, you've again been validated, lay out all these important points
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:47.740]  for folks.
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:54.500]  Well, thanks so much for having me on Alex, happy Valentine's Day and happy belated birthday
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:58.580]  to you, I know you just had a birthday this weekend, so hopefully everybody will send
[02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:02.900]  you some nice birthday wishes.
[02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:08.460]  We have been vindicated, I remember and when I posted my happy birthday message to you,
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:13.500]  I posted my favorite picture that we ever took together and that's of course when Jack
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:18.580]  Dorsey was trying to be whisked away outside of the congressional hearing in DC, it's an
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:23.900]  epic photograph, it's going to be in the history book someday and it's you being held back
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:30.060]  by a bodyguard confronting Jack Dorsey for lying in front of Congress and then of course
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:35.900]  as you mentioned, I had confronted Jack Dorsey during the congressional hearing and then
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:41.300]  you can see my pink selfie stick on the far right corner there, but yeah, look, I've been
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:46.740]  filing a lot of lawsuits against these big tech social media giants and the most recent
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:54.700]  case that I filed was in May of 2022 and this was a RICO case against Facebook and Twitter,
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:25:00.940]  Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, Procter and Gamble and it has also been amended to include
[02:25:00.940 --> 02:25:08.100]  the FBI as well or agents within the FBI since we now know that individuals within the FBI
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:13.020]  and other federal government agencies were colluding, right?
[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:18.500]  They've been colluding with these big tech social media giants on a private cloud server
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:22.900]  called JIRA, they've been communicating in other ways as well as these hearings revealed
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:27.380]  through private briefings to not only just surveil Americans but to really illegally
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:32.660]  interfere in our elections and so it's organized crime.
[02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:36.740]  You and I and others have been referring to big tech as a mafia because that's exactly
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:42.620]  how they operate and just like people like Rudy Giuliani utilized RICO, Racketeering Influence
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:48.300]  Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 to break up the mob and the mafia, that's exactly what
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:50.100]  we need to do with big tech.
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:56.220]  We need to have a RICO case and we need charges, these individuals need to be charged for their
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:03.260]  crimes and Elon Musk himself when he bought Twitter, he paid $44 billion for a crime scene
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:08.980]  and that's why he himself said that Twitter is a crime scene.
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:11.180]  What did you make of those fascinating hearings last week?
[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:14.700]  I know you're in contact with Congress, your information is being used, some more hearings
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:15.700]  are coming up.
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:21.660]  I mean for those that don't realize how we basically were the rabbit hole of their larger
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:25.660]  plan for everybody else and then after they censored us, we were the beta test, they went
[02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:29.740]  on after everybody else and if we're ever going to stop this deep state coup that we're
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:34.340]  living under, we've got to expose their mechanism of surveillance and censorship.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:42.100]  Yeah, look, I agree with you, you know, now finally people are starting to see this.
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:45.780]  You and I and others have really been ahead of the curve over these last few years and
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:47.180]  so it's been hard, right?
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:52.300]  A lot of people mocked my lawsuit and they said that it was over the top and they said
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:56.820]  that it was extra, right, or the same things that they say about you, right?
[02:26:56.820 --> 02:27:00.380]  They say that you're over the top, but now everybody's starting to realize that you're
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:01.380]  right.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:06.580]  It's look for example, big tech social media censorship, government surveillance, the most
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:12.220]  recent Alex Jones was right, tweets have to do with Project Blue Beam, okay, this is
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:16.740]  stuff you've been talking about for the last 10 years and now, right, everybody's starting
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:20.860]  to realize, wow, Alex Jones was right and ironically you're still not allowed back on
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:21.860]  Twitter.
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:28.660]  I'm hoping that, you know, more people will start speaking out about this lawsuit.
[02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:32.180]  You've been kind enough to have me on, Steve Bannon interviewed me, Roger Stone has also
[02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:38.060]  talked about this as well, but there really honestly has not been too much reporting outside
[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:43.340]  of conservative media and it shows you, right, how the Republican Party is pretty useless.
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:47.660]  These people, they love complaining, right, they love having their little hearings, but
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:54.180]  where are they to actually support a lawsuit that has legs to what they're pushing in Congress?
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:58.580]  We can sit and we can talk all we want in Congress all day long about who's censoring
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:04.980]  who, who's working with who, but this lawsuit is a vehicle to eventually lead to prosecution
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:05.980]  someday.
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:06.980]  I agree.
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:10.580]  I'd like to see the attorney generals of Missouri and Louisiana are doing a great job in their
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:12.900]  lawsuit to join your lawsuit.
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:15.700]  Yeah, we'll see, right?
[02:28:15.700 --> 02:28:20.820]  It's certainly very interesting and obviously big tech is starting to get scared because
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:22.300]  they lawyer up.
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:26.340]  So Elon Musk actually blocked me on Twitter last week.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:31.060]  Yesterday he unblocked me, which is kind of funny, but he blocked me on Twitter from
[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:32.060]  seeing his tweets.
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.940]  And then the day after the hearing, Twitter retained Obama's lawyer, Michael Gottlieb,
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:40.380]  who of course is a member of the council on foreign relations.
[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.380]  Laura, stay there.
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:43.260]  You're striking right to the heart of all this.
[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:46.420]  We'll talk about Elon Musk as well.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:49.500]  Thank God, let you and millions of others that were censored back on Twitter.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:54.100]  So I'm very thankful for him doing that, even if he keeps me banned and really goes along
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:55.540]  with official propaganda against me.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.540]  It's okay.
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:02.620]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.940]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:08.260]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:13.540]  But when we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:17.740]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:22.380]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:29:22.380 --> 02:29:24.620]  five, six, seven days a week.
[02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:26.580]  It's really just incredible.
[02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:29.620]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:34.980]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:35.980]  us.
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:36.980]  I know you spread the word.
[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:37.980]  I know you pray for us.
[02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:38.980]  That's wonderful.
[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:39.980]  Keep doing it.
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:44.380]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars.com and you never buy great products
[02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:45.860]  that enrich and empower your life.
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.540]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:51.660]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products in force.com.
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:56.460]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars.com, our funding problems will
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:57.460]  be over.
[02:29:57.460 --> 02:29:58.460]  Please take action now.
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:29:59.460]  You want to beat the new world order?
[02:29:59.460 --> 02:30:01.460]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:02.460]  Well, so do I.
[02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:07.340]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've
[02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:09.620]  got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:14.100]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:18.540]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:22.420]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going
[02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:25.260]  to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:27.180]  So please keep me on the field.
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:30.340]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:32.420]  that will empower you and your family.
[02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:37.060]  Go to infowarsstore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation.

[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:43.420]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost.

[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:58.380]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:31:04.060]  InfowarsMD is finally here, it's the very same high quality products you've been getting

[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:43.060]  surveillance and censorship has been the election meddling the criminal activity
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:46.860]  the threats facebook saying it's okay to call for violence against 12 key people
[02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:50.140]  thinking the public would accept that they could call for violence against
[02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:56.420]  people that shows how revolutionary and hateful this big media big tech globalist
[02:33:56.420 --> 02:34:00.660]  combine is and Laura Loomer has gone through hell run for Congress repeatedly
[02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:03.860]  been cheated but never gave up but now she's all over the place I see her all
[02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:08.900]  over being interviewed lawsuits moving forward vindicated in spades very
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:13.540]  exciting moment to be here how do you see this big fight playing out here as the
[02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:20.100]  deep state gets in so much trouble well Alex I'm hopeful that people are going
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:25.380]  to start to wake up I am hopeful that now that this information that you and I
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:29.540]  and others really it's been a select few of us have been warning people about the
[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:34.140]  extent of which big tech is trying to go to not only steal our elections but
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:40.620]  also digitally gulag and get dissidents like you and I killed they literally
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:44.940]  changed their terms of service Facebook to say that it was okay to murder you
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:49.860]  and I and Paul Joseph Watson and several others this was in 2019 when they deemed
[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:53.420]  us dangerous individuals and I'll remind you that the day that they changed
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:58.980]  their policy was the day that I filed my defamation lawsuit a separate lawsuit I
[02:34:58.980 --> 02:35:02.900]  had filed against Facebook for calling me a dangerous individual so you can
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:07.380]  really view that as a form of retaliation right then saying okay you're
[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:11.180]  gonna file a lawsuit against us for defamation and we're gonna tell people
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:16.300]  that it's okay to murder you so it sounds crazy but now people are really
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:19.260]  starting to see that you just say it doesn't sound real but there were
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:23.260]  mainstream articles the document was real they really did it because they're
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:26.660]  always pushing for more power they already surveil us and censor us and
[02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:30.380]  attack us and cheat everybody including the general public so why not go to the
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:35.620]  next phase of authoritarians retaliation which is a cause for violence well
[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:38.420]  that's exactly what they've done and that's what how far they've been able
[02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:42.860]  to you know test people they did it with my campaign and I blame Republicans
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:48.220]  honestly for the stolen election I really do I blame them because that's when
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:51.980]  big tech saw the Republican Party do absolutely nothing when they decided to
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:56.660]  single me out and make me the only D platformed candidate in 2020 denying my
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:36:01.020]  campaign access if you remember Facebook and Twitter literally created
[02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:06.580]  separate policies for the Laura Loomer campaign to keep me offline and then when
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:10.300]  I won my primary and Trump voted for me and he endorsed me down in Palm Beach
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:14.860]  County still they wouldn't allow me to have an account and that's when big tech
[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:19.060]  realized okay if we can actually get away with not only D platforming a
[02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:23.820]  congressional candidate but a GOP nominee in Donald Trump's own backyard we
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:27.540]  can get away with D platforming the sitting United States president so it
[02:36:27.540 --> 02:36:31.460]  really all began with the Laura Loomer for Congress campaign and of course you
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:35.620]  didn't see any members of Congress mentioned my campaign when they were
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:39.820]  having this hearing and you know we were telling them well what did you expect
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:43.140]  with the Hunter Biden story well exactly let me ask you this it's not
[02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:45.780]  because it's you and I that it happened to me why do they choose Laura Loomer and
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:52.860]  Alex Jones as the main test case because we're the most effective I would say
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:56.100]  that you and I were the two most effective people and then there were
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:37:00.260]  other people who were banned too but look you were exposing people and I was
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:04.500]  getting in people's faces and they didn't like the fact I mean prior to me on
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:08.620]  the right there really wasn't anybody on the right who was getting in the faces
[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:12.220]  of politicians and putting cameras in their faces like that's what made them
[02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:16.140]  mad is that you particularly in either a lesser extent was going to Congress
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:19.780]  going to these meetings and peacefully but aggressively confronting them with
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:25.460]  the facts yeah and then when we showed up together I mean that was kind of the
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:30.460]  chef's kiss right that was kind of our are the I guess you could call it like
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:34.740]  the coup de gras of that moment because you found yourself banned right
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:39.300]  immediately after that I believe I still had my account but then I was on a week
[02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:42.460]  long suspension and then they just permanently banned me that was September
[02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:47.860]  5th 2018 so you know nobody had really ever done that before on the right I
[02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:52.740]  remember you and I were both attacked aggressively even by some of my at the
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:56.380]  time were my closest friends telling me whoa I think that was a little out of
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:38:00.780]  line you know confronting Dorsey during the congressional hearing don't do that
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:04.540]  kind of stuff that's what left us do and again they're lying saying they never
[02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:08.100]  censored anybody for political reasons and and people say well that's just
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:12.060]  Laura Loomer and Alex Jones and Paul Watson again and St. Louis Farrakhan and
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:15.820]  a few others but then it was everybody else and then it was millions of
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:20.060]  citizens saying the vaccine made them sick or thousands of doctors and we know
[02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:24.540]  they were colluding with the NIH and the CDC to suppress not just America's
[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:29.700]  people all over the world this is a serious Nuremberg code violation of
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:35.980]  humanity here yeah absolutely I mean you have criminal illegal election
[02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:40.140]  interference you have surveillance part of me even wonders if I was illegally
[02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:44.620]  red flagged because of big tech you know designating me as a dangerous
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:48.180]  individual and terrorists because shortly after that of course I discovered
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:51.860]  that I had been put in the FBI next database nobody ever told me of course
[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:57.100]  but now that we know that FBI and DHS and big tech had these pathways of
[02:38:57.100 --> 02:39:02.900]  communication it really makes you wonder I know I'm on that list no criminal
[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:07.340]  record but same thing when I come back into the country I get pulled out I get
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:10.940]  searched everything else happens and again this is the future they want for
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:16.500]  everybody this is a social credit score they're trying to implement myself yeah
[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:19.980]  absolutely and I don't know if you've been federally prohibited from owning or
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:24.260]  possessing a firearm but I have I'm not allowed to own or possess or purchase a
[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:28.340]  firearm because the FBI illegally red flagged me and put me in this database
[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:32.620]  nobody wants to address it congressman Paul Gosar wrote a letter to Congress
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:38.140]  about it and or to the FBI and Merrick Garland in 2021 but you know nobody
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.420]  really is addressing this and then you know here in the state of Florida
[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:45.460]  Governor DeSantis who wants to run for president against Donald Trump you know
[02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:50.220]  he has completely ignored this issue you know during the last legislative
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:55.700]  session well the one in 2021 when we had this tech bill that was brought forth it
[02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:59.900]  was literally designed to fail and so now you see him on the campaign trail
[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:04.420]  talking about how you know he wants to address the banking but this is stuff
[02:40:04.420 --> 02:40:07.740]  that should have been addressed years ago when you and I were blowing the whistle
[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:10.940]  you know even during the Trump administration and I know on his way
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:15.500]  out Trump tried to address it but as I wrote in my book the biggest failure I'd
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:20.300]  say of the Trump administration was not doing enough to address social media
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:25.140]  censorship and deplatforming so hopefully you know in 2024 President
[02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:29.340]  Donald Trump surrounds himself with advisors and you know people like you
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:33.460]  and I who are able to you know give him good policy and suggestions on how to
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:36.900]  address these egregious civil rights violations right he criticized the mass
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:41.260]  censorship but didn't realize it would end up happening to him I really
[02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:43.700]  appreciate you coming on we got to get shown some time and dig up all the
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:47.140]  clips when we confronted Congress all the things when you brought illegal
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:50.580]  aliens and antsy Pelosi's house you were the first person to do that now being
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:53.780]  imitated of all these governors you've been a trailblazer and they and they
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:57.660]  saw what you did and said well if people imitate this it's game over for us so we
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:02.180]  can look at ourselves being persecuted not as victims but as as stalwarts in the
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:06.660]  fight and realize what we were doing the system feared that's why others should
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:10.860]  support us but also imitate and even upgrade what we've done because that's
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:14.820]  what the power structure is scared of but people can find you again on Twitter
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:19.940]  at Laura Loomer you can also go to loomard.com your book the book Loomard
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:24.060]  as well in closing what do you think about Elon Musk hero bad guy
[02:41:24.060 --> 02:41:30.580]  opportunist you know look I'm grateful that Elon Musk reinstated my account I
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:35.700]  was doubtful that he would ever do it I want to believe that you know he's a
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:40.420]  good guy I wish that he would you know stay true to the free speech absolutist
[02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:44.820]  mindset and actually reinstate your account and info wars and kind of not
[02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:49.020]  fall into the trap that the left has you know pushed out with the character
[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:53.740]  assassination of you and Sandy Hook and all that nonsense that they used to keep
[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:57.260]  you deplatformed right I think it's wrong because you've been right about all
[02:41:57.260 --> 02:42:03.540]  this stuff but you know look I am grateful like I said hopefully I think that
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:07.140]  there's a rogue it's pretty obvious I mean I know for a fact that there's a rogue
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:12.660]  employee element taking place here at Twitter and also the legal department is
[02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:16.980]  completely rogue you see that they tried to they actually did hire Perkins Coey
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:21.260]  to fight me in my lawsuit and then Elon Musk had to fire Perkins Coey because
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:25.100]  Twitter legal went behind his back and hired them even though he had said to
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:29.060]  never hire Perkins Coey ever again so I think that you have people in Twitter
[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:33.740]  legal and also just rogue woke leftist crazy employees that are undermining
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:37.660]  him deliberately but well we talked Saturday and you pointed out that Musk
[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:41.060]  had blocked you and I said I guarantee you that's bureaucrats in there in his
[02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:44.780]  account he's gonna reinstate you and he did Laura Lumer great job your example
[02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:49.620]  do us all Godspeed we'll talk to you soon thanks Alex have a great day thank
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:53.220]  you all right I promise callers have been every one of you stay right there

[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:06.260]  successes info wars has had I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because
[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:10.540]  of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info wars
[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:15.740]  people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:20.060]  MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer and the
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:25.180]  hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just
[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:29.100]  incredible so for myself the whole info wars crew I thank you for your past
[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:34.100]  support I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on

[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:08.940]  globalist I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:14.740]  America but the world we are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:19.940]  information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I persevered but the listeners
[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:25.180]  and viewers who support them for the real reason you have the success we're
[02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:29.500]  having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever

[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:14.940]  elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private 2007 Alex Jones

[02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:35.020]  stack of documents that folks were saying about my crew was the reported jet
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:37.820]  free Epstein data dump the judge is going to release sometime this week
[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:42.620]  that's confirmed that's real but it was from a lawsuit over Gisling Maxwell a
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:47.620]  couple years ago so the 2024 page document shared via Twitter is not an
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:53.380]  early release of the unsealed papers recently teased by the Daily Mail a few
[02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:57.260]  text Twitter accounts posted the old document believing it was breaking news
[02:47:57.260 --> 02:48:02.740]  the papers currently online or at least 2019 but soon the real documents will be
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:06.620]  released and we'll be here covering it as soon as that happens thanks to the
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:10.460]  callers for holding James in Oklahoma unprepared this in this crazy world
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:16.500]  you're on the air go ahead yeah I want to talk about being prepared we need to
[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:23.260]  be prepared spiritually mentally and physically you know being prepared
[02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:28.140]  spiritually we can seek out the father through his son Jesus Christ does knock
[02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:34.340]  in the door will be open he can he shall find repaired mentally what's going on
[02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:38.740]  this is in light of all this things that are happening it's only going to get
[02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:47.340]  worse in the eyes of the world I agree with you what we what we can do is
[02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:51.700]  prepare mentally reading books getting information making contacts with other
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:57.380]  people then also physically going to infowarstore.com and buying products you
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:49:01.700]  know planning your days out understanding what's going on around you
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:06.420]  making that connection with other people and getting involved in groups because
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:10.420]  it's not it's not going to get better you know it's just I mean you hear the
[02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:14.500]  news constantly you got to go through it you got to figure out what's going on
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:20.220]  and that spiritual and mental aspect is going to drive what the truth is and
[02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:26.580]  that spiritual aspect to drive the other two in which way you should go I agree
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:29.180]  without the spiritual discernment you'll never know how to make the right
[02:49:29.180 --> 02:49:33.140]  decisions amazing call thank you sir Max in Wisconsin on the escalation
[02:49:33.140 --> 02:49:39.460]  Ukraine Russia and the new tech on tanks go ahead hey Mr. Jones happy Valentine's
[02:49:39.460 --> 02:49:46.140]  Day thank you sir I wanted to talk about escalation in Russia with their new
[02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:52.820]  Armada tanks spotted on the ground there in Ukraine it's their latest tank and
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:58.220]  they were holding back sending those tanks in because they have the Russian
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:06.940]  super secret Doppler based arena AR ENA system where it uses a high-tech Doppler
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:12.460]  technology to scan the air detecting incoming missile that's like traveling
[02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:17.780]  thousands of miles per hour and then shoot another missile and counteract
[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:23.620]  that and the fact that they put that on the battlefield now in Ukraine as a
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:27.060]  sign of you know escalation they didn't want the US to have it for a long time
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:32.020]  and now obviously you know a tank is gonna get shot and they're gonna you
[02:50:32.020 --> 02:50:36.900]  know lose that technology has about 80% success rate and on top of that you know
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:41.260]  date deeper down the rabbit hole I thought you know if the Doppler radar in
[02:50:41.260 --> 02:50:46.300]  this tank can get that can detect a missile coming in surely you know like
[02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:52.540]  regular Doppler and other forms of Doppler can detect like you know myself
[02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:58.140]  walking around people walking around at things much easier to track what do you
[02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:03.220]  think absolutely they've got all sorts of frontline weapons they didn't use they
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:06.020]  use their really old equipment really kind of cannon fodder it looks like
[02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:10.100]  this is a real assault we're about to find out what's gonna happen max thank
[02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:14.820]  you for the call let's go to Bart and George on the balloon and the psyops go

[02:53:56.740 --> 02:54:01.340]  the day you'd be taking weekends and you had a extra guy creating formulas and
[02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:07.620]  your integrity is there because I bought iodine when that you are out and it
[02:54:07.620 --> 02:54:12.100]  doesn't match up the quality is not the same and when you look at the amount of
[02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:17.700]  dose per serving it's your iodine is cheaper well here's the deal sir I mean
[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:21.060]  we just a lot of our stuff's innovative like the iodine is innovative a lot of
[02:54:21.060 --> 02:54:24.820]  it's just whatever a top certified brand as we just get it relabeled and lower
[02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:27.780]  the price some but we could sell crap stuff all day but we want you to get a
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:30.780]  great result so I appreciate your support you want to know about project
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:34.700]  Veritas and I'm glad you called in it's confirmed they could James O.K. for eating
[02:54:34.700 --> 02:54:38.820]  an employee sandwich and they thought it was bad that he used some of the
[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:43.740]  company's money to put on some comedy shows well I mean everybody does that
[02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:47.260]  it's good to have community and to have organizations do some fun things too like
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:52.620]  it's like all the NRA is bad they flew the board on private jets to NRA events
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:59.140]  I mean it's all crap sorry go ahead it is I feel sorry for the guy and I love
[02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:03.540]  them I love miss Loomer but there's a lot of there's a lot of fruit out there
[02:55:03.540 --> 02:55:07.980]  that they can pick like Mariah Carey got the fake shot and I think I might have
[02:55:07.980 --> 02:55:11.580]  saw that on your website and Anthony Hopkins got a fake shot and it's on
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:17.980]  video if any of them have friends you know safe video tape and see yeah where
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:22.380]  you was a shot real or no I'm not gonna get the shot coming out of the shot they
[02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:26.580]  did it to the side of his arm behind him right right and then and then and then
[02:55:26.580 --> 02:55:30.620]  when these people are protesting Congress and or even at Pfizer asked them
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:34.460]  have you had the shot and the CDC decline taking the shot or they're not
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:38.420]  required to all the highest statistics group not taking fiction not taking the
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:44.180]  real shot or not taking it period has been government officials that's come
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:49.260]  out yeah and then it's kind of like remember remember they they exempted
[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:52.580]  high-level high-level government officials from a shot well that was a
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:55.940]  that was a red flag from the beginning I don't know why other people couldn't see
[02:55:55.940 --> 02:56:00.740]  that well and then they don't they don't they don't the scums don't take our shot

[02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:20.900]  put you in the ground bye bye dumb American Russell Bram put a brand put a
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:24.540]  tweet out saying that if you knew all the people that have told him they've got
[02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:28.300]  fake vaccine cards you'd be surprised or saying that you know you got to look
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:36.220]  at all you take time yeah and then oh also South Carolina news Nikki Haley's

[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:13.220]  and it was going northbound north westbound and I put my hair on the back
[03:01:13.220 --> 03:01:21.540]  of my neck stood up and I said you know I don't believe what I'm seeing but at the
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:31.180]  same token I was going through the the line from from the Atlanta airport and
[03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:38.380]  I saw the span that was spinning and it was showing this you know this this
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:45.300]  sort of I guess you would call it hologram they showed no guns no anything
[03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:52.820]  and I said would it be that and I looked again and I said it can't be that
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:58.660]  because it's too in line with what I'm seeing. Well have you seen when when
[03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:01.980]  Starlink launches and then a bunch of them are in orbit where they're all
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:09.900]  lined up it's it's pretty amazing. Well I I mean I wanted to try to disprove what
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:16.380]  I was seeing and I live in I live right over a flight patterned by O'Hare
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:21.860]  Airport in Chicago and they are flying their planes I go out for cigarettes
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:27.660]  every so often and today when I went out for my cigarettes I saw that they were
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:34.540]  flying planes four hundred feet below what they usually do so I'm a little bit
[03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:40.180]  worried. I hear you brother there's a lot of weirdness going on Don next time
[03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:44.540]  try to get some footage of it thank you for the call Chuck in California you're
[03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:50.100]  on the air. Hey what's going on Alex and happy birthday youngster I want to tell
[03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:54.020]  you a little story about train wrecks over here in San Bernardino in 1989 May
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:59.100]  12th Southern Pacific train derailed in my neighborhood right my back yard
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:04.700]  and decapitated two kids tied it was so safe this is the part I really want to
[03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:08.660]  say it was so safe they let us stay out there for 15 hours in the street knowing
[03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:13.260]  their pipeline was linking. The next week two weeks later it blew up Burton one of
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:17.380]  my friends threw a gate as she threw her kids over the fence so people in Ohio go
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:22.140]  with your soul don't listen to them the waters probably is not safe and then
[03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:24.860]  matter of fact they said it's headed towards Virginia guess we're going to be
[03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:30.220]  next month Virginia so I guess I'll be taking a pallet of water. Absolutely what
[03:03:30.220 --> 03:03:32.860]  do you think of just all the infrastructure getting blown up I mean
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:35.580]  some of it's probably happening by accident but they're admitting record
[03:03:35.580 --> 03:03:38.900]  infrastructure problems everywhere somebody's shooting up and blowing up
[03:03:38.900 --> 03:03:44.460]  power transformer substations all over the country somebody's derailing trains
[03:03:44.460 --> 03:03:49.380]  they admit on purpose all over the country I mean it's it's it's wild so
[03:03:49.380 --> 03:03:52.980]  maybe by accident but you know you put it together with all the food plants and
[03:03:52.980 --> 03:03:56.940]  everything else it can't be an accident one thing about Hollywood when that list
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:59.780]  comes out all of my friends are gonna start believing me I used to work out
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:03.940]  there with those weirdos and I'll tell you right now I'm when I'm in with
[03:04:03.940 --> 03:04:07.860]  with those guys I'm like the Matrix trying to dodge cameras because I don't
[03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:10.940]  want to be seen with any of them so when you get through with that list I want

[03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:48.120]  ahead. Hey what's going on man I was gonna say so I follow ADSB exchange and
[03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:52.560]  flight radar 24 for going on like two years now like look religiously when
[03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:56.700]  you couple of flight movements of military aircraft in particular to and
[03:06:56.700 --> 03:07:00.780]  back from the theater one of the things that you'll see when you take those
[03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:06.180]  ideas and data and then use Google Earth satellite imagery that is updated
[03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:09.180]  constantly because those satellites are constantly spinning around the planet I
[03:07:09.180 --> 03:07:14.300]  just want to say in Kaliningrad dude I'm seeing six generation checkmate
[03:07:14.300 --> 03:07:20.180]  aircraft on tarmacs that are Russian they are ready to go they have like stacks
[03:07:20.180 --> 03:07:26.020]  of missiles and stacks of bombs right next to those aircraft and they've been
[03:07:26.020 --> 03:07:29.300]  test firing those engines because those engines point down if you know anything
[03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:33.500]  about these Russian aircraft they have hundreds and hundreds of aircraft
[03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:39.580]  stationed in Kaliningrad Belarus and Crimea they have probably five to ten
[03:07:39.580 --> 03:07:43.220]  times more equipment and next-generation equipment station in those three
[03:07:43.220 --> 03:07:47.020]  checkpoints than in Ukraine right now and if you look at what's going on in
[03:07:47.020 --> 03:07:50.580]  Ukraine they're using corporate wars right they're using the equivalent
[03:07:50.580 --> 03:07:54.820]  Russian equivalent of Blackwater right they're not even engaging there with
[03:07:54.820 --> 03:08:00.820]  their tip of the spear those people who are fighting against Khazaria over there
[03:08:00.820 --> 03:08:06.460]  right now are just prisoners their mercenaries on their side they are not
[03:08:06.460 --> 03:08:11.000]  the Russian military we're about to probably see the real Russian military
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:17.300]  bust out because I'm watching on ADSB exchange our spy aircraft R-135 spy
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:22.060]  aircraft the really high-tech Learjet the AWACS is five or six of them today
[03:08:22.060 --> 03:08:26.100]  cruising around up and down Crimea cruising around Moldova cruising around
[03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:32.260]  the side of Ukraine Khazaria cruising around the border of Poland up there by
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:36.380]  Kaliningrad our people are scared right now they're not telling you that but I
[03:08:36.380 --> 03:08:40.040]  know about those great aircraft sites that show the planes in lifetime and
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:44.180]  give us the URL so that I'm just going off memory there's a bunch of them to do
[03:08:44.180 --> 03:08:47.780]  it the one you're saying we should go to to show what you're talking about yeah
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:53.820]  the easy one to use is ADSB exchange the Alpha Delta Sierra Bravo exchange go to
[03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:56.660]  the live map tracking thing there's a little filter on there you can click
[03:08:56.660 --> 03:08:59.820]  military click on that and then you can just sit there leave it all day long and
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:03.860]  watch again my crew is gonna pull it up and I'm gonna write it down but just one
[03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:09.180]  more time give us the URL yeah ADSB exchange you should have a dude on that
[03:09:09.180 --> 03:09:14.040]  24-7 watching that because whenever you listen to the EAMs I think the crew
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:16.860]  that's what you said because they're not pulling it up you get I'm a little slow
[03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:24.540]  here today so other ADSB exchange yes ADSB exchange and just and what do you
[03:09:24.540 --> 03:09:28.140]  click on there's like a live matter there does I've seen this site before
[03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:32.340]  okay click military on the right there's like a filter go to the right filter
[03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:36.740]  click military and they'll show you theater right but what I wanted to tell
[03:09:36.740 --> 03:09:42.020]  you dude is I listened to the emergency alert or emergency accent action
[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:47.540]  messages which are our R-135s flying over our missile silos and our bomber
[03:09:47.540 --> 03:09:51.860]  fields and they're talking down to those dudes saying radio check are you there
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:55.220]  he's like yes radio check we're here everything's good but they do it in code
[03:09:55.220 --> 03:09:58.780]  like 32 character codes I'm sure you've heard about that right your radio guy
[03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:03.060]  you know what I'm talking about yes the amount of those in the last 60 days has
[03:10:03.060 --> 03:10:07.780]  gone bonkers in fact when that balloon cruised from you know
[03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:12.080]  Canadian all the way down to when it got shut down those emergency action
[03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:17.660]  messages were being jammed there was high frequency like modem sounds and all
[03:10:17.660 --> 03:10:22.700]  kinds of noises going off while our dudes in R-135 are communicating down to
[03:10:22.700 --> 03:10:27.380]  our missile silos so this is the bottom line is there's a lot of battle chatter
[03:10:27.380 --> 03:10:33.020]  eating up yes sir and but what I'm telling you Colin and grad if you if any
[03:10:33.020 --> 03:10:36.780]  if any of our people right now are over there you need to get the hell out of
[03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:41.540]  Eastern Europe right now because it's about to go down and they're not telling
[03:10:41.540 --> 03:10:44.540]  you that and I was gonna say real quick one last thing Jen Stoltenberg that
[03:10:44.540 --> 03:10:49.940]  little neocon new old-order slave puppet master of Millie himself he just gave
[03:10:49.940 --> 03:10:54.980]  a series of you know updates right their little NATO summit that they had in the
[03:10:54.980 --> 03:11:01.380]  last two days that dude looks scared that dude Jen Stoltenberg was saying
[03:11:01.380 --> 03:11:06.540]  yesterday and today this morning that we are out of ammunition and we do not
[03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:12.060]  have the manufacturing capability we haven't mobilized Alex we haven't
[03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:15.500]  mobilized we are completely out of our high-tech missiles we are completely out
[03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:18.900]  of all of our stupid ammunition like our I mean dumb ammunition like our
[03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:24.660]  artillery right and they are going to have to invoke emergency willpower
[03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:30.100]  war powers here and over there in order to backfill Russia Russia mobilized their
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:36.180]  industry two months ago right they they've called up million people 500,000
[03:11:36.180 --> 03:11:41.380]  people here and there and they've been steady making tanks steady upgrading
[03:11:41.380 --> 03:11:46.660]  their shifts steady making all their stuff ready for this and it's about to
[03:11:46.660 --> 03:11:51.900]  go down and we are about to get owned because we do not have everything we
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:57.220]  need in position the people that are running this are willing fully leading
[03:11:57.220 --> 03:12:02.340]  us to get destroyed because I agree with you and I'm glad I held over to get

[03:12:43.260 --> 03:12:47.820]  thank you to the Info Wars team what an amazing amazing bunch of people you know
[03:12:47.820 --> 03:12:52.300]  I think that with all of the distractions that we're seeing right now you
[03:12:52.300 --> 03:12:58.700]  know the aliens I want to play a White House clip in a moment the aliens the
[03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:02.740]  things that are happening in Ohio now we just heard about Texas and of course
[03:13:02.740 --> 03:13:06.380]  I'm not saying these are distractions these are these are definitely real
[03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:10.540]  things that are happening but they're being done to distract us from the
[03:13:10.540 --> 03:13:16.060]  greater plan all of these mini crises that we're seeing all over the place
[03:13:16.060 --> 03:13:20.580]  what happened in Turkey and I shared a video recently of this ladies analysis
[03:13:20.580 --> 03:13:25.460]  of that situation talking about the fact that that was not an earthquake and
[03:13:25.460 --> 03:13:30.220]  she was actually a senator in Europe there so that was fascinating to see
[03:13:30.220 --> 03:13:33.700]  what she had to say about that she was talking about the fact that Erdogan
[03:13:33.700 --> 03:13:37.860]  walked out during a Schwab speech and this was sort of payback for Turkey
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:44.700]  it's very hard to discern right now what is an attack what is you know
[03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:48.260]  punishment for not complying with the globalist agenda but the thing I want
[03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:51.540]  to talk about I have a lot of news to cover today but the thing that doesn't
[03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:54.980]  make sense to me and it's something that I haven't heard anyone talking about
[03:13:54.980 --> 03:14:01.820]  yet is the fact that censorship has lifted in a lot of ways and that makes
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:08.900]  me nervous you think about this the you've got a global plan to depopulate
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:12.780]  keep people in the dark your plan depends on people going and getting
[03:14:12.780 --> 03:14:17.420]  poison shots and continuing to poison themselves in different ways and yet
[03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:20.580]  you're lifting the censorship of the people that are warning about this of
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:25.580]  course Alex is still banned on Twitter but here's what happened I am Z-media
[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:31.020]  is the most banned media in this country and I'm not exaggerating we've been
[03:14:31.020 --> 03:14:35.100]  banned on YouTube we've been banned up permanent Facebook shutter ban since
[03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:39.060]  April of last year three Instagram accounts you know other social media
[03:14:39.060 --> 03:14:44.020]  completely banned can't get back on and now all of a sudden Instagram is
[03:14:44.020 --> 03:14:49.980]  growing at a rate that even before they started banning me I wasn't getting it
[03:14:49.980 --> 03:14:56.140]  doesn't make sense why are they allowing this well you look at since Elon
[03:14:56.140 --> 03:15:01.140]  bought Twitter you know a lot of people flocked to that platform so we could say
[03:15:01.140 --> 03:15:07.020]  that maybe big tech is afraid now maybe the other platforms like meta are
[03:15:07.020 --> 03:15:11.220]  thinking we need to we need to compete with Elon but there's another
[03:15:11.220 --> 03:15:16.020]  possibility I think that we haven't considered and I'm gonna talk about it
[03:15:16.020 --> 03:15:21.380]  on the other side of the break we're gonna cover today Australia predicting
[03:15:21.380 --> 03:15:26.380]  the next stage of the COVID surge a personality and mainstream media
[03:15:26.380 --> 03:15:30.860]  personality here has called out the shots Damar Hamlin not wanting to talk

[03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:05.620]  money to further the information war and everyone should decide to take the fight
[03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:09.380]  the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we

[03:19:58.220 --> 03:20:14.100]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones. Welcome
[03:20:14.100 --> 03:20:18.100]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm your guest host Maria Z so we're talking
[03:20:18.100 --> 03:20:22.340]  about something that just doesn't make sense you have a new world order in
[03:20:22.340 --> 03:20:29.540]  full force in its last stages for this global corporate takeover and you start
[03:20:29.540 --> 03:20:36.180]  lifting censorship the censorship that they so desperately fought to achieve
[03:20:36.180 --> 03:20:40.660]  on social media and it's starting to lift something is not right here now I'm
[03:20:40.660 --> 03:20:45.660]  happy about it don't get me wrong but if you were the enemy the last thing you
[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:50.180]  would do is start giving your enemies a voice right now so what is going on well
[03:20:50.180 --> 03:20:53.660]  I have a couple of theories here Elon's building a payment platform we all know
[03:20:53.660 --> 03:20:57.620]  about that according to in the no sources who spoke with the Financial
[03:20:57.620 --> 03:21:02.220]  Times apparently Twitter has started applying for the regulatory licenses it
[03:21:02.220 --> 03:21:06.980]  will need to actually launch a payment system and it's also working on the
[03:21:06.980 --> 03:21:10.580]  software as well now we know that a lot of people have voiced their concerns
[03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:14.380]  about the fact that this is a trap it's going to end up being like a social
[03:21:14.380 --> 03:21:21.300]  credit score system that that is sort of conditioning people towards that or
[03:21:21.300 --> 03:21:25.100]  even will be used for that and it's making people feel comfortable with this
[03:21:25.100 --> 03:21:29.860]  platform in order to achieve that that's one possibility and if that is the case
[03:21:29.860 --> 03:21:35.020]  perhaps the other social media platforms are intimidated by the fact that so many
[03:21:35.020 --> 03:21:38.860]  have flocked to Twitter and so they feel like they need to start competing maybe
[03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:43.460]  they have the same plan but we're just getting comfortable with it with Twitter
[03:21:43.460 --> 03:21:49.060]  first I don't believe that the globalists do anything unless it's
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:53.380]  calculated yes they are afraid at the moment there's some amazing things
[03:21:53.380 --> 03:21:58.340]  happening around the world for example a huge lawsuit filed against legacy media
[03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:02.500]  I just interviewed Dr. Ben Tapper who's on the list of defendants with Robert F.
[03:22:02.500 --> 03:22:08.460]  Kennedy Jr. and this is attacking the Washington Post Reuters and a whole
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:13.340]  bunch of others which is massive they are you know the lawsuit is against the
[03:22:13.340 --> 03:22:17.700]  trusted news initiative which is essentially responsible for all of the
[03:22:17.700 --> 03:22:23.300]  people that have died from the COVID injections because they censored
[03:22:23.300 --> 03:22:28.220]  life-saving information and pushed false information out there so it's a huge
[03:22:28.220 --> 03:22:33.340]  deal and perhaps the other platforms and legacy media are starting to get afraid
[03:22:33.340 --> 03:22:39.500]  of what is actually you know this lawsuit other lawsuits coming for them and
[03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:45.140]  it is it's yapping at their heels as more and more truth comes out but again it
[03:22:45.140 --> 03:22:52.740]  just makes me nervous when we start seeing all of these words start to be
[03:22:52.740 --> 03:22:57.140]  allowed on YouTube you know especially when they went to all this effort to
[03:22:57.140 --> 03:23:02.340]  have that they spoke about online laws that they needed to create for
[03:23:02.340 --> 03:23:07.460]  misinformation and disinformation you know these these buzzwords they use so I
[03:23:07.460 --> 03:23:10.140]  think it's something to watch and I think it's something to be careful when
[03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:15.140]  off we need to be certain that we're not being lulled into a false sense of
[03:23:15.140 --> 03:23:19.980]  security and a trap when it comes to a lack of censorship we'll take it while
[03:23:19.980 --> 03:23:24.380]  we have it but it's always important to depend on platforms like this rather
[03:23:24.380 --> 03:23:28.340]  than the mainstream platforms we literally just use that to funnel
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:33.780]  information to the masses you know who don't know about banned off video who
[03:23:33.780 --> 03:23:39.340]  don't know about Z media dot com so just stay on guard everyone because from
[03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:42.860]  what I'm hearing with this platform that Elon's creating it's also going to
[03:23:42.860 --> 03:23:50.980]  accept crypto we know that regulated crypto is one of their preferred well
[03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:55.820]  it's one of the monetary systems that is going to exist on the other side of
[03:23:55.820 --> 03:24:03.100]  their created economic collapse because they want digital currency and I want to
[03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:09.580]  play this clip from the White House Karine Jean Pierre talking about you
[03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:13.340]  know she says that these are not extra terrestrials and they're not aliens and
[03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:17.100]  and the White House kind of laughs and I want to dissect this a little bit the
[03:24:17.100 --> 03:24:21.220]  team can pull it up last thing before I turn it over to the admiral I just
[03:24:21.220 --> 03:24:24.140]  wanted to make sure we address this from the White House I know there have been
[03:24:24.140 --> 03:24:29.420]  questions and concerns about this but there is no again no indication of
[03:24:29.420 --> 03:24:35.260]  aliens or extra terrestrial activity with these recent takedowns again there
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:39.260]  is no indication of aliens or terrestrial activity with these recent
[03:24:39.260 --> 03:24:42.980]  takedowns wanted to make sure that the American people knew that all of you
[03:24:42.980 --> 03:24:46.780]  knew that and it was important for us to say that from here because we've been
[03:24:46.780 --> 03:24:56.820]  hearing a lot about it I'm just you know I loved ET the movie but I'm just
[03:24:56.820 --> 03:25:05.700]  gonna leave it there yeah you look like ET but the here's the thing she says it
[03:25:05.700 --> 03:25:12.580]  twice she says no indication of aliens or extra terrestrial activity we just
[03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:15.700]  want to be honest with the American people you are never honest with the
[03:25:15.700 --> 03:25:19.500]  American people in fact you deflect every time you're asked a question so why
[03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:24.500]  all of a sudden are you wanting to be honest now you're wanting to say it you're
[03:25:24.500 --> 03:25:29.340]  wanting to be honest because or honest because you want to drum in the words
[03:25:29.340 --> 03:25:35.100]  aliens and extra extra terrestrials into people's heads and the fact that all of
[03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:40.380]  the people in the crowd are just laughing at that that was 100% part of
[03:25:40.380 --> 03:25:45.980]  their conditioning and Alex did a fantastic talk on the the alien deception
[03:25:45.980 --> 03:25:49.460]  the other day I encourage everyone to go and watch it I'm not gonna cover the
[03:25:49.460 --> 03:25:55.100]  same ground but this is very very telling this is extremely telling she's
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:59.500]  using the words twice on purpose aliens extra terrestrials to get it into
[03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:03.540]  people's heads this is how they do it and they normalize it through this
[03:26:03.540 --> 03:26:08.100]  Karine Jean-Pierre has never been honest you know she gets asked a question oh I
[03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:11.300]  would direct you to this department or I would direct you to that department and
[03:26:11.300 --> 03:26:14.940]  their question is that she should be answering but all of a sudden she wants
[03:26:14.940 --> 03:26:18.420]  to answer this because it's important to the American people give me a break
[03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:24.820]  absolutely ridiculous now breaking just in the WHO is going to hold an
[03:26:24.820 --> 03:26:31.380]  emergency meeting Tuesday after at least nine people so today in equatorial
[03:26:31.380 --> 03:26:37.740]  guinea died from Marburg hemorrhagic fever a cousin of the Ebola virus they've
[03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:42.260]  got this huge outbreak allegedly over there over 200 people just yesterday
[03:26:42.260 --> 03:26:47.540]  placed in quarantine apparently nine dead now from this Marburg and this is
[03:26:47.540 --> 03:26:53.460]  something that you know they filed the patents long ago for Marburg they you
[03:26:53.460 --> 03:26:57.140]  know we've been warning that this may be coming we think that they've done some
[03:26:57.140 --> 03:27:02.300]  test runs in China of the hemorrhagic fever and I've had experts on who've
[03:27:02.300 --> 03:27:07.340]  said what everyone needs to know is not to be afraid this is not contagious or
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:12.940]  airborne like they're gonna try and tell you it is it is predominantly
[03:27:12.940 --> 03:27:17.700]  transmitted through body bodily fluid or say for example if you have a hemorrhagic
[03:27:17.700 --> 03:27:21.180]  fever the patient vomits and the person treating them sorry that's a bit gross
[03:27:21.180 --> 03:27:25.660]  but the person treating them comes into contact with those fluids that is that
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:30.740]  is exactly how it can become contagious but it's not airborne but they will try
[03:27:30.740 --> 03:27:35.500]  to tell you that it is so this is the latest you know fear mongering from the
[03:27:35.500 --> 03:27:40.620]  WHO there's an account on Twitter called terror alert that said oh you know
[03:27:40.620 --> 03:27:46.500]  well warning the WHO has announced a huge new pandemic Marburg you know I'm
[03:27:46.500 --> 03:27:52.580]  I'm exaggerating what they said but the terror alert Marburg hemorrhagic fever
[03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:55.500]  it's something that we've been warned about for quite some time I've had
[03:27:55.500 --> 03:27:58.980]  people like Todd Callender on coming to talk about the patents the fact that
[03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:03.500]  they want to launch this and you know the CDC with their joke section on their
[03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:07.060]  website about the zombie apocalypse I don't know if you've seen that yet but
[03:28:07.060 --> 03:28:10.060]  they say that oh it started off as a joke and then we ended up updating all
[03:28:10.060 --> 03:28:14.740]  these resources for the zombie apocalypse I mean it really is Twilight Zone
[03:28:14.740 --> 03:28:20.060]  staff guys but it's on their website and again it's part of that conditioning
[03:28:20.060 --> 03:28:24.020]  it's part of that conditioning on the other side of the break I'm gonna talk
[03:28:24.020 --> 03:28:28.620]  about Australia predicting the date and state of the next COVID surge they
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:32.980]  really are doing their best because we've just launched the fifth booster in
[03:28:32.980 --> 03:28:35.300]  Australia and all the headlines are telling everyone about how they're
[03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:40.940]  eligible for the fifth death shot come and get your death shot people and we
[03:28:40.940 --> 03:28:45.180]  have to give you the fear so that you'll get your death shot because we need more
[03:28:45.180 --> 03:28:50.660]  of you dead love the globalists absolutely sick stay with us we'll be
[03:28:50.660 --> 03:28:53.020]  right back
[03:28:56.300 --> 03:29:01.260]  Info war secret weapon is finally here it's a secret weapon for your immune

[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:16.180]  these products for what you pay for similar products are the exact same
[03:29:16.180 --> 03:29:19.380]  products in stores around the country that's because we go right to the highest

[03:31:57.840 --> 03:32:01.020]  I talked a lot about the great successes info wars this had
[03:32:01.020 --> 03:32:05.540]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of Listerians viewers
[03:32:05.540 --> 03:32:09.380]  supporting us but when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the
[03:32:09.380 --> 03:32:15.020]  scenes the researchers the riders they really have been the MVPs in this fight
[03:32:15.020 --> 03:32:19.320]  and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage
[03:32:19.320 --> 03:32:25.440]  every day five six seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself
[03:32:25.440 --> 03:32:29.240]  the whole InfoWars crew I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you
[03:32:29.240 --> 03:32:34.360]  now to realize that InfoWars can not stay on air if you do not support us. I know
[03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:37.400]  you spread the word I know you pray for us and that's wonderful keep doing it but
[03:32:37.400 --> 03:32:41.880]  most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy

[03:32:45.200 --> 03:32:48.480]  on air. I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy

[03:32:52.600 --> 03:32:58.200]  1. InfoWarsStore.com our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:32:58.480 --> 03:33:06.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.960 --> 03:33:18.960]  So Australia is predicting the next COVID surge. This is how ridiculous this
[03:33:18.960 --> 03:33:22.480]  people have become but it's the reason I'm bringing it up is because it's very
[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:28.000]  specific. You see the headline says COVID surge looms over one state as next
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:33.520]  Aussie peak revealed and you know it even admits in the article that that
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:37.840]  that numbers appear to be going down everywhere but you know experts are
[03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:42.400]  arguing about it and one guy comes out and says oh unless something dramatic
[03:33:42.400 --> 03:33:46.320]  happens in Europe and America my expectation is that we will probably
[03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:50.080]  see another peak in winter or late autumn but then he goes to say that
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:54.480]  there's going to be another peak in March in the state of South Australia.
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:00.320]  How do you know this? Oh they know this because of modeling. The same
[03:34:00.320 --> 03:34:06.400]  modeling that said we're going to lose you know however many millions to
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:12.480]  COVID and now they say oh we've saved over X amount of million lives with the
[03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:16.880]  shots because our modeling said we were going to use this lose this many
[03:34:16.880 --> 03:34:22.160]  million but you haven't saved any lives in fact you've killed lives and your
[03:34:22.160 --> 03:34:25.760]  modeling's a bunch of junk so anyway I just I thought this was important
[03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:29.520]  because they're actually saying oh no in March in South Australia we're going to
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:32.560]  have a peak here in the rest of the country we're going to have a peak in
[03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:36.960]  autumn-winter and of course it is because of the five shots that are
[03:34:36.960 --> 03:34:42.960]  upcoming. Now an Australian mainstream media personality has actually come
[03:34:42.960 --> 03:34:49.200]  out and on live television said I'm done with the jobs and he said fit and
[03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:54.720]  healthy people are dropping down with heart issues. I'm quoting Carl Stephanovic
[03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:58.480]  here he was blasting the fifth booster call and that was fascinating to me.
[03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:04.080]  Now why why well part of the reason is a lot of these people who were promoting
[03:35:04.080 --> 03:35:07.920]  the injections early on are realizing how many of these people are dying and
[03:35:07.920 --> 03:35:13.520]  God forbid they were held accountable by all the lawsuits coming for them but
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:19.520]  also I think many of them are realizing that this is happening so regardless of
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:25.360]  what his motivation is I'm glad it was said on national television but then
[03:35:25.360 --> 03:35:28.880]  then you've got people like Damar Hamlin and I want to get the team to bring up
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:35.760]  that clip if it's ready where he's asked what what have doctors told you about
[03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:38.880]  what happened to your heart take a look at his reaction.
[03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:44.400]  I see you the question on so many minds what caused his heart to stop beating.
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:52.240]  In your 24 peak physical condition can run circles around me right now.
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:35:57.760]  How did doctor describe what happened to you?
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:14.160]  I saw no one stay away from. I know from my experience the NFL they do more tests
[03:36:14.160 --> 03:36:19.280]  than anything and in the course of you having your physical did anybody ever
[03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:23.600]  come back with any so you had a heart issue or anything that was abnormal?
[03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:32.320]  Honestly no I've always been a healthy young fit energetic you know human
[03:36:32.320 --> 03:36:37.120]  being let alone athlete so it was something that was just that we're
[03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:40.480]  we're still processing and I'm still talking through with my doctors just to
[03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:44.000]  see what everything was.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:53.920]  I don't want to talk about that that was a very very nervous response a lot of
[03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:59.040]  people have said we don't even know if that's Damar Hamlin you know and I'm
[03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:03.840]  not going to get into that aspect of it who who even knows but his response
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:08.160]  there you know it's like it's like he really thought about it he really
[03:37:08.160 --> 03:37:14.160]  thought about how do I answer this you know without looking like I'm covering
[03:37:14.160 --> 03:37:21.280]  up or I almost like regret I don't know I I don't know what do you guys think it
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:27.120]  looked almost like regret in his eyes about the fact that you know maybe he
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:33.120]  did want to talk about it but he's been told he can't you know look at that and
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:37.760]  of course the radio viewers can't see this but we're just replaying that moment
[03:37:37.760 --> 03:37:46.080]  where he pauses and and contemplates you know how does he does he know what this
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:51.760]  is have the doctors refused to tell him I mean of course of course if you you know
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:59.680]  were someone of stature there would be so much controversy around vaccine
[03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:06.000]  induced myocarditis or pericarditis there would be so much effort to not let
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:11.360]  this come out but as I said to you in Australia mainstream personality is
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:15.840]  saying fit and healthy people are dropping down with heart issues on live
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:20.720]  TV it's something that just cannot be hidden anymore there are so many
[03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:27.680]  athletes that are dropping from these poison shots and you know I just I was
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:32.320]  really just watching that and thinking how how how is he going to overcome this
[03:38:32.320 --> 03:38:38.160]  what because he then goes on to say well no I never had any heart issues before
[03:38:38.160 --> 03:38:42.960]  you know these athletes go through so many checks they go through so many
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.440]  medical assessments there's no way that something like that would not have been
[03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:50.720]  detected beforehand so at least he speaks about that
[03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:54.160]  I don't know we'll see where the more comes out on that I just wonder why he
[03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:58.800]  said he didn't want to talk about it now Harvard Medical School
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:04.320]  is about to integrate climate change into the medical
[03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:09.280]  doctor curriculum this is one of the most ridiculous things I've read but
[03:39:09.280 --> 03:39:11.760]  honestly it's no surprise I spoke about a
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:18.160]  recent podcast I was watching and I can't remember her name but
[03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:22.800]  she she's a medical student I think third year now
[03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:26.720]  and she was saying openly that if the you know she was
[03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:30.320]  speaking about abortions killing babies and the fact that she thinks it's a
[03:39:30.320 --> 03:39:34.800]  great thing and the the interviewer asked her okay
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:38.800]  well back in the 1800s the medical consensus was
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:42.800]  if you're going to if everyone's performing lobotomies and it's
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:46.160]  the medical consensus is yes let's go and perform these lobotomies this is the
[03:39:46.160 --> 03:39:48.000]  right thing to do would you have done it
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:51.120]  knowing now because they were having a discussion on ethics knowing now that
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:53.840]  it's unethical knowing now that we should never have performed those
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:57.840]  lobotomies would you have done it and after some wrestling with the question
[03:39:57.840 --> 03:40:02.400]  she finally comes down and admits yes I would have performed the lobotomies
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:06.880]  because it was the medical consensus at the time even knowing what we know now
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:11.920]  about how wrong and unethical that was and that is the doctors of today
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:18.480]  those are the doctors of the future so this article here the Harvard Crimson
[03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:21.360]  a Harvard Medical School committee voted last month
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:25.920]  to embed climate change into the school's curriculum
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:30.640]  now apparently it was a unanimous vote to do this
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:34.800]  and it says that the new climate change curriculum will examine the impact
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:39.440]  of climate change on health and health inequality
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:43.200]  applications of these impacts of clinical care and the role of physicians
[03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:47.760]  and health institutions arriving at climate solutions what does
[03:40:47.760 --> 03:40:53.280]  what does climate change do to inequality what what does this mean
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:57.440]  what does this actually mean I'm going to play you a clip when we come back on
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:00.800]  the other side of the break just letting the team know to get it ready
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:06.320]  this this insane new gender equality ambassador that we have in Australia
[03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:10.800]  you're you're going to be shocked when you hear from this woman look at that
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:16.800]  shivers so you know the this inequality word that they keep
[03:41:16.800 --> 03:41:21.440]  hammering down our throats you know the the US audience might not know this
[03:41:21.440 --> 03:41:25.200]  but we've currently got this voice to parliament
[03:41:25.200 --> 03:41:28.160]  thing happening in Australia and it's essentially a trap
[03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:32.320]  for our Aboriginal people to to fall into this trap
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:36.240]  of coming under the Australian Constitution so that they don't have
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:41.040]  the same rights as they still have now really
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:44.560]  and it's a it's a way to initiate CRT in Australia
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:48.000]  and they want that desperately because they want the people divided
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:52.320]  and they want to shame you for being white
[03:41:52.320 --> 03:41:55.040]  but anyway it's going to be increasingly important for people in
[03:41:55.040 --> 03:41:59.440]  leadership roles in health care and other industries to integrate climate
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:03.680]  change and climate related hazards into their
[03:42:03.680 --> 03:42:06.480]  strategic decision-making as they lead
[03:42:06.480 --> 03:42:09.760]  organizations so you can expect the doctors of the future
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:14.000]  the ones who think that it's ethical to kill babies and perform lobotomies
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:17.520]  to also make all of those decisions around climate change
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:24.320]  and inequality whatever that is health inequality
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:29.120]  i mean who who gets denied health care based on their race it's not even a
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:32.720]  thing it doesn't even happen okay maybe a few
[03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:36.800]  isolated incidents of a bad egg you know
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:41.120]  giving someone bad treatment because they're there they may be a racist or
[03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:44.320]  have bias but it's it's just not a thing in today's
[03:42:44.320 --> 03:42:47.760]  day and age other than the narrative that they're creating the people are not
[03:42:47.760 --> 03:42:49.920]  getting the correct health care because of their race
[03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:52.720]  we'll be back right on the other side of this break and we'll keep going with
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:56.800]  this insane weirdo from Australia
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:03.520]  well i just want to say about diet force diet force is amazing i'm 45 and i have
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:07.200]  bits i go to the gym and i have bits that won't move
[03:43:07.200 --> 03:43:11.280]  and diet force has helped me move those bits like

[03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:45.920]  i'm incredibly honored to take on this role as the lead international advocate
[03:47:45.920 --> 03:47:49.680]  for australia's commitment to gender equality and the human rights of women
[03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:53.120]  and girls and persons of diverse gender identities
[03:47:53.120 --> 03:47:57.200]  in this role i'm committed to listening to those who are dedicated to promoting
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:47:59.920]  gender equality and learning about the perspectives and
[03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:03.520]  priorities in communities and countries in our region
[03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:07.600]  and globally promoting gender equality is the right thing to do
[03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:11.760]  but it's also the smart thing to do it is central to australia's diplomatic
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:15.760]  economic development and regional security as well as our international
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:19.440]  engagement i look forward to working with partners in australia

[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:31.840]  women and girls leadership and to end sexual and gender-based violence
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:34.720]  to improve access to health and education services

[03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:47.360]  i look forward to delivering this message while i have a
[03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:51.920]  gun held to my head because i can't blink and i need to read off this
[03:48:51.920 --> 03:48:54.960]  teleprompter i mean it's just weird right
[03:48:54.960 --> 03:48:58.960]  it is absolutely bizarre but here's the one thing a lot of people have shared
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:02.640]  this footage and spoken about the fact that yes she barely blinks
[03:49:02.640 --> 03:49:07.360]  yes she looks like she's being held hostage and has to say these specific
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:10.960]  words and doesn't want to be there right i look forward to
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:13.360]  i mean i don't i don't have to do that again for you but
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:20.160]  she says this for the radio viewers she's she's on the screen now just get her
[03:49:20.160 --> 03:49:24.560]  off get her off listening to those that are dedicated
[03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:29.200]  to promoting gender equality she doesn't say
[03:49:29.200 --> 03:49:35.120]  she's she can't wait to listen to all people on this issue no
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:38.640]  she says she looks forward to listening to those
[03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:44.960]  that are dedicated to promoting gender equality so she only wants to hear from
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:48.640]  people the ambassador for gender equality
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:51.680]  only wants to hear from people that are dedicated
[03:49:51.680 --> 03:49:56.480]  to promoting this no one else i'm i'm the ambassador i'm not here to educate
[03:49:56.480 --> 03:49:59.680]  anyone and explain why i'm here and why i'm so
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:02.480]  passionate about this i need to get her through to everyone
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:06.320]  no no no none of that i only want to talk to people that agree with me and that
[03:50:06.320 --> 03:50:09.920]  is what we're facing guys these doctors
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:13.840]  that i spoke about from harvard i wanted to read this to you
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:17.040]  before and i missed it the curriculum change
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:21.040]  aims to integrate climate change themes throughout
[03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:26.080]  students medical school education rather than creating new courses specifically
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:28.320]  around climate change so what they're talking about
[03:50:28.320 --> 03:50:33.680]  is embedding this indoctrination into all aspects and it goes on to say in
[03:50:33.680 --> 03:50:36.880]  this report that you know they'll add a sentence or two
[03:50:36.880 --> 03:50:41.760]  or or a little segment on every single topic these doctors are learning
[03:50:41.760 --> 03:50:46.960]  to help them understand how it's all linked to climate change
[03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:50.240]  their entire course and the way that they treat
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:55.040]  their patients is all linked to climate change
[03:50:55.040 --> 03:50:59.520]  so you've got these brainwashed drones out there now in medical school who
[03:50:59.520 --> 03:51:02.640]  were saying we would we would prepare lobotomies
[03:51:02.640 --> 03:51:06.000]  we would we would perform lobotomies even though we know now that it was
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:09.440]  wrong if the medical consensus says it will do it if the medical consensus
[03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:13.120]  is you need to kill these people we're gonna do it
[03:51:13.120 --> 03:51:17.520]  because that's the best science of the time and don't you question it and i
[03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:21.200]  only want to talk to people that agree with me i mean we are living
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:27.760]  in an insane world right now with the people that are being installed in
[03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:32.320]  these positions just being the ultimate weirdos
[03:51:32.320 --> 03:51:36.400]  i mean who is actually going to go and seek
[03:51:36.400 --> 03:51:41.840]  advice from the experts who wants to listen to the experts
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:46.640]  these soulless people who can barely blink who say they would perform a lobotomy
[03:51:46.640 --> 03:51:50.080]  who are going to tell you now when you go to the doctor all of these new
[03:51:50.080 --> 03:51:54.720]  graduates that your heart condition is due to climate change got nothing to do
[03:51:54.720 --> 03:51:58.640]  with the covid shot nope nope it is climate change and i know that because
[03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:02.560]  i learned it at harvard the most one of the most
[03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:06.560]  prestigious medical schools of our time i learned
[03:52:06.560 --> 03:52:09.680]  that everything that's wrong with you is because
[03:52:09.680 --> 03:52:13.520]  of the changing weather that we've had for thousands of years
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:17.280]  what a great doctor i am give myself a pat on the back do you want a lobotomy
[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:20.160]  while we're at it
[03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:23.600]  and any doctors that are enrolling in this
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:27.520]  apparently they were asking for it for years the medical students have been
[03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:31.360]  asking for years for climate change to be
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:34.720]  the main focus of their courses their studies
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:39.200]  really because up until five minutes ago when the media started using the words
[03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:42.640]  climate change we thought it the biggest problem facing us was global
[03:52:42.640 --> 03:52:45.040]  warming so how many years back are we talking
[03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:47.840]  guys because climate change just erupted
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:51.600]  really out of covid as the new method to control the citizens
[03:52:51.600 --> 03:52:55.280]  who the hell wants to go and see one of these doctors not me
[03:52:55.280 --> 03:52:59.840]  i swear they're going to be performing you know surgeries in underground
[03:52:59.840 --> 03:53:04.560]  veterinary clinics one day to avoid these crazy crazy frankenstein
[03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:06.880]  doctors but here's what else is happening
[03:53:06.880 --> 03:53:12.240]  in the world okay kenya is currently trialing a biometric vaccination system
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:15.280]  for newborn babies so this is what the globalists are doing
[03:53:15.280 --> 03:53:18.480]  in the african countries rolling out a bowler
[03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:21.680]  and by the way i said before a bowl is not airborne i want to add there
[03:53:21.680 --> 03:53:25.920]  unless they mess with it which is possible they love gain of function
[03:53:25.920 --> 03:53:30.240]  they love death and destruction who knows they might have done it
[03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:34.720]  they might have done it there has been funding
[03:53:34.720 --> 03:53:39.520]  for gain of function for Ebola this was i mean i did these interviews quite some
[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:43.200]  time ago they're all on zmedia.com and i have another huge one i want to
[03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:46.080]  i want to say here it'll be on the website at about
[03:53:46.080 --> 03:53:49.680]  8 p.m central it won't be on band yet
[03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:53.600]  that is a huge interview coming this week talking about how
[03:53:53.600 --> 03:53:59.760]  all of the injected population within half an hour
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:04.160]  are shedding these toxic materials into the uninjected and the blood of the
[03:54:04.160 --> 03:54:07.520]  uninjected is coming up as contaminated as the
[03:54:07.520 --> 03:54:10.320]  injected this is something that everyone needs to see
[03:54:10.320 --> 03:54:14.080]  so please head to zmedia.com at 8 p.m central on
[03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:17.440]  wednesday night but advancements are being made in controversial tests
[03:54:17.440 --> 03:54:20.320]  carried out in a hospital in a small town in kenya
[03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:25.280]  to develop a biometric vaccination management program for newborns
[03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:28.080]  so here's what they say this new method aims to ensure
[03:54:28.080 --> 03:54:31.520]  that as soon as a child is born and receives their first vaccine
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:34.720]  biometric scanning of four of their fingers takes place
[03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:37.760]  and in addition to fingerprinting the babies
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:41.840]  they're taking their voice data of the caregiver
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:45.440]  now they say they only store this for two years yeah right
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:50.000]  like they weren't collecting people's dna during from the PCR tests and shipping
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:53.280]  them to companies and that later came out oh yeah we're only going to store for
[03:54:53.280 --> 03:54:57.040]  two years and it apparently attracts how eight
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:00.480]  vaccines and one supplement are given to the babies why do you need to track it
[03:55:00.480 --> 03:55:05.760]  through biometric data why do you need to track it through biometric data we
[03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:10.320]  have systems for that we have books we have you know the doctor's records
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:14.080]  we have such advanced IT systems that surely your doctor can log that
[03:55:14.080 --> 03:55:16.720]  information
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:21.760]  and quickly before i wrap it up the UK government
[03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:26.640]  recently a top banker predicted that a UK government will eventually roll out a
[03:55:26.640 --> 03:55:31.120]  super app that houses each citizen's combined economic footprint
[03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:34.560]  from credit credit ratings to know your customer details so this has already
[03:55:34.560 --> 03:55:38.480]  started in Australia we have big banks like the Commonwealth Bank for example
[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:43.280]  which has already rolled out a carbon tracker so it tells you how
[03:55:43.280 --> 03:55:47.200]  many how much carbon your purchase emitted to
[03:55:47.200 --> 03:55:51.200]  try and commence this social conditioning
[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:54.400]  and all of this is social conditioning and people think oh well that's great i'm
[03:55:54.400 --> 03:55:58.160]  helping the environment wow just like they thought oh that's great i'm
[03:55:58.160 --> 03:56:03.520]  getting injured to protect my neighbour i'm a great human
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:06.320]  and i'm not talking about those who were coerced and felt they had no choice and
[03:56:06.320 --> 03:56:10.080]  were backed into a corner i'm talking about the ones who are proud that they
[03:56:10.080 --> 03:56:13.280]  partook in a medical experiment that's killing so many
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:17.360]  who and wish death upon those that didn't
[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:22.240]  participate and so they're conditioning the human
[03:56:22.240 --> 03:56:26.480]  race right now in the background while all of this chaos is happening
[03:56:26.480 --> 03:56:31.440]  they're conditioning the human race the biometric data being sent

[03:56:34.960 --> 03:56:39.280]  to get used to integrating these platforms
[03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:43.040]  with payment platforms and the social credit system that they want to roll
[03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:46.560]  out they're testing this on Africa as they always
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:51.040]  do with babies biometric data because eventually the plan is
